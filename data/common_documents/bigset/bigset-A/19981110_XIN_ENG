<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel Exchange Views on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- As part of the bilateral contact,
Egypt and Israel Monday exchanged views on the current situations
in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
Israeli Ambassador in Cairo Zvi Mazel conveyed him a verbal
message from his Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mazel said that both his meeting with Moussa
and Sharon's message dealt with the implementation of an interim
peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet is expected to reconvene Wednesday to adopt
a "suitable" decision on the Wye agreement, he said, adding that
the deal will be carried out in one or two weeks after the Israeli
parliament ratifies it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed on October 23 in Washington
the deal on Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West
Bank in exchange for tough Palestinian measures against
anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended the
cabinet discussions over the deal following a suicidal car bomb
explosion Friday in Jerusalem, which killed two people and wounded
more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel
in 1979, is a key mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict. But the
Egyptian-Israeli ties have been cool due to Netanyahu's hardline
policy in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been calling for full implementation of the Wye
agreement as soon as it was signed.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Commentator's Article on Dalai Lama  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, publishes a commentator's article Tuesday
censuring the Dalai Lama for his remarks on the so-called
statement on Tibet's political status during his current trip to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "The More One Tries to Hide, the More One
Is Exposed," ridicules the Dalai Lama who, before leaving for the
US, said he was willing to recognize Tibet and Taiwan as part of
China, and later denounced the reports about his proposed
declaration as being "wrong" and "untrue."
</P>
<P>
A State Council spokesman reiterated the Chinese government's
stand on the issue on November 4, which has disturbed the Dalai's
side, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The commentator's article goes on to say that the central
government's policy on Tibet has remained consistent, clear and
unchanged, which means: the Dalai Lama must really abandon the
proposition of setting up an independent Tibet, put an end to
activities to split the motherland, and make a public announcement
recognizing that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, that
Taiwan is a province of China, and that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing all of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the State Council quelled the former Tibet government
after an armed rebellion by the upper class reactionaries was put
down, and the Dalai Lama and his followers fled the country,
according to the article. The central government has never
recognized the illegal Tibetan "government-in-exile."
</P>
<P>
When the Tibet Autonomous Region was founded in 1965, the
article adds, a people's power has been set up and regional
autonomy by ethnic groups practised there, the article says,
noting that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has led the Tibetan
people to abolish reactionary serfdom with an integration of
governance and religion, and emancipate one million serfs then.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Commentator's Article on Dalai Lama  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tibet has experienced tremendous changes and progress,
including economic growth, social progress, unity between
different ethnic groups and political stability, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the so-called "Tibetan independence" has been an
outcome of imperialist aggression against China in history, the
article says. It questions the purpose of certain international
anti-Chinese forces who have pressured the Chinese government on
the issue of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and talks between the Chinese government and the Dalai
Lama are China's internal affairs, and the central government has
smooth channels to keep in touch with Dalai, it says.
</P>
<P>
"We have always opposed any foreign interference into China's
internal affairs," the article says. The fact that the Dalai Lama
has made propaganda internationally and created public opinions on
the issue can only shows that he is not sincere about talks with
the central government.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the Dalai Lama has presented nothing new
this time. In the past 20 years since 1978, the Dalai Lama's
personal representatives have kept on circling around the issue of
Tibetan independence during his talks with the central
government," the article says.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the changing situation in the world, they have
constantly readjusted their tactics," it says, "they became
arrogant when the situation was favorable to them, and came to ask
for negotiations when the situation turned against them."
</P>
<P>
"But they have never halted their activities to split the
motherland, even when they were at the talks," the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The zigzagging on the issue of "declaration" indicates
that the Dalai Lama has merely made tactical readjustments
and played tricks, while his stance on Tibetan independence has
remained unchanged in principle, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
Had the Dalai Lama not stopped his activities to split the
motherland, the nature of his goal to achieve independence could
never be covered up with whatever plots and tricks he has been up
to, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
"The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed" as the
Chinese saying goes, and the people in the world can see their
true feature still more clearly, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Must Back Down to Avoid Use of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq can end its latest
standoff with the United Nations only by complying with all
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, British Defense
Secretary George Robertson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference at the Ali Al-Salem air base in
north Kuwait, where he was paying a visit to British air force
servicemen, Robertson said the current confrontation was created
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and could end by his compliance.
</P>
<P>
"This confrontation can be ended if Saddam Hussein himself now
decides to comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions
related to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait," Robertson was quoted
by Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am giving him (Saddam) the clear message that he must comply
or the option of force is still available and still on the table,"
said Robertson, who arrived here Sunday and will fly Monday to
Bahrain for talks with Bahraini leaders.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary noted that although time was
running out for Saddam, "diplomacy is not exhausted until we are
sure that Saddam intends to continue his confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Robertson refrained from revealing the timetable for action
but stressed that Saddam Hussein "would be mistaken if he thinks
that he can drag the current situation," adding that "we want a
diplomatic solution, but it is up to Saddam to back down."
</P>
<P>
Turning to his talks in Kuwait, Robertson said the Kuwaiti
leadership made it absolutely clear that "this confrontation was
engineered by Saddam and can be ended by Saddam."

<HEADLINE> UK Deputy PM Attacks Press for Intruding Private Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) - Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott attacked at the British press on Monday for prying into
politicians' private lives.
</P>
<P>
Prescott made the remarks after Agriculture Minister Nick Brown
was forced to admit he is gay when a former lover tried to sell
his story to a Sunday tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's quite deplorable. They (newspapers) seem to be
judge, jury and executioner in this matter. It's totally
unacceptable and I think British public opinion's against it
also," Prescott told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Let's pursue the editors and the journalists who do this and
let's see how they like their private lives taken apart on the
front page," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also called on the Press Complaints
Commission -- a voluntary industry watchdog -- to clamp down on
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
Brown went public about his sexuality after The News of The
World, a Sunday tabloid, was approached by a former lover with
what it said were "a series of fanciful and lurid allegations".
</P>
<P>
Brown acknowledged that he occasionally gave his partner small
sums of money but denied he ever paid for sex.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said there is a balance in reporting and protecting
private life, but at the moment "some of the editors have decided
that the balance should be more to what is to do with selling
papers."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on
Monday rejected reports that Irish Republican Army (IRA) would
take the first move on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't give any credence to those reports and indeed I
think they are mischief-making," Adams told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Weekend newspapers said that the IRA, the political wing of
Sinn Fein, would make a decision soon on whether to give up its
arms.
</P>
<P>
Adams is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair later in the day at Blair's Downing Street office in London
on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the disarmament as
well.
</P>
<P>
A timetable to seal a lasting peace after years of strife in
Northern Ireland missed a vital deadline on October 31 because of
the row over the linking of disarmament to political progress.
</P>
<P>
Adams blames Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble
for the stalemate in decommissioning, saying he was making "arms
decommissioning" a precondition to the formation of a range of new
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has insisted that he will not sit in a coalition
cabinet with Sinn Fein until the IRA gives up its arms.

<HEADLINE> First Direct Link Between Gulf and Iraq Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A ferry from the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) arrived in Iraq's southern port city of Umm Qasr
Monday afternoon, marking the opening of first direct link between
the Gulf and Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Jabal Ali-1, a luxury cruise ship that can carry 550
passengers, completed its 32-hour maiden voyage with on 43 foreign
correspondents and tourists on board, the Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
It sailed out from UAE's port city of Dubai on Saturday after
the United Nations agreed to open the sea lane from Emirates to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The liner, which can also carry 500 tonnes of cargo, is
scheduled to travel from Dubai to Umm Qasr every Saturday and
return every Monday at the initial stage. INA said more runs will
be arranged in the future.
</P>
<P>
The journey costs about 329 U.S. dollars for a two-way trip,
much cheaper and quicker than the other option - traveling by air
to Jordanian capital Amman, and then making the 1,000-kilometer
road journey to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait, which set off the 1991 Gulf War, barring flights to and
from Iraq as well as other direct links.
</P>
<P>
The ferry caters mostly to Shiite pilgrims and businessmen, as
well as Iraqis working in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
There are about 50,000 Iraqis working in the UAE, with most of
them engaged in construction and trade in Dubai and its capital
Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.N. gave the green light to the opening of the sea
lane, it still authorized U.S. warships in the Gulf to check the
liners to see if there are banned items aboard.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been in the forefront among the Gulf Arab states to
call for the lifting of the eight-year-old sanctions against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> hke110975 -India, Pakistan Make No Progress in Talks on Sir Creek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan failed to
make any headway Monday on their long-pending Sir Creek maritime
boundary dispute with New Delhi firmly rejecting Islamabad's
proposal for a third party arbitration.
</P>
<P>
According to a bland joint statement issued this evening,
discussions between the two sides were held in a frank and cordial
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors resumed their talks Monday on Sir Creek
maritime boundary dispute in the Rann of Kutch area, western state
of Gujarat, in a bid to resolve the border demarcation in the
Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stated their respective positions during the
talks, the statement said, adding that it was agreed to continue
discussions during the next round of the dislodge process.
</P>
<P>
This is the second phase of the scheduled nine-day talks
between the two countries which have so far not turned out any
positive results on three of the six outstanding identified
issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on both a navigation project and the Siachen
Glacier held here last week had also ended in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the marking of the boundary with Pakistan
would have an important bearing on the exploitation of promising
sea-based resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Maritime boundaries between New Delhi and Islamabad would
determine the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones available to both
countries for possible commercial use.
</P>
<P>
While India has defined Maritime boundaries with Myanmar,
Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia, it is yet to reach
such a settlement with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Talks between India and Pakistan on boundary dispute in Sir
Creek, along the Gujarat-Singh Coast, have been going on since
1965 without concrete results.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Monday, New Delhi asserted that boundary in
the Creek, which is rich in oil and gas deposits, should be a
notional mid channel as the contours there keep changing due to
shifting tidal movement while Pakistan insisted that the boundary
should start from the southern edge of the Creek.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to resolve the issue by the year 2005 for
India and 2007 for Pakistan or else they would have to submit to
U.N. mediation, the sources here said, adding that without the
maritime boundary demarcation, neither country can exploit
resources in its Exclusive Economic Zone up to 2,000 nautical
miles or its continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
Indian and Pakistan failed to make any headway last Friday on
the disputed Siachen issue after three hours of talks in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any breakthrough last Thursday
on the dispute over the Tulbul navigation project, which was
called Wullar Barrage in Pakistan after four hours of talks
between two countries' water resources and power delegations.

<HEADLINE> NASA Completes Tests of Air-Breathing Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- NASA has completed two years
of testing new rocket engines that breathe oxygen from the air,
and is ready for flight testing.
</P>
<P>
Officials from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center said that
air-breathing engine technologies could make future space travel
like today's air travel, and spacecraft with this engine would be
completely reusable, take off and land at airport runways, and be
ready to fly again within days.
</P>
<P>
According to News Releases reaching here Monday from the
Center, an air-breathing engine gets its initial take-off power
from specially designed rockets, called air-augmented rockets,
that boost performance about 15 percent over conventional rockets.
When the vehicle's velocity reaches twice the peed of sound, the
rockets are turned off and the engine relies totally on oxygen in
the atmosphere to burn the hydrogen fuel. Once the vehicle's speed
increases to about 10 times the speed of sound, the engine
converts to a conventional rocket-powered system to propel the
vehicle into orbit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor Expects Autonomy in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
said here Monday night that Macao's autonomy is important not only
to the region itself but also to China and Portugal after the
transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a dinner hosted by scores of consuls
residing in Macao, the governor said the success of Macao's
transition will make a positive contribution to understanding
and cooperation and symbolize the close relationship between China
and Portugal, understanding between Europe and Asia, and
co-existence between East and West.
</P>
<P>
"This success is also vital to your own countries and
organizations," the governor told the consuls. "I am grateful to
you for all you have done to make your authorities, entrepreneurs
and cultural agents aware of the opportunity Macao offers and for
your interest in supporting the project implicit to the Joint
Declaration."
</P>
<P>
In the process of transfering the responsibility for government to
the Chinese authorities, a process now entering its final stages, what
Macao has sought to achieve is a matter of interest not only to
Portugal and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Rather, there are several objectives that are most certainly of
interest to any country that believes that what happens in this area
is relevant to establishing a new world order that can open up
horizons of progress and peace for the coming century," the governor
noted.

<HEADLINE> Improved Lighting for the Great Hall of the People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) --Some 4,570 new lights with
greatly improved quality are replacing the 2,700 incandescent
lights in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
General Electric Jiabao Lighting Co.Ltd. recently signed a
contract to replace the lighting in the main banquet hall of the
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the new energy-efficient GE lighting
system provides nearly 10 times the illumination of the present
system, and will reduce energy consumption by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
This project is part of the general renovation of the Great Hall
of the People.
</P>
<P>
The huge lighting fixture in the banquet hall was designed by
artists of the China Central Academy of Arts forty years ago, and
the incandescent lamps they used as lighting sources provide
less luminosity and consume more electricity than the new lights.

<HEADLINE> UK Small Firms' Confidence at Low Ebb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) - Confidence among Britain's smaller
businesses has collapsed to its lowest level since the depths of
the last recession seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey by the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI) made sombre reading and provides another warning that the
economy could be heading for a recession.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly CBI survey showed that 59 percent of the small
and medium-sized businesses questioned were more pessimistic than
four months earlier.
</P>
<P>
Only 6 percent were more optimistic, a negative balance of 53
percent. This compared with minus 46 percent in July and minus 3
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Employment in these small businesses fell more sharply than at
any time since 1993 and firms expect the situation to get worse.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has called for more interest rate cuts to save smaller
manufacturers from bankruptcy. According to the latest official
statistics, the number of bankrupt companies in England and Wales
rose by 4.7 percent in the three months to September.
</P>
<P>
Colin Perry, who compiled the survey, said the findings were
particularly worrying because smaller companies were very
vulnerable during an economic downturn.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Situation in Sindh Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The political crisis in
Pakistan's troubled Sindh province has entered into an intricate
stage as the ethnic Matthidda Qaumi Movement (MQM) requisitioned a
session of the dormant provincial assembly.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 deputies of MQM, the second biggest party in the
109-member Sindh Assembly after the main opposition Pakistan
People's Party (PPP), signed a requisition for the session last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy speaker of the Sindh Assembly has fixed November 12 for
the session of the House whose fate was undecided after the
imposition of governor rule on October 30 in the province.
</P>
<P>
The crisis started as MQM broke off its alliance with Pakistan
Muslim League at the end of last month after Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif openly accused one of its provincial deputies and seven
activists of involvement in the murder of former Sindh governor
Hakim Muhammad Saeed on October 17.
</P>
<P>
The Nation, an Islamabad-based major English daily, said
editorially that Sharif had consciously chosen not to dissolve the
provincial assembly.
</P>
<P>
"When the federal government chose not to dissolve the
assembly, it implicitly accepted the possibility of the opposition
using that forum to whatever advantage it can, to criticize the
center and defend itself against the charges by the prime
minister," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a resolution condemning the imposition of
governor rule is certain to be passed by the Sindh Assembly where
MQM and PPP led by Sharif's arch rival Benazir Bhutto are in
majority.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that none of the resolutions of the
paralyzed House which has been deprived of the executive powers,
could be implemented. Even if the House carries out some
legislative work, it can't become law unless signed by the
governor who acts on the directives of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also launched a crackdown on the
"terrorists" in the province's capital of Karachi, the country's
commercial hub, where some 6,000 people are reported to have been
killed over the past six years in ethnic, sectarian, factional and
political-related violence.
</P>
<P>
Karachi has been in constant turmoil since MQM, previously
known as Mohajir Qaumi Movement, launched its violent struggle in
the 1980s for the political rights of the Urdu-speaking people
migrated from India.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of migrants had settled in Karachi,
now a city of more than 12 million people, and other urban centers
of Sindh at the time of Pakistan's independence from the British
colonial rule in 1947.
</P>
<P>
MQM has remained at odds with successive central governments
over the rights of its constituents.
</P>
<P>
It joined Benazir Bhutto's first coalition government in 1988
but quitted it only months later.
</P>
<P>
MQM, which is rated as Pakistan's third largest political
party, was also the partner of Sharif's first government in 1990.
However, an army crackdown on alleged terrorists in 1992 forced
MQM's firebrand leader Altaf Hussain to seek asylum in London.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's second government was dismissed in November 1996 by
then president Farooq Ahmed Leghari, who cited extra-judicial
killings in Karachi, mainly of MQM activists, as one of the main
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Press reports suggested that Pakistan was seeking extradition
of MQM's exiled leader for his alleged involvement in a wave of
political murders in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
MQM denied its involvement in the killing of former Sindh
governor Saeed and other political murders in Karachi, where most
of the violence was attributed to the party's running feud with
breakaway faction known as the Haqiqi group.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of activists of rival MQM factions were arrested in
the recent sweep by the government. Altaf Hussain has ordered his
party activists to hide to escape the government crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Now the question remains: will the imposition of governor rule
restore peace in the troubled Sindh province?
</P>
<P>
"The Sharif government is now knee-deep in the Karachi mire. It
first neglected the issue and postponed decisive actions and then
swung into action in a way which is far from wise," leading
columnist Sayed Talat Hussain wrote.
</P>
<P>
He was critical of the government's decision not to decide the
fate of provincial assembly which, in his view, will trigger a
legal battle in the country and deflect attention from restoring
peace in the violence-prone province.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that the Karachi issue is a
complex and multi-dimension one. The government needs sincere
courage and wisdom to solve it.

<HEADLINE> UK Firms' Investment Less Than Rivals: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) - British businesses are investing
about third less than comparable companies in Europe, North
America and Japan, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A survey released by the DTI looked at the 500 UK companies
with the best investment record and was conducted by
Edinburgh-based Company Reporting.
</P>
<P>
It put average capital investment per employee by British
companies at 9,000 pounds last year, 4,700 pounds less than their
counterparts abroad.
</P>
<P>
The DTI said that as a result of lower investment, the capital
base of UK companies is lower too, also a third below overseas
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed gross tangible fixed assets per employee
at 96,000 pounds, lagging behind the average of the survey's
international sample by 53,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The figures provide some support for claims by Chancellor
Gordon Brown that low investment may underlie the UK economy's
long-term problems of relatively low productivity.
</P>
<P>
Brown has been critical of companies, saying competitiveness
problems are due to low investment and productivity, not economic
slowdown or the high value of the pounds, as some companies claim.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Calls for CIS Help in Seizing Mutiny Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government on Monday
appealed to CIS countries for help in seizing masterminds and
active participants of a rebellion last week in north Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Dushanbe asked the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, "primarily Uzbekistan and Russia," to help organize the
search and detention of the rebels as well as persons "involved in
a number of other acts of terrorism and sabotage" in the former
Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The fugitives wanted by the Tajik authorities included former
prime minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov and his brother Abdugani,
former Tajik army colonel Mahmud Khudoiberdyev and his brother
Ergash Khasanov, former chairman of the Customs Committee Yakub
Salimov, and former transport minister Nazrullo Dustov, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Government troops chased the last large group of rebel fighters
into the mountains Monday after five days of fighting in this
Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government said in a statement that "according to
reliable reports, Abdulladzhanov, Khudoiberdyev and others with
the support of individual institutions are living in the Uzbek
capital, and some in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
"The fraternal assistance to CIS countries is a key factor of
the advancement of the peace process in Tajikistan," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are now in full control of the
Dushanbe-Khudzhand highway but the traffic has not resumed because
of the possible presence of land mines, Interfax said, quoting an
official with the Tajik presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
Scattered groups of rebels are retreating along mountain paths
towards Uzbekistan, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Forty rebels were killed and 10 government soldiers wounded in
the fighting, presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev began the uprising Wednesday, demanding that
President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring
his supporters into the government. The president has ruled out
any talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and the Rakhmonov
government.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition groups are now participating in the government
and the armed forces and participated in the fighting against the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka Strives to Improve Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh, a least-developed
country with a weak infrastructure, has been making relentless
efforts to improve its environment for investment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The government has introduced a number of measures to attract
foreign private investment in various economic areas except some
reserved sectors such as arms, ammunitions and other defense
machinery, nuclear energy, extraction of reserved forest, security
printing and minting, and international air transportation and
railways.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts, the government has set up about 82,000
small and medium industries in the last six years in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh offers a wide range of incentives for
foreign direct investment, which include:
</P>
<P>
Tax holiday for five to 10 years depending on location of
industries;
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years' tax holiday for private power generation
companies;
</P>
<P>
Facilities for repatriation of invested capital, profit and
dividend;
</P>
<P>
Exemption of tax on interest on foreign loans;
</P>
<P>
Tax exemption on royalties, technical know-how and technical
assistance fees;
</P>
<P>
Avoidance of double taxation on the basis of bilateral
agreements;
</P>
<P>
Convertibility of national currency, the taka, for
international payments in the current account;
</P>
<P>
Treating re-investment of repatriable dividend as new
investment;
</P>
<P>
Allowing working capital loan, as well as term loan, from local
commercial banks to go to industries set up with foreign capital;
and
</P>
<P>
Allowing foreigners to buy state-owned enterprises through
tender.
</P>
<P>
Besides, government permission is not required for both local
and foreign investors to set up new industries irrespective of
their investment ceiling. But investors need to register with the
Board of Investment for available facilities and institutional
support given by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government recently enacted a law to enable private
investors to set up private export processing zones (EPZs).
Industrial units in the private EPZs will enjoy facilities similar
to those in the two state-owned EPZs in Dhaka and Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to set up more EPZs to meet the growing
demand for investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has also formed a high-powered
committee to speed up approval of foreign investment proposals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has initiated a number of policy
initiatives to encourage private participation in creating
infrastructure facilities and services under BOO (build, operate
and own) and BOT (build, operate and transfer) models in areas
like power generation, exploitation of oil, gas and other mineral
resources, highway development, port infrastructure facilities and
industrial parks and private EPZs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has reduced regulatory controls and
constrains as it has steadily liberalized the trade regime. Some
progress has been made in reducing non-tariff restrictions on
trade, rationalizing tariff rates and improving export incentives.
</P>
<P>
On the legal and administrative front, the government has set
up a permanent law reform commission to ensure transparency and
predictability in the way the rules and regulations are made and
implemented. Besides, an administrative reform commission to
rationalize the existing rules, regulations and procedures has
also been set up.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the government's efforts, over 2 billion U.S.
dollars of foreign investment have been poured into the country
during the last two financial years from July 1996 to June 1998,
according to the latest figures from the Board of Investment.
</P>
<P>
But Bangladesh still has a number of problems in attracting
foreign investment, such as its weak infrastructure, shortage of
power supply, low working efficiency, bureaucracy and corruption,
etc.
</P>
<P>
It will take a long time for this South Asian nation to improve
its investment environment.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Issue Debated in House Subcommittee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A Republican House
subcommittee chairman on Monday said U.S. President Bill Clinton
should be "called to account" for his conduct in the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles Canady, a Republican and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, made
the remark in opening a hearing to seek advice from historians and
legal experts on what constitutes an impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
Canady rejected arguments that conduct in a private lawsuit
can't be grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"If the president is guilty of the offenses charged against
him, he must be called to account under the Constitution for the
commission of high crimes and misdemeanors," Canady said.
</P>
<P>
The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Representative Bobby
Scott, said "the overwhelming majority of scholars have said the
offenses do not constitute grounds for impeachment."
</P>
<P>
The hearing was a prelude to formal impeachment hearings
scheduled to begin next week in the full Judiciary Committee
chaired by committee chairman Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
Previous to the hearing on Monday, scholars clashed on paper
over the standard for impeachment and whether Clinton's efforts to
cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky make him unfit for
office.
</P>
<P>
In prepared remarks, one professor said that the evidence set
out against Clinton by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr meets
that standard.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have argued that the standard for impeachment should
be whether the president's actions have undermined the government.
Some witnesses for the Democrats already have contended that the
president's behavior falls short of impeachable conduct because it
did not affect his official duties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 400 academicians signed a letter to
House and committee leaders opposing Clinton's impeachment. Such
action, they said in the letter, would weaken the presidency by
allowing Congress to impeach anyone holding that office whose
behavior they disapprove.

<HEADLINE> Apostolakis: Greece Not to Reduce Army Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Undersecretary
Dimitris Apostolakis said that Greece would not reduce the
strength of its army just because of neighboring Turkey's threat
to the country's security.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Chief of the Dutch General Army
Staff, Lieutenant-General Maarten Schouten, Apostolakis welcomed
the ongoing process by Dutch to reduce its army by 50 percent, but
he stressed that Athens would not follow suit because of the
Turkish threat which forced Greece to maintain one of the
strongest military forces among countries of the same size,
according to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis also said that Greece maintained good relations
with all neighboring countries except Turkey because Greece was
doing its utmost to consolidate security and stability in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey should be blamed for such a situation.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed Europe's security and cooperation
between the countries in the field of weapons systems.

<HEADLINE> EU Forces Rwanda to Admit Presence in Congo (k) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has pressured
Rwanda into admitting that it had soldiers inside the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), said Zimbabwean Minister of Foreign Affairs
Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said Sunday that Rwanda had previously denied its
presence in the DRC, but last week finally admitted that some of
its soldiers were among the invading troops in the DRC, charting
the path towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict, according
to a daily Herald report Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald, Mudenge said that Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe had paid tribute to the EU for exerting
pressure on Rwanda culminating in its admission.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, who just returned from a joint two-day EU and
Southern African Development Community (SADC) meeting in
Vienna, Austria, where he addressed the ministerial conference on
the DEC conflict, also praised the EU for accepting a SADC appeal
to pressure Rwanda to confess.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that the invaders had been mentioned by
name and appealed to by name. This was an important evolution to
the European position," said the Zimbabwean foreign minsiter.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeks Market for Surplus Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is seeking new foreign
markets for the surplus power it will generate when all the new
power-generating projects in the upper reaches of the River Nile
come into full operation in six years' time.
</P>
<P>
An East African weekly report said Monday that the country
will have a generating capacity of 1,000 megawatts of power by
the year 2000, much more than the projected domestic demand of
320 megawatts by then.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will first ask its neighbors to buy its surplus power,
the report said, adding that Ugandan Minister for Natural
Resources Richard Kaijuka went to Nairobi last week to discuss
this matter.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is Uganda's biggest buyer of its excess power at
present. It buys some 30 megawatts from Uganda each year,
followed by Tanzania and Rwanda which takes five megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1999, two more turbines in Jinja, some 80 kms east of
the capital city, are expected to operate, giving the country an
excess of 20 megawatts of power because Uganda lacks capacity to
distribute all the power generated.
</P>
<P>
An estimated five percent of Uganda's population has access to
power now.
</P>
<P>
Major extension works at the Owen Falls dam will yield an
additional 200 megawatts beginning in mid-1999 and if sufficient
transmission and distribution capacity is in place, another five
percent of the population is expected to be connected.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) high level talks on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border
dispute ended Sunday in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, with a ray of
hope for a peaceful settlement, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Zimbabwe,
mandated by the 34th session of the OAU summit to seek a
peaceful solution to the dispute, referred the issue to the
forthcoming meeting of the central organ of the OAU mechanism for
conflict prevention, management and resolution, scheduled for
next month.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, Hassan Gouled
Aptidon of Djibouti and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe made their
decision after hearing initial responses from President Issias
Afewerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The two warring neighbors appeared before the mediating
leaders separately. The discussions were held with the blessing
of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who sent his special
representative to the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the talks said both
countries will continue to reflect on the proposals made by the
high level committee.
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals put forward by the high level committee
are the need to demilitarize and demarcate the border area of
Badme, at the heart of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
It was proposed that Eritrea withdraw its armed forces
presently in Badme to the positions they held before May 6 when
the dispute escalated into a military confrontation, killing
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
The proposed demilitarization process will be supervised by a
group of military observers who will also assist the interim
civilian administrators to run the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
The warring parties were advised to engage the services of
experts from the U.N. cartographic unit in collaboration with OAU
to carry out the demilitarization and demarcation of the border
within six months.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the conflict, Eritrea had
initially steadfastly maintained that it would not pull out of
the disputed border, claiming colonial birth rights over the
area, while Ethiopia insisted on talks only after Eritrea had
withdrawn its troops.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea had also initially threatened to pull out of the
settlement in protest against the inclusion of Djibouti in the
committee, allegedly because it was an Ethiopian ally.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two Horn of African countries dates
back to May 6, when Eritrea moved its troops into Badme -- a
strip of land measuring 400 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Defense Chief Visits Bahrain on Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State
for Defense George Robertson arrived in Bahraini capital Manama
from Kuwait for a one-day visit as part of his tour of Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Bahraini leaders on regional
issues, particularly the latest developments of the Iraqi-U.N.
standoff over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The standoff was triggered by Iraq's decision to halt
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said on Saturday that his country hopes for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis, although it supports a military
strike if Iraq refuses to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Robertson will also discuss the bilateral relations and
cooperation between Britain and Bahrain, especially in the
military arena.
</P>
<P>
His visit follows a similar tour of the regional countries by
the U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen last week. Washington
said it had the necessary support from the Gulf countries for a
military action against Iraq in the wake of Cohen's trip.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Iraq decided to halt cooperation with UNSCOM
till the U.N. Security Council considers lifting the crippling
sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and
restructuring the special commission.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can not be removed until UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has eliminated all its nuclear, chemical, biological weapons
and long-range missiles. Baghdad has long accused UNSCOM of
serving U.S. and Israeli interests.

<HEADLINE> University Students Hunger Strike Against High Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli university students
intensified their protests against high tuition fees with a hunger
strike on Monday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, dozens of students from various
universities took part in the hunger strike, which was held
outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The students began the nationwide strike three weeks ago to
demand that tuition fees, currently at about 10,000 shekels (2,300
U.S. dollars) a year, be reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
And they decided to intensify their protest with a hunger
strike after a series of negotiations with officials of the
Finance Ministry failed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry turned down the students' demand, noting that the
tuition charge level was set by a joint commission established
after a student strike in 1996, which also included student
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Lior Rothbart, chairman of Israeli Students National Union,
said that "too many days have gone by for them (government
officials) to treat our situation apathetically."
</P>
<P>
"We said from the beginning that we were serious, and we are
continuing to prove this," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the
director general of his office Moshe Leon to intervene in the
affair personally.
</P>
<P>
Leon asked the students to halt the hunger strike on Monday,
but the call was rejected.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that student representatives and ministry
officials will meet again on Monday in a bid to find an immediate
solution to the strike.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Delegation Returns from Ouagadougou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The high-level Ethiopian
delegation led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi returned home
Monday after attending the two-day Ouagadougou meeting on a
peaceful resolution to the Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government spokesperson Selome Taddesse told
journalists here Monday that at the meeting, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) committee presented a peace proposal to both
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal was consistent with the previous OAU resolution
which stated that Eritrea should withdraw from Badme and its
environs to positions held before May 12 and that the Ethiopian
civilian administration should return," she said.
</P>
<P>
Taddese noted that points of clarification were raised by the
Ethiopian delegation, and the clarification was sought as it was
important that all points be stated clearly, especially when
taking into consideration the Eritrean government's tendency to
be selective about facts that emerge from such meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the proposal and the satisfactory clarification
of these points, Ethiopia fully accepted the proposed OAU plan,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, Eritrea rejected the proposed
plan, stating that any withdrawal could never be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of Eritrea's intransigence, the Ouagadougou
summit was forced to conclude that it should pass the peace plan
and the responses elicited from both parties to the OAU's central
body for conflict resolution," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Ouagadougou summit was attended by presidents of Burkina
Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti as well as OAU chief and leaders from
Ethiopia and Eritrea. The pan-African organization expected the
two Horn of African states to end the six-month border crisis by
accepting the peace plan proposed at the Ouagadougou summit.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Businessmen Urged to Set up Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian official
Monday urged Chinese businessmen to establish joint ventures in
Nigeria for various products, especially minerals, for local
consumption and export.
</P>
<P>
Chief Kola Daisi, the National President of the Nigerian
Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and
Agriculture, made the remarks at the opening of the 98' China
Jiangsu Machinery and Electric Products Exhibition in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Daisi noted that mutual trade between Nigeria and China had grown
impressively over the recent years and the Jiangsu exhibition was
"a clear demonstration of the faith in the systematic growth of
the Chinese business presence in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official said opportunities are abound for
exploitation in Nigeria for export of a wide range of minerals,
adding that this could be done on the basis of joint venture and
to the mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The on-going renovation of the Nigerian Railway Systems
demonstrates "Nigeria's recognition and acceptance of Chinese
technical competence in this service area of activity," Daisi
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would continue to explore
other areas of possible cooperation with Nigerian business
partners.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Lu
Fengding expressed the hope that the current 98' Exhibition by
Jiangsu Province will play a big role "not only in
furthering the existing ties of trade and economic cooperation
between China and Nigeria, but also in enhancing the friendship
and mutual understanding between our two peoples."
</P>
<P>
Chief Ernest Shonekan, former Head of State of Nigeria and
adviser to Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar,
attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition which is the
second of its kind in recent years by China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five companies are exhibiting 50 categories of
machinery and electric products including tractors, motorcycles,
bicycles, generators, textile machinery and electronic
appliances.
</P>

The exhibition is scheduled to close on November 13.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Urges U.S. to Help Implement Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia urged the
United States on Monday to force Israel to implement the
newly-signed Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, the Saudi Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly cabinet session on the latest development
of the Mideast peace process, Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
expressed hope that the U.S., which had striven to reach the
signing of the accord, would "force Israel into fulfilling its
commitments."
</P>
<P>
The king said that Washington can play a significant role in
helping implement the agreement which called for an Israeli
withdrawal from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for harsher Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed the memorandum in Washington on
October 23 after nine days of marathon negotiations mediated by
the U.S. in Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The deal was temporarily endangered after two members of the
militant Islamic Jihad set off a car bomb at the entrance of a
crowded open-air market in the heart of Jerusalem last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed the two assailants and injured 21 shoppers.
Israeli cabinet reacted by immediately halting the debate and
ratification of the agreement, whose implementation had been
expected to start in mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence Stabilizing in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- After five months of
steady decline, South Africa's business confidence stabilized in
October, the South African Chamber of Business said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although confidence was still low in the manufacturing sector,
signs of stabilization in several key market indicators had
halted the decline in the chamber's business confidence index
(BCI), South African Press Association quoted the chamber as
saying.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a 12-year low in September, the BCI remained
unchanged in October at 84.4, the report said. Seven out of the
13 indicators used to measure the index had shown improvement,
while six deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The positive factors were led by the strengthening Rand, the
decline in the short-term interest rates, higher share prices and
the slightly increased vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's commercial banks lowered their prime lending
rates by two percentage points to 23.5 percent in the past four
weeks. But the rate is still much higher than that in late May,
when speculative attacks on the country's currency started.
</P>
<P>
Negative influences included the sharp rise in the consumer
price index, lower manufacturing volumes and a decline in retail
sales.
</P>
<P>
The country's consumer inflation rate rose to 9.1 percent in
September from 7.6 percent in August, much higher than the five
percent in April before the financial turmoil.

<P>
The chamber's director of economic policy, Ben van Rensburg,
said the threat of global turmoil continued to cast a shadow over
the local economy.

<P>
"Despite the boost given to exporters by the weak Rand,
scaled-down world growth forecasts imply that we will have to

<P>
In tune with the low business confidence in the manufacturing
sector, retailers were expecting zero growth in Christmas sales,
the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
About 27 percent of respondents surveyed by the chamber
forecast negative sales growth over the festive season, compared
with 10 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeks Market for Surplus Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is seeking new foreign
markets for the surplus power it will generate when all the new
power-generating projects in the upper reaches of the River Nile
come into full operation in six years' time.
</P>
<P>
An East African weekly report said Monday that the country
will have a generating capacity of 1,000 megawatts of power by
the year 2000, much more than the projected domestic demand of
320 megawatts by then.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will first ask its neighbors to buy its surplus power,
the report said, adding that Ugandan Minister for Natural
Resources Richard Kaijuka went to Nairobi last week to discuss
this matter.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is Uganda's biggest buyer of its excess power at
present. It buys some 30 megawatts from Uganda each year,
followed by Tanzania and Rwanda which takes five megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1999, two more turbines in Jinja, some 80 kms east of
the capital city, are expected to operate, giving the country an
excess of 20 megawatts of power because Uganda lacks capacity to
distribute all the power generated.
</P>
<P>
An estimated five percent of Uganda's population has access to
power now.
</P>
<P>
Major extension works at the Owen Falls dam will yield an
additional 200 megawatts beginning in mid-1999 and if sufficient
transmission and distribution capacity is in place, another five
percent of the population is expected to be connected.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Growers Demand Own Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee Board of Kenya
(CBK) Monday urged the authorities to allow the establishment of
the coffee bank so that farmers can get needed credits to fight
against the 10-year decline of coffee yield.
</P>
<P>
Coffee yield in the east African country dropped by more than
50 percent from 130,000 tons in 1987/88 to 65,000 tons in
1997/98, according to the data from the Coffee Research
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The board warned Monday in a report that coffee yield in Kenya
will fall further in the next two years due to lack of farm
credit and high cost of inputs.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a coffee farmers' bank will be
very helpful to reverse the downwards trend, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
The coffee board has already set aside 211 million Shillings
(3.52 million U.S. Dollars) for the bank and said it will meet
any criteria set by the central bank for such commercial
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The report said a farmers' bank would focus on seed purchases
and working capital, crop maintenance, transport, marketing and
tracking sales on the auction floor as well as price hedging.
</P>
<P>
"The Kenyan banking system is presently dominated by
commercial banks which focus primarily on short term lending.
Under such a scenario, agricultural lending does not qualify as a
core business," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"The rationale for a coffee farmers' bank is based on a need
to develop a specialized institution that would focus on specific
needs of the sector. Farmers growing exportable crops should be
in a position to borrow offshore," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Kenya rejected any
forming of sectoral banks, claiming farmers should leave banking
to commercial bankers.
</P>
<P>
However, the coffee board said in the report that it was
seeking a technical partner for its bank.
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee exports in the first five months of 1998
declined by 24 percent to 7.0 billion Shillings (117.55 million
Dollars) from 9.3 billion Shillings in the same period last year,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Kenya's third largest foreign exchange earner after
tourism and tea, accounting for some 20 percent of the total
foreign exchange earnings. But analysts here predict that it
will be overtaken by horticulture and placed as the fourth in the
coming years.

LUANDA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary vote-counting
indicated that the ruling Sao Tome &AMP; Principe Liberation Movement

In the past four years, MLSTP had to form a coalition

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Civil wars in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Angola are threatening
Africa's progress, Botswanan President Festus Mogae said in
Gaborone Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Mogae as saying that
"It is deeply regrettable that the situation in those countries
and the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia threatens to take
Africa backwards."
</P>
<P>
Mogae made the remarks at the fifth session of Botswana's 7th
parliament. This was his first state address since he assumed
the presidency on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Lesotho, where Botswana joined
in a Southern African Development Community military operation to
restore peace and stability after politically inspired unrest,
Mogae said the situation in the mountain kingdom still required
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has been contained and political dialog has
stated which we believe will lead Lesotho toward a path of stable
and long-lasting democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
"The situation requires monitoring for a while but we shall
demobilize as soon as stability has been assured," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho suffered political unrest in August and September
which stemmed from disputes of May 23 general election. Some
3,500 soldiers from South Africa and Botswana were deployed in
Lesotho to quell mutinous soliders.
</P>
<P>
Mogae pledged that his government would "continue to deploy
sound political and diplomatic skills that have a bearing on
peace, security, stability and the development of our
sub-region."

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Denies Presence of Tajik Mutiny Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan on Monday denied that
leaders of an anti-government mutiny last week in neighboring
Tajikistan are hiding on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Foreign Ministry spokesman Bakhodyr Umarov also
reiterated an earlier statement that described as "slanderous"
reports that the leaders of the revolt, which started last
Wednesday in northern Tajikistan, had entered Tajikistan from
Uzbekistan, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Monday's denial followed Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar
Saidov's supposition earlier in the day that former colonel
Makhmud Khudoiberdyev and ex-prime minister Abdumalik
Abdulladzhanov have fled to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev and Abdulladzhanov are believed to be the
masterminds of the armed revolt, which left 40 rebels killed and
10 government soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government on Monday asked the countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, "primarily Uzbekistan and
Russia," to help organize the search and detention of the rebels
as well as persons "involved in a number of other acts of
terrorism and sabotage" in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Government troops chased the last large group of rebel fighters
into the mountains Monday after five days of fighting in this
Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government said in a statement that "according to
reliable reports, Abdulladzhanov, Khudoiberdyev and others with
the support of individual institutions are living in the Uzbek
capital, and some in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
"The fraternal assistance to CIS countries is a key factor of
the advancement of the peace process in Tajikistan," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev began the uprising Wednesday, demanding that
President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring
his supporters into the government. The president has ruled out
any talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The fighting followed a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and the Rakhmonov
government.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition groups are now participating in the government
and the armed forces and participated in the fighting against the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> China Absorbs Largest FDI in Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia, China has hit a new record in absorbing
the foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1977, a U.N. economist said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
George Kell, U.N. economist in the Office of the
Secretary-General, told a press conference here that China
attracted 45.3 billion U.S. dollars of FDI, accounting for more
than a half of the flows into Asia and almost one-total FDI to all
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Kell made the statement as he was briefing the press here on
the World Investment Report 1988, compiled and published by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The report is
scheduled to be launched in Lyon, France on November 10.
</P>
<P>
"China continues to maintain its position as the second largest
FDI recipient in the world and the single largest among developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's FDI boom has now lasted for six consecutive years, and
since there has been a financial crisis in Asia which could have
some spillover effects on China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to increased competition from some Asian countries which
have their currencies devaluated, China's competitiveness for
foreign investment has been negatively affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years of reform and opening to the outside
world, China has been making substantial progress in bettering
investment environment, which, to a large extent, plays an
important role in wooing foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asks Palestine, Israel to Put Peace First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn
Talal called on the Palestinians and the Israeli government to put
peace issue on the top of their agendas, the official Petra news
agency reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Ehud Barak, leader of Israel's opposition Labor
Party, Hassan said it is very important for both sides to work
seriously to bring comprehensive and permanent peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
Giving priority to issues other than peace will create a
climate of despair and generate violence and other threats to the
region, Hassan said, adding that the peace issue should not be
held hostage to certain political considerations.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who arrived here earlier Monday with a delegation,
affirmed his party's support to the peace process. He noted that
85 percent of the Israelis supported the recent peace deal between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed an interim land-for-peace agreement in
Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact, Israel will withdraw from another 13.1
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians will intensify
crackdown on anti-Israeli terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu on Sunday indefinitely postponed a cabinet debate on
the ratification of the deal as a result of a suicide bomb attack
in West Jerusalem last Friday, which killed the two assailants of
the Islamic Jihad and injured 21 others.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes that, with the implementation of the deal, Israel
would open the Palestinian markets to the kingdom and fully
implement the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Hopes New NATO Admissions Completed in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany would like to see Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic become full members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization by the time of the next NATO summit
in April 1999 in Washington, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, addressing a joint press conference after talks with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, said however that formal
reasons could prevent the admission process being completed at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the two sides agree on all essential elements of
NATO policy. Without going into details, he said however that
discussions were still necessary about structural changes within
the alliance and about strategic questions.
</P>
<P>
Solana was the first high-ranking foreign visitor met by
Schroeder who took office two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said the U.N. Security Council should be the
only authority to make decisions on the use of force. "Within this
framework" Germany would fulfill its obligations under NATO.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, Schroeder said he and Solana agreed that
pressure must be maintained on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor pledged that Germany would participate in an
international force for the protection of observers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Kosovo, though he did not say how many troops it would send.
</P>
<P>
Solana thanked the new leftist German government for its
handling of the Kosovo crisis. Analysts said he was referring to
the fact that Schroeder had signalled his approval for a possible
military intervention before being sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Solana said otherwise it would not have been possible to force
Milosevic to observe U.N. resolutions on Kosovo which he said were
aimed at a safe return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Germany Marks  Anniversary of The Night of Nazi Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 9 (Xinhua) --"The night of the 9th to the 10th
of November, 1938, belongs to one of the most evil and shameful
moments in German history," said German president Roman Herzog
Monday at a ceremony organized by Germany's Council of Jews
marking the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The night of Nazi terror known as "Kristallnacht" - Night of
Broken Glass - when German Jews were terrorized, their shops
smashed and synagogues, plundered and set on fire across the
country 60 years ago as being recalled in Berlin Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi horror that night against Germany's Jewish citizens
was characterized by Herzog as a "slap in the face of humanity and
civilization". It would be the first in a wave of systematic
attacks against Jews which would culminate in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Herzog went on to say that the pogrom against the Jewish
population was an unmistakeable signal of the Nazi regime's
brutalization of public morals.
</P>
<P>
In the whole of Germany synagogues had burned. "Here was a
quite conscious taboo break and state-managed sacrilege," said the
German president, who added that remembrance of what happened that
night should be passed on and never forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Monday evening, a silent march through the heart of Berlin will
be held, marking the Kristallnacht anniversary. Many Berliners and
members of the Jewish Community are planning to take part in the
march.

KAMPALA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of State for
Finance, Planning and Economic Development Mathrew Rukikaire has
refuted reports that he used his polictical muscle to have the
International Credit Bank (ICB) licensed to operate against the
objections of the Bank of Uganda (BOU).
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued from the Ministry of
Finance, planning and Economic Development Monday,
Rukikaire said that the powers to license commercial banks and
credit institutions under the Banking Act 1969 were vested in the
Minister of Finance and not the bank of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he did not, as alleged, put pressure on the
BOU to license ICB.
</P>
<P>
But, it said, the minister directly issued the license and
forwarded it to the Governor of BOU Charles Kikonyogo and for onward
transmission to ICB as duly carried out.
</P>
<P>
After making the necessary consultations that ICB met the basic
criteria, the minister of state accordingly granted the bank a banking
license as mandated by the law.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Monitor daily quoted the BOU Governor as saying
that Rukikaire had used his political muscle to have the ICB
licensed to operate against the objections of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The BOU suspended the operations of ICB and two other commercial
banks over alleged insolvency in September, sending panic waves across
the country.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President
Festus Mogae told parliament Monday that Botswana's economy
continued to be stable and perform satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
"Current indications are that the 1998/99 growth rate will be
around 6.5 percent," South African Press Association quoted Mogae
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said the average annual growth rate for the current Five
Year National Plan period (to 2003) is expected to be about five
percent. Year on year inflation is down to 5.6 percent, the
lowest in over a decade.
</P>
<P>
Growth in gross domestic product for 1995/96, 1996/97 and
1997/98 had been around seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said that his government is committed to greater market
orientation of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Government policies to develop small medium and micro
enterprises (SMMES), the privatization of parastatals and
government departments are part of a deliberate move towards this
aim, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments around the world have come to recognize the vital
role played by SMMES in helping achieve industrial and economic
development objectives.
</P>
<P>
"They create jobs, generate wealth and provide satisfying
careers for a growing number of enterepreneurs," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
The president said privatization and the role of the private
sector in further development remain high on the government's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government and the private sector to work
together to search for excellence in the true spirit of smart
partnership.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Promote Transport Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) were urged Monday
to adopt policies that will encourage private sector's
participation and investment in the region's transport and
communication sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the third meeting of COMESA's Committee on
Transport and Communications opened in Lusaka, Dickson Matutu,
Zambian Deputy Minister of Communications and Transport, said
transport infrastructure in the region should be improved to
facilitate the realization of a free trade area within about two
years.
</P>
<P>
Matutu also urged COMESA members to implement agreed programs
at the same pace if the regional grouping is to achieve its
objectives, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some countries continue to lag behind in
implementing agreed programs, adding this should be addressed as
COMESA moves toward a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for telecommunication services to be
affordable to the majority of the people and called for more
investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier at the meeting, COMESA Secretary-General
Erastus Mwencha said transport and communications facilitation
programs remain a key factor in the movement of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
He explained that COMESA is promoting a series of instruments
aimed at improving transport in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although COMESA has reduced transportation costs to make the
region more competitive, a lot still needs to be done in
improving transport and communications, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka-based grouping now has 21 members. It aims to
achieve a full free trade area by the year 2000 and a customs
union with a common external tariff by the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Schools to Get Aid After Test Paper Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Ministry of
Education and Culture is trying to provide financial assistance
to government schools which have to accomodate students affected
by a widespread leakage of test papers.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving to get fund to help boarding government
schools foot the cost of keeping students for additional
two-month stay at schools," a ministry official told reporters in
Dar es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said no decision has so far been made on how to
assist private schools, adding that the National Examination
Council should give a proper approach to this problem.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Juma Kapuya declared last Friday that the
National Form Four examinations held early this month were null
and void because leakages of test papers have been reported in at
least six mainland regions and the Pemba island.
</P>
<P>
A set of papers were sold at more than 5,000 Shillings (about
7.5 U.S. Dollars) in secondary schools, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to nullify the examinations has affected some
55,000 students nationwide, who are required not to leave schools
as a new test will be administered in two months.
</P>
<P>
A lot of students interviewed complained that they are
frustrated by the incident and may not recover quickly to prepare
for the fresh examination.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed sympathy with the students saying that
they have been affected by "few untrustworthy individuals."
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the police have held at least five
suspects including some teachers and watchmen.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian secondary school students who want to finish
secondary school from Form One to Form Six are required to sit
for national examinations every year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Pledges Support for OAU's Future Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Monday that Ethiopia will contribute its share
for the success of future peace efforts of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Seyoum made the remarks at a news briefing here shortly after
he returned from Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso as a member
of the Ethiopian delegation attending the two-day OAU meeting on
Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said the OAU committee has presented a peace proposal
which once again called on Eritrea to withdraw from the disputed
Badme and its environs to positions held before May 12.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea rejected the OAU peace plan while Ethiopia has fully
accepted it," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, one of the 11-point peace proposal
of the OAU committee is to deploy in the dispute area an OAU
observer force which will be supported by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The OAU observer force is to observe the withdrawal from the
area of Eritrean troops and is to remain in Badme and its
environs for six months until the dispute is resolved on the
basis of international laws and conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also suggested the involvement of U.N. cartographers
in the delimitation of the border between the two countries, he
said, adding the OAU committee decided to refer the matter to

He said the OAU peace effort has failed because of Eritrea's
refusal to accept the proposal. The OAU has decided to pass the

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Schools to Get Aid After Test Paper Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Ministry of
Education and Culture is trying to provide financial assistance
to government schools which have to accomodate students affected
by a widespread leakage of test papers.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving to get fund to help boarding government
schools foot the cost of keeping students for additional
two-month stay at schools," a ministry official told reporters in
Dar es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said no decision has so far been made on how to
assist private schools, adding that the National Examination
Council should give a proper approach to this problem.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Juma Kapuya declared last Friday that the
National Form Four examinations held early this month were null
and void because leakages of test papers have been reported in at
least six mainland regions and the Pemba island.
</P>
<P>
A set of papers were sold at more than 5,000 Shillings (about
7.5 U.S. Dollars) in secondary schools, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to nullify the examinations has affected some
55,000 students nationwide, who are required not to leave schools
as a new test will be administered in two months.
</P>
<P>
A lot of students interviewed complained that they are
frustrated by the incident and may not recover quickly to prepare
for the fresh examination.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed sympathy with the students saying that
they have been affected by "few untrustworthy individuals."
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the police have held at least five
suspects including some teachers and watchmen.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian secondary school students who want to finish
secondary school from Form One to Form Six are required to sit
for national examinations every year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Promote Agro Research for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of agricultural
experts gathered here Monday over the latest outcome of local
research which they said, are key for Kenya to meet its
industrialization target by 2020.
</P>
<P>
"If Kenya is to attain the NIC (New Industrialized Country)
status as proposed, then we have to vigorously develop the
agro-based sub-sectors" by applying advanced agro technologies,
said Joseph Ojiambo, Head of Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project (LVEMP).
</P>
<P>
"The path to industrialization was mainly through developing
agro-based industries such as food processing, textiles and
clothing, leather products, and beverages manufacture," he said
at the Sixth Scientific Conference of Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI).
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts by the east African country to
raise agricultural production while promoting technologies that
conserve natural resources at the same time.
</P>
<P>
As the base of Kenya's economic growth, agriculture is "mainly
dependent on rainfall, a factor which we have no control," he
noted, citing the effects of heavy El Nino rains in later last
year and earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate technology development for agriculture has
progressed in a slow pace" in Kenya, constrainting the
agricultural growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the meeting Monday, Kenyan Minister for
Research and Technology Andrew Kiptoon also called for
re-doubling efforts in meeting new challenges facing the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The conference "is taking place at a time when many challenges
face food production, agricultural output and development in
general in the country and the world over," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural sector is at a crossroad where we are faced with
eminent crisis because the returns from the sector are falling
short of the needs and expectations of the rapidly growing
population," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reaffirmed the government's commitment to
ensuring an enabling environment conducive to effective and
efficient agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Kenya saw an agricultural growth rate of only 1.2 percent in
1997, down from 4.4 percent in 1996. Drought in late 1996 and
earlier 1997, coupled with heavy El Nino rains nationwide in
later 1997, adversely affected agricultural output as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the largest single sector of Kenya's economy,
making up about 25 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP)
and providing more than 70 percent of rural employment.
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the theme of "Agricultural Research and
Technology Development for Sustainable Resource Management and
Increased Production," is to end on November 13.
</P>
<P>
KARI is the country's largest and top-level agricultural
institution which has branches across the whole country. Endite

<HEADLINE> Adams Urges Blair Focus on Northern Irish Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on
Monday urged British Prime Minister Tony Blair to focus attention
on ending the impasse in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after one-hour talks with Blair in Downing Street, the
Sinn Fein leader said the pro-British Protestant unionists were
"wilfully" delaying implementation of the Northern Ireland peace
agreement reached in April.
</P>
<P>
Unionists led by David Trimble, the First Minister-elect of a
new Northern Ireland assembly, are refusing to form an executive
including Sinn Fein to administer the province's internal affairs
until the Irish Republican Army (IRA) starts to scrap its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Adams warned that without the involvement of the British and
Irish governments, the process would not move forward.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, you cannot make progress in the British-ruled
part of Ireland unless the British government are in leadership
all the time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would be very, very disappointed if he (Blair) does not
accept the challenge that this presents."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the decommissioning, Adams says Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, cannot force the guerrilla group to
give up its arms.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the setting up of an all-Ireland council,
another element of the complicated Good Friday accord, expired on
October 31 with little sign of progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of British people
waiting for hospital treatment has fallen again sharply, according
to figures released by the Department of Health on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people waiting for treatment fell again in
September by 29,100 - the fifth monthly fall in a row - to 1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
The figures put the government on course to hit its target for
next April of bringing waiting lists in England down to 1.16
million.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health also announced that there has been a
cut in waiting times with the number of patients waiting for more
than a year to fall by about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of people waiting for more than a year for treatment
has now fallen by 9,000 since June - the fourth monthly fall in a
row.
</P>
<P>
The figures also revealed that 247,000 more people were treated
in the first six months of this year than during the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
Labor is committed to fulfilling its pledge of cutting waiting
lists by 100,000 by the end of this parliament.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Leader Promises to Fight PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) Chairman Jalal Talabani Monday promised to fight
the militants of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Talabani made the statement following a meeting with Turkish
Foreign Ministry officials on the latest developments in northern
Iraq, an area of a power vacuum after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The PUK leader said that his forces would join hands with
Turkish security troops in fighting the PKK militants who have
camps in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugur Ziyal, deputy undersecretary with the Foreign
Ministry, said that Turkey will monitor whether the PUK keeps
its word on that issue.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK allegedly maintains closer relations with
the PKK which has been fighting the Turkish authorities for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Ankara was slightly relieved with
the meeting between Talabani and his rival Massoud Barzani,
leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in Ankara on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had voiced its concern on many occasions that the peace
accord signed by Talabani and Barzani in September with the
mediation of the United States might lead to an independent
Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, who came here last Tuesday, and Talabani, who arrived
here last Saturday, assured Turkey that the Washington agreement
is mainly aimed at ending armed conflicts between the KDP and PUK
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK have been fighting each other for the control
of the northern Iraq since the Gulf War in 1991 when Iraq was
defeated by the U.S.-led multinational troops deprived of
exercising sovereignty there.
</P>
<P>
Talabani is expected to meet with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Police from Angola's Ministry
of Fisheries have seized a foreign ship for illegally fishing in
the country's territorial waters, the Angola News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Acadia, which had the national flag of Belize, was
seized near Zaire Province in the north with 1,070 cases of
processed fish and 31 tons of raw fish.
</P>
<P>
There were 256 foreign crew and fishermen on board, including 247
Senegalese.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such incident since October 22, when a
Korean fishing ship registered in Spain was caught. The
fishermen, mostly Senegalese, on board have been repatriated and
the ship detained.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the ship as well as executive crew will be
brought to trial in the local court.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with 1,650-km-long coastline, boasts the richest
aquatic resources in Africa. Last year, its catch of sea fish
reached 241,800 tons, in which 100,000 were from foreign fleet
under the contract with the government.

ABU DHABI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The first session of talks
between Sudan and Eritrea on reconciliation started Monday at the
Qatari Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail and his Eritrean
counterpart Haile Woldensae arrived in the Qatari capital Doha
earlier in the day for the Qatari-brokered talks.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabir
Al-Thani said at the beginning of the two-day talks that his
country was keen on helping normalize the Sudanese-Eritrean ties,
reports reaching here from Doha said.

Diplomatic ties between the two neighbors were severed in
December, 1994, after the two sides accused each other of

Qatar offered to mediate between Sudan and Eritrea during a
visit by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin-Khalifa Al-Thani to Sudan
last June.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's State Transport Company Posts Huge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's state
transport company, Transnet, on Monday reported a huge net loss
of 133 million Rand (24.2 million U.S. Dollars) in the six months
to September, South African state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Transnet, the public company controlling the country's rail,
road, air and sea transport, blamed the Asian market crisis and
high-level costs for its mammoth loss.
</P>
<P>
The company recorded a 48 million Rand (8.7 million Dollars)
profit for the April-September period last year and at year-end
on March 31, 1998 was 278 million Rand (50.5 million Dollars) in
the black.
</P>
<P>
Transnet's Managing Director Saki Makozoma said 50 percent of
the company's costs come from labor, and the management will hold
negotiations with trade unions to discuss possible retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
Transnet officials said the organization is going through hard
times as a result of the instability on the Asian markets. When
the company's main trading partners in Asia, such as Japan,
suffered from financial crisis, the company's business volumn was
also affected.
</P>
<P>
One of the most profitable business units in Transnet,
Spoornet, which controls the country's rail transport, registered
only a profit of 573 million Rand (104 million Dollars) in the
six months to September, down from 712 million Rand (129 million
Dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Container shipments company PX, another Transnet unit,
registered a loss of 126 million Rand (23 million Dollars),
despite the fact that it had already shed about 4,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
South African Airways is also running at a loss, posting 207
million Rand (37.6 million Dollars) of loss. The company's
management is cutting down on unproductive staff, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Makozoma said the coming year will not be easy for Transnet,
hence it was necessary to hold negotiations with unions regarding
job cuts.

<TEXT>

HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi said here Monday that peace in Africa remained
under constant threat and a mechanism must be put in place to
thwart any forces of destabilization.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on defense management, Mahachi said while
prospects of a global military confrontation had paled into
insignificance, "the world today, particularly the southern
African region, remained fragmented, volatile and unpredictable."
</P>
<P>
"Our cherished dreams of permanent peace and tranquillity
which we all know are prerequisites for unimpeded and
socio-economic development have therefore remained a far cry,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current crisis in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and between
Ethiopia and Eritrea were some of the few manifestations of
turbulency in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa's challenge is now to put in place mechanisms, policies
and strategies that will contribute to the defense and security
for the region to enhance prospects for peace, stability and
tranquillity, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he defended Zimbabwe's military involvement in the
DRC, saying this was taken in response to resolutions by the
Southern African Development Community which recognized that
continued escalation of the conflict would bring about immense
suffering and misery to the people of the Congo and the whole
African region.

<HEADLINE> Two More Small Banks Fall in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Another two small commercial
banks were taken over Monday by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
due to failure to meet their financial obligations amid a
two-month crisis shocking the country's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
CBK Governor Micah Cheserem moved quickly Monday to appoint
statutory managers for City Finance Bank and Prudential Bank to
save them from paying the crippling financial penalties that
result from their failure to meet liquidity requirements.
</P>
<P>
City Finance is a sister bank of the Trust Bank, the seventh
largest commercial bank which, together with another two, were
seized control by CBK in September due to a sudden run by
depositors and mismanagement in September.
</P>
<P>
City Finance shares the same shareholding and chairmanship
with the Trust Bank. It has suffered a persistent run from
depositors who panicked due to this association since then, local
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At Prudential, troubles came to the fore also at the end of
September due to its inability to meet financial obligations
arising from Clearing House transactions soon after the fall of
the three banks.
</P>
<P>
"The liquidity problems arose due to a high proportion of
non-performing loans. The shareholders of the bank promised to
re-capitalize and return to the Clearing House within days... The
bank has failed to recapitalize as promised," said Cheserem in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Placement of the two banks under statutory management -- which
takes effect immediately -- is intended to allow the banks time
to improve on their liquidity positions through the injection of
additional capital and loan repayments.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks operating in Kenya, of which about a dozen
are branches of British, American, South African and Dutch banks.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is very overbanked. In essence a shake-out is good for
the industry, but it's going to get worse before it gets better,"
Matthew Pearson, an analyst with Investec Securities, commented
at the beginning of the Domino phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Favors of Diplomatic Solution: Robertson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State
for Defense George Robertson said his country was in favor of
diplomatic solution of the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who arrived in Manama on Monday for a one-day visit
to Bahrain, told reporters that the escalation of tension could be
avoided if Iraq backtracks from its recent position and allows
U.N. arms inspectors resume their mission.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis between Iraq and the U.N. is very dangerous,
and Iraq should fully comply with the U.N. resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The standoff was triggered by Iraq's decision to halt
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Noting international unanimity against Iraq's confrontation,
Robertson pointed out that the international community and the
United Nations were getting "impatient" with Iraq, adding "all
options were still open."
</P>
<P>
Robertson said his tour of Kuwait and Bahrain was part of the
British and international efforts to bring Iraq into complying
with U.N. resolutions as well as the deal signed by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Robertson held talks with Bahraini Prince Crown Sheikh Hamad
Bin Isa Al-Khalifa on the developments of the situation in the
Gulf region as well as issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also met with Bahraini foreign minister Sheikh
Mohammed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Iraq decided to halt cooperation with UNSCOM
till the U.N. Security Council considers lifting the crippling
sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and
restructuring the special commission.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions can not be removed until U.N. inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated all its nuclear, chemical, biological
weapons and long-range missiles. Baghdad has long accused UNSCOM
of serving U.S. and Israeli interests.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Israel to Ratify Land-for-Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
said Israel needs to ratify its agreement with the Palestinians
by next week in order to carry out its responsibilities under the
land-for-peace accord.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the fact that the
Israeli Cabinet has not acted yet does not mean Israel has
violated the pact, which was reached last month at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if they act soon, they will be able to act in
time to implement on schedule the time line of the Wye
memorandum," Rubin said in distancing the Clinton administration
from reports Israel had failed to meet a required schedule.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, however, Israeli officials said Israel was likely to
miss the accord's call for the start of a 13 percent pullback on
the West Bank next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, has said
Israel would like to proceed with the agreement as soon as it has
assurances a "spate of terrorist bombings have been taken care of
by systematic comprehensive action by the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
There have been two incidents since Israel agreed to give up
the land in exchange for an action plan to fight terrorists. One
was an attempted bombing of a school bus in Gaza, the other a
suicide attack on a market in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said "it is understandable that there would be a short
pause" in taking up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "We believe it is important that the Israeli
government resume the political-legal process soon and carry out
its responsibilities under the terms of the Wye memorandum."
</P>
<P>
Rubin indicated the Clinton administration expects more than
oral endorsement of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
renunciation of calls for Israel's destruction when the
Palestinian National Council meets in Gaza in December.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that "this process of reaffirmation... will include
relevant procedures."

representing the ruling Democratic Convention won with 1 pct more
votes the Sunday election for Bucharest's General Mayoralty,
announced the Central Electoral Office on Monday.
</P>
<P>

running for the main opposition Party of Social Democracy Sorin
Oprescu got 49.5 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Deputy PM Attacks Press for Intruding Private Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) - Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott attacked at the British press on Monday for prying into
politicians' private lives.
</P>
<P>
Prescott made the remarks after Agriculture Minister Nick Brown
was forced to admit he is gay when a former lover tried to sell
his story to a Sunday tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's quite deplorable. They (newspapers) seem to be
judge, jury and executioner in this matter. It's totally
unacceptable and I think British public opinion's against it
also," Prescott told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Let's pursue the editors and the journalists who do this and
let's see how they like their private lives taken apart on the
front page," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also called on the Press Complaints
Commission -- a voluntary industry watchdog -- to clamp down on
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
Brown went public about his sexuality after The News of The
World, a Sunday tabloid, was approached by a former lover with
what it said were "a series of fanciful and lurid allegations".
</P>
<P>
Brown acknowledged that he occasionally gave his partner small
sums of money but denied he ever paid for sex.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said there is a balance in reporting and protecting
private life, but at the moment "some of the editors have decided
that the balance should be more to what is to do with selling
papers."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on
Monday rejected reports that Irish Republican Army (IRA) would
take the first move on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't give any credence to those reports and indeed I
think they are mischief-making," Adams told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Weekend newspapers said that the IRA, the political wing of
Sinn Fein, would make a decision soon on whether to give up its
arms.
</P>
<P>
Adams is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair later in the day at Blair's Downing Street office in London
on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the disarmament as
well.
</P>
<P>
A timetable to seal a lasting peace after years of strife in
Northern Ireland missed a vital deadline on October 31 because of
the row over the linking of disarmament to political progress.
</P>
<P>
Adams blames Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble
for the stalemate in decommissioning, saying he was making "arms
decommissioning" a precondition to the formation of a range of new
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has insisted that he will not sit in a coalition
cabinet with Sinn Fein until the IRA gives up its arms.

<HEADLINE> NASA Completes Tests of Air-Breathing Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- NASA has completed two years
of testing new rocket engines that breathe oxygen from the air,
and is ready for flight testing.
</P>
<P>
Officials from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center said that
air-breathing engine technologies could make future space travel
like today's air travel, and spacecraft with this engine would be
completely reusable, take off and land at airport runways, and be
ready to fly again within days.
</P>
<P>
According to News Releases reaching here Monday from the
Center, an air-breathing engine gets its initial take-off power
from specially designed rockets, called air-augmented rockets,
that boost performance about 15 percent over conventional rockets.
When the vehicle's velocity reaches twice the peed of sound, the
rockets are turned off and the engine relies totally on oxygen in
the atmosphere to burn the hydrogen fuel. Once the vehicle's speed
increases to about 10 times the speed of sound, the engine
converts to a conventional rocket-powered system to propel the
vehicle into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the air-breathing rocket engine technologies
developed by NASA's Advanced Space Transportation Program is to
make space transportation affordable for everyone from business to
tourists, reducing launch costs from today's price tag of 10000
U.S. Dollars per pound to only hundreds of Dollars per pound.

LAGOS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy Jesse
Jackson met here Monday with leaders of Nigeria's Ogoni minority
</P>
<P>
Sources here said during the meeting with minority leaders,
they brought up several points which the American civil rights
leader promised to discuss in his meeting with federal government
officials in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Jackson also met officials of oil companies including
Royal/Dutch Shell, Chevron and Elf Aquitaine and discussed with
them the issues which came up in the meeting with Ogoni leaders.
</P>
<P>
The meetings took place on the eve of the third anniversary of
the hanging of nine environmental activists including author Ken
Saro-Wiwa who had campaigned for more autonomy for the Ogoni
minority and against the degradations of oil exploration in Niger
Delta region.
</P>
<P>
Following the execution in November 1995, Western countries
reacted by imposing limited sanctions on the then Sani Abacha
junta which were partly lifted after General Abdulsalami
Abubakar set in motion a process toward elections.

<P>
Later, Jackson flew to capital Abuja where he is scheduled to
meet Nigerian Head of State General Abubakar and other government

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Loan to Nepal for Water Supply Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved Tuesday a technical assistance loan of 5 million
U.S. dollars to help improve water supply in the Kathmandu Valley,
the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to assist the Nepali government in
preparing an investment project to provide water to the valley
from the Melamchi river about 40 kilometers northeast of
Kathmandu, and to investigate the feasibility of an artificial
recharge of the ground water in the valley, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the loan is interest-free and repayable over 40
years, including a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the technical assistance loan is expected
to start in January 1999 and will be completed with the award of
all major contracts by mid-2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Melamchi water supply project costs an estimated
270 million dollars (in 1997 prices).
</P>
<P>
In addition to government contributions, it is expected that
six co-financiers will be responsible for different elements of
the project, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"It is intended to commission the investment project by 2005,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
The Melamchi water supply project has been conceived by the
Nepali government as a means to alleviate the chronic water
shortage in the Kathmandu Valley, which has a population of about
1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The current water supply demand in the valley is about 140,000
cubic meters per day, but the combined supply of surface and
ground water in the dry season meets only half of the demand, the
ADB noted.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, the bank approved a technical assistance grant
of 800,000 dollars to support reforms in the urban water supply
sector in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The assistance under implementation aims to ensure the
sustainability of existing and future water supplies in the
valley, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Market Economy Swells the Wallet of Ethnic People in Xinjiang(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- While the expression "market
economy" has been a focus of discussion for economists, ordinary
Chinese folks, including those in remote areas, are simply
doing it.
</P>
<P>
"Market to me means money," said Hadan, a Kazak herdsman-turned
businessman in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In the past,
the Kazak people were known for holding business activity in
contempt.
</P>
<P>
The owner of a "mobile store" on the vast Altay Grassland,
Hadan is now leading a modern nomadic life, shipping commodities by
truck from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
Hadan, in his 50s, told reporters that in recent years he has
shifted from one business to another, with each new one making him
richer.
</P>
<P>
He was from the Keke Argashi Township, where traditional bias
against commerce wiped out the existence of the retail
business. As a result, people had to use sheep and wool to swap
for daily necessities with the passing drivers of cargo
vehicles. For other commodities, they went to villages, sometimes
crossing several mountains on horsebacks.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Hadan, the life of Helat, a Uygur youth, is much
easier. Helat is the owner of a booming store in Urumqi, the
regional capital, where he sells items imported from the neighboring
Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS).

CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Iraq and Jordan intend to construct a railway line
from Ramadi, 120 kilometers west of Baghdad, to the Jordanian
coastal city of Aqaba, via the capital city of Amman, sources
close to the Amman Chamber of Industries said.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a comprehensive project to link Jordan with the
countries of the region by railways, including Iraq, Syria and
Israel. The project was offered in 1994 when hopes were running
high for peace, but was overwhelmed by obstructions facing peace
negotiations on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Secretary General of the Arab Union for Cement and
Construction Materials Ahmed Al Roubian said there are 105 Arab
cement factories with a total output of 115 million tonnes of
cement a year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Monday's inaugural session in Beirut of the 10th
World Conference of Cement Industries, Roubian urged Arab
producers to raise their cement production to 120 million tonnes
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will allow Palestinian citerus fruits to transit
its territory to Arab and foreign countries, it was disclosed by an
Egyptian commercial source.
</P>
<P>
The source added that Palestinian Authority Minister of
Agriculture Hikmat Zeid has agreed with Egyptian officials last
week to establish a joint Egyptian-Palestinian company to market
agricultural products in external markets.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria will introduce 1.65 million telephone lines,
expanding the capacity of automatic telephone exchanges of the
country from 1.8 million lines by the end of 1998 to 3.45 million
lines by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's edition of the "Baath Economic" weekly,
the new project will cover 367 urban and rural centers, using
optical fiber cable network.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Chairman of the Egyptian investment and free zone
authority Ibrahim Fawzi announced that Egypt has received some 2
billion U.S. dollars in direct foreign investment over the past 10

Minister Abdul Karim Hershawi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
ALGERIA -- A Dutch economic and trade mission arrived in
Algeria Monday on a four-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes representatives of 10 establishments

Stock trading is also the big-eyed Uygur lad's cup of

"Xinjiang Economic Journal" and the "Urumqi Evening News,"
mostly for the latest quotations and developments on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
"I'm only interested in the shares of the Tianshan Woollen
Spinning and the Youhao Department Store," he declared, but
declined to disclose what stocks he himself holds. The two
companies he is concerned with are both from Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Rezat, a Uygur farmer, is another success story. He first
worked as a Russian interpreter and this offered him the chance to
meet many CIS businesspeople bustling around the Horgos Port of
Entry at the China-Kazakstan border. Now he acts as a business
go-between, an activity that can earn him as much as 10,000 yuan
(1,204 U.S. dollars) for one successful deal.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Horgos was only a small village of some 30
Uygur and Kazak families living by farming and animal
husbandry. Now it has been turned into a thriving border town with
over 1,500 business go-betweens from different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In Tacheng, the northwesternmost city in China, people of the
Daur and Russian ethnic groups are busy making money at the Baktu
Port of Entry. Old Russian ladies in their 60s and 70s are often
seen guiding foreign tourists on shopping sprees.

<P>
"The turn-away from the traditional shame of doing business has
provided a "golden key" for the ethnic people of Xinjiang to get
out of poverty and become rich," said Huang Jun, director of the
Economic Research Institute of the Xinjiang Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, over the past decade the governments at all
levels in Xinjiang have done a great deal to instill
market-awareness in the local people, helping them to enter into

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's most promising Internet
content provider China Internet Corporation (CIC) held the Third
CIC-china.com Conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred representatives from the Chinese Government and
international information technology and financial circles
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint sponsorship of CIC, the News and Information
Center of Xinhua News Agency and the Data Communications Bureau of
China Telecom, the conference invited representatives from
successful Internet content providers in the world to give
lectures, including Jack Davis, President of America Online.
</P>
<P>
The conference focused on four topics under the theme of
"creating network society, embracing network civilization,"
including growth of international network technologies, Internet
market in China, network applications and on-line advertisement.
</P>
<P>
CIC was jointly developed by Xinhua News Agency and the former
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The china.com company
(CCC), or China Wide Web (CWW), is a solely owned company of
CIC. The first and second china.com conferences were held in
October, 1996 and December, 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, china.com has achieved success in
creating a number of specialized web sites during such major
events as the World Cup Football Games, U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to China and serious floodings in China. As a
result, it has become a pace setter in terms of on-line
information and advertisement in the country's fledging Internet
industry.
</P>
<P>
At present, china.com provides information about China and its
Hong Kong and Taiwan regions in both Chinese and English. It has
four major web sites and access to users in over 200 cities and
regions in China, as well as to those around the world.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Cause Flooding in C. Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Several days of heavy rains
have caused serious flooding around Beira in central Mozambique,
killing two people and blocking traffic in some areas, national
media said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dead were two brothers, one 18 years old and the other 20.
They were drowned while trying to get necessities in the current,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that the torrential rains starting Saturday in Beira
City and its suburbs only came to a halt Monday. The rainfall on
Sunday alone amounted to 160 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses collapsed and the No. 6 National Road in
Manica Province leading to Zimbabwe was almost shut in torrents.
</P>
<P>
The traffic on this highway is affected in the rainy season
every year.
</P>
<P>
Drivers predicted that it is hard to reopen the road in a
short time because bridges affected by the flooding need to be
rehabilitated while the alternative routes are still submerged in
water.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in suburban Beira reportedly had to gather in their
sweet potatos in the fields earlier than usual, to save them from
the floods.

<HEADLINE> EU Enlargement Enters Ministerial Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
enlargement entered a substantive phase on Tuesday when accession
negotiations were moved to the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial accession conferences were held with each of the
six invited applicant countries: Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the EU's 15-member states and the
six applicant countries reviewed progress made toward requirements
set forth by the union.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel, whose country
holds the EU's rotating presidency, said that none of the 11
requirements can be bypassed no matter how easy they may be.
</P>
<P>
The accession requirements range from infrastructure to
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Formal accession talks with the six countries began in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
Though the EU foreign ministers have stressed their objective
for the inclusion of Cyprus as a bi-communal and bi-zonal
federation, the report on accession progress published last week
could not cover Cyprus as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They also regretted that the invitation of the Cyprus
government to include representatives of the Turkish Cypriot
community in the accession negotiations had so far not been
addressed.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the partially-represented Cyprus in the
upgraded accession negotiations could further sour the EU-Turkey
relations that first worsened when the union decided not to invite
Turkey to join the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia
are also applying for EU membership. Malta has re-activated its
application and asked to be put on the fast track alongside the
six countries that have already entered ministerial accession
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Women's Participation in Decision Making Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Director of the African
Center for Women Josephine Ouegraogo Tuesday stressed the need to
communicate women's views and their participation in decision
making at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the two-day meeting of the
African Women Committee on Peace and development here, Ouegraogo
noted that women constitute over 80 percent of all refugees and
displaced persons in the world.
</P>
<P>
"As the worst victims of conflict, surely they would have to
have a voice in deciding when and how wars and peace are made,"
she said, adding that "it is only by so doing that their needs
and interests can be taken account of as decisions are made."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the African Women Committee on Peace and
Development, Ouegraogo said the committee should remain alert,
vigilant and well informed with regard to where issues of
conflict and peace are evolving, being discussed and decisions
being taken.
</P>
<P>
"By monitoring closely the state of pre-conflict, conflict,
post-conflict and reconstruction in Africa, the committee will be
able to assess how best to engage in negotiations and advocacy,
and policy dialog, always ensuring that the women's view point is
well reflecting in the final outcome," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the conflicts in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Guinea
Bissau, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Western Sahara and
Sudan, Ouegraogo said, "the committee needs to demonstrate with
immediate effect that it is indispensable, and that it is indeed
what has been awaited to reflect women's needs and interests
where decisions are made."
</P>
<P>
The African Women Committee on Peace and Development comprises
16 representatives from five sub-regions of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 16 members, six represent governments, five
represent non-governmental organizations while the other five are
selected in their own individual capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the African Center for Women, the
African Women Committee on Peace and Development will establish
its secretariat in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The committee shall convene one annual regular meeting and
special meetings as and when required.

MOGADISUu, November 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people have
died, seven of them children, in the past three days in Huddor
town and its nearby villages, 320 kilometers southwest of
Mogadishu, local authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of others are on the brink of total starvation in
Bakol region, Deputy Chairman for the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) in Huddor Sheikh Adan Madobe told reporters in Mogadishu

</P>
<P>
He said that people are dying in dozens especially in the

</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, four people including
three children died for famine in Bur Dhuhunleh village, 30
kilometers north of Huddor town, Monday alone.
</P>
<P>
The RRA deputy chairman has characterized the situation as a
nightmare similar to that of 1992 when hundreds of thousands of
Somalis died of hunger in Bay and Bakol regions before the
American-led Restore Hope Operation came into effect.
</P>
<P>

Huddor following what he called the liberation of the town 11
days ago from Hussein Aidid's militiamen who controlled the

Serious food and medical shortages have surfaced in Huddor
town after several thousand people have returned from the

<HEADLINE> IMF's Endorsement of HK's Linked Exchange Rate System Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong welcomes the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s endorsement of its policy
framework, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Staff Mission recently made an assessment to continue
its support for Hong Kong's linked exchange rate and the
government's economic policy framework in the Concluding Statement
by the mission following the annual consultation with China in
respect of Hong Kong's economic and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The mission predicted that Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) will decline by about five percent this year, and expected
economic activity to remain weak in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, it believed that Hong Kong's economy will begin to
recover in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "It has been a difficult year for Hong Kong and the
IMF's positive assessment of our strong economic fundamentals and
effective economic policy framework came at an opportune time.
This further strengthens our confidence in an early recovery of
Hong Kong's economy as the external situation improves."
</P>
<P>
The mission noted that Hong Kong was not immune from the
contagion of the regional financial crisis but Hong Kong's
economic fundamentals were remarkably strong. The rapid economic
adjustment was a demonstration of the flexibility of Hong Kong's
economy.
</P>
<P>
It also acknowledged that the government's actions in August
and September had succeeded in stabilizing the financial markets,
and welcomed the establishment of an independent company to manage
the Hong Kong government's investments, and the disclosure of
details of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
The mission commended that the Hong Kong government's high
fiscal reserves had been playing an important role in sustaining
confidence in financial markets and had significantly enhanced its
ability to manage the economy in a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
The IMF endorsed Hong Kong's strong prudential supervision and
robust regulatory oversight of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"The financial position of Hong Kong's banking system and the
quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong
by international standards, and that the impact of the regional
crisis on the banking system will be manageable," said Wanda
Tseng, deputy director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was
in Hong Kong with the mission.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Mission was in Hong Kong from October 21 to November 2
this year, headed by David Robinson, division chief of the Asia
and pacific Department.
</P>
<P>
It held discussions with both private sector and government
officials. The mission issued the Concluding Statement at the end
of the visit.

BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Borussia Moenchengladbach,
languishing bottom of the Bundesliga, on Tuesday replaced Friedel
Rausch with former Germany international Rainer Bonhof.
</P>

1970 to 1978. He joined the German Soccer Federation (DFB) in
1990 as head coach Berti Vogts' assistant.
</P>
<P>
Rausch was widely expected to be dismissed after they were

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. End Talks on Nuke Export Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts of India and the
United States concluded here Tuesday their two-day talks on export
control regimes to check nuclear proliferation following India's
nuclear tests in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs
termed the deliberations as "very useful" and said the two sides
would meet in six to eight weeks after examining documents
exchanged by them.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which Indian officials described as mainly
preliminary and exploratory in nature, were part of the on-going
dialogue on nuclear issues between New Delhi and Washington aimed
at finding a common position on export controls.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held nearly a fortnight ahead of the next round
of crucial talks on nuclear and non-proliferation issues between
Indian Prime Minister's special envoy Jaswant Singh and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott scheduled in Rome on
November 19.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that India in Tuesday's
talks conveyed its serious concern to the U.S. delegation led by
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Barker over the U.S.
denial of specific dual-use of high technology for civilian
programs.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said
Washington "appreciates India's commitment to non-proliferation,
reflected in its effective system of export controls and applauds
India's support for enhancing its export control system."
</P>
<P>
Indian officials said that Washington was satisfied with New
Delhi's commitment to non-proliferation of sensitive equipment and
material in nuclear, space, missiles and other programs.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that during the talks, which focused on
various aspects of disarmament and non-proliferation, the two
sides also discussed the issue of revitalization of the 1984
Indo-U.S. memorandum of understanding intended to promote exchange
in high technology areas.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials complained that the memorandum was not being
implemented in its true spirit by the U.S. and its denial of high
technology would have continued even if India had not conducted
the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held just after U. S. President Bill Clinton
announced a waiver on some of the sanctions imposed on the South
Asian country after the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team at the talks includes representatives from
commerce, customs, energy, defense and foreign ministries, while
the Indian team comprises top officials from the External Affairs
Ministry and other departments.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Huge Market for Menstrual Pads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- In 1997, Chinese women
consumed 25.5 billion menstrual pads, valued at over seven billion
yuan, compared with one billion pads in 1985, according to the
Daily-Use Papers Committee of the China Paper Making Association.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Manxia, secretary general of the committee, said China
has much potential for the expansion of the menstrual pad market
as the majority of Chinese women living in remote villages do not
yet use menstrual pads.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in China, with a population of
nearly 1.3 billion, there are 278 million Chinese women aged
between 15 and 49 years old, but only 41.8 percent of them use
modern menstrual pads.
</P>
<P>
The booming market has lured many local investors and foreign
manufacturers. By the end of 1997, China had some 1,000 menstrual
pads manufacturers, with more than 1,300 production lines.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2002, Chinese women are expected to need more than
30 billion menstrual pads, according to official estimates.

<HEADLINE> Small Business Owners Held in High Esteem in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Small business owners are held
in high esteem in Canada while politicians and labour union
leaders were at the bottom of the list, a poll said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven percent of those polled said they had a great deal
or fair amount of respect for small business owners when they were
asked which professions they respect.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, police officers and teachers rank closely behind small
business owners, commanding the respect of nine out of every 10
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Priests and ministers, judges and actors, singers and artists
are further back in the pack. These groups receive respect from at
least eight out of every 10 of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Corporate executives, journalists, lawyers and federal
government employees are viewed with respect by roughly two-thirds
of those polled in the survey, which was conducted from October 27
to November 1.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the list of 13 professions are union leaders
and politicians. Both have a positive image among fewer than half
of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The top ranking given to small business owners reflects the
value Canadians now place on people who are "self-reliant,
self-rewarding," said John Wright, senior vice-president of Angus
Reid Group that conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
"This is respect for people who survived the recession. Plus,
consistent polling the last two years has shown that one in five
Canadians say they would like to start their own business," Wright
was quoted as saying by Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and
Mail.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted for the Globe and Mail and the CTV
Television Network, interviewed 1,500 Canadians and has a margin
of error of minus or plus 2.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Donation to Rebuild Schools in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Youth Development
Foundation, which over the past decade has been helping school
dropouts in poor areas continue their education, today received a
two million yuan (about 250,000 U.S. dollars) donation for
rebuilding schools destroyed during the devastating summer
flooding.
</P>
<P>
From July to September, the entire Yangtze River basin and
northeast China's Nenjiang and Songhua river basins were hit by
the worst flooding in decades, causing direct economic losses
of some 20 billion U.S. dollars. Schools in the flooded areas,
especially primary schools, were also seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
The China Youth Development Foundation is renowned for its
"Hope Project" initiated in 1989, which over the past nine years
has raised 1.5 billion yuan in donations worldwide, helped build
over 6,000 primary schools in poverty-stricken areas, and sent
some two million dropouts back to school.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the floods receded, the foundation launched a new
round of fund-raising to help the flooded areas rebuild
water-damaged educational facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Ning, deputy secretary general of the China
Youth Development Foundation, his foundation received more than 30
million yuan in domestic and overseas donations in only

schools and over 100 primary school buildings, providing

<HEADLINE> France Does Not Exclude a Military Strike Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that a
military strike by Western allies against Iraq for its failure to
cooperate with the United Nations arms inspectors is an option
being discussed by the West.
</P>
<P>
"All reactions are not excluded, the strikes are an option. The
(U.N.) Security Council is ready to evaluate all the situations
and accept the consequences," said French Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
He refused to answer whether France will join a military
operation against Iraq in case the United States decides to attack
Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based American newspaper, the International Herald
Tribune, however, said on Tuesday that "there are signs" that
France has agreed to join an American-led military operation if
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein does not change his stand in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq can change its stand, we still hope so. The attitude of
Iraq can only delay the lifting of the sanctions," said the French
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
As for the call by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa that
the make-up of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of destroying Iraqi arms of mass destruction should be
changed, the spokesman said that Iraq should resume cooperation
with UNSCOM first.
</P>
<P>
``We support UNSCOM. First Iraq should resume its cooperation
with UNSCOM. It is afterwards that we will see if we can improve
the efficiency of UNSCOM,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Cyprus' Entry into EU Can Help Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Tuesday that
Cyprus' entry into the European Union (EU) could help find a just
and viable solution to the division of the island on the basis of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement welcoming the beginning of talks with Cyprus and
five other European countries, Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that Cyprus' inclusion in the EU
facilitated the issue of peace and stability in the wider region
and was to the advantage of both communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots would be able to live
together in a federal Cyprus which would come under the security
umbrella provided by lawful order in Europe, he said, adding that
the EU was in a position to guarantee peaceful coexistence,
cooperation and the prosperity of both communities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece was opposed to making finding a
solution to the division of Cyprus a prerequisite to the island's
accession to the community.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that there could be no justification for
not including Cyprus in the EU with other candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy said in a joint
declaration Monday that the inability of Greek and Turkish
Cypriots to reconcile their differences weight heavily on Cyprus'
chances of being accepted into the community.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis also said Tuesday
that Greece would not accept the EU's expansion with the accession
of other countries if Cyprus' bid membership was rejected because
of the island's outstanding political problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
south and the Greek Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Greece has made it clear that it desires the inclusion of a
united Cyprus in the European family, but warns that Cyprus should
not be held hostage to Turkey, which also wants to join the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Tuesday that he is against banning the Communist
Party as suggested by some politicians.
</P>
<P>
"I think a ban on a party which has a majority in parliament,
may destabilize the situation," Interfax quoted Primakov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's comments followed suggestions by leader of Russia's
Democratic Choice Yegor Gaidar and CIS Executive Secretary Boris
Berezovsky to ban the Russian Communist Party for anti-Semitic
statements made by Albert Makashov, a Communist deputy in the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"One must be very cautious about such statements," Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Mikhail Mityukov, President Boris Yeltsin's
representative to the Constitutional Court, said a ban on the
Communist Party would aggravate the political situation in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal, if implemented, may have the opposite result
than the intended," Interfax quoted Mityukov as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance and
Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar Tuesday expressed the hope that the
government would succeed in getting the 5-billion-U.S.-dollar
package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The IMF package is very much on the cards and is likely to be
finalized after our talks with the IMF team," Dar said while
talking to journalists in his chamber at Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition leaders' statement regarding the
country's default is baseless. "Pakistan will soon get the IMF
package, so the question of default does not arise," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the change in the financial team was made
by the prime minister and not due to any pressure from
international donors.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif does not believe in dictation and
decides economic and other issues in the best interest of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that changes in the financial team would not effect the
on-going process of talks with the IMF, as he and Governor State
Bank along with other officials were involved in the talks from
the beginning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Action Risks Damaging Ties With EU: Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Tuesday
blamed the United States for risking potential damage to their
economic and political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by European Commission Vice-President Sir
Leon Brittan while commenting on the publication by the United
States of a long list of products for possible unilateral trade
sanctions as a result of a new banana-trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
"This unilateral action by the United States is politically
unwise, contrary to their World Trade Organization obligations,
and risks doing wide damage to EU-U.S. relations," said Brittan.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union threatened to take counter-actions within
the framework of the WTO. "If the United States persists with such
unilateral action, the EU will have no choice but to take rapid
steps to challenge it in the WTO," said the commission
vice-president in charge of relations with the United States and
WTO-related affairs.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers approved only a day earlier the action
plan for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) and the
U.S. action came completely unexpected.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan blamed the U.S. action as an unlawful act of
might-is-right and described the timing of the U.S. action as the
worst possible for EU-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should not and need not do what it is
doing," added the vice-president who personally negotiated with
American Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky for the TEP
action plan.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States spent the past several
months designing the TEP which is aimed at enhancing transatlantic
trade relations by addressing the remaining barriers to
transatlantic trade.
</P>
<P>
Brittan admitted that the EU had lost its previous banana-trade
dispute panel and had been complying with the WTO ruling by
designing a new banana-trade regime the EU deemed to be compatible
with the WTO ruling. The United States however argued that it had
not correctly implemented the WTO ruling.
</P>
<P>
The commission vice-president appealed to the American side to
desist from unilateral action and to seek to resolve the
differences according to the lawful and multilateral channels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU is ready to cooperate with the United
States in addressing the differences within the WTO rules and
procedures, but it will not do so under the threat of illegal
unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States are each other's
single largest trading partner in the world. In 1997, they traded
goods worth 277 billion ECUs (about 326 billion U.S. dollars), or
around 20 percent of their total world trade volume.

<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, chief of
the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA),
in meeting here today with visiting United States Pacific
Commander General Joseph Prueher, reiterated that the U.S. should
abide by the principles of three Sino-U.S. joint communiques on
Taiwan and handle the Taiwan Issue properly in order to maintain
the good trend in bilateral relations between the two countries
and two armies.
</P>
<P>
Fu added that the U.S. should attach greater importance to the
development of bilateral ties, keep its promise and not support
independence for Taiwan, "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan,"
and not support Taiwan's entrance into any international
organizations where nationhood is a requirement.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of China's Central Military Commission,
expressed his appreciation for the efforts made by Prueher in
promoting the development of Sino-U.S. army relations.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the two countries have, through their
successful exchange of visits, established a framework and a
direction for the growth of Sino-U.S. relations, and reached
an important consensus on bilateral exchanges and cooperation in a
wide-range of fields, all of which signal a new phase in
Sino-U.S. relations, Fu noted.
</P>
<P>
Fu also expressed his satisfaction with the good development of
bilateral army ties.
</P>
<P>
Prueher said that high-level mutual visits and exchanges have
so far guided Sino-U.S. army relations to "a big step forward."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said he hopes the two sides will work together to
reduce their differences for a stable development of military
relations.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors See High Rates of Return in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) by trans-national corporations (TNCs) into Africa remains
low but there are signs of rising levels for the future partly as
a result of high FDI rates of return from the continent.
</P>
<P>
Growth, economic reform and improvements in the regulatory
frameworks of many countries in the continent are being
increasingly recognized by both domestic and foreign investors,
according to the World Investment Report 1998 issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the case of FDI from the United States, there was only one
year (1986) between 1980 and 1997 when the rate of return on
investment was below 10 percent, said the report from the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
"Since 1990, the rate of return in Africa has averaged 29
percent and since 1991... net income from British direct
investment in Africa was reported to have increased by 60 percent
between 1989 and 1995," said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding South Africa, FDI flows to Africa were just
three percent of the total flows to developing countries in 1997
with a volume of 4.7 billion U.S. Dollars. The figure in 1996
stood at 4.8 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Angola accounted for two
thirds of this total. Inflows of FDI to Africa have to a
considerable extent been related to natural resources.
</P>
<P>
For a number of African countries, many of the economic
fundamentals are improving and enabling policy frameworks for
investment are being put in place, the report commented.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report stressed that 1997 was the fourth
consecutive year of economic growth for Africa as a whole and
privatization has become increasingly important for attracting
FDI, although it is far from being fully explored by most African
countries.
</P>
<P>
In Sub-Saharan Africa, 299 million Dollars from a total of 623
million Dollars in privatization sales were accounted for by
foreign investors. Ghana topped the list with 186 million
Dollars, selling a 112-million-Dollar stake in Ashanti Goldfields
to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was placed second with 137 million Dollars, which
included a 26 percent share in Kenya Airways that was sold to KLM
of the Netherlands for 26 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
African countries are also strengthening efforts to enhance
policy frameworks, making them attractive to foreign investors,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, some 47 out of the total 53 African countries had
adopted national laws governing FDI.
</P>
<P>
The leading countries of TNCs investing in Africa between 1982
and 1996 are Britain, France, the U.S., Germany, Japan and the
Netherlands, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that in recent years, France overtook Britain as the
largest single country source of African FDI.

<HEADLINE> Albania, U.S. Troops Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The special forces of Albania
and the U.S. Marine Corps are holding joint military exercises and
training in Albania to improve their ability to counter terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
The joint exercises and training, scheduled from November 3 to
mid-November, is within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) partnership, according to sources in the
Albanian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A company from the Albanian special forces and the U.S. Marine
Corps each joined the operation, which covers the use of
anti-terrorist weapons, speedy landings from helicopters, and
helicopter-assisted search and salvage, and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The joint maneuvers and training have a special meaning,
Albania's deputy Defense Minister Ilir Bocka said. It strengthens
and broadens the area of the two countries' fight against
terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Berdaj, Commander of the Albanian Special Troop, said
the joint operation will increase the ability of the Albanian
special forces to fight against terrorism and other criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the U.S. and Albania have
arrested terrorists from Arabian countries by launching
cooperative raids in Albania.
</P>
<P>
However, terrorist activities directed at businessmen, such as
kidnaping and blackmail, are reportedly on the rise in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.S. diplomats in Albania have left the country
after two U.S. embassies in Africa were bombed by terrorists.

strongly indicated they still plan to move forward with
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.

trip to Asia might be curtailed, or even canceled.
</P>
<P>

debate warned members of the House Judiciary Committee that a

<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- After a decade of population
growth in prisons, the number of Canadians behind bars is now on
the decline.
</P>
<P>
The average number of adult offenders in custody peaked between

years, according to a statistical report released in Canada on

<P>
The national average in the incarceration rate fell to 14

BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Tuesday that it had no comments to make on a French proposal
regarding the role of international representation of the euro
zone after January next year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the commission said that he had not yet read
the full text of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
French Economy Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Monday
proposed that the 11-nation euro zone should be represented
internationally by its president and a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, proposed earlier that the euro zone
should be represented internationally by the European council of
ministers of euro member states, the commission and the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the commission's proposal had to be
discussed and approved at the November 23 European Council of
Economy and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN).
</P>
<P>
The commission is the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, while the European council of ministers is the legislative
body of the union.
</P>
<P>
International representation in the euro zone could become a
difficult issue to resolve since both proposals point to more than
one representative at any international occasion. The commission
is in favor of representation by three groups, while France
prefers two.
</P>
<P>
Both proposals would also affect the current representation of
the countries that take part in the single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Britain has not joined the euro zone, and can thus keep its
slot in the industrialized Group of Seven. However, France,
Germany and Italy may likely be unwilling to give up their
representation in that group.
</P>
<P>
The representation issue will have to be discussed and decided
by the year's end European council by the heads of state.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday blasted a
U.S. bill targeting Iraq as interfering in the domestic affairs of
a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which addresses the liberation of Iraq and was
adopted by Congress and signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, may
exacerbate the already difficult and explosive situation with Iraq
and the region, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes a package of measures to make preparations
for unseating the Iraqi leadership, Interfax quoted Rakhmanin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the motives, such steps represent interference
in the domestic affairs of a sovereign country, which runs counter
to the fundamental principles of international law," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Secretary Ends Visit to Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State
for Defense George Robertson left Manama Tuesday for home
following his brief one-day visit to Bahrain, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bahrain, Robertson held talks with senior
Bahraini officials on ways to develop and promote bilateral
relations, and the latest developments in the region, particularly
the current standoff between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Manama Monday evening, he said
the Iraq-U.N. crisis was extremely serious and that the
international community was losing patience. He called upon Iraq
to resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors to avert a military
strike.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary arrived in Manama Monday
afternoon from Kuwait to expound the efforts being made by the
international community and Britain to follow up Iraq's abidance
by the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's visit followed a similar Gulf tour by
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen last week to win support
of the countries in the Gulf region for a military strike at Iraq
should it persist in refusing to cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on October 31 its decision to halt all forms of
cooperation with U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for disarming
Iraq until the U.N. Security Council moves toward the lifting of
the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted last Thursday, the Security Council
condemned the latest Iraqi defiance and urged it to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM immediately and unconditionally, but Iraq
has refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 for its invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until weapons inspectors verify that it
is free of banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Promises Modern Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) --The new German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Tuesday that his government intended to introduce
modern economic policies that will be free of political influence.
</P>
<P>
"We do not stand for right-wing or left-wing economic policies,
but for modern policies responsive to the social market economy,"
Schroeder said in his inaugural speech to parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said pressure needed to be eased on household budgets to
revive the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Under Schroeder's reforms, relief in the amount of 15 billion
marks (8.8 billion U.S. dollars) will be provided for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that after four years, a family with two
children earning an average income will pay 2,700 marks (1,600
dollars) a year less in tax.
</P>
<P>
Mass unemployment is the "most pressing and painful problem,"
Schroeder said. He has issued invitations to both trade unions and
employers in a bid to hold the first meeting of the "alliance for
work" grouping in December.
</P>
<P>
Turning to nuclear energy, Schroeder defended the concept of
the central-left coalition in his own Social Democrat party and in
the Greens to end Germany's reliance on it. He said the use of
nuclear energy is "socially unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He is convinced that he can find a compromise with the energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
The new chancellor promised to improve education and vocational
training, saying that a project will immediately be launched to
provide 100,000 young people with special training.
</P>
<P>
Broadening the theme, the new chancellor vowed to speed up the
transfer of technology to the economy. He added that state
investment in research and education would also be doubled in the
next five years.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Hold First Round of Talks on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan held
their first round of talks on commerce and trade here Tuesday with
initial signs showing that only marginal headway has been made in
resolving key issues relating to telecommunications, railways and
power.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Indian Commerce Ministry said the two sides
exchanged views on various aspects of economic and commercial
cooperation during the three-and-a-half-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Commerce Secretary Mohammed Sulaiman, leader of the
seven-member Pakistani delegation, declined to say anything on the
outcome of the talks Tuesday which are part of the current round
of complex talks between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Indian delegation is led by Commerce Secretary P.
P. Prabhu.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Islamabad expressed its willingness
to offer power to India starting with small projects of 50
megawatt.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan also raised the issue of problems in operating an
express between the two countries, especially due to security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to discuss the issue from time to time and
the Pakistan team even insisted on a dialogue between railway
secretaries Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
But the meeting did not take place since the Indian railway
secretary was not in the capital, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to settle all pending accounts relating to
different services.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to continue discussions on various aspects of
economic and commercial cooperation in the next round of dialogue
process.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between India and Pakistan was about 170
million U.S. dollars in 1996-97, but unofficial business turnover
was estimated to be around 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any progress Monday on their
long-pending Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute with New Delhi
firmly rejecting Islamabad's proposal for a third party
arbitration, but their talks were reportedly held in a frank and
cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is the second phase of the scheduled
nine-day dialogue between the two countries which has so far
turned out no positive results on three of the six outstanding
identified issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on both a navigation project and the Siachen
Glacier dispute held here last week also ended in a deadlock.

<HEADLINE> FM: Iraq Wants to Solve Arms Inspection Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Tuesday that Iraq is making
intensive contacts with France, Russia, China and other countries
to find a peaceful solution to the current Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf told the Iraqi News Agency (INA) that Iraq is for a
political solution based on the lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on the country in 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He hailed some member states of the Security Council for their
stance that U.N. resolutions must be implemented within their
legitimate framework without adding any further conditions,
saying that their stance reflects Iraq's demands.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the U.S. position that the lifting of the
U.N. sanctions should be linked not only with Iraq's disarmament,
but also with some other time-consuming issues, such as the
release of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
On the latest resolution adopted last Thursday by the Security
Council which condemned the Iraqi non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors, al-Sahhaf said it has defects, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
"If these defects remain, the Security Council and Iraq cannot
find a solution out of the current standoff," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on October 31 announced its decision to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for
disarming Iraq until the Security Council moves toward lifting
the U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday's Security Council resolution urged Iraq to
resume cooperation with UNSCOM, but so far Iraq has refused to
back down.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf warned that "using force against Iraq will not lead to
any progress, rather it will shake the region violently and lead
to tremendous deterioration of the situation."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq does not fear military threats. It demands its
legitimate rights that have already been stated by the
U.N. resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that "the threat of force is a fatal mistake,
therefore all the parties concerned, including the U.S. and
Britain, must join the current efforts to find a solution to the
crisis, and they must make it clear to U.N. secretary-general that
the comprehensive review of Iraqi issue will lead to the lifting
of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the U.S. and Britain should be fully
responsible for any further deterioration of the
situation.

<HEADLINE> China Sells Financial Bonds to Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance
announced today that it has successfully issued six billion yuan
(725 million US dollars) in special financial bonds to commercial
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said that the five-year bonds have
an annual interest rate of 5.68 percent, which will be paid
annually. The bonds are especially designed for insurance
companies and cannot be traded on the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of the bonds include PICC Life, China Pacific Insurance
Company Ltd., PICC Reinsurance, China Ping An Insurance Company
Ltd. and a number of other commercial insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue aims to make effective and rational use of
insurance capital to promote a sustained, fast and healthy growth
of the national economy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has undergone fairly rapid development
in recent years, but the investment channels for insurance capital
are still limited. This issue is expected to further raise the
safety and efficiency of insurance capital, and at the same time
create new fund-raising channels for the state's finances.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Global Internet content
provider Yahoo has signed a landmark agreement with China to sell
its services here, Yahoo international Vice President Heather
Killen announced here today.
</P>
<P>
She said in a speech delivered at the Third CIC-China.com
Conference here that Beijing-based Infoshare Technology
Co. Ltd. will be the exclusive sales agency for Yahoo in China.
</P>
<P>
Infoshare is a state-owned company under the China
International Electronic Commerce Center (CIECC) of the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Ma Yun, general manager of Infoshare, said that this
cooperation will begin in December. Infoshare will promote Yahoo
services in China and help Chinese enterprises create on-line
advertisements on Yahoo's worldwide network.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the first step in cooperation, and we have a
complete plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate, saying that the plan will be unveiled
at a joint press conference in the United States in the next 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
Killen said that it is a good idea to cooperate with MOFTEC,
which has direct links with import- and export-oriented companies
in China.
</P>
<P>
She said that Yahoo will offer a global platform for Chinese
companies entering the international market.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to have a local sales agency in the country
because the number of Chinese companies contacting Yahoo for
on-line advertisement is increasing, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma the newly established Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) is drafting new regulations on the rapidly growing
Internet market and there is no requirement that the MII approve
this cooperative project.
</P>
<P>
"We will go through all necessary procedures if any are
introduced in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has six million Internet users and the figure is
doubling every year.

<P>
Recently, foreign media reports predicted that the Angolan
government troops would soon launch a large-scale military
offensive on such important towns as Andulo and Bailundo
controlled by the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Andulo and Nharea in the central province of Bie and Bailundo
and Mungo in neighboring Buambo Province have been regarded as
the strongholds of the UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Andulo is the "political and military capital" of Savimbi's
movement. UNITA's refusal to surrender the four towns to the
control of the government as required by the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol has been largely attributed to the faltering peace
process in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Angolan defense minister acknowledged that his
troops have intervened in some local conflicts, saying that "the
army has to respond to some acts of Savimbi's forces because the
national police has a lot of other things to do."
</P>
<P>
As to whether the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) will step in in the conflict of Angola, Sebasstiao said
his government will welcome SADC intervention because Savimbi's
troops have caused unrest in Angola and also brought negative
impacts upon the region.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan armed forces keep the rein on the situation and
are ready to repulse any attack by the UNITA, the defense
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Metal Export Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's metal export earnings
dropped by about 42 percent in the first nine months of this year
to 468.83 million U.S. Dollars from 809.3 million in the same
period last year, Financial Mail weekly reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's earnings comprise 386.18 million Dollars from
copper, 82.35 million Dollars from cobalt and 0.3 million from
other metals, said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Copper earnings fell by 44 percent from 688.6 million Dollars
realized from January to September last year to mere 386.18
million in the same period this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in copper earnings has mainly been attributed to
the low prices at the London Metal Exchange resulting from the
Asian financial crisis. Production on the other hand, is yet
still low and fails to compensate for the decline in prices.
</P>
<P>
The reduced metal export earnings coupled with lack of any
balance of payment support from the country's donors have put the
economy under extreme pressure.
</P>
<P>
The donors have withheld their support to press Zambia into
speeding up its privatization of copper mines, Zambia's major
foreign exchange earner.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Soya Faces Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Soybean industry is facing a
serious slump this year locally and globally with its prices
declining, an industrial report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The export markets for soya have shrunk while prices on the
domestic market have significantly dropped, said the report in
the Zambian Farmer, a journal of the Zambia National Farmer's
Union.
</P>
<P>
The report carried by the Financial Mail weekly predicted that
the prices will not improve over a short term.
</P>
<P>
It said soya markets are depressed across the globe with a
glut of soya cake from Argentine and Brazil pulling down the
prices.
</P>
<P>
With the prices unattractive, a stockpile of soya has built up
in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Export Board of Zambia shows that world market
price for soya is 280.1 U.S. Dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's farmers have started to consider pulling out of
growing the crop because of the price fall.

XINING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province has ordered an outright ban on the felling of natural
forests, effective today.
</P>
<P>
The ban is the latest move made by the Qinghai Provincial

The provincial government has also decided to close timber
markets, outlaw the timber trade, and dismantled timber processing
plants in the forest zones.
</P>
<P>
Along with these measures, no more permits for the transport of
timber and timber products from state-owned forest zones will be
issued, according to the decision.
</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States could put
its citizens abroad at risk if it persists with its bid to
prosecute alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden, Afghan Taliban
authorities warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement, the militia accused Washington of
double standards, saying the U.S. Supreme Court's indictment
against the Afghanistan-based Saudi dissident could spark a costly
regional response, according to reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
"What the Americans will gain is a storm of hatred against them
in the region, and in the Muslim world, which will cost them
hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of years to find any
friends here," said the statement, which was read over official
Radio Shariat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has indicted bin Laden for the bombings of two of its
embassies in East Africa on August 7, which killed 224 people, and
announced a 5-million-U.S.-dollar reward for his capture and
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar has resisted
requests to hand over the Saudi dissident and set November 20 as
the deadline for Washington to provide evidence of the allegations
made against him.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Power &AMP; Lighting Co.
(KPLC) has signed a contract with Israel's Ormat Turbines Ltd. on
the building of a geothermal power plant worth up to 172.5
million U.S. Dollars in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Ormat, which designs and builds geothermal
power plants, would also have a 20-year operating license for the
plant, according to a media report available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be built in Ol Karia district, could generate up
to 100 megawatts at full capacity, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The accord calls for the plant to be developed in two stages.
The first, powered by existing thermal water sources, would
generate eight megawatts and take 17.5 million Dollars and two
years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The company did not say where financing for the project would
come from, and a spokeswoman said that she could not provide any
further details.
</P>
<P>
The second stage, which could cost about 155 million Dollars
to develop and take another two years to finish, would depend on
developing new thermal power sources in Ol Karia, Ormat said.
</P>
<P>
It said the second phase would boost generating capacity to
between 64 and 100 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The company said that at a minimum output of 64 megawatts, the
plant would produce revenues of 43 million Dollars annually, or
860 million Dollars over the life of the contract.

MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific Airways and the
Interim Rehabilitation Receiver of Philippine Airlines (PAL)
jointly announced here Tuesday that the PAL receiver has accepted
Cathay Pacific's conditional proposal for a possible investment in

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Urged to Condemn Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called on the
U.N. Security Council to condemn fresh Turkish incursion into
northern Iraq and ask the Turkish government to withdraw its
troops from Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf issued the call
in two letters to incumbent president of the Security Council and
U.N. secretary-general, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said in the letter that "Iraq vehemently rejects
Turkish allegations furnished to justify the repeated acts of
invasion of the Iraqi territories."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkish troops, which were estimated at
more than 25,000 and supported by jet fighters and helicopters,
carried out a new incursion on Sunday into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has claimed that its troops entered northern Iraq in
order to track down elements of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for an independent state in southeast
Turkey since 1984, and it often launches cross-border attacks on
Turkish government forces.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf stressed that the policy of imposing the no-fly zone
pursued by the Turkish government in cooperation with the U.S. and
British governments created an abnormal situation in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. and Britain established the
no-fly zone in northern Iraq with the declared aim of protecting
Iraqi Kurdish minorities from government forces' attacks. The
Iraqi central government since then has lost its actual control
over this region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that Iraq has preserved its legitimate right
under the international law to take the appropriate reply to the
Turkish military aggression on Iraqi territories and airspace,
and to ask for compensations for the losses Iraq had sustained in
men and properties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. Security Council would
adopt measures condemning Turkey's invasion and asking the
Turkish government to abide by the U.N. Charter and international
law and norms, and to withdraw its troops from Iraqi territories
immediately.

HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government,

This was announced by Minister of Information, Posts and

He said, "industrial action is, therefore, not the answer to
present economic problems."
</P>
<P>
The problem should be resolved squarely by all parties who had
an interest in the successful implementation of the current
reform program, Chimutengwende said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce for its
continued call for dialog as opposed to confrontation. Work
stoppage would seriously hamper operations by companies which are

<HEADLINE> IMF, Zambia to Discuss Copper Mine Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) delegation will arrive here this week to discuss with
Zambia issues including the dragging privatization of copper
mines, a national newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion during the the IMF mission are expected to
center on the country's macro-economic development, privatization
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and next year's
budget of the country, according the Financial Mail weekly.
</P>
<P>
Because of the disagreement over the selling prices of Nkana
and Nchanga mines, two biggest copper mines of the country,
Zambia has suspended the negotiations with the initial bidders.
</P>
<P>
The donors have withheld their balance of payment support to
press Zambia into speeding up the ZCCM privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The non availability of the financial support from the donors
coupled with declining earnings from metal exports, down by
almost 50 percent this year, have led to depreciation of the
country's currency Kwacha, rebounding inflation rate and lack of
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the donors pledged to give Zambia an aid of 530
million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Higher Awareness of Y2K Among HK Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- There has been a significant
improvement in the awareness of the Year 2000 Problem (Y2K) among
Hong Kong companies, a survey conducted by the Hong Kong
Productivity Council (HKPC) showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the Council interviewed 3,065 local
companies through telephone on the Impact of the Y2K in Hong Kong.
Some 98.3 percent of the respondents said they had heard about Y2K
while 77.5 percent claimed that they knew what it is.
</P>
<P>
Compared with a similar study conducted by HKPC in 1997 in
which nearly 40 percent of the respondents had never heard of Y2K,
the latest findings reflected a remarkable increase in the Y2K
awareness level.
</P>
<P>
The study was endorsed by the government's Information
Technology and Broadcasting Bureau and supported by the Industry
Department.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the study, Thomas Tang, executive
director of HKPC, said, in spite of an improvement in Y2K
awareness in the business sector, local companies, in particular,
small and medium-sized enterprises, are still facing a lot of
problems in tackling Y2K, mainly due to lack of financial and
manpower resources.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that the size of the companies is directly
proportional to the amount of preparation they undertake toward
solving the Y2K problem. Among those who believe they will be
affected by Y2K but with no plan to tackle it, over half are
companies with less than four staff and 40 percent with five to 19
staff.
</P>
<P>
To help small and medium-sized enterprises combat the
millennium bug, HKPC launched Tuesday an 888 Bug-Buster Program,
an on-site Y2K rectification service for local companies at the
affordable price of 888 HK dollars (114 U.S. dollars).

a number of "bright spots" that clearly indicated the Philippines
would "remain standing long after the storm has passed."
</P>
<P>
These positive developments signaled, he said, the return of
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that his pro-poor agenda was compatible with his
adherence to free-market principles, adding that "one of the major
ways of attacking poverty is through the creation of more jobs by
an expanding business sector."
</P>
<P>
He said his administration would increase its deficit spending
to pump-prime the economy by increasing public investments in the
areas of agriculture and housing, which both have the most direct
impact on the life of the poor.
</P>
<P>
This strategy has even got the nod of the International
Monetary Fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of the goal of sheltering the people from future
financial upheavals, Estrada said his administration has prodded
the privatization and deregulation of the power sector, and will
step up its campaign against official corruption.

<HEADLINE> Major Research Society Closes Annual Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 annual meeting of the
Chinese Society for Research on the Restructuring of the Economic
System ended here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scholars and experts attended the 3-day meeting
and discussed ways to increase demand in order to maintain effective
growth. They agreed that China has been successful in countering
the effects of the Asian financial crisis since the second half of
last year while maintaining the stability of the yuan and
realizing relatively high economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To form a solid foundation for sustained growth, China should
increase support for medium and small enterprises, and
appropriately step up construction of medium and small cities and
towns and satellite cities around major cities, accelerate the
development of new and high-tech industries, and give greater
importance to the utilization of international capital, the
participants concluded.
</P>
<P>
Since the Society was founded 15 years ago, it has put forward
many research results and offered policy proposals for China's
reform, opening-up and economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Party Refuses to Give up Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) Tuesday refused to hand over the National
Assembly's presidency to opposition FUNCINPEC party, claiming it
is against the Constitution and the law.
</P>
<P>
The CPP pointed out in its communique released Tuesday that it
is utterly unjustifiable that the two opposition political parties
who lost in the elections attempt to use the presidency as a
bargain chip to break the current political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Both the CPP and FUNCINPEC are haggling for the assembly
presidency because it means the control of the National Assembly.
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, also CPP vice-president, had
earlier suggested a co-presidency of the assembly but was rejected
by FUNCINPEC.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC insisted that the presidency should be awarded to it
as it had won the 1993 election but agreed to give up the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The CPP communique stated six reasons to prove that FUNCINPEC
was forced, not voluntary, to give up the assembly presidency in
1993 under a special situation.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the CPP also made a great concession in order
to achieve the national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The CPP insisted that the current situation is totally
different from that in 1993, so "the model 1993" has no meaning at
present.
</P>
<P>
The communique proposed that FUNCINPEC nominate their
presidency candidate to compete with the CPP through the National
Assembly's vote.
</P>
<P>
The CPP's bottom line is to have the premiership, the
parliamentary presidency, and a 7-5 split of the 12 official
assembly positions between it and FUNCINPEC. But FUNCINPEC wants a
4-4-1 split, that is FUNCINPEC has four positions, the CPP has
four and Sam Rainsy Party gets one.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the July election this year but fell short of a
two-thirds majority needed to form a new government alone.
FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party have refused to accept the election
result, saying the CPP won the election through fraud and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy left Cambodia on September 25
and refused to return for negotiations, saying they fear for their
safety. They have insisted on a three-party summit meeting outside
Cambodia, which has been rejected by the CPP.

<HEADLINE> French President to Visit Mexico for Closer Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will pay a state visit from November 11 to 14 to Mexico, whose
market is dominated by the United States, to expand bilateral
economic cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by 40 heads of French enterprises, Chirac will
discuss with his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo, about ways
to strengthen the bilateral economic ties, which were weakened by
the 1994 financial crisis in Mexico but has seen a steady rise
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
France's exports to Mexico rose from 4.3 billion francs (750
million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 6.3 billion francs (1.05 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1997, while Mexico's exports to France increased
from 2.5 billion francs (440 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 3
billion francs (500 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Zedillo are expected to sign an agreement on
reciprocal protection of investment and a declaration backing the
negotiations between the European Union (EU) and Mexico on free
trade.
</P>
<P>
They will also sign an agreement on cooperation in fighting
organized crimes, under which France will provide advanced
technologies for Mexico against crimes such as drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will address the two chambers of the Mexican parliament
and make a televised speech to the youths of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the biggest Latin American buyer of French products
until 1994, is the third largest now behind Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The EU share of the Mexico's market has fallen from 15 percent
in the 1980s to less than seven percent in 1997. Meanwhile, the
United States has taken more than 85 percent of the Mexican market
share with the help of the North American Free Trade Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Violence Occurs in Israel's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A number of people were
injured in violence which erupted Tuesday in certain parts of
Israel during local elections, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
In Lod, a city southeast of the Ben Gurion Airport near Tel
Aviv, a woman of a political party was shot in the leg by some one.
</P>
<P>
The Radio did not say which party the woman belongs to, but
said the local police is investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
In Israel's southern city of Beer Sheba, the car of a
supporter of the current city mayor David Bunfeld was attacked
and the supporter was injured.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, strifes occurred between Secular and
Ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters, but no serious incidents were
reported.
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem, only partial commercial strike was observed
by Arab Palestinians in response to the call of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to boycott the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has called on Arabs in East Jerusalem to boycott
Tuesay's elections, saying East Jerusalem is an occupied territory
and Arab's participation would weaken the Palestinian's position
in final status negotiations over the city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli voters throughout the country began casting their
votes at different polling stations since Tuesday morning to
elect 161 mayors or local council heads and 2,800 local council
members.

candidates running for mayors or heads of the local council and
20,858 candidates for council seats.
</P>
<P>
The number of eligible voters is about 4 million, 3.5 million
Jews and 0.35 million Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Till noon, the turnout was very low, with an overall 18
percent turnout registered in the country's Arab sector and only
8 percent in Jewish sector, the Radio added.
</P>
<P>
The low turnout was despite that major political parties such
as Labor and Likud joined forces Monday night in a last minute
call to the public to vote.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cast his vote for the Likud
candidates at Jerusalem's Beit-Chinuch School in the morning.

BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan held a press conference here today for Beijing-based
Russian and Japanese journalists during which he expounded on the
significance of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit to
Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will visit the two countries at the invitation
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and the Japanese government
between November 22 and 30.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting between Jiang and Yeltsin, the sixth
between the two heads of state, will be the first "no-tie"
informal meeting, in which they will have a through, free, and
in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations, as well as
other major regional and global issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects the meeting will add more content to
the existing China-Russia strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Russian economic and trade relationship, Tang said
the Asian financial crisis has had an impact for the two
countries. To boost bilateral economic cooperation, he pointed
out, the two nations should make common efforts, implement the
agreements already in place, and seek new outlets for growth
through diversifying the current trading structure.
</P>
<P>
He believes such cooperation can be lifted to a new level,
given the two countries make unremitting efforts.

significance for Sino-Japanese relations."
</P>

relations, and construct the framework for a 21st-century oriented
relationship of good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation
between China and Japan, from a long-term and strategic
perspective," said the Chinese foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and Japan, two influential nations
in the region and the world at large, should make even greater

"So long as the two sides strictly adhere to the Sino-Japanese
Joint Statement, and the principles enshrined in the Sino-Japanese
Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and properly handle any problems
between them in the spirit of viewing history correctly and
looking into the future, especially in the two principle issues --
history and Taiwan, Sino-Japanese relations will be able to
continue to move forward steadily and healthily," said Tang.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand was forced to cut
ticket sales target for the upcoming Asian Games on Tuesday as
they are hoping for a last-minute rush on tickets.
</P>
<P>
With the games just 26 days away, officials admitted ticket
revenues for the opening and closing ceremonies were a mere 60
million baht (1.6 million dollars), miles apart from a planned
250 million baht.
</P>
<P>
"I admitted that sales were far below the target, which
worried the committee," said Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai
Rattakul who also chairs the Games organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"But I think that we can boost sales in the last minutes,"
added Bhichai.
</P>
<P>
Forecast ticket sales for the ceremonies have been revised
down to 200 million baht, from 250 million, said ticketing
committee official Kiatisak Wongpanich.
</P>
<P>
Kiatisak said overall sales for the entire games will reach a
mere 260 million baht, down from an earlier estimate of 312
million baht.
</P>
<P>
Tickets have been on sale across the region for the December
6-20 games, featuring 38 sports and 43 countries, since last
month.
</P>
<P>
Though shrugging off fears that Asia's financial crisis would
overshadow the event, they had played down their target to make
even instead of turning a profit from the games.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Committed to Sustainable Forestry Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is committed to
achieving a sustainable forestry management, Deputy Primary
Industries Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the objective of sustainable forestry in 2000, the
Forestry Department is taking steps to determine a forestry
management unit, to legislate a sustainable forestry management
indicator and criteria and to continue reforestation activity in
each state which has the capability to increase productivity, he
told reporters after officiating a workshop on Forestry Policy in
Serdang near here, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said although efforts were being actively carried out to
achieve a sustainable forestry in 2000, the government is still
facing problems and challenges like decreasing overseas markets
for timber which has directly affected forestry activity in the
country.
</P>
<P>
To increase the competitiveness and standards of sustainable
forestry, he said the Malaysian government has approved 40 million
ringgit (about 10.526 million U.S. dollars) to undertake research
concerning the management of sustainable forest, using returns
from collection of levy.
</P>
<P>
He said to enhance the usage of information technology in
forestry management, the government with the cooperation of the
European Union is implementing a project which would take two
years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is rich in forestry resources. Last year, exports of
timber products totaled 14.7 billion ringgit (about 3.868 billion
U.S. dollars), a 4.2 percent increase over the previous year's
exports of 14.1 billion ringgit (about 3.71 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Adjust Ratable Values for All Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's top financial
official announced Tuesday that the government will conduct
an immediate revaluation for all properties so as to adjust
rentals to the downfall of property market.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Donald Tsang said Tuesday that the Rating and Valuation
Department will carry out the general revaluation in the next few
months, and revised ratable values will take effect from April 1,
1999 based on rental values as at October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Tsang explained that the present ratable values, which take
July 1, 1996 as the reference date, no longer reflect the actual
rentals since the Asian financial storm has drastically brought
down property values in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary expected that the new ratable values
will generally be lower than the current level, but he refused to
confirm how much before the revaluation results become available.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has decided to conduct the
revaluation on an annual basis so as to reflect more precisely the
actual ratable values of properties.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Announces New Rule on Foreign Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai has issued a new decree on regulations concerning the
management of borrowing and repaying foreign debts, an official
report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new decree, overseas borrowings by businesses,

will be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The decree is aimed at tightening the control over offshore
borrowings to ensure foreign funds are used properly, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of the Ministry of Planning and Investment
for the overall planning of foreign borrowings by both the state

</P>
<P>
"A strong point of the new decree is that the responsibilities
of relevant ministries in supervising foreign borrowings is
clarified," said Truong Thai Phuong, head of the External Finance
Department under the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
She said regulations on guarantees for borrowing by enterprises

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Seek Lifting of All U.S. Sanctions: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif will seek the lifting of all sanctions against
Pakistan during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
month, including the repeal of the U.S. Pressler Amendment which
bans arms supply to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz in an interview
Monday with Pakistan Television Station on Pakistani-U.S.
relations in the backdrop of the prime minister's visit to
Washington early December.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the belief that the economic sanctions against
Pakistan are in the process of being removed, Aziz called for the
lifting of all sanctions against Pakistan, both military and
economic.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no justification for
these sanctions and particularly (that) on weapons because our
F-16s are stuck up for the last so many years and we have neither
got our money nor planes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan signed a contract for the purchase of 28 F-16 fighters
in September 1989 at the cost of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the United States passed in October 1990 the Pressler
Amendment to ban arms supply to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"But our main objectives in the meeting between the prime
minister and President Clinton would be to also seek the repeal of
the Pressler Amendment as well as the removal of and the
relaxation of military sanctions so that the issue of F-16s and
the issue of other spare parts can be automatically resolved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that one should not pin too high hopes because the
issues are rather complex and can only be solved through a series
of continuing dialogues.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Rival Parties Seek Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean ruling and
opposition parties agreed on Tuesday to end a long-time strife
that had dominated the country's politics since President Kim
Dae-jung took office in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The six-point agreement was reached after a two-hour meeting,
the first one between Kim Dae-jung, who is the head of the ruling
National Congress for New Politics, and Lee Hoi-chang, the leader
of the opposition Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed to make joint efforts to ease regional
rivalry, pass reform bills and other legislation proposals during
the current Assembly session and amend political reform bills.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to avoid wasteful political contentions with a view
to overcoming difficulties faced by the nation and restore mature
politics through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of mutual
understanding and cooperation between the ruling and opposition
parties," the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the parties in office and in position
had been strained since the President's inauguration in February
and further deteriorated over prosecutors' investigation in
scandals such as the alleged border shootout plot and illegal
raising of funds before last year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a ruling-opposition joint consultation
forum against the economic crisis will be established.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which called for a "productive operation" of the
National Assembly and more talks between the parties, also set
December 8 this year as the date for starting the planned
parliamentary hearings on economic mismanagement by the government
led by former President Kim Young-sam.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Two weeks after the arrival of the hurricane Mitch in
Central America, the European Union (EU) announced having already
sent some 70 million ECUs (about 77 million U.S. dollars) of aid
and is ready to send more. The foreign ministers of the 15 EU
countries met on Monday in Brussels discussed a reconstruction
plan of Honduras and Nicaragua. France, which has sent 25 million
francs (about 4.2 million U.S. dollars) of aid, has called for an
alleviation of the debt of the countries struck by hurricane.
</P>
<P>
-- Line after line, stone after stone and vault after vault,
German youths have constructed on computers what the generations
of their parents and grand-parents destroyed. Before the
computers of the technology univerity of Darmstadt, south of
Frankfurt-on-the Mein, a group of students of architecture have
undertaken the "reconstruction" of the synagogues ravaged by the
Nazis and have "reconstructed" three synagogues of Frankfurt,
which one can visit on the website of the university.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- As the consequence of the Russian economic crisis, the dozen
Russian barons of finance and energy who once made cloud and rain
over the Kremlin, are in full decline. Among them is Vladimir
Goussinski, founder of the "Most" bank and nicknamed "Murdoch" of
Russia. One of the tycoons admitted that they themselves have
triggered the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
-- German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder has declined an
invitation by French President Jacques Chirac for attending a
ceremony memorizing the French and German soldiers killed in the
last battle of World War I in Vrigne-Meuse. For the Germans, World
War I belongs to the past and what cannot be got around is the
Holocaust during World War II, which Shroeder called on the
Germans not to forget at a ceremony Monday marking the "Crystal
Night" attacks by Nazis against Jews.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Stock Prices Down Due to Yen's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Seoul stock prices Tuesday
dropped 4.9 percent due to heavy selling by foreign investors
following the yen's tumble to the 120-yen range against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
The composite Korea Stock Price Index nosedived 21.21 points
from the previous day to close at 403.24 points.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the sharp decline, the turnover reduced to 184.5
million shares worth 826 billion won (some 6.5 billion
U.S. dollars). Losers outnumber winners 559 to 271 with 52 issues
remaining flat.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners expanded their selling orders because of the yen's
sharp fall. Their selling centered on companies whose profits are
closely linked with the movement of the yen, such as Samsung Heavy
Industries and Daewoo Heavy Industry, said dealers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock sentiment was further undercut amid talks that
top-tier domestic banks, which took over ailing commercial banks,
might be downgraded by international credit rating agencies, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to fall further amid concern over the
unstable yen against the greenback, but it may rebound if the yen
stabilizes, said analysts.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker After Offshore Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) --The Australian dollar
retreated Tuesday to close lower as more offshore interests sold
to get out of long positions.
</P>
<P>
Paul Macarounas, senior manager of foreign exchange at NM
Rothschild &AMP; Sons, said the currency was weaker after aggressive
selling of both the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen by
Japanese institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 62.93 U.S. cents from 63.38 at
close of local trade Monday.
</P>
<P>
It traded in a range of around 80 basis points, falling to a
low of 62.89 and a high of 63.70 on the day.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said market expectation was for the Australian
dollar to continue to rally after the release of the Reserve Bank
of Australia's statement Monday, which served to end speculation
over a possible easing in monetary policy in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar opened higher Tuesday at 63.66 U.S. cents
on this expectation but was forced lower after later selling.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 76.86
Japanese yen from 75.74 and 1.0625 German marks from 1.0624.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania House Upholds Civil Servants' Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) - The Tanzanian Parliament
has rejected a government bill for extending the retirement age
for civil servants from current 55 to 60, claiming that would
enable seniors to seek personal gains.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly, quoted by local media on
Tuesday, argued that there are many energetic and educated youths
and the extension of the retirement age would frustrate their
employment and promotion in public service.
</P>
<P>
Debating the Government Pensions Bill 1998, the MPs said at
the parliament house in central city of Modoma that the extension
would only favor some veteran civil servants for their private
benefits.
</P>
<P>
"If the government thinks some of the civil servants are still
needed above 55, then it should advise them to engage in the
informal sectors," they said.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawing the bill, which was tabled last Friday, Finance
Minister Daniel Yona told the House Monday that such an extension
was aimed to tap the expertise and experience of senior civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
"Some professionals like medical practitioners spent many
years schooling and needed more time to practice what they
learnt," he said. "Meanwhile, life expectancy for Tanzanians has
increased."
</P>
<P>
The bill also proposes the establishment of a government
pensions fund under which a servant will contribute five percent
of his monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye also regretted over the
rejection, saying that the government will work afresh on the
bill before enabling it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to create a consolidated fund to pay benefits to
retired civil servants," Sumaye explained.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Lower in Line With U.S. Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares headed
lower for the second consecutive session Tuesday, breaking the
upward trend of the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was led downward largely by a slip on
Wall Street overnight.
</P>
<P>
"It was the second down day in about two weeks, so was nothing
too dramatic, following the second down day in about two or three
weeks in the U.S.," Scott Mitchell of Macquarie Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 6.7 points lower at 2682.4.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall drop, Mitchell said there was little clear
direction to the market with sectors such as gold suffering
noticeable falls while others including retail surged upward.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index shed 14.8 points to 1070.1 while the
all industrials index added 0.2 to 4687.2.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were mixed Tuesday. The banking subindex ended
55.0 points higher at 5862.8. Much of the rise in the subindex was
fueled by a 39 cent gain in National Australia Bank's rise.
</P>
<P>
Westpac also rose six cents while Commonwealth dropped 26
cents.
</P>
<P>
Topping the turnover in the market was zinc miner Pasminco Ltd
after two large trades by stockbroker Salomon Smith Barney. The
total volume of Pasminco shares traded stood at 20.30 million,
worth 27.06 million Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, market heavyweight News Corp fell with its ordinary
shares losing 20 cents and its preferred shares off 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications group Telstra was steady.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were also weaker following a 0.40 U.S. cent decline
in the price of gold bullion in the U.S. after an even bigger
decline the previous day. The gold index lost 23.2 points to
1166.0.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 339.87 million shares valued at 1.12
billion Australian dollars (705.60 million U.S. dollars) with 484
rises, 556 falls and 389 stocks steady.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Up Constitution Debate Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has appointed a 25-member Constitution Debate
Committee to collate Nigerians' input into the 1995 draft
constitution before its promulgation.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Abubakar, Mohammed
Haruna, said the committee would be headed by Justice Niki Tobi
of the Court of Appeal, and would be inaugurated Wednesday in
Abuja, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 draft constitution was worked out by the
Constitutional Conference from June 1994 to June 1995 summoned by
late leader General Sani Abacha but was never published.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the constitution includes a rotational
presidency between Nigeria's six geo-political zones and a
multi-party system.
</P>
<P>
It also asked Abacha to hand over to a elected civilian
president but provided no date for him do so, for which it was
accused of being used by Abacha to perpetuate his rule.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his succession to Abacha in June 1998, General
Abubakar has promised to publish the 1995 draft constitution for
national debate before it is promulgated.
</P>
<P>
Though Abubakar has won the trust of many people over his
sincerity to hand over to a civilian government, many Nigerians
have expressed their concern over the absence a constitution,
three months from the expected presidential election in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians have said that they would not decide on
whether or not to stand for the presidency until there is a
constitution out there.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Fall 1.33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks fell
further Tuesday as profit takers continued to sell blue chips amid
diminishing hope for a U.S. rate cut this month.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index closed down 130.60 points, or 1.33
percent, at 9,721.33 Tuesday. Turnover remained slim at 5.972
billion HK dollars (765 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Early profit-taking dragged down the market by 148.94 points in
the first minute of trading, and the blue-chip index plunged
207.27 points before midday but regained some lost ground at final
close.
</P>
<P>
Brokers expected the U.S. Federal Reserve will not cut interest
rate at its next meeting in mid-November, and the Hong Kong market
lacks fresh support to stand firm above the 10,000-point level.
</P>
<P>
All sectoral sub-indices retreated Tuesday, with property and
banking shares both losing more than two percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said today that it is the common responsibility of China
and Japan to open up the future of bilateral relations from a
strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of taking
lessons from history.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks in a meeting with a delegation from the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Yokomichi Tokahiro,
chairman of DPJ Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
The first state visit to Japan by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
at the end of this month will be of major historic significance to
Sino-Japanese relations, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China and Japan should proceed from the overall
situation of bilateral ties and foster a permanent, healthy, stable
and cooperative Sino-Japanese relationship oriented towards the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China(CPC), told
the delegation that the CPC is prepared to further its ties with
the political parties in Japan on the basis of the Four
Principles of Party-to-Party relations to contribute to the
growth of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tokahiro said that Japan-China ties have entered a historic
moment. President Jiang's visit to Japan will have an important
impact on bilateral relations and on peace and development in
Asia and the world as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side hopes that President Jiang's Japan tour
will enable the two countries to forge a friendly partnership
of peace geared to the 21st century, Tokahiro said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Taiwan issue belongs to China's
internal affair and the Japanese side should strictly abide by
the principles set out in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Tokahiro continued that Japan will look into the future on the
basis of facing up and introspecting the past and strengthen the
exchange and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He told Hu that the DPJ will continue to work for the constant
development of Japanese-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here at the invitation of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows Full Support for Sugar Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has thrown his full support behind a sugar project in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, amid the country's recent
sugar supply shortfall.
</P>
<P>
A Presidential Palace news release said Tuesday that the
president described the Moroland Sugar Integrated Project as one
of his administration's flagship programs and hoped it would help
prod the country into "a major player in the global sugar
industry."
</P>
<P>
The project was started in 1996, following the signing of a
peace agreement between the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), a former rebel guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
As a joint venture, it was sponsored by the MNLF-backed MSC
Group, the Swiss-based CAM Food Industries and the Southern
Philippines Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expected the project would boost government peace
initiatives in the south by providing jobs to former Muslim
secessionist rebels, including 3,500 former MNLF combatants.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the foreign firms which invested in the project
that they would be rewarded well for their renewed confidence in
the Philippine economy.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Considers New Camp for Congo (K) Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
refugee agency officials working in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region
said on Tuesday that they are considering to use another camp to
accommodate people fleeing fightings in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Jean Durieux, head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) sub-office in Kigoma, expressed fears that the Nyarugusu
Camp in the region which has a holding capacity of 50,000 will be
full soon.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in the camp, some 160 kilometers
northwest of the Kigoma town, has reached 44,000 and is still
increasing by hundreds with each passing day, he spoke to Xinhua
from Kigoma in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official revealed that plans are underway to use the
Lugufu Camp in the Kigoma district of the region for new
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Both camps have been providing shelter to refugees who fled
Congo (K), the former Zaire, since late 1996 when Laurent Kabila
began to fight against late President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of them was suspended early August this year
after eruption of a new war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The Lugufu camp currently has 8,000 refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 14,000 refugees from Congo (K) have fled into
Tanzania since rebels rose up against President Kabila on August
2.
</P>
<P>
After crossing Lake Tanganyika by boats into the Kigoma
Region, they were registered at the Kigoma town and then
transported to Nyarugusu camp for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, most of the refugees came from South Kivu Province
and Shaba Province, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in DRC has as well affected the security
situation in Kigoma, he said, adding that more armed robberies
and armed attacks on vehicles have been reported in the region
along with the inflow of weapons.

<HEADLINE> Southern China Expecting Good Late Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Southern China is expecting a
good harvest of late rice thanks to high temperatures and good
sunshine and rainfall since autumn, which have been good for
pollination and the drying of the drop, according to the China
Academy of Meteorological Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Only southwestern China, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, will have its late rice harvest affected by continuing
drought.
</P>
<P>
The Central Meteorological Observatory says that much of the
country has had higher temperatures than usual in the first 10
days of November.
</P>
<P>
Harvests of the late rice on the southern bank of the Yangtze
River are near completion, but rice in most parts of southern
China is still ripening.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the late rice should be gathered in and dried
as soon as possible to avoid possible bad weather
conditions.

solid backing for the current U.S. efforts to pressure Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Big Money Found from Former Nigerian Head's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
confirmed the recovery of huge amount of money in various
national currencies from the family of late Head of State General
Sani Abacha, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Press Secretary to the Head of State of Nigeria,
Malam Mohammed Haruna, was quoted as saying Monday in capital
Abuja that the amounts are 625.26 million U.S. Dollars, 75.3
million Pounds Sterling and 252 million Naira (about three
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that all the money recovered both in foreign
and local currencies had been deposited in a special recovery
account of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
</P>
<P>
Haruna disclosed that although Abacha's former national
security adviser, Alhaji Ismalia Gwarzo, claimed that he was an
"errand boy" for the Abachas in siphoning the nation's money
abroad, he was yet to account for 8.6 billion Naira (about 100
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that Gwarzo who is now under house arrest in his
country home in Gwarzo, Kano State, had admitted to owning some
property including 28 buildings in capital Abuja, five in Zaria,
three in Kano and one in Gwarzo, which have already been
confiscated by the government.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary stated that the government would decide on
the appropriate action to take at the end of the on-going
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar told the
nation recently that a large amount of money had been recovered
from top officials of the Abacha regime and promised to disclose
the amount recovered in due course.

<HEADLINE> Australians Claim World-First in Dengue Fever Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists said
Tuesday they had achieved a world-first in dengue fever control
using a biological method against the mosquito that spreads it.
</P>
<P>
In a project in North Vietnam, Brian Kay of Australia's
Queensland Institute of Medical Research said Tuesday at the
Control of Communicable Diseases Conference in Canberra that he
had wiped out the Aedes Aegypti mosquito in one village selected
as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Kay and John Aaskov of Queensland University of Technology are
using a microscopic shrimp called a copepod to feed on the
mosquito larvae which breeds in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
However, the success of the project hinges on the participation
of villagers in maintaining high levels of the little predator and
in recycling old tyres and other rubbish which otherwise become
mosquito breeding grounds, Kay said.
</P>
<P>
His report on the successful eradication in a village of 400
people about 30 km from Hanoi has been published in the journal of
the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The project has now expanded to cover 11,000 households in
three provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kay said it appeared to have reduced the incidence of dengue
fever this season.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are now underway to use the copepod technique in
Laos and Cambodia as well.
</P>
<P>
Aaskov said he was developing a cheap diagnostic test for
dengue which could eventually be manufactured locally.

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with U.S. Senator Conrad Burns here today, expressed his
admiration for Burns' efforts to promote Sino-US trade links.
</P>
<P>
Although bilateral ties have had their ups and downs since
diplomatic ties were established, Qian said, they have advance
continuously on the whole, as have trade links.
</P>

With the increase in China's reforms and opening up and the
growth in the economy, the areas of cooperation will also grow, he
said.

Burns said he is glad to see the development of bilateral ties
and hopes that cooperation between the U.S. and China in many
fields like trade will continue to grow, and that problems in
bilateral trade should be settled through cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Begin HIV Vaccine Trial Later This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists will
soon start a trial on HIV-infected patients to test a technique
which they say could lead to the first viable vaccine against the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Australian National University (ANU), the Commonwealth of
Scientific, Industrial Research Organization and Melbourne-based
MacFarlane Burnet Center are collaborating on the vaccine
developed by the university's John Curtin School of Medical
Research.
</P>
<P>
Alistair Ramsay, an immunologist of the school, said the trial
would involve 25 patients from Sydney and Melbourne using a
modified vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The government-funded trial would run for about six months,
from late this year or early next year, and cost around 630,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said it could take between three and five years to be ready
to apply for licensing a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine works in two stages by priming the immune system
before boosting the immune response against the virus.
</P>
<P>
Trials on monkeys had shown the vaccine gave them high-level
immunity to HIV, the research team said.
</P>
<P>
Head of the team, Professor Ian Ramshaw of the university's
medical school, said that with no cure for AIDS, a cheap and
simple vaccine preventing further infections would be a
significant development.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine developed by the team is based on cytotoxic T cells
and has destroyed HIV-infected cells in monkeys.
</P>
<P>
"By boosting the number of T cells targeted specifically at
HIV, we can rapidly attack infected cells before they have a
chance to replicate the virus," Prof. Ramshaw said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This has emerged as the only successful way of defeating HIV."
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, produced at the medical school, costs only a few
cents per shot, could be administered with basic training, and did
not need refrigeration, making it particularly useful for
developing countries, Ramshaw said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged Not to Have Official Links with Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the United
States to observe the principles set out in the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques, earnestly implement its commitment
on the Taiwan issue not to have any official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson's
Taiwan visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
at today's news briefing that the U.S. must strictly restrict its
relations with Taiwan within the unofficial scope, and safeguard
with concrete actions the overall situation of the improvement and
development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has made representations to the U.S. side, Zhu
said, stressing that China is opposed to any official links
between the U.S. and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the U.S. side sent Secretary of Energy
Bill Richardson to Taiwan has seriously violated the principles
set out in the three joint communiques and its commitment not
to have official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese side is greatly concerned about the
U.S. act and expresses strong dissatisfaction with that, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections Kick Off in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli voters throughout
the country began casting votes at polling stations on Tuesday
morning to elect majors and members of municipal councils.
</P>
<P>
Although major political parties such as Labor and Likud
joined forces Monday night in a last minute call to the public to
vote, the morning turnout in Jerusalem is low.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cast his vote for the Likud
candidates at Jerusalem's Beit-Chinuch School in the morning.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's local elections, also called municipal
elections, voters will choose 161 mayors or local council heads
and 2,800 local council members.
</P>
<P>
The number of eligible voters is about 4 million, 3.5 million
Jews and 0.35 million Arabs.
</P>
<P>
As announced by the election committee, there are 682
candidates running for mayors or heads of the local council and
20,858 candidates for council seats.
</P>
<P>
All registered voters are eligible to vote, even if they have
not received voter's cards due to the Interior Ministry
strike. The voters can confirm their identity at polling stations
with an ID card, a passport, or a driver's license with a photo.
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Interior Ministry is on strike for some time
asking for wage increase.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations nationwide opened to voters at around 07:00 am
local time (0500 GMT) and will be closed at 22:00 pm (2000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Final results will be announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority has called on Arabs in East
Jerusalem to boycott Tuesay's elections, saying East Jerusalem is
an occupied territory and Arab's participation would weaken the
Palestinian's position in final status negotiations over the city.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Guard Coffee Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been urged to
jealously guard the quality of coffee to safeguard the country's
leading foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Tuesday by the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority (UCDA) called on all coffee dealers to act
together to protect the image of Ugandan coffee.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the main coffee season, the UCDA would like to
inform all coffee dealers that processing of wet Kiboko or
parchment is the major cause of quality deterioration and it
contravenes section 20 of the Coffee Regulations," it said.
</P>
<P>
Kiboko or parchment coffee should be well dried and storied
prior to hulling. The hulling should be done in factories
approved and registered by the UCDA.
</P>
<P>
Some unscrupulous coffee dealers deliberately mix black beans,
stones and other impurities with the processed coffee in an
effort to increase its weight before it is sold, the press
release added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it warned that any factory or buying store found
engaged in any improper practices that undermine the coffee
quality will be closed, adding that the coffee will be impounded
and the proprietors prosecuted according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The general public, local authorities and police are requested
to assist in identifying such coffee dealers.
</P>
<P>
Uganda expects to export 300,000 bags of coffee this month to
make up for the shortfall in the previous month and the expected
increase in coffee receipts might help stabilize the falling
Ugandan shilling.
</P>
<P>
In October, the country's coffee exports declined to 99,123
bags, the lowest realized in the month of October in the last
five coffee seasons.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Stock Market Predicted to Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock trading in Kenya is
expected to improve if the current fall in interest rates for
short-term securities is sustained, market analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
The stock market will benefit from falls in yields, especially
on Treasury bills, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Equity has not been a preferred investment option for dealers
at the NSE for some time. The lure of high-yielding short-term
guaranteed earnings in T-bills has been strong, as the
government's domestic borrowing continues, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the trend seems to have changed over the past few
months, following attempts to reduce domestic government
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Yields on short-term securities have been falling. The base
lending rates of banks have also been declining.
</P>
<P>
The NSE index, which is a measure of price trends, has shown a
steady decline over the last decade, from a high of 5,030.55 in
1993 to a low of 2,771.60 currently.
</P>
<P>
Only last month, the bourse recorded its lowest daily turnover
in the last 10 years, at three million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
A monthly bulletin by the NSE shows that the overall
performance declined in October, compared with September. The NSE
index dropped by 2.7 percent to stand at 2,734 points, while
turnover fell to 284.95 million Shillings in September.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Leaves for Saudi Arabia for Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh Tuesday left for Saudi Arabia to look for alternative oil
supply in case that the Iraq-U.N. crisis turns into a military
confrontation and Iraq, as Jordan's sole oil provider, cuts off
its supply.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh's talks with Saudi officials will focus on the latest
crisis in Iraq and the possibility of resuming Saudi Arabia's oil
supply to Jordan if military confrontation in Iraq cuts off the
kingdom's energy lifeline from Baghdad, the semi-official Jordan
Times quoted an anonymous official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia stopped its flow of oil to Jordan in 1990 in the
wake of the Gulf Crisis due to the kingdom's perceived tilt over
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's oil demand has been fully met by Iraq for
years. According to an oil agreement, Jordan can import 4.8
million tonnes of oil from Iraq at half the world price in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day official visit, Tarawneh will also deliver
good-will messages from King Hussein to Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz and from Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan to Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Jordan's official Petra news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Iraq announced its decision to halt all forms of
cooperation with U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged of
disarming Iraq until the U.N. Security Council moves toward the
lifting of the eight-year-old economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted last Thursday, the Security Council
condemned Iraq's defiance and urged it to resume cooperation with
UNSCOM immediately and unconditionally, but Iraq has refused to
back down.

<HEADLINE> Flesh Trade, Biggest Industry In India: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Flesh trade is the biggest
industry in India with a turnout of 400 billion rupees
(approximately 10 billion U.S. dollars) annually, according to a
latest study published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Center of Concern for Child Labor (CCL), a non-governmental
organization, said in the report that 30 percent of prostitutes
are children below the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
"We all have become silent spectators of such worst human right
violations," said M. N. Venkatachaliah, chairman of the National
Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The number of prostitutes in India, according to the study on
"Child Prostitution in India, is estimated at 900,000, of which
between 270,000 and 400,000 are children.
</P>
<P>
A television advertisement said that around 500,000 children
below the age of 14 are working as prostitutes, the number of
which is increasing at the rate of 8 to 10 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
CCL said in its study that the demand for "pre-puberty girls"
is increasing in cities like Mumbai, Calcutta, Hyderabad,
Bangalore, Delhi and Chennai and in rural areas on tourist
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Among the "clients", the study said, the youth had fast
emerged, with students accounting for nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Explicit sex education can tear down the natural inhibitions
and defenses of both young boys and girls, leaving them vulnerable
to sexual predators," said the study.
</P>
<P>
CCL director Joseph Gathia told reporters on Monday that "the
current trend of child prostitution is resulting from
commodification of children in the market economy and its
subsequent effect on culture and the law."

<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Flooded areas along the
Yangtze, Nen, and Songhua rivers in China are making an effort to
change their economic structure for development, the Agriculture
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises that cause serious pollution and don't
show a profit will be closed, while those with good market
prospects will be helped to restart production, according to an
official at the ministry's township enterprise bureau.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 of township enterprises were affected during this
summer's floods.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of farming, forestry work, and fisheries to
agriculture will also be changed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to do more to protect
forests and lakes and has made it clear that all cultivated land
developed after 1994 and that developed before 1994 but with a
slope of above 25 degree will have to return to forest before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan and Yunnan provinces have projects to protect natural
forests, and water resources departments are making arrangements
to resettle people from land that will be returned to flood
diversion areas.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese Academy of Social Sciences member said that China
paid too much attention to grain production in the past and
ignored forest and lake protection, which to some degree caused
this summer's severe floods.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the cultivated land that is returned to lake
areas can be used for forestry and aquaculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research institute
in central China's Hubei Province has developed a new generation
of amphibious planes.
</P>
<P>
Li Xu'e, President of the China Academy of Science and
Technology, says that it has the characteristics of a plane and a
high-speed hovercraft and it is expected to become an important form
of marine transportation.
</P>
<P>
It is undergoing trials at Taihu Lake in Jiangsu Province,
according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The 15-seat DXF-100 has a top speed of 200 kilometers per hour
and it can fly two hours without a stop. It can float on the water
and fly in the air with an altitude of one to five meters. It does
not need an airport.
</P>
<P>
Li says that it can be used for commercial purposes, controling
smuggling on coastal waters, patroling borders, and for marine
rescue work. It has the speed of a plane but less risk of crashing.
</P>
<P>
It can automatically avoid an obstacle with its global
positioning system and costs less than an ordinary plane to
operate.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle is produced by an aircraft company in Hubei
province.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Children Have Less Playtime: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 9 (Xinhua) -- American kids are spending
more time these days on homework and organized sports, but less
time on playing and household conversation, showed a new study on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Children's free time -- the hours left after eating, personal
care, sleeping or attending school -- had shrunk to 25 percent of
their daytime in 1997 from 40 percent in 1981, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by sociologists at the University of
Michigan Institute for Social Research, asked parents of 3,585
American children under 13 to keep a diary logging every minute of
their time during a weekday and weekend day.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that school time had increased in all age
groups, but especially for children under 3. In 1981, they spent
an average of 11.5 hours weekly in day care or preschool. In 1997,
they spent 20 hours there.
</P>
<P>
They also found American kids watch average 90 minutes of
television in weekday in 1997. In 1981, they spent two hours in
front of the TV set.
</P>
<P>
The American children under 13 in 1997 spent about 15 minutes
less a day at meals than they did in 1981, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"Major changes have taken place in how children spend their
time," said study author Sandra Hoefferth, who added that
children's lives are affected by their family time crunch.
</P>
<P>
The American kids now have less time for deep conversation with
mom, dad or siblings. They spent an average of 34 minutes a day in
household conversation in 1997, less than half the time they did
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
One major reason behind the phenomenon, according to the
researchers, is the growing presence of their mothers in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
Whether married to a wage-earning husband or supporting a
family on their own, about 70 percent of mothers with children of
12 years old and younger are employed full or part time.
</P>
<P>
The researchers urged parents to give their children more time
to play.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of play should not be underestimated -- it
helps kids learn and develop social and mental skills," said
Hoefferth. "If you really want the best for your kids, you'll make
sure they have safe places to play independent of adults," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Yield Up by 42% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is still on course for
record high tea production this year, with the crop, the only
beneficiary of heavy El Nino-related rains that had pounded the
country for five months from October last year.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield shot up 42.09 percent in the first nine months of
1998 compared with the same previous period, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya also said in its November report
that earnings from tea rose 83.8 percent to 21.6 billion
Shillings (362.4 million U.S. Dollars) in the first seven months
of 1998 compared with 11.8 billion Shillings in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The recovery in tea production arises from both the favorable
international prices that have prevailed since January and the
positive effects of El Nino," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative figure (January to September) now stands at
217.09 million kilograms, 42.09 percent more than that during the
previous corresponding period, according to the latest data from
Africa Tea Brokers (ATB).
</P>
<P>
ATB posted the crop figure for September at 22.037 million kg,
down 0.71 percent over September 1997.
</P>
<P>
"West of the Rift (Valley), some heavy rainfall with isolated
hailstorms and cold temperatures in the first half of the month
resulted in low leaf intake (in September)," said ATB.
</P>
<P>
"Later, there has been less rainfall with warmer conditions
and crop levels have shown an improvement, it continued.
</P>
<P>
"Areas east of the Rift remained sunny with few intermittent
showers in the Mount Kenya district. Crops have been high but
toward the end of the month, with less moisture, have shown a
decline," ATB said.
</P>
<P>
Production is usually patchy in the months of July, August and
September, and the fact that the crop did not appear to have
suffered much suggested that this will be Kenya's best ever
harvest, a senior trade official said.
</P>
<P>
"The gains of January to June will be consolidated in the
final quarter of the year and overall production growth of 40 to
50 percent over 1997 is not far-fetched," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier forecasts have put Kenya's tea output in calendar 1998
at 260-280 million kg. Traders now believe that a figure of 300
million kg was now possible.
</P>
<P>
Rains linked to El Nino ruined Kneya's roads and destroyed
coffee and flowers. The central bank said that production of
coffee, horticulture and sisal were all in decline in calendar
1998.

<P>
CHONGQING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A 28-meter-long dinosaur
fossil recently unearthed in the Chinese city of Chongqing is just
another discovery to local people.
</P>
<P>
In the past 60 years, there have been many such discoveries,
giving them the feeling that they are walking all over these giant
animals that walked the earth 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dinosaur eggs have been found in five places in
20-square-kilometer Yuzhong District. Zhou Shiwu, the curator of
the Chongqing Nature Museum and a dinosaur specialist, says that
all the world's dinosaur fossils from the Jurassic period have
been found in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou says that more than 50 percent of the city's 82,000 square
kilometer area contains a stratum from the Mesozoic era, which is
referred to as the "era of dinosaurs" by palaeontologists and that
dinosaur fossils and footprints have been found in 40 places here,
since the first discovery was made in 1939.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing used to have many lakes and low-lying marshland, with
a hot, damp climate that was suited to dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
There are now 14 complete dinosaurs and over 200 fossilized
footprints and eggs at the Museum.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Challenged by Low Literacy Skills of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Almost half New Zealand's
workforce falls below the minimum level of literacy competence
required
for everyday life, according to an international survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was published by the Dominion Tuesday, shows
that
New Zealand's manufacturing, construction and agriculture
industries are
the worst affected with 50 percent of staff unable to deal with
written
demands at work.
</P>
<P>
It says 20 percent of managers also have sub-standard literacy
skills,
the Wellington-based newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The business and finance sector of New Zealand fares best with
39
percent of employees at the higher end of the scale for literacy
skills,
the survey says.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that immigrants face lower wages due to their
lower-
than-average reading skills.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Australia achieved only slightly
better
results with 38 percent of its workforce having sub-standard
literacy
skills compared with 42 percent in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted executive director Liz Moore of the
National
Center for Workplace Literacy and Language as saying that
businesses in
New Zealand face a "big challenge to improve workplace literacy
levels."
</P>
<P>
"In the last six months there's been a real increase in
employers
coming to us for help," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many wanted to introduce new technology or systems but they
first
wanted their staff to improve their literacy skills, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the New Zealand Government to take "more interest in
the
problem", according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Sustainable Development Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional consultative
conference opened here Tuesday morning to discuss the importance
of supporting sustainable development in the context of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Regional Consultative Conference on Sustainable
Development in Asia and Pacific will also seek to promote the role
of regional institutions in implementing plans worked out by the
U.N. Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the meeting, U.N.
Under-Secretary General Nitin Desai said that in the wake of
Asia's worst financial crisis in years, the emphasis on
sustainable development is more critical than ever.
</P>
<P>
"As countries struggle to restore growth and raise incomes,
there is a strong temptation to throw caution to the wind and
further accelerate the already heavy exploitation of environmental
assets," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
While rebuilding the financial sector is an important
short-term goal for restoring growth, the U.N. official said,
longer term strategic thinking is required that ensures not only
the sustainability of financial markets, but the long term
prospects for economic development, social stability and
protection of natural assets.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, experts and representatives of
non-governmental organizations in the Asian and Pacific region
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is co-organized by the United Nations Department of
Economic and Social Affairs and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific, and the Asian Development Bank.

SHANGHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, is expected to reach its export goal for this
year, offsetting the negative effect of the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, the city's exports were worth 10.09
billion U.S. dollars, up 10.36 percent from the same period of

commission.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a decline in exports to Southeast Asia and the

Hong Kong were up 21 percent, 49 percent and 7.9 percent,
respectively, and exports to new markets in Latin America, Africa,
Oceania and the CIS were up 17.8 percent, 3.3 percent, 15.3
percent and 74.7 percent, respectively.

Technology-intensive and high value added products such as
machinery and electronics are more likely to find a market,
according to Zhu Xiaoming, director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Ship-builders exported fewer vessels to traditional customers
in Japan and Hong Kong, but increased exports to Europe,
Singapore, and the United States by 67 percent to a value of more
than 400 million U.S. dollars worth.

</P>
<P>
Of the three killed, two were gunned down in Nazirabzar, and
the third one was run over by a speeding truck in Nazirabzar.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly holds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A special session of
Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), was officially opened by Speaker Harmoko at the
Parliament Building on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie and 981 members of MPR and the House of
Representatives (DPR) attended the 40-minute opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Harmoko described the session as "a new
chapter of the history of Indonesia's journey".
</P>
<P>
"The Assembly special session is being held as part of the
Assembly's response to the people's demands and aspirations who
want to see an overall reform of the practices of life as a
society, nation and state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lasting until November 13, the special MPR session is part of
the government's political agenda mainly to advance the time frame
of the next general election from the year 2002 to May or June
1999.
</P>
<P>
"We regard general election as the best way for the people to
determine their own future in a democratic manner. Because we are
all of the opinion that one of the important substances of the
reform agenda is how to give back sovereignty to the rightful
owner, namely the people," Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
The general election will be followed by a general assembly of
the MPR in December 1999 to elect new president and vice
president, and limitation of the presidential term of office has
been included in the agenda of the special MPR session.
</P>
<P>
The decree under discussion would limit the maximum amount of
time a president and vice president could serve to two five-year
terms. Former president Soeharto has abused the Constitution's
article by maintaining his post for seven consecutive five-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said this was in line with the spirit of reform, "so
the president institution does not have to go through a
personalization process that leads to an authoritarian and
centralistic rule."
</P>
<P>
The special session's agenda was set by the new administration
led by Habibie, the country's third president, following the
resignation of Soeharto on May 21, 1998, in the wake of
demonstrations staged by students throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Various parties have been at odds over the need for the special
session, with some demanding that it be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government protests continued in Jakarta and other cities
across Indonesia on Monday, voicing their rejection of the MPR
special session.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the session, over 25,000 military personnel
bolstered by 125,000 civilian recruits have been deployed in the
capital. Fifteen warships have been made ready along with six
aircraft and helicopters, and another four patrol boats, in
anticipation of eventualities in connection with the session.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session is the second ever held since
Indonesia's independence in 1945. The first special session, held
in 1967 following the stepping down of former president Soekarno,
elected Soeharto as acting president.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Urges Western Countries to Stop Finger- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has urged the western
countries, which are seriously affected and inflicted by narcotic
drug menace, not only to stop fingerpointing and scapegoating
others, but also to seriously find more realistic and practical
methods to tackle the drug menace problem.
</P>
<P>
A latest official report on the political situation of Myanmar,
issued by the Office of Strategic Studies (OSS) of the Defense
Ministry, points out that "pressuring others to accept and carry
out methods, which have undeniably failed in the past, will
definitely not help in our fight against narcotic drugs".
</P>
<P>
The report cites Myanmar's method in dealing with former drug
warlord Khun Sa, saying that, in spite of all the natural
obstacles and man-made difficulties imposed by the Western
nations, it managed single-handedly to disband his army after his
unconditional surrender in January 1996 and then to have Khun Sa
and his top aides under government custody and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"His troops were sent back to their respective villages to live
and work there as normal citizens, while the leaders were also
given financial and other assistance to start a new life doing
legitimate business," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar government described the surrender of Khun Sa as one of
its two major wins since taking over of state power in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact, the report says, the western world,
especially the United States and the United Kingdom, have
continued in accusing Myanmar of not being serious in the fight
against narcotic drugs, not extraditing Khun Sa to the U.S. and
not prosecuting him and other ethnic leaders.
</P>
<P>
On survey of opium cultivation and production in Myanmar, the
report charges that the western nations have reported differently.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the OSS at the end of
1997, there was a wide gap existing in the forecasts made by
Myanmar and the U.S. on the cultivation and production of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar's related data which were based on ground
survey and calculation, there were 9,751 hectares in poppy
cultivation and 106 tons in opium production in 1996, but
according to the U.S. data which were based on satellite images,
there were respectively 162,496 hectares and 2,560 tons which were
enough to produce at least 250 tons of refined heroin.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no comparison for 1997 in the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report claims that Myanmar has prevented 45
billion U.S. dollars worth of heroin from reaching streets of the
U.S. since 1988 up to date despite cut in assistance by the U.S.
since then.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the first six months of
this year, Myanmar seized a total of 4,927 kilograms of narcotics
including 219 kg of heroin and 4,471 kg of opium, destroying 15
heroin refineries and over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations.

The verdict would now automatically go to the Supreme Court for
confirmation in accordance with the Criminal Penalty Code,
Advocate Anisul Huq, one of the public prosecutors, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Death sentences cannot be carried out until it is confirmed by
the High Court," he said.
</P>
<P>
The convicts would apparently move to the High Court against
the judgment, which had to be done within seven days after the
announcement of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Huq said it would take at least another seven to eight months
before whole process was completed. And the convicts would have
another chance to move to the Appellate Division after completion
of the trial process in the High Court, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report said the government was contemplating
to appeal against a part of the verdict in the murder case,
relating to the acquittal of four accused.
</P>
<P>
"There is every likelihood that we are going to appeal against
the part of the judgment...acquitting four people from the
charges," a government legal expert said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up Jobless Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is
expected to use an Asian Development Bank loan to create a
database on unemployment, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a government spokesman as saying that
accurate data would help the government implement assistance
measures more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The database would be jointly set up by the National
Statistical Office, the National Economic and Social Development
Board, the Interior Ministry, and the Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Plans to help the unemployed included creating jobs in rural
areas, replacing alien workers with Thais, promoting the export of
Thai labor, and expanding or opening new factories.
</P>
<P>
The government would also help keep entrepreneurs in business
to stem redundancy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The labor ministry estimated the number of laid-off people this
year to reach between 320,000 to 350,000, mostly from the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
According to its statistics until October 31 this year, 3,207
of 30,820 industrial and service enterprises, which hired
6,626,139 people altogether, had already reduced 251,504
employees.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government would speed up the use of
construction budgets to help contractors survive. Skill
development training would be held for employees in construction,
production and repair of electrical appliances, security and
cleaning.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Gyrates to Technical Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore economy has
gyrated to technical recession as it shrank by 0.7 percent in the
third quarter this year over a year ago, its first year-on-year
contraction since the first quarter of 1986, according to an
economic survey released Tuesday by the country's Ministry of
Trade and Industry(MTI).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference for the release, Finian Tan,
deputy secretary for industry &AMP; planning, MTI, said "on a
quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis, GDP shrank for the second
consecutive quarter, signaling that the economy is in a technical
recession."
</P>
<P>
Taking various factors into account, Tan said, the preliminary
1999 GDP growth forecast is estimated at minus 1 to positive 1
percent. MTI is also narrowing the 1998 growth forecast from
0.5-1.5 percent to 0.5-1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tan noted growth in all sectors continued to moderate with the
manufacturing and commerce sectors turned in a third and fourth
consecutive quarter of q-o-q decline respectively.
</P>
<P>
Noting the external economic environment had deteriorated
measurably in the past few months and some stability has returned
to most Asian economies following more signs of reform
implementation, the widespread asset deflation, substantial
corporate debt, large reversals of capital flows and weakened
access to financing, Tan said economic contractions in his country
are likely to take a protracted period to work themselves out and
business expectations remain bearish.
</P>
<P>
The following are major points listed sector by sector in the
survey on Singapore economic performance in the third quarter
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sustained weakness in electronics demand and the sluggish
external environment saw the manufacturing sector shrink by 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector registered a 1.1 percent growth,
slowing down dramatically compared to the strong growth of 12
percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The commerce sector contracted by 6 percent, further down from
the minus 4.7 percent a quarter earlier.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sector, one of the relatively
robust performers, moderated its growth to 3.2 percent from the
5.6 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
As the slowdown hit both private consumption and capital
spending, total demand fell by 7.8 percent with 6.8 percent
decline in the external demand and 11 percent drop in domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
On the labor market, employment is estimated to have declined
by 17,900 in the third quarter, comparing with 5,900 in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate nearly doubled to 4.5
percent in September from 2.3 percent in June although the number
of retrenchments eased in the third quarter to 5,900 workers,
comparing with 7,309 in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total trade contracted by 9.2 percent, worse than the 7.7
percent decline in the second quarter with non-oil domestic export
to Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong continuing to shrink due to the
crisis-induced demand slump.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments surplus shrank to 865 million Singapore
dollars (about 527 million U.S. dollars) compared with 1.2 billion
Singapore dollars (about 732 million U.S. dollars) as the current
account surplus rose to 8.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.36
billion U.S. dollars) due to improvement in both goods and service
balances.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Using Euro in Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering using
the European single currency, the euro, in the country's foreign
reserves, the Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Ministers of Thailand has ordered the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand to study the possibility
as the single European currency is set to go into circulation on
January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
A special task force will study the impact of the euro on the
country's official reserves in a bid to help stem volatility of
the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"If the euro proves stable, Thailand will use it as part of our
international reserves," a government official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council also assigned the Commerce Ministry to
set up a group to work with state agencies, including the Foreign
Ministry, to examine the impact of the euro on Thailand's
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a study on the impact on the country's investment
will be undertaken by the Board of Investment while the National
Economic and Social Development Board will join hands with the
central bank to dig into the impact of the European single
currency on Thailand's macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
A combined European Union market is expected to be helpful for
Thai exporters to gain more excess into the market. The single
currency will also benefit Thailand's import from the EU as it
will reduce the operating costs of European traders.
</P>
<P>
However, the arrival of the euro is likely to reduce Thailand's
trading volume with other countries significantly, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Targets Record Low in Public Spending in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is targeting a
record low 1999 public spending between 15.5 and 15.7 percent of
its gross domestic product, Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the streamlined government spending, "the lowest in the
modern history" of Mexico, aims to alleviate the shortfalls caused
by sagging oil prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The government is due to submit the draft 1999 budget on Friday
to the opposition-dominated lower house of Congress, where loud
voices were heard against a government proposal to convert a
60-billion-U.S.-dollar bank bailout package into public debt.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at Mexico's stock exchange, Gurria predicted a
continuing slump in the oil market, noting public spending would
have to be further slashed to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Income from crude oil makes up about 40 percent of the state's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon put forward a 1999 budget less dependent on crude
oil prices, and this will represent a long-time strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the government would continue to cut budget
spending next year to keep its foreign debt under control.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has to pay overdue loans in 1999 while its growth rate
could also slow down, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the country's currency would be more stable and inflation
rate lower next year under the free exchange rate policy, he
said.

COLOMBO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Against the recent backdrop of
several of archaeological artifacts being vandalized and stolen,
Sri Lankan Cultural Affairs Ministry is taking steps to ensure

<HEADLINE> Lithuania to Continue Efforts for Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania will step up its
reform process aimed at joining the European Union (EU), said
visiting Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The timing of Lithuania's joining the EU is not most decisive;
what is important is Lithuania's being a member of this regional
bloc, he told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania will carefully consider the European Commission's
proposals made last week concerning the negotiations on the
country's EU membership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said his country fully
supports Lithuania's bid and reforms for joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU itself also needs to make necessary reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus arrived here Sunday on a two-day working visit to
Finland.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with his Finnish counterpart and other Finish
officials on bilateral trade ties, European integration and
cooperation in the Baltics.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Adamkus expressed his full support for an
earlier Finnish proposal on strengthening cooperation among the
EU, Baltic countries and Russia's northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, including cooperative programs concerning the
whole Europe in the fields of natural gas, transportation and
nuclear safety, will help Lithuania join Europe's cooperative
mechanism when Finland holds the rotating EU presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade betweeen Finland and Lithuania has seen a rapid
expansion in recent years. Finland now has over 100 wholely-owned
or joint ventures in this Baltic country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Delays to Set up First Securities Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's first securities
center is expected to see the light of day late next year,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA)  reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam planned to set up its securities center in Ho Chi Minh
city in last October.
</P>
<P>
VNA quoted senior officials from the State Securities
Commission (SSC) as saying that it is difficult at the moment to
set a definite timeline for the establishment of the center as the
financial crisis is still raging in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had all the necessary conditions for such a center
to operate despite our intensive preparations over the past
years," a senior SSC official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, one of the current obstacles to the
emergence of a securities market in Vietnam now is the lack of a
strong banking system.
</P>
<P>
People's saving in Vietnam now accounts for only about 15-16
percent of the GDP and most people still prefer not to invest
their money in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The lack of goods for the securities market is another delaying
factor. According to the government commission for state-owned
enterprise (SOE) reform, Vietnam has so far equitized 44 of the
178 SOEs marked for equitization.
</P>
<P>
Even if all of these SOEs completed their equitization plan
this year, only a few of them would be eligible for listing on the
securities market, a Vietnamese analyst said.
</P>
<P>
In that case, he said " it would be impossible for the planned
securities center to operate busily."
</P>
<P>
VNA said the government is yet to issue clear-cut regulations
on the issuance of treasury bonds, the timing of bidding for them
and a mechanism for their retail sales.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of these regulations has been frustrating the
calculation of interest on due bonds," an official said .
</P>
<P>
"It should open a securities center only when all the
conditions for it are ripe,' a senior economist said.
</P>
<P>
However, VNA said, Vietnamese economists are optimistic that
the emergence of such a center will come sooner rather than later.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Submits Streamlined 1999 Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government on
Monday sent Congress a streamlined budget for 1999, reducing total
federal spending by 17 percent from its budget proposal in late
August, in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF) demands.
</P>
<P>
Planning and Budget Minister Paulo Paiva said that the fiscal
austerity program targets 41.4 billion reals (34.8 billion
U.S. dollars) for total spending, down by 8.7 billion reals (7.3
billion dollars) from the original version.
</P>
<P>
The new budget foresees an average cut of 20 percent in public
spending for all ministries. Smaller cuts include education, 12
percent, and health programs, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
State revenues will be boosted by 14.8 billion reals (12.4
billion dollars) next year, mainly through hefty tax hikes, such
as a tax on financial operations which will go up from 0.20 to
0.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government modified its budget proposal after the IMF last
month demanded an economic austerity policy in exchange for a
22-billion-dollar rescue package.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the IMF and the world's richest nations put the
final touches on a multi-billion-dollar rescue package for Brazil
in the hope of averting an Asia-style financial meltdown in Latin
America.

PANAMA CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
remove all dangerous material from its military bases in Panama
when it leaves the country before the year 2000 in compliance with
a 1977 pact, a U.S. diplomat said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still committed to totally comply with Canal agreements
signed in 1977 and ready to ensure that all threats to human life
and safety will be removed (from military bases) before their
return to Panama," U.S. embassy trade attache Edward O'Donnell
said after a four-day meeting on non-detonated ammunition

Under the Torrijos-Carter accords, 4,500 U.S. soldiers will

material from the bases.

O'Donnell acknowledged that explosives such as landmines and
grenades would be difficult to find in three U.S. camps on the

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 1.6 billion
yuan over the next 5 years on Poyang Lake, the country's largest
inland lake.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to dismantle 234 protective embankments along the
main watercourse to enlarge the lake's surface area by 1,137 sq
km. Other projects include reinforcing river dykes and
establishing a flood warning system.
</P>
<P>
This will help ensure more stable yields on more than 187,300
ha of land near the lake, even if there are droughts or excessive
amounts of rain.
</P>
<P>
Because of land reclaimed for cultivation, the lake in Jiangxi
Province has gone from 5,100 sq km in the 1950s to 3,900 sq km.
</P>
<P>
This large lake near the Yangtze River has played a major role
in regulating river waters during the flood season. And the
reduction of Poyang's size kept it from playing its role during
this summer's floods, which caused 38 billion yuan in losses to
Jiangxi, an amount that was equal to provincial revenues for three
years.

GUIYANG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 90,000 farmers in
southwest China's Guizhou Province have been given "green
certificates" for technical proficiency since the central
government launched the program in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose was to make agricultural development rely on
science and technology and to improve the technical level of
farmers by giving them technical proficiency degrees when they
complete 300 hours of training and fieldwork in agriculture,
animal husbandry, and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The province has built more than 40 training centers, compiled
200,000 textbooks at a cost of 50 million yuan, and has 3,000
teachers for the job, according to the provincial office of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
About 180,000 farmers have received training, 92,200 of whom
have passed exams and got certificates, it said.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, there are expected to be 300,000
farmers with the certificates, or one qualified farmer for every
300 rural households.
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 farmers with certificates have been promoted to the
position of technical worker in farming, forestry, animal
husbandry and fishery, or administrative personnel at rural and
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The use of improved crops and planting techniques has brought
the average per-unit output of hybrid rice and corn up by nearly
one quarter.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Seeks to Quiet Alarm Over Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema tried Monday to quiet the recent alarm over immigration,
saying the actual numbers of news arrivals did not warrant grave
concern.
</P>
<P>
"I would like this issue to regain a sense of normality,"
D'Alema said at his first regular press conference. "The alarm
goes beyond the data of the reality of immigration. There are
European countries that face much more substantial problems."
</P>
<P>
The message was meant to calm a country that in recent weeks
has seen press reports of undocumented immigrants arriving on
Italian shores or pushing in line at public offices for a coveted
permit to stay.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said there are 1.2 million immigrants who "pay taxes,
contribute to the economy and their rights must be fully
guaranteed".
</P>
<P>
He added that the immigration problem was not unmanageable and
should be handled by the government rather than left to illegal
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather Italy have two legal immigrants who pay their taxes
than one illegal immigrant tied to a criminal operation," D'Alema
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the quota of 38,000 residence permits to be
issued this year was "not a ceiling".
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister said that those who entered the
country before March 27, when the new immigration law came into
force, had a means of supporting themselves and a place to stay,
would eventually be granted legal status, if not this year, then
next year.

<HEADLINE> Fiat, Renault to Merge Foundries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Italian auto maker Fiat and the
French car manufacturer Renault Monday unveiled a preliminary
deal to merge their metal foundry activities.
</P>
<P>
The new group, which will keep the name of Fiat's Teksid, is set
to start operating early next year.
</P>
<P>
It will be 66.5 percent owned by the Turin-based car company
and 33.5 percent controlled by its French partner.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated turnover of 2 billion U.S. dollars a year,
the new Teksid will be a world leader for cast-iron, aluminium and
magnesium components for the car industry.
</P>
<P>
Renault will get its 33.5 percent stake in Teksid via a
reserved rights issue, Fiat sources said.
</P>
<P>
Renault is bringing to the deal four foundries controlled by
its A.T. Systems Group and two other units that will act as
independent companies.
</P>
<P>
According to initial estimates, Renault will hike the capital
of the six units by about 75 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to strengthen the international position
of Teksid, which already has 22 companies in Europe, North and
South America and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The operation will use synergies to concentrate know-how and
expertise in the most rational geographical way, Fiat sources
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of five Central
American countries met at San Salvador's international airport on
Monday to review damages by hurricane Mitch and appeal for more
international aid, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At least 30,000 people have reportedly been killed by the end
of October with thousands still missing and millions homeless due
to flooding and mudslides caused by Mitch, while the region's
economies have been devastated.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were expected to request emergency international
aid as well as long-term assistance for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
They were also likely to urge the United States to postpone its
deportation of illegal Central American immigrants, scheduled to
start on November 22.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that money sent home by the immigrants
account for up to 50 percent of foreign currency earnings in El
Salvador, and to a similar degree in Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Carlos Flores of Honduras, Arnoldo Aleman of
Nicaragua, Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador and Miguel Angel
Rodriguez of Costa Rica were present at the meeting. Guatemalan
President Alvaro Arzu was represented by Foreign Minister Eduardo

region. President Flores said about 6,500 people had been killed
and 11,000 missing in the country.

<P>
Nicaraguan President Aleman gave a "conservative" estimate of
4,000 dead and 7,000 missing in his country.

<P>
Hundreds were believed to have died in Guatemala and El
Salvador while in Costa Rica, the country least affected by Mitch,
seven people were reportedly killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Another good fish harvest is
expected this year in the city of Rongcheng in east China's
Shandong province because of government environmental protection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Though the fishing business in some areas of the country has
been declining because of overfishing, total output in Rongcheng
hit an all-time high of 698,600 tons in the first nine months of
this year, 15 percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, Rongcheng has been a large producer of aquatic
products and was first city of its size to set up a quality index
for coastal water in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The local government has restructured the breeding of aquatic
products and made new regulations on ships and vessels to help
keep the sea water clean.
</P>
<P>
The government has also put 35 million yuan into pollution
control, and the sewage treatment capacity is up to 20,000 tons
per day, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the sea around Rongcheng has been the cleanest in
the country for more than ten years.

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Those people who were scared
by China's places of public convenience more than a decade ago,
now can rest a bit easier these days.
</P>
<P>
More than 870 more modern public toilets have been built since

older urban areas where people live in single-storey compounds
without indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Evening News, in some of the better
toilets there are even lounge areas with sofas.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 of these toilets can be found scattered around
Beijing's scenic spots and along main streets. They bring in about
5,000 yuan in fees every day.
</P>
<P>
Most of Beijing's large department stores like Xidan and

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will announce
his comeback fight at a news conference in New York next week and
the date he will return to the ring is scheduled on January 16 in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
His opponent still hasn't been signed, but South Africa's
Francois Botha remains the front-runner. If Tyson's advisers
can't make a deal with Botha in the next few days, they will turn
to either Vaughn Bean or Denmark's Brian Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be Botha, but that's not certain yet," Tyson'
s adviser Shelly Finkel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finkel said he expects to hold a press conference next Tuesday
in New York to formally announce the latest comeback by the
former heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
How much Tyson will make for his first fight back since biting
Evander Holyfield's ears is still not known, but it is expected
to easily exceed $13 million, an amount of taxes Tyson should pay
to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
Tyson got $25 million for his prior comeback in August 1995
against Peter McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
The January 16 fight will be shown on Showtime pay-per-view.
The fight is expected to be promoted by Dan Goosen who said last

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic gold medalist
Gary Hall Jr. was cited for marijuana use by the International
Swimming Federasion on Monday but faces no suspension-ban.
</P>
<P>
Hall, who won four golds at the Atlanta Games, had been
suspended for three months by the drug panel of FINA for testing
positive for marijuana. However, FINA lifted his three months
suspension today.
</P>
<P>
Two other U.S. swimmers were cited for drug offenses by FINA
from its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Black, the gold medalist in the 800 meters freestyle
at last year's University Games, was suspended for three months
after testing positive for marijuana. FINA did not specify the
date and place of the test.
</P>
<P>
Austin Ramirez, an open water distance swimmer, received a
"strong warning" after a drug test showed evidence of the
stimulant Pemoline.
</P>
<P>
Hall was suspended in July by FINA after he was tested
positive during a May 15 competition in the United States. He
was not allowed to compete in the Goodwill Games in New York last
July.
</P>
<P>
Hall also had tested positive for marijuana during the 1996
Olympics, but he only received a warning then because Marijuana
was not on the banned-substance list of FINA.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez could have faced a three-month suspension but FINA
only reprimanded him for failing to say he was taking the
substance for medical reasons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Scraps Post of Socio-political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Amid a wave of popular calls
for the abolishment of Indonesian Armed Force or ABRI's "dual
function" (military and social-political roles), the ABRI chief
and Defense and Security Minister Gen. Wiranto Monday scrapped
ABRI's post of socio-political affairs chief.
</P>
<P>
The term "ABRI Chief of Staff for Socio-political Affairs
(Kassospol)" has been scrapped and changed into "ABRI Chief of
Staff for Territorial Affairs (Kaster)," military sources Tuesday
quoted the ABRI chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the change, the current ABRI Chief of Staff for
Socio-political Affairs, Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
automatically assumes the post of ABRI Chief of Staff for
Territorial Affairs, Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wiranto said the ABRI faction was ready to discuss
the demands at the special session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) to be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Please raise various demands but we will study the reality,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto conceded that people liked to comment about the Armed
Forces but he questioned whether those comments were logical and
plausible and in the best interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, chairman of the ABRI
Assembly faction, also said Monday that demands to limit the
military's representation in legislative bodies would be broadly
discussed at the special session.
</P>
<P>
Students across the country on Monday piled various pressures
on the MPR on the eve of its special session. In their sporadic
rallies, the students renewed their demands for the assembly to
scrap the ABRI privileges of playing both defense and
socio-political roles and to try former president Soeharto whom
they accused of power abuses over 32 years.

MEXICO CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has decided to
postpone the Confederations Cup from January to August in a hope
to secure the participation of world champions France.
</P>
<P>
According to Justino Compean, president of the local
organizing committee of 1999 Confederations Cup, announced that
the event has been pushed back to August.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of the tournament will remain mostly unchanged,
but it is not clear if world champions France will participate or
not.
</P>
<P>
France announced last month that they decided to pull out of
the event after many European clubs and domestic leagues made it
clear they didn't want to release their French players for the
event.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Zhejiang Keen on Technological Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 197,000 farmers in east
China's Zhejiang Province have attended diversified technological
training programs and gained related certificates over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The province initiated a farmer-training project in 20 of its
cities and counties in 1991, and now 1,489 of the province's total
1,841 counties and towns have such training programs in the fields
of agriculture, animal husbandry, aquatic production, farm
economy, and breeding and cultivation.
</P>
<P>
A local agricultural official said that farmers in many
developed countries such as the United States must have
certificates of related technological training and most of them
are university graduates.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of modernized agriculture, China should
promote the education of farmers and provide them with up-to-date
agricultural techniques, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The province is carrying out profitable policies for farmland
development and agricultural promotion projects, while helping
arrange bank loans for local farmers who attend training programs
and obtain their certificates, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Scientist: Drugs War Faces Defeat Without Blood Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's leading drug
testers warned on Monday that International sport's war on drugs
is facing a defeat if blood testing is not in force by the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to local report on Monday, Professor David Cowan,
head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accredited
laboratory in London, fears certain drugs are being used by
athletes in the knowledge they cannot be detected by existing
testing methods involving urine analysis.
</P>
<P>
"By 2000, unless we are testing blood, we haven't got a
chance," Cowan told an anti-doping conference in Dublin organised
by the Olympic Committee of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Cowan, who supervised the establishment of the eight million
U.S.dollars drug testing centre in Kuala Lumpur used at the
recent Commonwealth Games, has also been involved in recent
research to discover an acceptable test for substances such as
Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
He said a three million U.S. dollars research project, funded
by the IOC and the European Union, has discovered reliable blood
tests for EPO and HGH.
</P>
<P>
Cowan said he hoped the tests will be accepted when the IOC
stages an international symposium on drugs in Switzerland next
February.
</P>
<P>
EPO and HGH are believed to be in widespread use throughout
international sport.
</P>
<P>
Also at the Dublin conference, Dr Jim McDaid, Ireland's sports
minister, announced plans to introduce legislation to jail
athletes caught using performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"If I can find the means within Irish law, I will not hesitate
to apply criminal sanctions, including jail terms, to those who
contaminate sport with drugs," McDaid announced.

<HEADLINE> Casiraghi to Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea's Italian striker
Pierluigi Casiraghi will undergo a surgery on Tuesday after a
serious leg injury on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Casiraghi tore knee ligaments and damaged nerves in his leg in
a collision with West Ham goalkeeper Shaka Hislop during
Chelsea's 1-1 Premier League draw.
</P>
<P>
The former Italy international was left screaming in pain as
medical staff took more than five minutes to treat and stretcher
him from the pitch.
</P>
<P>
He spent Sunday night in London's Charing Cross Hospital and
had a scan on Monday. Media reports said the injury could take up
to six months to heal but the club had no comment until after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
"He was in an awful mess," said Chelsea captain Dennis Wise.
West Ham defender Neil Ruddock said: "It was not nice to see.
His face was contorted with pain."
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old joined Chelsea from Lazio for 5.4 million
pounds (8.99 million U.S. dollars) in the summer but a
combination of injury and coach Gianluca Vialli's rotation policy
meant he has barely played a full game.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Monday announced the approval of a 16 million U.S.
dollar loan under its emergency post-conflict assistance policy
for Sierra Leone to back its economic program for 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
The 1998/99 program, which started on July 1, this year, aims
at promoting a resumption of economic growth, reducing financial
imbalance, and continuing to normalize relations with external
creditors. Real GDP is expected to rise by only 0.7 percent in
1998 and by 5.9 percent in 1999, after falling by 20.2 percent in
1997. The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation is targeted to
fall to 6.0 percent by the end of 1999 from 43.5 percent in the
last quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone joined the IMF in September 1962. Its quota is
about 108 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing
currently totals some 173 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq Could Quickly Revive Arsenals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) said Monday that Iraq could quickly
rebuild its chemical and biological arsenals if international arms
inspections ceased.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has "the capability to quickly resurrect weapons of mass
destruction production absent U.N. sanctions," the CIA told the
U.S. Congress in a report.
</P>
<P>
Although the report predates the latest flurry of activity
involving Iraq, a U.S. intelligence official said Monday that the
assessment reflects the agency's current thinking.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials are debating whether continued
inspections or an open-ended threat of military force can root out
Iraq's suspected secret weapons cache.
</P>
<P>
Despite years of U.N. inspections and the destruction wrought
by the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq retains the key equipment and
technology needed to make chemical and biological weapons and
mount them on missiles, according to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq could retain a small force of Scud-type missiles, a small
stockpile of chemical and biological munitions, and the capability
to quickly resurrect weapons of mass destruction production absent
U.N. sanctions" and international inspections, the CIA wrote.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "continues to withhold information about (nuclear)
enrichment techniques, testing data, foreign procurement, and
weapons design.... Iraq could be conducting covert nuclear
research and development that would be difficult to detect," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessments, also forwarded
to Congress, reached similar conclusions, though the DIA said
Iraq's ability to revitalize chemical and biological weapons
production was limited.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that if sanctions are lifted, Iraq will proceed
expeditiously with its nuclear, chemical and biological programs
as well as the corresponding delivery systems," DIA said.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Iraq President Saddam Hussein declared a halt to
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission that searches for
chemical and biological weapons. U.S. President Bill Clinton's
national security team has developed options for him that include
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
A concern that could rule out strikes is that Iraq might
respond by permanently banning the international search for
illegal chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin sought to dispel
suggestions that the United States was alone in its effort to
isolate and punish Iraq for noncompliance with international arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened in recent weeks is we've seen the coalescing
and the clarity of the entire world that Iraq is in noncompliance,
that this current problem is Iraq's fault," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The blame of the whole world is resting clearly and squarely
on the doorstep of Iraq and the shoulders of Saddam Hussein.... We
don't feel lonely," the spokesman added.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley said Monday he is scheduled to travel to the Middle
East Wednesday to promote regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Daley will meet with the leaders of Israel, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority, remaining in the region
through November 17.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first trip ever to Lebanon by a commerce
secretary and also the first trip to the area by a Clinton
administration Cabinet member since the land-for-security peace
agreement was signed in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
"The road to lasting peace must be built on economic stability
and jobs," Daley said at a news conference. "We need to move from
bombs to business."
</P>
<P>
He plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, Crown
Prince Hassan of Jordan and business and other government leaders.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense that it should be easier for Israel to do
business with Britain than it is with its neighbor Jordan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to promoting regional cooperation, Daley said he
will seek expanded opportunities for U.S. businesses, which export
11 billion U.S. dollars in goods a year to the countries he is
visiting.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to sign business deals in Egypt for U.S.
companies. In Israel, he plans to press for more market share for
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, he'll seek a share for American companies of the 13
billion U.S. dollar project to rebuild war-shattered Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Daley also plans to visit the Gaza Industrial Estate, a
business park scheduled to open next month.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Betters Two World Records in Short-Track Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Only 12 years after practising
of short-track speedskating started in Bulgaria, the country has
a world record-holder, 21-year-old Evegniya Radanova.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend the Bulgarian became the first local skater to
break two world records in one short-track competition.
</P>
<P>
Radanova was first respectively in the women's 500, 1,500 and
1,000 meters at the World Cup race in Budapest, bettering the
world records in the first two events. On Friday she covered the
1,500 meters for 2 minutes and 25.146 seconds and the next day
the 500 meters for 44.690 seconds.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Radanova won the gold at the 1,000 meters and ranked
fifth at the 3,000-meter events.
</P>
<P>
"The competition was very tough even without the participation
of the Chinese and Japanese skaters, who are among the leaders in
short-track. However, this does not belittle Radanova's success.
This was the first World Cup event and the International Skating
Union (ISU) had not envisaged premiums," Stoicho Stoichev, ISU
representative in charge of technical issues at the Budapest
events said.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely happy with the victories and the two world
records," Radanova said upon arrival from Budapest. Radanova
added she was not going to rest but would start preparing for the
European and world competitions due in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The European events will be held in Oberstdorf in January 1998
and the world ones in Sofia in March.
</P>
<P>
Radanova was born on November 4, 1977 in Sofia. She is 1.67
meters high and weighs 64 kg. She skates for the Slaviya club
and her coach is Ivan Pandov. She ranked sixth in the 1994 World
Cup 500 and 1,500 meters. At the Winter Olympics in Nagano she
qualified for the 500-meter and 1,500-meter quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria now leads the World Cup standings. The next two
rounds of competitions are due in December in South Korea and
Japan. However, Bulgaria's participation is not certain due to
lack of funds.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop New Biosensor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from U.S.
Agriculture Department, Czech Republic and Italy are developing
new biosensor that can identify traces of chemical residues in
soil and water in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
Heavy applications of herbicides can leave environmentally
unsafe residues in soil and water. A biosensor is made of a
chlorophyll- protein complex--the green proteins in plants used
for photosynthesis--fixed on electrodes that specifically
measure oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
A liquid sample is passed through the biosensor. If the sample
contains a herbicide, the chemical will react with the
biosensor's proteins and inhibit oxygen production. The
electrode in the biosensor detects oxygen levels and sends the
information to a computer.
</P>
<P>
The new biosensor, according to a report from U.S.
Agricultural Research, instead of using plant protein but relies
on a protein complex from a particular cyanobacterium--a bacterium
that can fix carbon dioxide in the presence of light and can
grow at very high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The new biosensor is easy to use, but also reusable in the
fields. Currently scientists are working on a miniaturized
commercial version, available within 2 to 3 years.

LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Confidence among Britain's
smaller businesses has collapsed to its lowest level since the
depths of the last recession seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey by the Confederation of British Industry

SOFIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Valentin Yotov, 10, bronze
medalist at the World Junior Championship in Spain, will take
part in the World Quickplay Championship in Paris Saturday. He
will compete in the up-to-12-year old category. Another boy and
two girls from Bulgaria will participate in the contest.
</P>
<P>
Valentin will not be accompanied by his coach in Paris. He
also wasn't accompanied at the Junior Championship, in contrast
to participants from other countries who had teams and equipment,
coach Notko Noev said Monday. Valentin lost three kilograms
during the contest.
</P>
<P>
Valentin brought Bulgaria's first medal in the 10-year-old
boys category. This is also the first medal in classic chess
since 1993, Noev said. In his view, if Valentin continues his
fast and successful development, he will become the world's
youngest grandmaster. The youngest grandmaster at present is 14
year old.
</P>
<P>
Valentin said Alekhine and Karpov were his idols and that he
hopes to become a grandmaster soon.
