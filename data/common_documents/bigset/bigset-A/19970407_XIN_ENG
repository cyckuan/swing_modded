provide free access to refugees and displaced persons and enable
aid workers to assist them.

parties prepare for political negotiations over their country's
future."

prepare to meet in South Africa, the release said, "we appeal to
the participants in the talks to fully consider the urgent
humanitarian needs" of refugees stranded in the war zone.

eastern Zaire.
trying to aid more than
100,000 refugees who have re-emerged from the forest, the release
said, noting that many thousands of Rwandan and Burundi refugees
remain out of reach.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Mobilize Resources Against Epidemics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Health
Adem Ibrahim said that Ethiopia is ready to mobilize its
resources in renewed efforts to curb the widespread "emergence
and re-emergence of infectious epidemics" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Adem said Ethiopia should give top priority to the development
of national capacity in the area of epidemiological serveillance
and control of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The remark were made by the minister to mark World Health Day
to be observed throughout the world on April 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Adem put particular stress on hiv/aids, which causes human
suffering and economic burden to society, the terrible ebola
epidemic which broke out in Zaire in 1994, a new form of cholera
(bloody diarrhoae) as some of the newly detected infectious
diseases that are of global concern.
</P>
<P>
The minister also indicated that tuberculosis together with
its association with hiv infection, cholera which has been
reintroduced into countries where it had once disappeared, lassa
fever and yellow fever outbreaks, the meningococcal meningitis
pandemic which, with its "unprecedented gravity" occurred in west
Africa to spread from its usual zone (the meningitis belt) into
central and southern africa, have reappeared in epidemic
proportions due in part to the deterioration in water and
sanitation systems.
</P>
<P>
He attributed several factors including rapid and intense
international travels, urban overcrowding with poor sanitation,
and deteriorating public health infrastructure which has
increasingly become unable to cope with increasing demands of the
population to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Health Day is "emerging
infectious diseases -- global alert, global response".

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Sets Conditions Resumption of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said today that the
Palestinians are willing to resume political contacts with Israel
on the condition that Israel freezes all Jewish settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, Saeb Erekat, PNA's
Local Government Minister and top negotiator, said that Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should stop his accusation of
the Palestinians, adding it was Netanyahu's policy which helped
Palestinian extremists and threw the peace process into the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed that the PNA has been making every responsible
effort to fight against terrorists, and would not tolerate any
violent acts against the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Tibi, adviser to PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told Israel Radio that there is no reason for Arafat not to meet
with Netanyahu, if there is an Israeli commitment to freezing
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said that the Palestinians will agree to begin
negotiations on a permanent status agreement with Israel, if
the Interim Agreement, which calls for further Israeli pullback
from the West Bank, is also implemented.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the PNA will not agree to bypass what should
be implemented under the Interim Agreement before talks begin on a
final status accord between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In earlier March, Netanyahu proposed to conduct and
"accelerate" the final status talks with the Palestinians, which
would hopefully be completed within six months, without exceeding
nine months at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians rejected the proposal and insisted that Israel
first implement the Interim Agreement, also known as Oslo II.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's timetable is quite ambitious, since the issues in the
final status talks, such as the status of Jerusalem, borders
and settlements, are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, it took four months of intensive negotiations
between the two sides just to deal with a pullback from 80
percent of the West Bank town of Hebron.

<HEADLINE> UK's Labor Party U-turns on Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor Party,
facing a general election on May 1, will break with its
traditional commitment to nationalization and embrace a policy of
privatization, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Labor leader Tony Blair will tell
businessmen in a speech on Monday that if his party comes to
office after the election, it will endorse the privatization
strategy and will sell off billions of pounds-worth of state
assets.
</P>
<P>
Blair will say that his government's "presumption should be
that economic activity is best left to the private sector, with
market forces being encouraged to operate".
</P>
<P>
Shadow chancellor Gordon Brown this week will also announce
Labor's conversion to the policy of privatization which the ruling
Conservative Party has pursued successfully over the past 18
years.
</P>
<P>
If Labor wins, Brown will conduct an urgent review of all
government services, land and buildings with the aim of selling
assets worth billions of pounds.
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw the move as the Labor Party's effort to head off
further damaging Tory attacks in the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives had claimed that a Labor government would be
left with a 12 billion pounds (19.7 billion US dollars) "black
hole" in its income, which would include missing revenue from Tory
privatization.

<HEADLINE> Five WNBF Leaders Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Five of the sixteen high command
members of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) including its deputy
commander have been detained in southern Sudan, "the New Vision"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abdallatif Tiyoa, the deputy overall commander of WNBF, and
Juma Musa Degga, the advisor of the main leader of WNBF and their
three colleaqgues, gave interviews to Emmy Allio, a reporter of
the newspaper in the city of Yei in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The five were captured by Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) in an ambush on March 12 in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
This was the first report of the numbers and the identities of
the captured leaders of WNBF. Uganda media earlier referred the
loss of WNBF leadership in southern Sudan as mostly "killed or
captured".
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 high commander members of WNBF, only two
including Juma Oris survived the ambush and fled to Kartoum, the
capital of Sudan, the report said, adding that six were missing
since the operation, two others were killed in the fierce
fighting with their 800 soldiers, and still another has been
killed in eastern Zaire on March 9.
</P>
<P>
WNBF lost its main forces in the battle, earlier reports said.
The five rebel leaders were captured with their 500 subordinates.
</P>
<P>
Juma Oris agreed to form a joint rebel group with the Lord
Resistance Army (LRA) last week, an earlier report said.
</P>
<P>
There were three main rebel groups in Uganda: WNBF active in
the north-west, Lra in the north and Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) in the west. The Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF, part
two), another small rebel group active in the north-west, was in
contact with Lra to form a joint rebel group earlier.
</P>
<P>
lra had some 2,000 soldiers in previous years. But it has only
three detachments with some 200 men each now.
</P>
<P>
Adf had some 1,000 men in its ranks last November. But its
main forces were annihilated by Uganda army later and its
remaining forces devided into some small groups scattered in the
west and the south-west. Recent reports from the west said some
700 defeated Zairean government troops joined its ranks.

<HEADLINE> Makwetu Suspended as PAC Leader of S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Pan African Congress
(PAC) leader Clarence Makwetu has been suspended from his
leadership position in the party, a PAC spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu will remain a member of parliament pending
the second round of disciplinary steps against him, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by the PAC National Executive
Committee, which met in Johannesburg on Saturday to consider
Makwetu's future in the party, she said.
</P>
<P>
The PAC is one of the major political organizations of the
South African black people.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu was given the newly created post of chairman after he
lost the presidency to former Methodist Church leader Bishop
Stanley Mogoba at a national congress in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu was charged with violating the PAC's Constitution by
allegedly dividing the party, creating factions and undermining
leadership.
</P>
<P>
He failed to appear before a disciplinary committee in
Pretoria on Thursday, which went ahead with proceedings in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
However, insiders said the disciplinary committee decided that
in the interests of transparency and to counter accusations from
supporters that Makwetu had been prejudiced, he would be given a
final opportunity to present his case.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Peace Talks to Be More Structured, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Zairean government and the anti-government armed forces would
resume on a more structured basis in Pretoria today, the South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Discussion between the two parties so far had been of an
informal nature, Spokesman for the South African Foreign Ministry
Pieter Swanepoel was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They only exchanged ideas on the informal basis on Saturday
as they were still waiting for all the delegates to arrive,"
Swanepoel said, adding that the more structured talks will start
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel declined to disclose the venue of the secret talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations to find a peaceful resolution for the ongoing
Zairean civil war formally kicked off in Pretoria, the
administrative capital of South Africa on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chief negotiators from the Zairean government and the
anti-government forces led by Laurent Kabila have reportedly
committed themselves to seeking a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, a Zairean Embassy spokesman on Sunday expressed fears
that the current situation in Zaire might not be conducive to
successful talks.
</P>
<P>
He said attempts by a coalition of opposition parties to
remove recently appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi could
jeopardise the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is hosting the talks as one of four countries
chosen at a summit in Nairobi last December to spearhead peace
efforts in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who had played a
prominent role as broker, said yesterday that the coming
negotiations would be co-chaired by South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad and Mohamed Sahnoun, special representative
of the United Nations for the Great Lakes Region.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Population Growth Down to 1.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today that
its population growth rate dropped down to 1.6 percent during
the last Iranian year which ended on March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ali Reza Marandi, Minister of Health and Medical Care, said
that the decelerating population growth rate is expected to
continue during the current Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the health minister
made the remarks on the occasion of the International Health
Day, an event that was also attended by President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
However, some specialists maintained that Iran's population
policy is not so successful as the government claimed. They said
that the population growth rate is around 1.8-2.0 percent in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate stood at 3.2 percent on average
during the 10-year period from 1976 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
The assessment of Iran's population is also different between
specialists and the government. The U.N. population specialists
estimated the Iranian population at 65 million while the government
said that it is less then 60 million at present.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian health minister said that his country has also
made progress in reducing the mortality rate of mothers, which
dropped from 254 per 100,000 18 years ago to 40 per 100,000 now.

CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian State Security Prosecutor
General Hesham Saraya has ordered the imprisonment of 27 members
of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood for 15 days pending
investigations, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
These people, arrested during a meeting in the Giza province
outside of Cairo on Saturday, are mainly accused of joining an
outlawed group and distributing leaflets in an anti-government
campaign to shake national security.
</P>
<P>
Investigations began Saturday night on the arrested group,
which includes five journalists and a lawyer. The rest were
reportedly government employees.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest outlawed fundamentalist
group, is accused of backing the violent militant campaign against
the government since 1992 to establish a strict Islamic rule and
is officially banned.
</P>
<P>
The government stroke hard on the Brotherhood in 1995 when
hundreds of its members were arrested and dozens tried before
special military tribunals.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Denies Reports Of US Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said today that the U.S. is not exerting heavy pressure on
Israel to freeze settlements, reported the state-run Israel TV.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opposition to settlement activities is known, Levy
told reporters before meeting with Miguel Moratinos, European
Union (EU) Special Envoy to the Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
The minister also dismissed a suggestion that Israel and the
U.S. are moving on a collision course due to the Israeli
government's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Speculations were widely spread about U.S. pressure on Israel
as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu left Israel this morning for
urgent meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to present Netanyahu a proposal to solve
the crisis in the Israeli-Palestinian relations and get the
stalled peace process back on track. But U.S. officials remain
tight-lipped over the content of the proposal to be offered
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Washington, Clinton is likely to
put pressure on Netanyahu to halt the construction of the Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem, as well as on
Palestinians to stop violence and combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day working visit, Netanyahu will also visit
King Hussein of Jordan, who is receiving medical treatment in a
U.S. hospital. The king urged Clinton to enhance his role in
mediating the endangered peace process during his meeting with
the president in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians President Yasser Arafat has sent Minister of
Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi to Washington, where she will
meet with Albright and Middle East peace coordinator Dennis
Ross after Clinton-Netanyahu summit Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Levy, Moratinos put forward new ideas
for reviving the peace process. Levy said that Europe is
welcome to provide help and advice, but cannot replace the
U.S. in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, the EU has stepped up its diplomatic
activities to assert its role in the peace process in the adjacent
Middle East. Moratinos has shuffled between Israel and its Arab
neighbors for the past weeks. He is scheduled to return to
Brussels Monday for a special meeting of EU Middle East experts.
</P>
<P>
France is also reportedly planning to raise a new proposal
to break the deadlock of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for EU Initiative on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- France has called on the 15 European
Union (EU) nations to make an initiative to contribute to the
unjamming of the peace process between Israel and Palestinians,
reported the Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today said at an EU
foreign ministers' meeting in the Dutch city Noordwijk that the
current president of EU, the Netherlands, should send a message to
the United States President Bill Clinton on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Dutch presidency of the European Union send
a message to President Clinton suggesting the (two) sides fix the
basis for a new departure to put an end to the impasse of the
peace process," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
He said that the basis for a new departure of the peace process
should be built on the commitment by Israel and Palestinians to
respect the agreements of Oslo and Madrid, and an ending by Israel
of its blockade of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the construction of a new Jewish settlement
in Har Homa district of East Jerusalem by Israel, suspension of
confiscation of identity cards of Palestinians in Jerusalem by
Israel, and a commitment by Palestinians to fight terrorism should
also be the basis for relaunching the peace process, said de
Charette.
</P>
<P>
The French proposal will be discussed by EU foreign ministers
this evening in Noordwijk, and again by the EU foreign ministry
officials in charge of the Middle East on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu is on a visit in
Washington to discuss with President Clinton his plan to relaunch
peace talks with the Palestinians.

devastation, and opening a new page of construction and
development in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> UK Issues Guidelines for Magistrates on Traffic Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Motorists in Britain who confess to
speeding or drink-driving offenses immediately are to have their
punishment cut by a third.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the main instructions to magistrates in new
guidelines issued in an attempt to standardize sentencing all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, produced by the Magistrates' association with
the Justice's Clerk Society, give courts charts to help them to
decide on the appropriate level of fines and jail. According to
the offender's level of income -- low, average or high.
</P>
<P>
However, magistrates are not obliged to stick to the sentences
recommended -- and each of the 52 pages in the document bears the
sentence: "Remember: these are guidelines, not a tariff."
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, you will get three penalty points on your
driving license if, for instance, you are driving at up to 40mph
in an area with a 30mph limit.
</P>
<P>
You may also be fined 60 pounds (96 US dollars) if you are on a
low income, 150 pounds (240 US dollars) on an average income and
360 pounds (576 US dollars) on a high income.
</P>
<P>
Magistrates are offered a range of aggravating or mitigating
factors to take into account when passing sentence.
</P>
<P>
In the case of drink-driving offenses, the chart gives the rate
of alcohol on the breath, in the blood and in the urine related to
the length of disqualification and fine.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines urge: "consider mitigation, for example
cooperation with the police. Consider a discount for a timely
guilty plea."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also list amounts of compensation which can be
awarded. A black eye, for instance, can earn the victim 100 pounds
(160 US dollars), while the loss of a front tooth carries a 1,000
pounds (1,600 US dollars) compensation award.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches TB, Leprosy Prevention Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim today announced that an integrated tuberculosis (TB)
and leprosy prevention program has been launched across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Adem called for joint efforts of government and non-
government bodies, international organizations, donors,
religious leaders, professional associations and the private
sector in preventive campaigns against the diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in connection with the World Health Day
which falls on tomorrow, the minister said TB was reported last
year as "the first killer disease" while malaria and dysentery
were second and third respectively on the top ten list.
</P>
<P>
Although TB had never been put under control in the
country, it can be said that the disease gradually relapsed and
has now become a major killer disease after the AIDS virus came
into the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
A policy is being formulated with a view to involving
government, non-government bodies and donor organizations in the
anti-AIDS campaigns, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that malaria remains to be a major health problem in
the country as the disease has become resistant to curative and
preventive medicines.

The official said that the Council meetings will continue talks
on the partnership process held during the five-day visit by
President Hosni Mubarak last month to the U.S., the largest donor

two countries will also be discussed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch Medicine Week in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will kick off a Medicine Week
in Iraq Tuesday in a bid to export the goods to the country within
the framework of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A large consignment of Egypt-made medicines reached the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad Saturday for the week-long fair, Ouny Hashem,
director of the Egyptian Trade Center in Iraq told the Egyptian
MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The exhibited products will be later offered free of charge to
the Iraqi people, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the fair, an Egyptian medical delegation
will hold rounds of meetings with Iraqi health ministry officials
to discuss its requirements of medicines, chemicals and medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also work out a delivery schedule for these
goods, said Galal Ghorab, head of the Egyptian Holding Company for
Medicines, which is co-organizing the fair with the Iraqi health
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership has given special directives to the health
ministry and pharmaceutical firms to obtain medicine from Egypt in
particular, according to Ghorab.
</P>
<P>
The event is designed to get acquainted with Iraq's pressing
needs for drug since the UN-imposed economic sanctions on Iraq were
partially removed late last year.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 20 Egyptian firms specialized in manufacturing of
drug will participate in the show.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in late January, Egypt will export 3
million U.S. dollars of medicine to Iraq. The first batch of the
medicine has already reached Iraq in late February.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects the volume of exports to Iraq to reach 100
million U.S. dollars in the first six months of the implementation
of the oil-for-food deal concluded between the UN and Iraq last
December to ease the impact of the trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In line with the deal, Iraq will be allowed to sell 2 billion
dollars of oil in six months, 30 percent of which will be
funneled to the Fund for Gulf War Reparations and meeting other
UN costs.
</P>
<P>
Then it will have access to about 1.3 billion dollars over six
months to purchase food, medicine and other daily necessities,
which is much less than the annual 8 billion dollars it used to
buy food and medicine before the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President's China Visit Important: Ambassador Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit by Syrian
Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam to China is an important one,
coming at a crucial time in the Middle East peace process, Syrian
Ambassador to China Loutof Allah Haydar said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Haydar told Xinhua that the current situation in the Middle
East is "subtle" and "dangerous" and may badly destroy the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president is scheduled to visit China on April
9, and is expected to meet with Chinese leaders to discuss ways of
re-starting the stalled peace process and what China can do.
</P>
<P>
Peace is a strategic choice of Syria and should be based on the
return of Israeli-occupied Arab land and the recovery of the
rights of the Arab people, he said, emphasizing that "security" is
essential to both negotiating parties.
</P>
<P>
Syria is willing to resume negotiations with Israel on the basis
of the common understanding on "troop withdrawal" and "security
arrangements" reached by Syria and the former Israeli government,
instead of starting all over again, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he pointed out that Syria strongly opposes
the activities of Israeli authorities in building Jewish
settlements in Har Homa in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
China, as an old friend of Syria, has always supported the just
cause of the Arab people, the ambassador said, adding that China's
stand on the Middle East issue is clear and widely welcomed by
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria hopes to develop Syrian-Chinese friendship
and cooperation into a "good example in international relations"
and that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,
will play an even greater role in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> NPC Leader Thanks Italy for Geneva Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of China's National People's
Congress (NPC), Qiao Shi, said here today that he greatly
appreciated Italy's stance over the 53rd session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights, now under way in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Qiao conveyed his gratitude during a meeting with Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Dini said China has made great improvements in its human rights
record and Italy had decided to take a common stand with France,
Germany and Spain, and not to raise proposals against China at the
annual session of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said it is pointless to make confrontations on human
rights issues in Geneva each year.
</P>
<P>
China supported dialogue and cooperation on human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, and opposed confrontation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy is enhancing ties with Asia-Pacific countries,
especially China, and the relations between Italy and China have
developed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said he had visited China twice and seen with his own eyes
great changes. It was a miracle for China to maintain rapid
economic growth while containing inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
No other country could maintain such high economic growth for
such a long time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped China would become a member of the World Trade
Organization as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's forthcoming
visit to China will further improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should push forward the bilateral
relations to usher in the 21st century.

be deployed on the ground in Albania as part of the multinational
protection force will be from the 9th Division of the Infantry of
the French Navy.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse quoted military sources as saying
today that the 2nd Regiment of the Infantry of the Navy will send
500 men to Albania, while the Regiment of the Infantry and Tank of
the Navy will send a squadron of armored vehicles with about 130
men.
</P>
<P>
A reconnaissance unit of the French Navy and 150 other French
soldiers to serve in the office of the chief of staff of the
multinational force and a military helicopter squadron will also
be sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
All the French soldiers will be placed under the command of
Colonel Philippe Roisin, chief of the 2nd Corps of the Regiment of
the Infantry of Navy, together with 150 other French military men
who will make up the rest of the 1,000-man French contingent in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The 850 French soldiers will leave the southern French port of
Toulon Thursday for the port city Durres in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
A French Defense Ministry spokesman said last week that French
troops will be deployed between Durres and Tirana to secure the
arrival and sending of humanitarian goods to the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries have suggested that a multinational
task force be sent to southern Albania, where tension remains high
after anti-government riots broke out in early March.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,000 soldiers from Italy, France, Greece, Turkey,
Austria, Romania and Denmark will join the multinational force
proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and approved by the United Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reassures Strict Euro Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today rejected reports that he saw room for flexibility in
interpreting the strict budgetary requirements for joining the
single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"Three is three.... There is no room for interpretation," said
Waigel.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to one of the five criteria under the
Maastricht Treaty which requires member states of the European
Union (EU) to cut their budget deficit to no higher than three
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in order to qualify
for Euro membership.
</P>
<P>
Press reports in leading British newspapers quoted Waigel as
saying, while attending a weekend meeting of EU finance ministers
in the Netherlands: "I have never nailed myself to the cross of
three percent".
</P>
<P>
It sparked speculation that Germany might retreat from its
hardline stance.
</P>
<P>
Given soaring jobless benefit costs caused by Germany's record
unemployment, there are growing doubts that Germany can make the
grade for the single currency on time.

PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouvahia signed a decree last Saturday on the creation of the
country's first free economic and trade zone in Bellara, in the
department of Jijel 300 kilometers east of the capital Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Algerian newspapers said that the locality of the zone was
chosen by the National Agency of Territorial Management among 15
candidates, because of its proximity to the port of Djendjen and
the existence of a local electricity power center with 630
megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
Bellara is also close to an airport and has highway and railway

<HEADLINE> Ramos Cautious About Return of Former Military Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
here today parried criticisms on the government's cautious
handling of the return of former military chief Fabian Ver.
</P>
<P>
Ver was the chief of staff of the Philippine Armed Forces
during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. He fled with Marcos in 1986
to the United States and recently asked for permission to go back
to the country.
</P>
<P>
"The crime (he committed) is very serious, we want to be sure,"
the president said after presenting as a guest of honor at the
opening ceremony of the First Asian Junior Badminton Championship.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the government is still in the process of
reviewing Ver's cases before the former military chief is allowed
to come home.
</P>
<P>
Ver faced criminal charges and would be arrested upon his
return to the country. However, some people, including Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa, said Ver's return will no longer pose
any threat to the national security.
</P>
<P>
Last week, former first lady and now Leyte Representative
Imelda Marcos asked the government to allow Ver to return to the
country so he can shed light on the assassination of former
opposition Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr.
</P>
<P>
Aquino was killed on August 2, 1983 upon his arrival at the
Manila International Airport after years of exile. Ver was one of
the accused but he was acquitted by the court.
</P>
<P>
Marcos named Ver as the chief of staff on August 15, 1981.
Although the term of office was only three years, Ver held the
position until he was forced to flee the country when the Marcos
regime was toppled in a people's uprising.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Improves State Sector Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China will
take steps to provide better financial services to state
enterprises this year to facilitate the nation's state-sector
reforms, a senior banking official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank will double its effort this year to support
the restructuring and expansion of state enterprises," Chen Yuan,
the bank's deputy governor, said at a symposium on state
enterprise reforms in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen said a national information database for state enterprises
will be developed this year to help with management and
macro-economic controls.
</P>
<P>
The country will also try its sponsor bank system on a larger
scale, given its effectiveness in setting up a relatively stable
relationship between banks and enterprises and improving the
quality of credit with better supervision of borrowers'
performance, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Banks should provide active financial support to enterprises
with good economic returns, good market potentials and high credit
rating," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The banks also need to use their credit leverage more
effectively and more in line with state industrial policy, for a
more efficient distribution of state assets in various
industries," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor also called for further financial reforms,
saying that "the state-owned commercial banks should focus on
offering better services to state enterprises, and urban
development banks cater mainly to medium-sized and small firms."

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Executives from Hong Kong's Swire
Group today started to take a week-long course on "Contemporary
China Study" in Beijing-based Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Qinghua University said that this is the 41st
class on the same subject for senior management personnel in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Qinghua has sponsored a series of China study
seminars for senior civil servants in Hong Kong. Because of this,
business and financial people in Hong Kong asked the university to
open courses catering to their needs.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the university had organized 40 classes
for executives from Hong Kong companies like Swire Group, Hong
Kong Telecom, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the
Sun Hung Kai Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Those taking the course hear lectures by local experts or
government officials on such topics as the Basic Law of Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, China's current economic situation,
state enterprise reforms, and the legal and financial systems of
China.

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.N. Human Rights Body to Drop Cold War Thinking  (Part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It should reverse the present trend of politicizing human
rights issues and adopt correct guiding principles.
</P>
<P>
The alternative representative of the Chinese delegation, Wang
Guangya, was speaking at the 53rd session of the commission under
way in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the reform of the commission, priority should
be given to the elimination of Cold War thinking, the redress of
the currently prevailing trend of politicization and double
standards, and the establishment of the correct guiding
principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged readjustment of the commission's membership to ensure
geographical balance.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of the commission should cover the issue of readjusting
its composition to ensure an equitable geographical distribution
of its membership. The Center for Human Rights should be
restructured according to the principle of transparency and
fairness," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, the group of developed countries has been
unduly over-represented in the commission. This phenomenon, which
is in serious violation of the principle of equitable geographical
distribution stipulated in the U.N. Charter, should be corrected
as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Center for Human Rights is an important component of the
Commission on Human Rights. Smooth functioning of the commission
is inseparable from the support of the center," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the center will follow the principles of
transparency and fairness and refrain from deviating from its main
function of providing conference services and conducting research
work, " he said.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that it would "attach genuine importance to the
right to development, correct the imbalance in the geographical
distribution of its staff members, and take effective measures to
redress the phenomena of severe lack of representation of Asian
countries in the center," he said.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the lack of democracy and equality in the
commission.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is also indispensable in handling international
relations. It means that countries, big or small, strong or weak,
rich or poor, have the equal right to speech and the right to
choose their social systems and development paths. Their
sovereignty, cultures, traditions and values should be respected.
</P>
<P>
"However, some developed countries oppose such democracy in
international relations. They launch willful attacks on developing
countries, resort to sanctions from time to time and infringe upon
the democratic rights that other countries are entitled to. They
never examine or try to work on their own human rights problems,"
Wang complained.
</P>
<P>
"Sovereign equality is one of the important principles
enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Equality is the essence of human
rights. But it is difficult to understand why there is no
equality to speak of at the meetings of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past five years, 72 developing countries have been
subject to country resolutions due to manipulations of developed
countries. Name-calling of the former by the latter is also
frequent.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, in his statement on country human rights
situations, a representative from a certain group of developed
countries singled out more than 60 developing countries in one
breath.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to this kind of arrogance, this patronizing
attitude, this practice of picking on developing countries and
brandishing the baton of human rights against them demonstrated by
certain developed countries, we cannot but ask this question: Who
gave them the right to do so and do they, after all, have the
right to do so?
</P>
<P>
"Does the fact that they come from developed and well-off
countries give them the right to play judge before others and
teach others lessons as school-masters?
</P>
<P>
"In this commission, every member state is equal and there is
no such distinction between first-class and second-class
citizens. We sincerely hope that arrogance can be replaced by
genuine equality in international exchanges," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> China Is Looking Forward To Chirac's Visit: Premier Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting with French Defence
Minister Charles Millon today, China's Premier Li Peng said that
China is looking forward to President Jacques Chirac's visit to
Beijing in May, and said he believes the visit will produce
substantial results.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Chirac's visit is "a major event in Sino-French
relations," and that "we greatly appreciate President Chirac's
emphasis on relations with China and his devotion to Sino-French
friendly co-operation."
</P>
<P>
Recently, Chirac said that France will no longer support bills
against China at the UN human rights conference, Li noted, adding,
"We highly appreciate this wise and far-sighted decision, and
agree with President Chirac in his view that such actions against
China should be stopped."
</P>
<P>
Because countries differ in their national conditions, there
may be also differences in human rights conditions, the Premier
said, suggesting that they respect each other, reserve their
differences, and replace unpleasant confrontations with dialogue
on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"China will have various forms of communication and
co-operation with France on the protection and promotion of human
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in recent years bilateral relations have witnessed
overall progress. He also mentioned his visit to France last year,
and described a recent French visit by Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, as a
"great success."

<TEXT>
<P>
China and France, two countries with important responsibilities
in international affairs, both treasure their national
independence and share identical views on many important world
issues, Li said, pointing to the complementariness of their
economies and prospects for co-operation.
</P>
<P>
All this provides a solid base for friendly and
mutually-beneficial co-operation between the two countries, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
As the world speeds up the pace of multi-polarization, Li said,
considering and handling bilateral relations from a strategic
standpoint, increasing consultation and co-operation, and
establishing friendly relations and cooperation for the 21st
century are not only in the interests of the people of the two
countries, but also benefit world peace, stability, and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to join France in promoting world
peace and development, in compliance with the growing historical
trend of multi-polarization.
</P>
<P>
In expressing pleasure with his China visit, Millon said its
purpose is to promote communication between the two countries'
armed forces, reinforce bilateral co-operation, and push forward
economic, trade and technological contacts.
</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the UN Security Council, both France
and China have important responsibilities for world peace,
stability and economic progress, Million said. Since they both
advocate a multi-polar world, improvement of their friendly
relations will help accelerate the world's move towards this goal,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have much in common, and their co-operative
prospects in various fields are broad, Millon said, expressing the
belief that bilateral ties will develop through concerted efforts
by both sides.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Millon said it is dialogue rather
than confrontation that conforms to the interest of all sides.

He asked for dialogue instead of confrontation to solve
differences on human rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is justified that a country has its own focuses on the
promotion and protection of human rights, and takes appropriate
measures in light of its national conditions. It is also normal
and unavoidable that countries have some divergence of views on
human rights issues," Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The correct way of handling such divergence is to engage in
dialogue and exchanges of views on the basis of mutual respect and
equality, rather than turning the commission into a courtroom and
adopting country resolutions against those countries which are not
to the liking of certain other countries.
</P>

"Such confrontation only leads to the escalation of hostility
and estrangement. It will not contribute to promoting, but to

slighting economic, social and cultural rights in the commission
should be redressed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, some countries, in total disregard of the
integral whole of the concept of human rights, have ignored the
reality of severe poverty and famine in many developing countries,
and the fact that the poverty population of the whole world has
amounted to more than 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
"They deny or downplay the importance of the realization of
economic, social, cultural rights and the right to development and
propagate the idea that civil and political rights are tantamount
to the right to development."
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out: "In terms of the establishment of agenda
items, allocation of time, the number of resolutions adopted and
the establishment of rapporteurs, the importance received by
economic, social and cultural rights in the commission is far from
being proportional.
</P>
<P>
"The Center for Human Rights also fails to give adequate
attention to the right to development in its institutional
arrangement and resource allocation.
</P>
<P>
"This commission should take measures to correct its practice
of slighting economic, social and cultural rights and the right to
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the work of the rapporteurs and the working groups
of the commission, Wang said: "Activities of the working groups
and the rapporteurs of the commission should be carried out in
line with established standards.
</P>
<P>
"They are to function under the supervision of the commission
and they are not human rights judges. Their work should be carried
out according to established rules. Their research, visits and
investigation activities should be done in such a way so as not to
infringe upon the sovereignty, dignity and interests of host
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, since they are directly involved in the
implementation of the decisions of the commission, the importance
of their work requires that their normal work should receive the
support and cooperation from all governments," Wang said.

<P>
He was addressing the inaugural session of the regional
conference on "challenge of human development in South Asia"
organized by the Human Development Center in collaboration with

effectively utilizing the great potential of resources possessed
by South Asian countries which were lagging far behind in
different sectors, particularly in human resource development, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Minister Urges SAARC Countries to Enhance Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz today called on the SAARC countries to enhance customs
cooperation which would lead to facilitation of trade within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of two-day first meeting of
the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
countries on customs cooperation, Aziz said the conference had to
decide a number of initiatives and the results of this conference
would be watched carefully as they could usher in a new era for
traders in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the 21st century, the role of customs has to be
changed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the overall progress which SAARC achieved in
promoting economic cooperation is less than expected because of
political problems between member countries but at sectoral and
technical level, very useful interaction has been taking place.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is fully aware of the importance of international
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
With this objective in mind, Pakistan recently introduced major
tax reforms through the industrial revival package, he said.
</P>
<P>
Through this bold move, he said "we have reduced the maximum
customs tariff from 65 percent to 45 percent. The tariff slabs
have been reduced from 13 to 5 and special concessionary rates
will be reduced to the maximum possible degree."
</P>
<P>
All this is aimed at simplifying customs tariff and to make it
more transparent, he said adding the reduced tariff, besides
reviving industry, would lead to increased international trade, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Prevention of Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China should strengthen the
prevention and treatment of Infectious diseases which have
reappeared and pose a new threat to the nation's health in spite
of effective controls that China has developed, a health official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Although the incidence and mortality rate of infectious
diseases has been dropping in general, we shouldn't slack off in
disease prevention and control," Public Health Minister Chen
Minzhang told a meeting in Beijing today for "World Health Day."
</P>
<P>
More than 1.84 million cases of infectious diseases were
reported in China last year, and 3,127 people died of them, Chen
said. The incidence rate was 154 per 100,000 people and mortality
25 per ten million people, both a drop of 7.18 percent from 1995,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, China still has ten million people suffering from
hepatitis, and some 600,000 to one million newborn infants are
infected by Hepatitis B virus every year.
</P>
<P>
The country has more than six million tuberculosis patients,
including 1.5 million who are highly contagious, and plague and
cholera, which have been under effective control in recent
decades, have caused small-scale epidemics in some places in the
past few years, Chen noted, adding that "some new infectious
diseases have invaded the country and will probably cause
epidemics."
</P>
<P>
The number of people infected by HIV virus was more than 5,000
last October, but experts estimate that there are at least 50,000
to 100,000 HIV carriers in China at present.
</P>
<P>
Cases of colon bacillus, Lyme disease, and cholera have also
been found, according to a report released by the Ministry of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
To meet this challenge, health departments will increase
surveillance and establish rapid prevention and containment
measures, the minister said, emphasizing that the ministry will
tighten controls on blood products and blood supplies in order to
prevent the transmission of Hepatitis C and G, HIV/AIDS, syphilis,
and malaria through tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Health Day is "Emerging
Infectious Diseases -- Global Alert, Global Response." The World
Health Organization says that infectious diseases are a major
killer, and in the last two decades, more than 30 new, highly
contagious diseases have been identified, such as HIV/AIDS and the
Ebola virus. Diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, cholera,
and dengue fever have also reappeared after recent declines.

today that China attaches importance to the development of
relations with Mauritania, and is ready to make a joint effort to
strengthen bilateral friendship and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li said that Baba is "an old friend of the
Chinese people" who has done a lot of work for developing
bilateral friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the two countries established diplomatic
relations over 30 years ago, bilateral friendship has been
continuously enhanced, and cooperation with mutual benefits in
politics, trade and culture has developed smoothly and steadily,
thanks to the efforts made by leaders of the two sides and by the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China and Mauritania, as two developing
countries, share the same or similar views on many important
international issues and have close cooperation in international
affairs. He said that the Chinese government appreciates the
strong support of Mauritania to China on human rights issues, and
its adherence to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Li also spoke highly of the Mauritanian government's and
people's efforts at safeguarding national independence and
sovereignty, developing good friendship with its neighbors, and
promoting unity among Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Li voiced the belief that the Mauritanian people will have
greater achievements while building their country and developing
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Baba said that the Mauritanian-Chinese traditional friendship
and good cooperative relations are firm and will stand the test of
time. The two sides have always sympathized with and supported
each other in international affairs, and bilateral relations are
bound to see greater progress.

NOORDWIJK, Netherlands, April 7 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
and Latin American foreign ministers attending a ministerial
meeting here agree that the relations between the two blocs should
be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The two-day EU-Rio Group ministerial meeting, which opened here
on Monday, will focus on political developments in the EU and
Latin America, interregional cooperation, and the fight against
drugs, organized crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
European ministers will hold separate talks with their
counterparts in the Rio Group which is made up of Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Venezuela, Chile, Mexico and Panama.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of EU troika (Ireland, the Netherlands
and Luxemburg) will hold talks with Mexico and Chile.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Mexico are currently trying to agree on a mandate
for wider economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, EU ministers will also hold talks with their
counterparts from the five Andean Community countries: Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are expected to address the Andean Community's
political situation and the future evolution and EU-Andean
relations.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Andean Community links have been strengthened since 1990
as bilateral trade has increased. Bilateral trade rose to ECU 13.8
billion (15.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ties were further boosted by the growth of EU aid to the
region -- to ECU 150 million (171 million dollars) in 1995, 30
percent of it as assistance to Latin America -- and cooperation in
fighting drug trafficking.

assistance to the Selangor and Federal Territory Mentally Retarded
Children Association which planned to run such homes for the
handicapped who could earn income and need not be dependent on
their parents and families for financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The homes could be set up in housing estates, not necessarily
in special buildings, to enable the disabled to interact with
local residents, the minister told reporters after presenting
certificates to teachers of mentally retarded children here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the association, whose 100 mentally retarded
people secured permanent jobs, could negotiate with Kuala Lumpur
City Hall to acquire a few units of flats to convert them into
such homes.
</P>
<P>
There will be no age limit for occupants of the homes but they
must be able to work and foot their personal expenses including
house rent on their own, association president Fauziah Idris said
on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
She said there are 700 mentally retarded children from 12
schools under the association's purview.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Treasury Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China will improve its treasury
bond marketing to increase liquidity and efficiency, according to
Gao Jian, director of the State Debt Mangement Department of the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to standardize the market-oriented tender
approach in government bond floating," he said in a recent report,
noting that short-term discount bonds will be issued through
uniform price bids, while coupon bonds will be floated through
multi-price yield bids.
</P>
<P>
Both multi-price bids and uniform-price tenders will be used,
with the size to be based upon market demand.
</P>
<P>
The existing quotation subscription and bidding will be
replaced by competitive or non-competitive bidding, he said, and
that open bidding will be tried when necessary.
</P>
<P>
He noted that measures will also be taken to reduce the cost of
individual investors in opening a bond investment account to allow
them to buy certificate bonds more easily.
</P>
<P>
China should establish special funds for individual treasury
bond investment as soon as possible, Gao suggested, and that China
will issue government bonds more regularly to increase
predictability.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Gao also said that China will unify the treasury
bond registration, settlement, and clearance system this year.
</P>
<P>
China started issuing treasury bonds again in 1981 and its
annual issue has expanded greatly in recent years, hitting a
record 196 billion yuan last year. By the end of 1995, China had
issued 660 billion yuan in government bonds. Its bond issue this
year is budgeted at 248.596 billion yuan.

LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Five Nigerian soccer fans were
crushed to death inside locked doors of the National Stadium after
a World Cup Qualifying match here, according to the local
newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
And more than a dozen others fans were hospitalized in serious
condition at Lagos' University Teaching Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the five gates of the stadium were opened on
Saturday while more than 40,000 people trying to get out after the
Nigeria's 2-1 win over Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Crowds who were trying go out after the match were unaware the
door were still locked, so people were being trapped and
crushed. Stadium workers who were responsible for opening the
doors had abandoned their duties to celebrate Nigeria's victory,
according to the Lagos Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said more than the capacity of 40,000 people
were let into the game and that no crowd control measures were in
place.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such stampede at Lagos' National Stadium in
the last eight years. Eight fans and a player died in 1989 after a
World Cup qualifying match between Nigeria and Angola at the
stadium.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Head Wants Peace Talk with Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Kony, the head of crippled
rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), wants a peace talk with
Ugandan President Yoweri Moseveni, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alfred James Obita, the LRA's secretary of external relation
and mass mobilization, when announcing the news at a conference
of Acholi tribe in London Saturday, asked Moseveni to first
express intention on the peace talk "in person, not by proxy".
</P>
<P>
The proposed face-to-face talk should be supervised by
international observers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acholi tribe lives in northern Kitgum and Gulu districts where
LRA has conducted a ten-year guerrilla war against the Ugandan
government.
</P>
<P>
Obita made his remarks when LRA and other rebel groups in
Uganda are in trouble, according to a New Vision report.
</P>
<P>
LRA has three detachments now which has some 200 fighters
each, compared with some 2,000 soldiers in the past.
</P>
<P>
Kony has publicly abandoned the objective to overthrow Ugandan
government.
</P>
<P>
West Nile Bank Front, another rebel group, has lost its main
forces of more than 1,300 fighters in its fighting with Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The allied democratic forces, also a rebel group, has lost its
main forces in fighting with Ugandan army since last November.
</P>
<P>
Alphonse Owiny Dollo, the state minister in charge of
pacification of the north, said at the conference that his
government will consider LRA's peace proposal when it stopped
killing and abduction in the north.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Produces 72.8 m Barrels of Oil in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Africa's largest oil producer
Nigeria produced 72.8 million barrels of crude oil in January,
averaging 2.3 million barrels a day, the Business Concord
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the January production is 5.8 million barrels
or 8.7 percent more than that of December last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's export, however, dropped by 10.5 percent or 7.28
million barrels from December to 61.8 million barrels, or 1.99
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a Petroleum Ministry source as saying
that the production now is still within Nigeria's quota of 1.865
million barrels per day from the Organization of Petroleum Export
Countries.
</P>
<P>
The prices of Nigeria's major crude oil products, the Bonny
Light and Forcados depreciated further on the London market from
fortnight ago's 18.77 and 18.43 U.S. Dollars a barrel to last
weekend's 17.56 and 17.21 Dollars a barrel respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sliding oil price is becoming a serious threat to the
Nigerian government's budgetary revenue in 1997, which depends on
oil export for 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings and is
projected on the basis of 17 Dollars a barrel.

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities have been urged
to deal with the death of a fisherman from the southeastern
province of Fujian who was shot by Taiwanese soldiers early this
month.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities will take effective
measures to settle the incident, and prevent it from happening
again.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon of April 1, a Fujian-registered fishing boat
was fired upon by Taiwan forces near the small island of Wuqiu, 18
sea miles from Fujian's Meizhou Island in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinchi, one of the fishermen, was hit in the head and died
not long after. This unfortunate incident has caused a great deal
of suffering for his family and means large losses to them, ARATS
quoted a provincial department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen's family and the local fishermen were quite outraged by
the actions of the Taiwan forces, and urged Taiwan authorities to
bring the culprits to justice and compensate Chen's family for

JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy

</P>
<P>
Mbeki on Sunday took part in peace talks between Zairean

<HEADLINE> Australian Manufacturing Sector Grows Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A latest survey found that
performance of the manufacturing sector was generally positive
during the March quarter but its gross product in national
accounts terms would grow marginally.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Australian chamber of
Manufacturing (ABM), said today, "Given the importance of
manufacturing to the overall growth of the economy, this implies
that national economic growth will also slow in annual terms even
with a modest pick up in activity in the second quarter of 1997."
</P>
<P>
ACM chief executive Allan Handberg said in a statement that the
small increase in manufacturing growth in the March quarter and
the predicted 0.6 percent growth in the June quarter would not
offset the poor performance in the second half of 1996 and annual
growth was likely to dip from one percent in 1996 to only 0.4
percent in the year to June 30.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that jobs in the manufacturing sector
would fall by 1.8 percent in the 1996-97 financial year and jobs
would not grow unless budget and other strategies were enacted to
bolster confidence, investment and exports.
</P>
<P>
The weak outcome in manufacturing meant GDP (gross domestic
product) would increase by about 2.6 percent in 1996-97, rather
than the budget forecast of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"While firms expect export trends to improve in the June 1997
quarter, current trends suggest that this is unlikely to be
realized unless there is a significant drop in Australian dollar
or new export markets open more rapidly," said the survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, manufacturing production would rise by
2.8 percent for the next 12 months while investment would lift by
6.1 percent and exports by just 0.3 percent.

FREETOWN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's presidential
adviser on peace Shaka Mansaray said Monday that the government
has severed all relations with the International Alert (IA)
Organization based in London.
</P>
<P>
He charged the organization has provided links between the

He claimed at a press conference that the group is "a negative

</P>

Western diplomats said the body has provided communication
equipments to Foday Sankoh, the disputed leader of the RUF, to
help him reach his fighters in the war zones and have broadcast
to the international radio network while he is in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Mansaray also appealed to international organizations not to
deal with anything on the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that the IA has been under fire. During
the military regime of Captain Valentine Strasser, the IA was

MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Starting September, the Department
of Foreign Affairs (DFA) will be putting up centers all over
Zambales in southern Philippines to help local residents wishing
to work overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported today that an official of
the DFA Commission on Filipino Overseas said she had already
conferred with several government agencies in Zambales, which will
help establish the centers.
</P>
<P>
DFA officials last month conducted talks with local officials
to work out the details for the establishment of migrant's
advisory and information network centers in Zambales, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the DFA official, several heads of government
agencies have assured that they will help in establishing the
centers in their areas starting September this year.
</P>
<P>
She added that the coordination of DFA with both local
governments and non-government organizations is the first phase in
the setting up of the centers which would bring migration-related
issues closer to the local residents.
</P>
<P>
The centers will educate overseas contract workers,
mail-to-order brides and migrants on issues such as illegal
recruitment and illegal matching of Filipino women with foreign
nationals, as well as the costs and benefits of social migration.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the DFA would also urge non-government
agencies to facilitate the setting up of such centers in the
future.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Mukanyange Joy, the Rwandan
Ambassador to Tanzania, has condemned the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda, describing it as a shame to Africans.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Rwanda was a shame not only to Rwanda but
also to Africa in general", said Mukanyage in an interview
recently.
</P>
<P>
She challenged Tanzanians to take precautions in whatever they
do lest they find themselves in a situation similar to that of
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Signs of civil strife start small but can grow tremendously
and lead to devastation", she warned, recalling that what
happened in Rwanda was a result of dictatorial politics.
</P>
<P>
She particularly admonished that tribalism and power-hungry
leaders could easily trigger a genocide. "Never let one group
rise over the other", she further warned.
</P>
<P>
Events that led to the mass political murders and genocide in
Rwanda were not clear to many people, she said, adding "It's not
because of tribal differences as many people tend to believe".
</P>
<P>
Mukanyange also suggested that the murders were a spontaneouss
reaction to the assassination of President Juvenal Habyarimana,
from the majority Hutu tribe, on April 6, 1994.

"For a long time, the group of developed countries has been
unduly over-represented in the commission. This phenomenon, which

"The Center for Human Rights is an important component of the

"We hope that the center will follow the principles of

main function of providing conference services and conducting
research work," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped it would "attach genuine importance" to the right
to development, correct the imbalance in geographical distribution
of its staff members, and "take effective measures to redress the
phenomena of severe lack of representation of Asian countries in

<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today reaffirmed his government's policy of empowering women,
"particularly those who are in disadvantaged situation in the
rural areas."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the turnover ceremony of high-tech training
equipment donated by Japan in the Presidential Palace, Ramos said
from the very beginning his government has emphasized two
principles of governance -- people empowerment and global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration has been seeking greater empowerment
for Filipino women by helping them gain fuller control of their
own lives and by giving them larger opportunities for livelihood,
education and self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Ramos added that the full empowerment of Filipino women would
also help fight against poverty which is a serious problem in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is known that the donated equipment will be used in the
carrying out of the second phase of a special project undertaken
by the Department of Social Welfare and Development for
disadvantaged women, expecting to benefit at least 28,000
disadvantaged women annually.
</P>

plant and Indol was likely to get a majority ownership, Helmore
said.
</P>
<P>
The plant, planned to be situated near Bom Jesus about 60
kilometers east of Luanda, would have initial capacity of six
million cases a year with expansion capability of up to 18
million cases a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola had three
Coke plants respectively located in the capital of Luanda, the
central highlands city of Huambo and the coastal city of Lobito.
</P>
<P>
After the country's 20-year civil war, only the Huambo plant
remains operational.
</P>
<P>
The Huambo plant owned by the Angolan company Zuid has a
capacity of 240,000 cases a year and its franchise covers most of
central Angola.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Central Bank to Expand Think-Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the central bank, is moving to reinforce its research departments,
expand its nationwide information networks, and get access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The moves are aimed at meeting the demands of the
fast-developing banking industry and financial reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some local observers said that the central bank is attaching
greater importance to the research work and international
information of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, when China adopted reform and opening
policies, PBOC has played an increasingly bigger role in the
development of the national economy and the government's
policy-making.
</P>
<P>
The role of the central bank became even more important during
the 1993-96 period, when the government succeeded in carrying out
its macro-economic control, and cooled down the over-heated
economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the central bank are so proud of PBOC's role in
that period that they boast of frequent visits to Zhongnanhai,
where the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party of China
(CPC), the State Council, and the cabinet, are located.
</P>
<P>
PBOC researchers are often called in to Zhongnanhai, when the
government ponders over making decisions on some key economic and
financial issues, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that to reinforce the think-tank and make full use of
theorists are of great significance for democratic and scientific
decision-making in the government regarding financial matters.
</P>
<P>
According to PBOC sources, the leadership of the central bank
is now planning to implement an overall reinforcement of the
research and information departments.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaoxian, vice-governor of the central bank who is
responsible for the research and information sectors, said at a
recent PBOC meeting that the central bank will strengthen the
research bodies in the headquarters and major local branches.
</P>
<P>
The research institutions will cooperate and study certain key
problems arising from the current situation, he said, stressing
that the achievements of the studies should be applied to the
practical work.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the central bank plans to, within
the next two or three years, build up nationwide data links and
get access to Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, of the over 1,000 universities
and colleges in China, some 400 have opened financial departments
or sections, which have become a major source of talent for the
country's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Chinese studying overseas, who majored in
financial subjects, have returned to the motherland.

TIRANA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Albania decided Sunday to allow a
European Union (EU) mission to expand its activities from the
border area to the whole country, reported Albanian Telegraphic
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Albania made the decision in an effort to restore order that
had been disrupted by a nationwide unrest triggered by a
pyramid-investment scheme since January.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made under a national reconciliation agreement
reached on March 9 by President Sali Berisha and ten main parties
calling for foreign military assistance.
</P>
<P>
The EU mission, composed of diplomats and soldiers, entered
Albania in 1992 under the request of the Albanian government to
monitor the situation along its borders with the republics of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.N-authorized multinational protection force led
by Italy will start to arrive by April 14 in Albania to help end

YANGON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded on Sunday night
here at the residence of the Second Secretary of the State Law and
Order Restoration Council of Myanmar Lieutenant-General Tin Oo,
killing the General's eldest daughter, Myanmar authorities
confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation said that it was a parcel bomb.
</P>

It was the second bomb attack in Myanmar's capital in less than

relic was kept for public worship, killing five people and
injuring 17 others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, raids on some Moslem mosques in Yangon by some
Buddhist monks also took place in March. The religious unrest was
spread from Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, where a
dusk-to-dawn curfew has been in force since March 17.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for NAM Support in Restoring Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Arafat, president of the
Palestinian National Authority, today appealed to the Non-aligned
Movement (NAM) countries to help restore the Middle East peace
process to its tracks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special session of the 12th NAM ministerial
meeting which opened here today, Arafat said that the decision of
the Israeli government to build a new settlement at Jabal Abu
Ghaniem in East Jerusalem and other Palestinian locations
constitutes a "flagrant violation to the international will and to
resolutions of international legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said "the Israeli aggressive measures and acts, its
tight security measures and the military mobilization imposed on
the Palestinian lands are equal to a declaration of war not only
on the Palestinian people, but also on the peace process and on
all those who believe in peace and do care for its progress and
success in the region."
</P>
<P>
In this context, the economic blockades and collective
punishment imposed on the Palestinian people not only contradict
the texts and principles of the peace process but also represent a
catastrophe for the infant Palestinian economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said altering the situation in Jerusalem through
confiscation, excavations, demolishing and building settlements is
a violation of Israel's commitment of what it had signed in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli settlement activities in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East
Jerusalem are null and void, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is the core of the Palestinian cause, it is the key
of peace and war in the region," he stated, adding that "peace
will not be realized unless Jerusalem returns to its legitimate
owners as the capital of the Independent Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted that "no peace can be realized with settlement,
which swallow the Palestinian and Arab land and change it to
cantons isolated from each other."
</P>
<P>
President Arafat appealed to NAM countries to help save the
peace process from this impasse that the current Israeli
government pushed to by providing political, financial and moral
support for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 12th Ministerial Conference of NAM countries, which
opened here this morning, was attended by foreign ministers from
over 70 countries.

Both United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Indian
Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda addressed the inaugural session.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Guarantees HK's Economic Success: HK Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- All key ingredients to Hong
Kong's economic success now were guaranteed from July 1 and
beyond in the Basic Law, Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's acting chief
secretary, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that he believed that China would keep the promises
set out in the law.
</P>
<P>
At the Harvard Business School Alumni Conference on "Greater
China: Myths, Realities, Opportunities," Tsang said that the
reason for his faith in the Basic Law was that the Law was drafted
by the Chinese government over a period of five years with the
participation of a whole range of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the promises it contains are not new requirements,
adding that they are based on Hong Kong's way of life now.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government created this blueprint for the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China because it could see how
successful Hong Kong is today and they want it to be just as
successful, and indeed more so, tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's continuing success will become a point of China's
national honor. Why then should China risk that success by going
back on its promises? I do not believe China will," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "It is no-one's interests to renege on this
promise. The rule of law lies at the very heart of Hong Kong's
success. It plays a crucial role in securing and upholding the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the myth that the press freedom and the free flow of
information generally would be eroded after 1997, Tsang said that
the government would not let these be eroded and again the Basic
Law makes a promise to this effect.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong was the telecommunications hub in the
Asia Pacific region and Hong Kong was linked to the rest of the
world by submarine cables, satellites and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also corrected the misconceptions held by some quarters
concerning the post-1997 law and order and corruption scene in
Hong Kong, as well as the alleged replacement of Hong Kong civil
servants with Beijing officials.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- India's Air Chief Marshal S.K.
Sareen said today that the induction of Suhoi-30 (Su-30) combat
jets from Russia was right on schedule and the first four had
reached India.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing modernization plan of the Indian air force which
includes induction of the Su-30 aircraft and upgradation of Mig-21
aircraft (Russia), was right on schedule, Sareen said while
inaugurating the week-long commanders' conference at the air
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
India received four Su-30 K fighters in knocked-down condition
last month as part of the 63.3 billion rupees (1.783 billion US
dollars) aircraft deal with Russia under which a total of 40 Su-30
aircraft would be supplied by 2001. Future induction of the Su-30
combat jets would include the more sophisticated variants called
MK-1, MK-11 and MK-111 and the bomber version, he said.
</P>
<P>
The long-range, deep penetration supersonic Suhoi jets can
carry an enormous eight tons of armaments and rockets and can fly
upto over 5,000 km with one mid-air refueling.
</P>
<P>
India has the option to manufacture the Su-30s under license
after the delivery of the 40 jets, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The ageing Mig-21 "bis" warplanes are being currently upgraded
by Russia by installing sophisticated avionics and weapon systems.
Two Mig-21s were already in Russia for upgradation and another
over 120 planes would be upgraded in the next few years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, United States Sign Air Services Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-U.S. air services
agreement singed here today would provide a firm legal basis
for the continued development of air services between the two up
to and beyond June 30, 1997, a Hong Kong official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Services, made
the comment at the signing ceremony here today.
</P>
<P>
Ip and Richard Boucher, the U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong,
signed the document on behalf of their governments.
</P>
<P>
The regular air services between Hong Kong and the United
States started in 1937, when the Pan American established a
passenger and cargo flying services between California and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Nine U.S. airlines operate some 84 passenger and cargo services
per week to Hong Kong. They carried 920,000 passengers and
147,000 tons of air cargo on direct services in 1996 between Hong
Kong and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific started its passenger and cargo services to the
U.S. in 1986, followed by Air Hong Kong, a dedicated air-cargo
carrier, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific and Air Hong Kong now operate about 21 services
per week between Hong Kong and locals in the U.S. and in 1996,
they carried 315,000 passengers and some 42,000 tons of air cargo.
</P>
<P>
The total number of passengers carried on direct services alone
between Hong Kong and the U.S. by the airlines of both sides was
close to 1.2 million in 1996, a 12.7 percent increase over the
1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
Today's air services agreement is the 19th signed by Hong
Kong. Hong Kong has signed similar agreements with the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Brunei, France, New Zealand,
Malaysia, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Australia, Germany, the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Japan, Italy, India, Myanmar and Thailand.

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work with
France to further the long-term and stable friendship and
cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries, said
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with visiting French Defense Minister Charles
Millon here this morning, Chi hailed the great importance of
Millon's visit to China, which is the first by a French defense
minister since China and France established diplomatic relations
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and state councillor, said the relationship between the
two armed forces is an important part of the Sino-French ties.
With the restoration and development of the bilateral ties in the
past few years, he added, the friendly cooperation between the two
armed forces has entered a new phase.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he believes the current visit of the French defense
minister will make a great contribution to the development of the
relations between the two countries and the two armed forces, and
will push the bilateral cooperation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Chi briefed the French visitor on China's defense policy, army
building and the achievements in the country's reforms and opening
up program.
</P>
<P>
The "China threat" theory spread by some people in the world,
Chi said, aims at sowing discord between China and its neighboring
countries and obstructing China's growth.
</P>
<P>
Millon said he was happy to be the first defense minister of
his country visiting China. He introduced France's defense and
security policies, and put forward proposals on the development of
military exchanges and friendly cooperation between France and
China.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also exchanged views on international
issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcome ceremony in
honor of Millon, who arrived Sunday on an official visit at the
invitation of Chi.
</P>
<P>
Millon met with Chinese Minister of Electronics Industry Hu
Qili and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, Fu Quanyou, this morning and at noon
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Annan Favors Reform of U.N. Development Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today stressed the need to reform the U.N. development
system in a bid to make it more efficient and cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the 12th Ministerial
Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Countries here, Annan
said the surest foundation for peace, stability and security is
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said he intends to reform the role of the U.N. in
international cooperation for development and ensure that greater
resources are devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
To secure the development of developing countries, the U.N.
needs to re-examine constantly its means of attaining that
objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that our approach to development takes full
account of the economic, political and technological realities of
our times," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said reforms should be taken to make the U.N. development
system sensitive to the concerns of developing countries so that
it can "provide assistance at the country level efficiently and
cost-effectively."
</P>
<P>
Talking about reform of the Security Council, he said that
"while an effective Security Council is vital for the U.N., a more
representative Security Council will enjoy even greater legitimacy
and support."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that one of the consequences of an expansion in the
council's membership would be to correct the under-representation
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from nearly 70 NAM countries attend the
two-day ministerial meeting which was preceded by senior
officials' meeting on April 4-5. A final document and a New Delhi
declaration will be adopted at the end of the meeting.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has
declared some Iranian big-valued bank notes invalid beginning
from May 22, the English daily Tehran Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the CBI Sunday. The bank notes
with the face-value of 5,000 rials (1.66 U.S. dollars) and 10,000
rials (3.33 dollars), which are designed on both sides with
pictures of the Tehran refinery and the former site of the
Parliament, will be replaced at all banks as of April 6 in an
attempt to unify the different shapes of the old bank notes.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the CBI called on people to refer
to all branches of banks throughout the country to convert their
old notes within the time span from April 6 to May 21.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-rial note is the note of the biggest denomination
in the country. The counterfeit printing of these notes is
commonplace in Iran and the banks have to examine them carefully
before accepting them.

LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that 25
percent of mothers and 29 percent of children in Nigeria suffer
from iron deficiency anemia (IDA), the Nigerian Tribune reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to curb the disease, the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has begun the administration of iron tablets on 500,000
pregnant women in the country, said John Egbuta, the UNICEF
project officer, in charge of micro-nutrients in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which started last month and is expected to cost
UNICEF about 10 million Naira (about 118,000 U.S. Dollars), is to
enrich expectant mothers with iron needed in the body.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, now being conducted in two government areas, is
targeted at about 10 million women and children.
</P>
<P>
It will cover all women of child-bearing age and children of
up to five years old when the second phase begins in July, the
UNICEF official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Egbuta, UNICEF is encouraging 1,500 schools in
Nigeria to cultivate gardens with vitamin A crops as part of the
diversification strategies being adopted.
</P>
<P>
Another strategy to be adopted is food fortification, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Try to Turn Army Bases into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The major Israeli peace
organization Peace Now has revealed that Jewish settlers have
moved in three military outposts in the West Bank, hoping to
establish new settlements.
</P>
<P>
According to a Peace Now report distributed to the press
here, its activists discovered a third outpost, Nahal Plugot in
Gush Etzion, apart from the outpost of Ofri reported in the media
10 days ago, and Rehalim on the Jerusalem-Nablus highway
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The settlers at the outposts are bachelors, disclosed the
report. "It appears that the settlers have decided to use a
different strategy," said Peace Now spokeswoman Hagit Ya'ari.
</P>
<P>
However, the Council of Jewish Committees in Judea, Samaria,
(Jewish names for the West Bank) and Gaza, has flatly denied
reports of a building boom. "There is nothing new in the reports
about settlers living on military outposts, many have been living
in outposts for years," said council chairman Pinhas
Wallerstein.
</P>
<P>
In response to the charges, Avi Benayahu, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai's media adviser, said Sunday night that in
accordance with the government decisions, no new settlements are
being established in Judea and Samaria.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Israel Radio broadcast a report on settlers
living in shipping containers in Ofri.
</P>
<P>
After the Israel TV aired a program showing the containers in
which the settlers lived two days later, the police arrested the
settlers and detained them for questioning. At the time, the
council said it had no knowledge of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
An Ofri local official said the Ofri group consisted of three
or four young men who have been living on the hilltop for at
least a year.
</P>
<P>
Reports regarding Rehalim, near Shilo, claimed that the
council was attempting to change its status to a settlement. The
outpost was established six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now has announced to hold a demonstration at the
entrance to Sha'are Tikva this morning, to demand that the
government freeze construction in all settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The government has recently authorized the construction of an
additional 48 units at Sha'are Tikva," said Ya'ari, adding
that many of the existing units are still empty.

<HEADLINE> Africa in Danger of Greater Marginalization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sub-Sahara African continent
is in danger of being more marginalized in the long-term global
trends, according to a U.N. report issued recently.
</P>
<P>
The latest report compiled by the U.N. Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) urged Sub-Saharan countries to quicken the
tempo of economic reform in order to make themselves more
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
It said that the continent's share of global manufacturing
output fell from a tiny 0.6 percent in 1970 to 0.3 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Sub-Sahara is losing export market share to Asian
countries even for the traditional commodities like cocoa,
coffee, vegetable oils, rubber and tin, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that not a single African country is included
among the developing world's 12 targets for foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
All Sub-Saharan countries attract less than five percent of
the total 244 billion U.S. Dollars capital flow in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, a World Bank report said that Africa became more
attractive for foreign investors in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the report said, Sub-Saharan countries attracted a
total of 11.7 billion Dollars in private capital, a significant

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Repay U.S. Debts Made by Saigon Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam agreed officially today to
repay the United States about 145 million U.S. dollars in economic
debts made by the former Saigon regime during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Financial Minister Nguyen Sing Hung and
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the highest-ranking
U.S. economic offical to visit the country since the end of the
war in 1975, signed the agreement here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to take effect in 30 days with Hanoi
paying a "down payment" of more than 8.5 million dollars of
interest and regular payments starting in July to extend until the
year 2019.
</P>
<P>
This agreement results from the multilateral debt agreement
Vietnam reached with the Paris Club of western creditor countries
in December 1993, under which the club agreed to cut Vietnam's
debts in half and reschedule more than 4 billion dollars debts
owed by both Vietnam and the former Saigon government.
</P>
<P>
In the Paris Club agreement, Vietnam acknowledged its
responsibility for the economic and social debts of the former
Saigon regime prior to April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
Rubin called the agreement "a significant step in the
normalization of relations" between the U.S. and Vietnam and "the
integration of Vietnam into the international financial community."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the signal sent by this agreement will be
important to the rest of the world in building confidence in
Vietnam in a way that will benefit its economy."
</P>
<P>
"With Vietnam's continued cooperation in accounting for
American POWs and MIAs, we look forward to working with Vietnam as
it continues to make progress toward structural reforms, a
market-based economy and regional and global economic
integration", said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dinh Bin hailed the
agreement, saying the agreement "showed the determination of the
two sides to get beyond the past to develop new relationship
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who is making an Asian tour including the Philippines
and Japan, arrived in Hanoi Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which established diplomatic relations with the
U.S. in 1995, has been eager to strike a comprehensive trade
agreement with the U.S. and to secure the Most Favored Nation
status.
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted the decades-old trade
embargo in 1994, trade and investment ties between the two
countries have achieved important development.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade came to 1 billion dollars in 1996, doubling
the 1995 figure and 4.5 times that of 1994 while it is expected to
rise to 1.5 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Having 54 investment projects worth 773 million dollars, the
U.S. ranked eighth among foreign investors in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Trade in Narcotics Flourishes in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The narcotics trade is rampant
and abuse of narcotics are becoming wide-spread in some parts of
the capital city of Nairobi, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper which has done extensive investigations
said that the abuse of cocaine, heroin and bhang/marijuana had
infiltrated schools and universities and about 40 percent of
students are on drugs.
</P>
<P>
The mafia-type drug syndicate is co-ordinated by barons based
in low-class hotels and brothels in the city center, it pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers secretly smuggle and traffick in drugs mostly
from the port city of Mombasa as the Anti-Narcotics Unit has
taken stringent measures at the Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi, heroin is easier available than cocaine since the
former is easily trafficked from India and Pakistan while the
latter is sourced from far-away South America.
</P>
<P>
Residents are quoted as saying that drug dealers are
influential individuals who operate under the police protection.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Head of Anti-Narcotics Unit Michael Jackoham
as confirming the activities of the drug syndicate.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the drug problem in Kenya, especially in urban
centers, is serious and should be addressed now."

central China's Hubei Province, have started to use helicopters to
combat severe criminal offenses, shoring up its "strike hard"
drive, the Legal Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters have been wielded as "a deterrent force"
against severe criminal offenders, the paper said.
</P>
<P>

Wuhan and a US company, he said, adding that it can fly at a
height of 4,000 meters, at a speed of 180 km per hour and for 500
km with no stops.
</P>
<P>
They are used in the city to help patrol streets, deploy police
forces, and provide telecommunications services, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters are especially effective in tracking criminals
and cars on the run, providing timely aid to the injured,
overseeing fires, floods and incidents, and coordinating with
ground police forces in their anti-crime fights.
</P>
<P>
Many police officers reached through telephone said that the
use of such helicopters may be spread in the future for its
speed and special functions.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Morogoro-based
non-governmental organisation has installed 200 plastic
biodigesters in different households in Morogoro and Tanga
regions of eastern Tanzania, reducing the use of charcoal in the
households by 50 per cent.

<P>
Six seminars had been organised during which 240 farmers were
trained on the installation and maintenance of low cost plastic
biodigesters.
</P>
<P>
Some households in Turiani of Morogoro Region and Amani in
Tanga Region have so far benefitted from the project which aims
at improving the well-being of rural people through application
of appropriate technologies.
</P>
<P>
SURUDE formed by a group of farmers and technology developers
group in Turiani was registered three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was a beneficiary of the Africa 2000 network
programme having received financial assistance to the tune of
14,809,000 Tanzanian Shillings (about 24,680 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Sarwatt, SURUDE had received requests for use
of biogas for lighting and was now studying the prospect of
implementing the idea using the low pressure gas.

JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Following his return from the
United States Sunday night, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said Israeli troops in the West Bank were to remain on
high alert, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said the total closure imposed on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip since last month's suicide bombing attack in a down
town coffee shop in Tel Aviv was to remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Mordechai was briefed on the
security situation by Israeli army chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak and army intelligence head Moshe Ya'alon.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting in his Tel Aviv office, Mordechai also heard
reports of the week's events from Ami Ayalon, head of the
General Security Service, and was updated on the events in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip by army commanders.
</P>
<P>
Avi Benayahu, Mordechai's spokesman, said the security forum
was not satisfied with the way the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has cracked down on terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, in coordination with those present, decided that
the closure would continue for now, with the exception of a few
steps taken on a humanitarian and economic basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli defense minister said his three-day
trip to Washington struck a positive chord with the U.S. and that
he achieved all of his objectives.
</P>
<P>
He instructed Israeli defense ministry officials to work
together with the Pentagon over the next few days to consolidate
the agreements reached during his meeting with U.S. Defense

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 households in
Beijing are still living under crowded conditions and in the near
future, all of them will have much better living areas.
</P>
<P>
This year, the municipal government will start the construction
of 11 residential areas, according to Wang Zongli, director of the
Municipal Construction Commission. As a result, 11,000 households
are expected to move into more spacious rooms later this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, 31,000 households in Beijing have
benefited from the city government's program to construct low-cost
apartments.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in 1993, is aimed at providing better
living conditions to the poor. Work units and local governments
are to guarantee that the apartments will be sold at cost.
</P>
<P>
With 1.1 billion yuan (132.5 million US dollars) in loans from
the World Bank, 25 low-cost residential projects with a total
floor space of 800,000 sq m will be launched this year, Wang
said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Tackles Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is monitoring all imported
products from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-hit
countries to prevent the BSE-caused mad cow disease from
spreading to people and the cattle industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily New Vision today, a national task
force on BSE has also been set up to coordinate with
international organizations and to advise government on policy
concerning the disease.
</P>
<P>
Winyi Kaboyo, Assistant Commissioner for Veterinary Public
Health in the Ministry of Health, was quoted as saying that
government was carrying out public education to explain its
policy in order to avoid misinformation and anxiety among the
people.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow disease is associated with a transmissible agent
consumed by cattle in concentrate feeds containing meat and bone
meal.
</P>
<P>
It was first reported in Britain in 1986 and increased
dramatically over the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
Over 163,000 BSE-infected animals have been found in Britain
ever since with 244 in Switzerland and a few others in nine other
countries.
</P>
<P>
None BSE case has been reported in Uganda or any other African
country.
</P>
<P>
BSE causes serious nervous disorders and eventually death.
There is no known cure yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Mwanza Ngoyi, Governor of Zaire's
second largest city Lubumbashi, has fled his war-torn country and
sought sanctury in Kitwe in Zambia's Copperbelt Province,
according to a report from Kitwe today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that most of guest houses in the city are full
of Zaireans, some of them paying U.S. Dollars for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Ngoyi was quoted as saying on Sunday that the situation in
Lumbubashi is so tense that he has to run for his life and will
not go back if the tension is not eased in Zaire where Laurent
Kabila's rebel forces are advancing.
</P>
<P>
Another Zairean named Kalenga (one name) said that Kyungu
Wakumwanza, the former governor before Ngoyi, has been
re-appointed as Lubumbashi Governor.
</P>
<P>
Kalenga said that people are fleeing Lubumbashi although the
war has not yet reached the city.
</P>
<P>
Zaire's two warring sides started talks in South Africa in
search for national reconciliation but so far there is no sign
for a stop of the military strife in that central African
country.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Parliament Committee Starts Hanbo Scandal Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A special committee of the South
Korean National Assembly (parliament) investigating the Hanbo loan
scandal today starts a three-week-long hearing broadcast live over
suspects and 41 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to question Hanbo Group Chairman Chung Tae-soo
in a Seoul prison on the names of politicians and officials he
bribed for the 6-billion-U.S. dollar preferential bank loan to his
subsidiary the Hanbo Steel Co.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo Steel Co., the country's second largest steelmaker,
announced bankruptcy in January with debts reaching 5.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chung has allegedly diverted some 1.7 billion U.S. dollars from
the 6-billion loan for lobbying and other purposes since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of the committee reportedly are to grill
Chung on whether he supplied election campaign funds to President
Kim Young-sam, then candidate of the Democratic Liberal Party in
the 1992 presidential election, in exchange for the loan.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee's ruling party members hope the
three-week-long hearing will help dispel the opposition's attacks
on President Kim and the party as the attacks are believed to
exert a great influence on the presidential race at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Those to be grilled include President Kim's second son Kim
Hyun-chul and three enjailed ruling and opposition legislators --
Hong In-kil, former senior secretary to President Kim, Kwon
Ro-kap, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's right hand man, and Iiwang
Byung-tae, former National Assembly Finance-Economy Committee
Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Kim Hyun-chul was accused of meddling in important national
affairs by asking bank officials to extend the preferential loan
to Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
Han Lee-hun and Lee Suk-chae, former top economic advisors to
President Kim, who denied enjailed Hong In-kil's confession of
forcing bank officials to extend the loan to Hanbo at Hong's
request, are also to testify about their roles in the scandal at
the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Street Children Said National Problem in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Increasing street children in
Zimbabwe have become a national problem and the government should
have a common program to tackle it, the daily Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper says the Harare city council recently strengthened
an exercise to send street children in the city to some
rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
At first the well-coordinated exercise appeared to be
successful, but then was frustrated by a new influx of children
from other areas according to reports last week.
</P>
<P>
These children are aware that if they roamed the streets of
Harare, they would eventually be picked up and placed in a home,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The street children problem should be tackled nationally and
all local authorities should be involved and have a common
program and objective.
</P>
<P>
It is the time for the local authorities to set up a special
fund in their budgets to cater for the destitute children.
</P>
<P>
The paper said if there are joint efforts by all concerned,
the situation can be improved.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bipartisan Move to Solve Ethnic Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The understanding reached by the
exchange of letters between the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the opposition United Notional
Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremasinghe last Thursday for solving
the ethnic conflict was welcomed by various sectors both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamil, the major ethnic groups in the island
country.
</P>
<P>
The liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has been fighting against
the government for a separate Tamil state in the North and east of
the country since 1983. More than 55,000 people have been killed
in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Through the years the country's ethnic crisis could not be
resolved because the two main parties would not get together to
resolve the issue. But the exchange of letters is now seen as a
major achievement.
</P>
<P>
Almost in chorus, several groups, particularly the Tamils,
worst affected by the conflict, have welcomed the step. The
mainstream Tamil political parties see this as a positive move
towards peace.
</P>
<P>
The Peoples Liberation Organization, the Eelam Peoples
Democratic Party, the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front
and the Up Country Peoples Front have with one voice lauded the
accord between the PA and the UNP in approaching the ethnic issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Buddhist Clergy said that the agreement will receive
the blessings of all sections of the community.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the move, the Sri Lanka Buddhist Congress has called
for wider cooperation among all political parties for resolving
all national issues and steering the country towards a more
vigorous path of development.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu Congress and the Hindu Council have applauded the
statesmanship of the two leaders on the bold step they had taken
which is worthy of the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have also welcomed the step taken by the two
Sri Lankan leaders. Indian High Commissioner Nareshwal Dayal
Sunday said Delhi welcomed the step and supported a political
resolution to Sri Lanka's conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has hailed the agreement as having
the potential to provide the foundation for a just and equitable
solution to the ethnic conflict, Foreign Ministry sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Germany have also praised the
accord between the two Sri Lankan parties, according to the
sources.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Claims 107 Lives in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harare, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea has killed 107
Zimbabweans and afflicted another 58,209 countrywide in the past
three months, prompting the Health Ministry to increase its
educational campaigns against the disease.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said Sunday in Bulawayo, the
second largest city, that the number of reported diarrhea cases
increase 13 percent since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to the incessant, heavy and widespread
rains in the just-ended season, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rains created unhygienic conditions in most urban areas,
resulting in an increased number of people being affected by
diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Uganda Committed to Tanga-Musoma Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Uganda have
renewed their commitment to building the Tanga-Arusha-Musoma
railway which has been on the drawing board for several years due
to lack of funds, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference shortly before ending the five-day visit
to Tanzania and flying home on Sunday, Ugandan Prime Minister
Kintu Musoke said that the two countries vowed also to implement
the proposed Dar es Salaam-Mwanza oil pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
The Kyotera-Mutukula-Mwanza project was also among priorities
which the two countries want to be implemented as soon as
possible so as to speed up their economic development and improve
people's living.
</P>
<P>
Musoke said feasibility study on the Tanga-Arusha-Musoma rail
project has been completed.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries were seeking for funds, but he did
not tell how much the projects would cost.
</P>
<P>
Musoke said he was happy with efforts made in improving
services by the Dar es Salaam Port and the Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) for smooth movement of goods to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda is a land-locked country and it will thus exploit
every route available both through Kenya and Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Tanzania on Wednesday, toured the Dar es Salaam
port, Zanzibar, TRC installations, Arusha-based East African
Cooperation Secretariat and the International Tribunal for
Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua)-- Shanghai plans to move its major
manufacturing plants and high-tech firms to its suburban areas,
while its downtown districts will mainly engage in financial and
commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the rapid improvement of infrastructures and cheap
land and labor on the outskirts, new manufacturing centers will be
set up there. Each of the city's nine suburban counties and
districts has set up a development zone.
</P>
<P>
Each of the zones has its specific industrial development
targets. For example, the Kangqiao Development Zone of Nanhui
County will focus on building materials, while the Songjiang
County Development Zone will mainly develop the instrumental and
electrical appliance industries.
</P>
<P>
The suburban areas have become hot spots for foreign
investment. Some 30 top multinational companies have invested in
these nine zones which now cover a total of 15 sq. km.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the development zones have attracted
nearly 1,000 projects, involving a total investment of 30 billion
yuan (3.61 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, local township enterprises in the suburbs will
increase their cooperation with large state-owned enterprises
and overseas business.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have completed
a survey of Antarctica and obtained more than 1,000 ice
cores and other samples.
</P>
<P>
These may help explain changes in the environment and climate
in Antarctica in the past 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhongqin, 35-year-old researcher at the Lanzhou Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology, attached to the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that it was the first time that Chinese scientists
investigated the ice sheet in the Antarctica and that they had
obtained precious ice core samples and materials.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica is the world's only continent without permanent
residents. It is also the region with lowest temperature, fastest
wind velocity, and the world largest ice sheet area.
</P>
<P>
Of Antarctica's 14 million square kilometers of the total land
space, 13.5 million square kilometers are covered with ice and
snow all year round.
</P>
<P>
Li said the survey, joined by more than 130 researchers from
China's 50 institutions, was China's 13th investigation tour in

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thailand Needs to Boost "Stars" for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand needs to further
stimulate exports of products in "rising star" categories while
placing priority on the poorly performing group, if the country is
to attain its 10 percent export growth target this year.
</P>
<P>
last year, Thailand's exports grew only 0.5 percent from 1995,
falling far short of the 18 percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
The country's highest expansion and highly competitive category
has 19 items, such as computers and parts, integrated circuits,
telecommunication equipment, electrical appliances, jewelry and
ornaments, electrical generators and motors, canned shellfish,
automobiles, motorcycles, animal feeds and cement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that this group still has good potential to
grow at a minimum of 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen that growth, the government should ensure a
steady supply of raw materials, reducing tariffs on some imported
materials where necessary, to help companies lower production
costs.
</P>
<P>
The government can also help the sector deepen its development
in order to add value to products, particularly electrical and
electronic goods, and to upgrade the skills of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
The export value of this group last year was 677.8 billion baht
(27.1 billion US dollars), 49 percent of the total, up 12.2
percent on 1995.
</P>
<P>
The group's impressive growth was attributed to high
competitive capacity, introduction of medium-and high-technology
production machinery, the use of skilled labor and the increasing
relocation of foreign companies' production bases.
</P>
<P>
In order for the country to achieve the overall 10 percent
export growth target, even exports of goods in the so-called
problem sectors must grow at least by 3-4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the poorest performers with low competitive capacity
were garments, frozen seafood, footwear, plastic products,
fabrics, canned fish, synthetic thread, vehicle tyres, watches and
parts, frozen chicken, toys and artificial flowers.
</P>
<P>
This group's exports accounted for 329 billion baht (13.16
billion dollars), or 23.9 percent of the total exports, and
tumbled 21.7 percent compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many products in this group have lost their edge to competitors
in lower-wage countries. As well, they often face non-tariff
barriers in export markets, such as environmental and sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to place a priority on stimulating this
largely labor-intensive sector.
</P>
<P>
The second best performing group last year contained five
cyclical agricultural products: rubber, rice, sugar, tapioca
products and coffee. The group accounted for 169 million baht
(6.76 billion dollars) or 12.3 percent of the total export value,
up 4.8 percent on 1995. This sector also needs more technology to
increase production capacity and improve quality.
</P>
<P>
This group was followed by the "normal growth" sector, which
included oil products, canned fruits, and canned juice. They
accounted for 202 billion baht (8.08 billion dollars) or 14.7
percent of the total export value in 1996, up 3.5 percent on 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the country is now at a juncture for
economic structural adjustment, from labor-intensive economy to
technology-intensive economy, as labor and raw materials are
costing more than its low-income competitors.

<HEADLINE> West China's Electricity to Be Transmitted to East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- West China's electricity will be
transmitted to ease electricity shortages in east China resulting
from its rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
A project, under which hydropower and thermal electricity in
the central and western areas will be sent to the east through the
national grid, has been put into operation, according to the
Ministry of Power Industry.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims at linking the economically-developed
east to the underdeveloped west for mutual benefits, and improving
the uneven distribution of power resources.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a thermal power plant in north China's Shanxi
Province, a major coal producer, has started to support east
China's Jiangsu Province, one of the most developed areas in
China. The Three Gorges Hydropower Station is designed to transmit
7.2 million kw of electricity to east China, upon completion.
</P>
<P>
A second A.C. loop and D.C. hydropower project is well under
construction in southwest China's Guizhou Province to link with
Guangzhou. More projects of this kind will be put into operation
by the turn of the century, and three million kw of electricity
will be transmitted to east China.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of hydropower resources and 80 percent of coal
reserves in China are in the west and north, respectively, while
70 percent of China's energy is consumed by the east and central
areas.
</P>
<P>
And 94 percent of east China's generating capacity comes from
thermal power, and 75 percent of coal is shipped in from
north. This aggravates air pollution in the area. China's largest
industrial city of Shanghai now has difficulties in finding
suitable sites for construction of thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the program will greatly promote contacts and
cooperation between west and east. The west will for the first
time send its intensively-processed product of electricity instead
of raw materials, to the east. The east in turn will put more
investment, technology, and personnel into the west.

<HEADLINE> Political Mess Hits Blue Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty over the passage of
budget for 1997-98 in the wake of political mess at the Center
following the withdrawal of support of the Congress Party to the
United Front (UF) government dealt a severe blow to blue chips
which took a sharp beating during the week ended on April 4.
</P>
<P>
Although the equity market tried hard to override politics
through the mid week, the week ended with lackluster trading
performance, indicating another phase of uncertainty ahead.
Traders said that the worst thing was that the political onslaught
came at a moment when the underlying sentiment in the market had
started consolidating for a possible rally.
</P>
<P>
The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 30-share sensitive index
skidded 302.64 points, the fourth largest plunge ever, on last
Monday, after shedding a massive 344.63 points. The sensitive
index clawed back lost ground marginally in the hope of the
passage of the budget and stabilized at 355.07 from 3663.53 on
April 2 shedding a net 106.46 points.
</P>
<P>
Nervousness prevailed both in the National Stock Exchange (NSE)
and the Delhi Stock Exchange (DSE). The NSE 50-share index shed
5.80 points to 1001 points from 1057.87 points while the DSE index
dipped to 747.69 points from 769.14 points, a loss of 21.45
points.
</P>
<P>
The Congress withdrawal of support to the 10-month old United
Front (UF) government on last Sunday came as a rude shock to the
share market, whose sentiment took a tumble on the assumption that
the budget, which was hailed as historic by industry, would be put
on the backburner.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition leader
has warned that an ordinance issued recently for amending acts on
local bodies and their elections could lead to "constitutional
deadlock", the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
President of the Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad
Koirala told a press meet Sunday that the ordinance could lead to
constitutional crisis as the forthcoming local elections will be
held under the ordinance without parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the government, King Birendra Friday
issued the ordinance to amend the country's acts concerning local
administrations bodies and elections.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance came out soon after the parliament concluded its
winter session without passing the bills, including the one on
decentralization, which earlier were expected to be passed.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization bill is designated to give more autonomous
rights to the local administration bodies and to empower local
people.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition leader, the ordinance have to be
approved by both houses of the parliament within six months of its
issuance under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has decided to hold the local elections
by mid-June on the schedule set by the former NC-led government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugar production of
this season may fall 10 percent short of target as many sugarcane
planters are burning their fields to make harvesting easier.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the country's sugarcane farmers are burning
their cane because of shortage of labor, according to cane and
sugar board office Secretary-General Pramode Vidtayasuk.
</P>
<P>
Burning up cane leaves and grass in the fields makes cane
cutting and transport easier but also reduces cane weight.
</P>
<P>
Cane-burning is not practiced in the northeast, where cheap
migrant labor is available.
</P>
<P>
Sugar output is expected to total 5.5 million tons this year,
of which 4 million is earmarked for export.
</P>
<P>
Many cane planters seek jobs at construction sites in big
cities during slack season, and will not return home to cut his
cane because they earn much more in cities. They simply send money
back to employ others to cut their cane.
</P>
<P>
Each year about 100,000 laborers are employed during the cane
harvesting season.
</P>
<P>
The cane and sugar board office hopes to reduce the practice
for the next milling season.

<HEADLINE> Italian Defense Ministry Says No Tax for Mission in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy's leading role in the coming
aid protection mission in Albania will not be funded by a special
one-off tax but mainly by cuts in defense ministry budget, sources
close to the ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it was up to the ministry to recommend how the
mission can be funded.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary analyses had shown room for further spending
constraints, already envisaged in the 1997 budget, by various
ministries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry will be able to make a "not marginal"
contribution to these savings, he added.
</P>
<P>
A member of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party proposed
funding the mission out of the 0.8 percent of annual returns which
taxpayers can choose to give to religious bodies, charities or the
state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, politicians in the government and opposition
criticized the idea of a special one-off tax surcharge.
</P>
<P>
Communist Refoundation, which is firmly against the mission,
called the idea "incomprehensible," and a centrist member of the
opposition Freedom Front and Turin mayoral candidate Raffaele
Costa dubbed it as "indecent."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Hospital Authority
has drawn up new guidelines against soliciting sponsorship and
donations from companies for doctors, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The authority, which manages 42 public hospitals and medical
institutes, is the territory's major drugs purchaser. Its
expenditure on 4,000 drugs and medicines has exceeded 1 billion HK
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines which is expected to be issued next month mainly
target the pharmaceutical industry, which has very close links
with public doctors, as being the major sponsor for their academic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Public Doctors' Association estimated that the amount of
drugs company sponsorship for doctors was about 20 million HK
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Drugs companies have offered packages of "air fares, hotels and
conference fees" to doctors and the value of the sponsorship had
caused concern of the authority.
</P>
<P>
Hospital Authority deputy director Ko Wing-man said, "We want
to help doctors not to put themselves in a situation easily
suspected by others."
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines, the employees of the Hospital
Authority must obtain written approval form their hospital or the
authority for sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
The authority should consider if the sponsorship could create
any obligation for the authority to the company, or if it could
adversely after the image of the authority.
</P>
<P>
Ko said that the authority had set up a special fund this month
to finance overseas courses or conferences for its 400-plus
consultants.

<HEADLINE> Mushroom-Shape Moths Plague Bulgarian Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A great number of highly
reproductive mushroom-shape moths have been found near eastern
Bulgaria's Varna region, putting the forests nearby in great
danger, Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Forestry experts warned that the plague of mushroom-shape
moths, whose larvas have an exclusive appetite for leaves of
broadleaf trees, occur once about every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, moth pests afflicted a few areas near Varna, while
up to 2,500 hectares of forests within 70 kilometers around the
city were endangered this year.
</P>
<P>
The pests will jeopardize orchards as well. Once entering the
orchards, the moths would eat up both leaves and flowers of fruit
trees.
</P>
<P>
So far, Bulgarian forestry authorities have taken emergency
measures and sprayed insecticide upon 97 percent of the country's
forests.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch Its Third Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's third satellite,
Thaicom 3, is due for launch from French Guiana on Saturday,
according to a source at Shinawatra Satellite Plc, the operator of
the Thai satellite.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite is scheduled to be launched into the 78.5
degrees east position, the same orbit as currently used by Thaicom
1, which is to be shifted to 120 degrees east to make way for
Thaicom 3.
</P>
<P>
However, Thaicom 3 will be close to the 80 degrees east slot
used by the Russian satellite, Express, and will have a frequency
interference problem.
</P>
<P>
The Russian satellite and Thaicom 1 have not interfered each
other because their footprints are different.
</P>
<P>
But the footprint of Thaicom 3 will extend to cover India,
overlapping that of the Express satellite.
</P>
<P>
Equipment would need to be adjusted to solve the problem, said
the source, adding that Russia wanted Shinawatra to shoulder all
the expenses as the Express satellite was in place first.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will have four weeks to solve the footprint
overlap after Thaicom 3's launch, as tests will be needed before
Thaicom 3 enters its planned orbital position.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's "Comfort Women" to Sue over Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Indonesian women
forced into prostitution by the Japanese army during World War II
plan to sue the government over its plan to keep their
compensation money, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Budi Hartono, chairman of the Legal Aid Foundation (IBH) in the
central Java town of Yogyakarta, said on Saturday that the
preparations for the lawsuit were almost complete.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government agreed last year to pay the 249 former
so-called comfort women 9 billion rupiah (3.7 million US dollars
as compensation for their sexual slavery during the imperial
army's occupation of Indonesia between 1942 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo said it would hand the money over to Indonesia's Social
Affairs Ministry, but in January, Social Affairs Minister Inten
Suweno said the government would actually use the cash to build an
old people's home.
</P>
<P>
Harsono said his clients last Wednesday sent a letter to
President Soeharto asking for their compensation money.
</P>
<P>
"If we get no response, we will launch the suit," Hartono said.

championship in South Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis spent more than two hours for her sixth title this

</P>
<P>
Things started turning in the second set. Hingis stretched out
rallies and fired precise forehands that continually clipped the
sidelines. She survived three break points to go 2-2, then broke
serve twice to even the match.

<P>
Hingis was up 5-2 in the third and on the verge of winning. But
Seles fought off three match points in the ninth game to stay
alive.
</P>

16-year-old Hingis made 10 straight errors and Seles led 6-5.
</P>

The tiebreaker was just as tense. Seles missed four straight

<HEADLINE> Sabotage Possibly Related to Blasts in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sabotage has not been ruled out as
the possible cause of two explosions that rocked an ammunition
depot at the Basa Airbase in Floridablanca, Pampanga, Saturday
afternoon, the newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Air Force Chief William Hotchkiss as saying
that he has ordered "a tightening of security" around the airbase
after 15 people were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the likelihood that it was sabotage, Hotchkiss
said, "That's a possibility. Of course we're not saying that is
the cause but that is a possibility."
</P>
<P>
The same ammunition dump was attacked a few years ago by New
People's Army guerrillas, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Two explosions, about 10 minutes apart, hit the storage area
located at the end of a runway at the base around 17:45 (09:45
GMT) Saturday, injuring 15 people, shattering glass windows in
nearby buildings. But the wounded suffered only minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Resuming of University Enrollment Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of the university
enrollment system has been a major factor for the country's
economic growth over the past two decades, according to Chinese
officials.
</P>
<P>
Ten million people have graduated from Chinese universities
since the enrollment system was resumed in 1977, and they have
been making great contributions to China's modernization drive,
the State Education Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities stopped recruiting students during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when knowledge was viewed as a
accoutrement of the exploiting class and bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
The resumption began in 1977 when the late leader Deng Xiaoping
gave a keynote speech calling for the revival of education and
science.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Chinese universities recruited the first group of
students after the Cultural Revolution, and 5.7 million people
registered for the entrance examination.
</P>
<P>
The country is carrying out a program to reform the higher
learning sector-- asking students to pay for themselves and
encouraging them to find jobs by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the state subsidized all the tuition fees for the
students and assigned jobs to the graduates.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (7-8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (7-8) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Is it correct to say that the Basic Law is a
mini-constitution of the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR is one of the basic
laws of China. It is not a constitution. Strictly speaking, it is
inaccurate to say the Basic Law is mini-constitution of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
This is because a constitution is the fundamental code of a
nation, whereas Hong Kong after 1997 is a special administrative
region of China. It is a local administrative region, not a
state. It is, therefore, improper to say the Basic Law is a
constitution or a mini-constitution.
</P>
<P>
In structure, however, the Basic Law does resemble a
constitution. It has a preamble, general principles, chapters and
sections on the basic rights and obligations of Hong Kong
residents, and Hong Kong's political structure, economy, culture
and education. Such a feature of the Basic Law is not found in
other domestic laws except the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps due to this fact, or because of the importance of the
Basic Law in the legal system of the Hong Kong SAR, many people do
customarily refer to it as a mini-constitution.
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the relationship between the Basic Law and
laws to be enacted by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, laws in force in Hong Kong will include
the Basic Law, laws previously in force in Hong Kong which do not
contravene the Basic Law or which have been amended by the
legislature of the Hong Kong SAR (the common law, rules of equity,
ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law), and laws
to be enacted by the legislature of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
These three groups of laws form the legal systems of the Hong
Kong SAR with the Basic Law as its core.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's decision on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR
stipulates, "Systems, policies and laws to be instituted after
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR shall be based on the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong SAR."
</P>
<P>
That is to say, after 1997, laws to be enacted by the
legislature of the Hong Kong SAR, previous laws to be enforced by
the Hong Kong SAR and policies of its government must be based on
the Basic Law and must not contravene it.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Riot Shakes Pekalongan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A fresh riot shook Indonesia's
central Java town of Pekalongan Sunday, but the situation was soon
put under control by security authorities, according to reports
reaching here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, an angry mob of about 350 people went on
the rampage, looting a motorcycle shop and setting fire to at
least nine motorcycles and a truck, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
A number of shops on the street of Urip Sumoharjo were stoned
and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Order was restored seven hours later by troops from the 0710
regional military command and local policemen.
</P>
<P>
The rioting was triggered by a report that a United Development
Party (PPP) supporter was stabbed to death by an unknown
assailant.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating the incident, which appeared to be
linked to rioting which occurred there two weeks ago, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 30 people were sentenced to prison terms ranging
from three days to three months for their involvement in the March
26 riot when a number of shops and properties were vandalized.
</P>
<P>
The riot started when PPP flags around a music concert area
were removed by supporters of the ruling party Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's three political parties -- Golkar, PPP and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) are preparing for the May 29
general election.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are vying for 425 seats of the house of
representatives in the election during which more than 120 million
people are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Pekalongan was the only central Java city where Golkar lost to
PPP in the 1992 elections.

</P>
<P>

conceded further humilation when Qu Bo netted a penalty stroke
goal in the 48th minute followed by penalty corner goal from Cai
in the coming minute.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Singapore match failed to produce any sparkling
move and dazzling attack as both sides tested each other force
after confining the game to mid filed due to long time ball
possession.
</P>
<P>

after strikers failed to stop the ball, showing lack of planning
and confidence out side the circle.

supremacy with the second penalty corner in the 27th minute.

stinging shot sounded the boards after goalkeeper tried to save

ATHENS, April 6 (Xinhua) --Greek Parliament Speaker Apostolos
Kaklamanis met with his Cypriot counterpart Spyros Kyprianou here
today to discuss issues of their common interest.
</P>
<P>
The two told the press after the meeting that they exchanged
views on developments of the Cyprus issue and goals of the two-day
conference which is being held here and attended by speakers of the
Mediterranean parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by U.S. ambassador to Greece Thomas
Niles today that Washington would interfere if Athens and Ankara
were led to an armed conflict in the Aegean, Kaklamanis called the
statement as "nothing new", adding that a U.S. political decision
leading to positive developments in the Cyprus and the Aegean
issues would be important.
</P>
<P>
"In other words," he said, "the United States must feel the
need for Turkey to change its attitude."
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis stressed that nothing had yet changed regarding the
existence of "a real threat" in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Mustafa Kalemli, president of the
Turkish National Assembly, today also said at the Mediterranean
parliaments conference that there was no tension between Turkey
and Greece.

<HEADLINE> BBC War Correspondent Named Anti-Sleaze Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Martin Bell, the well-known BBC war
correspondent, has agreed to stand as an independent anti-sleaze
candidate to fight against a Conservative candidate, who is
accused of taking money for parliamentary questions.
</P>
<P>
Britain's two main opposition Labor and Liberal Democrat
parties have backed Bell as their joint election candidate in an
effort to unseat Conservative candidate Neil Hamilton, who has
denied cash-for-question allegation, according to a BBC television
report.
</P>
<P>
Bell, who has reported on wars for 30 years, will replace Labor
candidate Jon Kelly and Liberal Democrat Roger Barlow in Tatton
constituency in northwest England unless Hamilton agrees not to
stand in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, a former government minister, reportedly had a strong
majority of 15,860 in the 1992 election, making Tatton one of
Conservatives' safest seat in the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll, conducted by the Observer newspaper, suggested
that a high-profile anti-sleaze candidate could eventually defeat
Hamilton.

<HEADLINE> British Small Exporters Remain Confused over EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's small exporters remained
confused about the prospect of the European Monetary Union (EMU)
with less than a third supporting its introduction on January 1
1999, according to a latest poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Euro Sales Finance, indicated that
although those British exporters polled all have a vested interest
in European transactions, only 27 percent of them are in favor of
the single European currency named euro.
</P>
<P>
Most of those surveyed are not convinced that the single
currency would be launched on time, although more than half of
those people agree that the EMU would make exporting easier and 44
percent believe it would strengthen trading relations.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the small exporters said that the big
drawback with the introduction of a single currency was the loss
of sovereignty, although 36 percent said they did not know whether
this was going to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
Ian Fitz-Harris, chief executive of Euro Sales Finance, said:
"Most of our clients like the idea of monetary union in principle,
but at the moment they are fairly cynical about the whole subject.
They do not think it is going to happen."
</P>
<P>
"Politicians sowing the seeds of doubt about the EMU have done
businessmen a disservice. Exporting companies should be preparing
for the EMU not ignoring it," he added.
