<HEADLINE> French, Algerian Presidents Meet During King Hassan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika had a brief but
cordial meeting on Sunday when they attended the royal funeral of
Moroccan King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna as saying that the two presidents preferred to
meet again ``under other circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Chirac to meet with his Algerian
counterpart since he became president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Chirac and former Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual was cancelled in the last minute in December 1995 during a
United Nations session.
</P>
<P>
France and Algeria were then disputing over Algeria's internal
policies, including the government's military crackdown on Islamic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Since Bouteflika came to power in April, relations between
France and Algeria have been improving.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will pay a visit to
Algeria on July 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has invited Chirac and other French leaders to visit
Algeria as soon as possible.

<P>
He will meet George Habash, chief of the People's Front for
Palestine Liberation (PFPL) and Naif Hawatmah, secretary general
of the Democratic Front for Palestine Liberation (DFPL), on August

</P>
<P>
The meetings are part of the efforts aimed at enhancing the

talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of Fatah Movement, the mainstay of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), will hold a plenary
session late July in Cairo for the first time in several years.
</P>
<P>
The session will provide an opportunity for further
consultations between the movement and other national factions,
Al-Zanoun told Voice of Palestine.

Arafat last met Habash in 1991 in Algiers, capital of Algeria,
and met Hawatmah in Amman, capital of Jordan, on the occasion of
the funeral of the late King Hussein in February.

RABAT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- King Hassan II of Morocco was buried

<HEADLINE> Barak Orders Removal of Settlers' Mobile Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- By order of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Israeli army Sunday removed five mobile homes set up
illegally by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The settlements were established Friday on a hilltop near the
Jewish settlement Shvut Rahel, which is about 35 kilometers north
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said that the Israeli
government guarantees the security of all Israeli citizens
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
However, the government opposes all illegal activity,
including adding mobile homes on the hilltop near the Shvut
Rachel settlement, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the hilltop is "an illegal outpost
whose future is in the hands of the courts."
</P>
<P>
"The government will vigorously oppose any illegal and
unilateral steps which it considers an unacceptable deviation from
the norms of behavior between a government and its citizens,"
the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The removal action serves as the first test of the Israeli new
government's settlement policy and has been welcomed by Israel's
Peace Now movement.
</P>
<P>
Hagit Yaari, spokeswoman of Peace Now, said that it is "a very
positive step on the way to peace."
</P>
<P>
Since Barak won a landslide victory in the May elections,
he has pledged to avoid the building of new Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accord between Israel and the
Palestinians, the fate of some 140 Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip will be decided in the final talks on a
permanent peace settlement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, U.S. Foreign Ministers Meet in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here
on Sunday and their discussions focused on bilateral relations and
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang told Albright that the Chinese
government always attaches importance to the development of the
China-U.S. relations, and that a healthy and stable Sino-U.S.
relationship conforms to the fundamental interests of both the
Chinese people and the American people, and people in all
countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the United States, as major powers commanding
 great influences in the world, shoulder heavy responsibilities
for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
But Tang pointed out that the Sino-U.S. relationship has been
seriously damaged by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, according to a Chinese spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China finds it hard to accept the explanation and the
so-called "conclusion" made by the U.S. side hitherto. He urged
the U.S. side to give full recognition to the serious nature of
the bombing incident, give serious attention to the Chinese side's
solemn demands and take practical action to remedy the serious
damage to the China-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. attaches great importance to its
relationship with China. But she repeated the U.S. previous
statements that the bombing of the Chinese embassy was a "tragic
accident."
</P>
<P>
Albright said U.S. President Bill Clinton, herself, and other
administration officials have made a number of formal apologies to
the Chinese side for the bombing and that she would like to
apologize once again.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. side will adopt a serious approach toward the
incident and is willing to take practical action to seek a proper
settlement of the issue so as to return the U.S.-China relations
to their normal track.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. government had sent its envoy, Undersecretary
of State Thomas Pickering, to China to present to the Chinese
government a report on the results of its investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
She said the internal investigations regarding the
responsibility for the bombing incident are still going on and the
U.S. side will brief the Chinese side about the results as soon as
they come out.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. had held the first round of negotiations
with China on compensation over the casualties and damage caused
by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy, and is ready to begin
the second round shortly in a serious manner.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan expounded on the Chinese side's solemn stand on
the Taiwan question. The Taiwan question has always been the most
important and sensitive core issue in the China-U.S. relationship
and the proper handling by the U.S. of the Taiwan issue holds the
key to the healthy and steady development of the bilateral
relations, the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee Teng-hui recently openly defined the cross-Straits
relations as "state-to-state" ties and that the essence of the
"two-states theory" is to deny the "one China" principle and to
separate Taiwan from the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
As the Taiwan question is one that relates to China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, it is natural that Lee
Teng-hui's separatist remarks aimed at splitting the country have
met with the firm opposition from the whole Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. side, with actual deeds, to abide by the
three joint communiques between China and the United States and
honor all commitments it has made on the Taiwan issue, which is
vital to stabilizing the situation across the Taiwan Strait and
returning the China-U.S. relations to their normal track.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has noted and attaches
importance to the fact that the U.S. administration has recently
time and again reaffirmed the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Albright reaffirmed the U.S. government's commitment to the
"one China" policy and said Washington will not change this
policy.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. honors the three joint communiques, does not
support "Taiwan independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan," and does not support Taiwan's membership in any
international organization where statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
She said the Taiwan question should be settled by the Chinese
themselves on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the U.S. hoped
that the issue would be resolved through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese government's basic policy of settling the
Taiwan question is one of "peaceful reunification," and "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
While the Chinese government stands for peaceful reunification,
it will not commit itself to renouncing the use of force, Tang
said. "If we commit ourselves to abandoning the use of force,
peaceful reunification would become empty talk," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister urged the United States to
properly handle the problems in bilateral relations and create the
necessary conditions and atmosphere for the China-U.S. relations
to return onto a normal track.

<HEADLINE> Sophism Won't Save Lee Teng-hui: Xinhua Commentator (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A commentator's article released
by Xinhua News Agency today points out that Lee Teng-hui, a man
widely condemned for his separatist remarks, is indeed a "
troublemaker" who has sabotaged relations across the Taiwan
Straits and jeopardized the stability of the Straits and the
island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has become extremely isolated. He and his
followers have tried to ease the pressure from anti-separatists
and people against the "independence of Taiwan" by whitewashing
his separatist remarks and activities with sophism, saying that
his "two States" remarks only demonstrate the "facts", and that
the Taiwan authorities have not changed their policy toward the
mainland, and intend to further promote talks and negotiations
across the Taiwan Straits. But their self-contradictory words just
do not hold water, the article says.
</P>
<P>
"They are just seeking some decent cover for the separatist
farce staged by Lee Teng-hui," the article notes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "One China" principle as the foundation for
healthy development of cross-Straits relations, the peaceful
reunification of China, and exchanges between the Association of
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and its Taiwan
counterpart, the Straits Exchanges Foundation, the article says
Lee's "two States" remarks went against this principle and were
aimed at separating Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
If the "One China" principle were to be abandoned, there would
no longer exist a foundation for contacts, exchanges, talks, and
negotiations between the two sides, and there would no longer
exist the foundation for a peaceful reunification of the
motherland, nor would there exist a foundation for ARATS president
Wang Daohan's visit to Taiwan, the article stresses.

<HEADLINE> UK Government to "Clean Up" Party Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has confirmed it is
planning to ban foreign donations to political parties in the UK.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill is to be published on Tuesday, outlawing funding
from people said to have "no connection" with the UK, a BBC report
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move comes amid continuing controversy over the business
dealings of Conservative treasurer Michael Ashcroft, who is the
largest donor to the party. He lives in Florida and most of his
business dealings are in central America, according to BBC.
</P>
<P>
But The Conservative shadow Cabinet Office minister Andrew
Lansley accused the Labour government of victimising Ashcroft,
saying "I'm afraid it rather reinforces the sense that the Labour
Party have been engaged with others in a vendetta against Michael
Ashcroft."
</P>
<P>
"Those who are entitled to vote in the UK should have an equal
right to support political parties in the UK," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Home Secretary Jack Straw said the rules had been drafted
to "clean-up" British politics, and denied accusations they had
been drawn up with individuals in mind.
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea whether the legislation would catch Mr Ascroft
or any other named individual, and that is not my interest," he
said. "My interest has to be to ensure that there are fair and
impartial rules that apply to everyone."
</P>
<P>
However, Ashcroft expressed his fears that the proposed new
rules would be extended to a clampdown on tax exiles.
</P>
<P>
"It would affect many people abroad rather than just myself,
many British people that would then be denied the ability to be
able to contribute to the Tory Party. I would just have to work
harder to make sure there is a broader base to contribute to the
Conservative Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Martin Linton, Labour MP for Battersea, who is leading calls
for the bill to be tightened, stepped up his demands, noting that
he wanted to see a specific clause banning donations from foreign
governments or their agents, in the light of the Ashcroft affair.
</P>
<P>
Linton said it also had to be made absolutely clear that only
taxpaying UK citizens who lived in the UK could make donations.
</P>
<P>
"That avoids the situation where people who are not paying any
tax in this country take part in setting the tax in this country,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sophism Won't Save Lee Teng-hui: Xinhua Commentator(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"How can the empty lies that the Taiwan authorities have not
changed its mainland policy cover the separatist attempt and its
damage to cross-Straits relations?" adds the article.
</P>
<P>
"They will defeat themselves in the end by sophism, if they
continue to deceive the international community and Taiwan people
with false remarks," the article continues.
</P>
<P>
Calling Lee Teng-hui an inconstant and capricious Machiavellian,
the article reminds people of numerous contradictions between Lee'
s past pledge to adhere to the "One China" policy and his recent "
two States" remarks, his publicly enunciated pledge to fight
against the independence of Taiwan and his separatist activities,
his pledge to base the economic development of Taiwan on the
mainland and his policies to deter economic cooperation across the
Taiwan Straits, his pledge to attach importance to improving
relations across the Taiwan Straits and his using the "two States"
remarks to damage cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The article says a complete analysis of Lee Teng-hui's past
remarks and activities have shown that Lee is a sophist who uses
specious words to cover his true nature as a deep-rooted
separatist.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all the explanations by his followers, Lee has
exposed his true separatist nature and defeated himself with his '
two States' remarks," the article says.
</P>
<P>
"Sophism just will not save Lee Teng-hui, nor can the Chinese
people at home and abroad and the international community be
deceived. The only way out is for Lee Teng-hui to immediately stop
separatist activities, abandon the 'two States' statement, and
resume the policy of adhering to the 'One China' principle," the
article concludes.

<HEADLINE> India Says One More Area Cleared of Intruders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- India declared on Sunday that
its troops had driven out "Pakistan intruders" from Drass, one of
the three pockets which it said were still occupied by
infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
The victory followed an intense fighting in the three
sub-sectors of Drass, Batalik and Mushkoh in Kashmir between the
Indian troops and the intruders throughout the day, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported from Kargil, Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an Indian army spokesman as saying that 32 enemy
soldiers were killed while India lost seven soldiers during the
fighting to clear the Drass area.
</P>
<P>
In the Batalik sub-sector, the spokesman said, Indian troops
killed at least 30 intruders but lost 14 of their men during an
offensive which began on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting was going on in Mushkoh where Indian troops were
making progress, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister George Fernandes said Sunday that
"Pakistan incursions" would be taken up by India in any future
talks which would be possible only after Islamabad restored the
sanctity of the line of control and stopped "infiltrating
militants."

<HEADLINE> Arms Deadline "out of the Question": Sinn Fein Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Pat Doherty of Sinn
Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), has said
the May 2000 deadline for IRA decommissioning is "out of the
question".
</P>
<P>
In a week of pessimistic statements from the republican party,
he also blamed unionists for "walking through" political
deadlines, a BBC report said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost program on Sunday,
Doherty said the "political crisis" in Northen Ireland was caused
by the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) refusal to sit on a
power-sharing executive.
</P>
<P>
He said disarmament "has to be in the political context and
there is no political context at the moment. We are nowhere near
that context".
</P>
<P>
The UUP has said it will not sit on the executive with Sinn
Fein until the IRA begins to decommission arms.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the executive
must be made up of both unionist and nationalist parties. But
Doherty stressed that it was not part of the Good Friday Agreement
that the IRA hand over its arms before the executive was set up.
</P>
<P>
"We believe if we are to have proper politics in Ireland, we
must bring all of the weapons, including those of the loyalists,
British army and the RUC, forward for decommissioning," he said.
"There are sections in the agreement for all of these areas to be
dealt with. But we must have a political context first where we
can resolve it."
</P>
<P>
He said there was currently no mechanism with which to bring
about decommissioning, as it could only be negotiated through the
Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our members believe the unionists do not want to share
power with nationalists and republicans." he said. "They do not
want us to get our hands on the levers of government in terms of
the equality agenda and the areas of justice and injustice."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Sinn Fein was "not split" over its
position on the political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The officially announced review of the peace process will begin
in September, chaired by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who
oversaw the multi-party talks which produced the Good Friday
Agreement 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
It will be the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at
finding a way around the handover of IRA arms, which has dogged
the peace process for more than four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Crowds of Moroccans struggled to

when it was moving along a three-kilometer long route from the
Royal Palace to the Mausoleum of King Mohamed V Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the forefront part of the cortege was a jeep carrying the

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Philippine FMs Meet in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan told his Philippine counterpart Domingo Siazon here Sunday
that there exists no fundamental conflict of interests between the
two countries despite some setbacks in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the Philippine foreign minister in Singapore, Tang said
the Chinese government pursues a consistent policy of maintaining
friendly ties with the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As China and the Philippines are both developing countries and
also close neighbors, the development of a good-neighborly and
cooperative relationship of mutual trust conforms to the common
interests of the two countries, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang reaffirmed China's principled stand on the question of the
South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides should always keep calm and adhere to the
consensus and understandings reached between the leaders of the
two countries, and persist in resolving their differences through
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed astonishment and displeasure at the incident
whereby the Philippine side once again resorted to the use of
force against fishermen from China who had been carrying out
normal fishing activities in traditional fishing ground and who
did not have even a piece of iron to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Philippine government to handle the incident
seriously and to take effective measures to ensure that such
incidents do not reoccur.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that the overall development of bilateral relations
remains good. He expressed the hope that the two countries will
enhance their cooperation in various fields, especially in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government will continue adhering to the "one
China" policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon expressed deep regret over the ramming of the Chinese
fishing vessels for the second time in the recent period, saying
the Philippine side will make efforts to avoid recurrence of such
incidents.

<HEADLINE> British Celebrities Join Biggest Anti-GM Picnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- British celebrities fueled the
protest against genetically-modified (GM) foods by joining on
Sunday the UK's biggest organic picnic in London.
</P>
<P>
The feast of chemical-free food included a giant fruit salad
prepared by the Savoy Hotel. People had been invited to bring
their own organic picnic to show their opposition to the
introduction of GM ingredients in food.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have also jointly challenged the government to
set a target for organic agriculture in the UK which at least
equals that of the rest of the European Union, 30 percent of
agriculture by 2010 if current rates of growth continue.
</P>
<P>
At present 70 percent of organic food sold in the UK is
imported and just 1 percent of agricultural land is farmed
organically.
</P>
<P>
Organizers aim to send thousands of postcards to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair urging him to ban GM foods, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
"I am one of the 30 million people in the UK who do not want to
eat GM food. I am also among the 73 percent of the British public
who agree that we should not grow GM crops as cross-pollination
with organic crops is unacceptable," the postcards said.
"Therefore GM field trials should be stopped due to the inevitable
threat of contamination."

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Turkish Decision to Probe Air Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran Sunday welcomed the decision
by the Turkish government to send a fact-finding team to probe the
recent Turkish air raids on Iranian border town.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi expressed
hope that the "positive" move by the Turkish government would

Asefi said that following Turkish air raids on the Iranian
territory, Iran proposed inspection of the area by a joint
Iranian-Turkish team to investigate the issue and estimate extent
of damage.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish delegation is to arrive in Orumiyeh, Iran's West
Azarbaijan province, on Wednesday to visit the area attacked by
Turkish planes along with an Iranian team and closely see the
impact of the air raid.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that four Turkish warplanes bombed an Iranian border
post and several villages last week, killing five people and
injuring 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Iran strongly condemned the attack and urged an official
apology and compensation from the Turkish government by summoning
the Turkish charge d'affairs to Tehran three times in a week.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Morocco Cries Good-bye to King Hassan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Morocco cried good-bye on Sunday to
King Hassan II who, with a 38-year reign of wisdom and absolute
power, has made his country one of the most stable and tolerant
African and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Moroccans turned out in the streets of Rabat on
Sunday to pay their last homage to the king, and crowds struggled
to break away from the security cordon to join the cortege in
uncontrollable emotions.
</P>
<P>
Men, women, elderly and children waved flags of Morocco and the
picture of the king, or simply tree branches, as they stood along
the three-kilometer long route from the Royal Palace to the
Mausoleum of King Mohamed V, where King Hassan was buried by the
side of his father king and his younger brother Moulay Abdallah.
</P>
<P>
The royal funeral, which was held 36 hours after King Hassan
died of a heart breakdown because of an acute pneumonia on Friday,
began at 13:00 local time in Rabat (13:00 GMT), in the presence of
some 40 heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan television broadcast live the one-and-a-half hour
walk of the cortege through Rabat, at the head of which was a
royal green and red coach drawn by four white horses and 100
servants of the king, all wearing white djellabas.
</P>
<P>
Behind the coach was a jeep carrying the coffin of King Hassan,
which was covered with a green and red Islamic fabric with the
golden letters in Arabic: ``There is no god but Allah.''
</P>
<P>
Morocco's new monarch, King Mohamed VI, and his brother Moulay
Rachid, both wearing white djellabas, were walking behind,
followed by other family members and foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign dignitaries walking behind the cortege were
U.S. President Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac, U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, Spanish King Juan Carlos, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
Crowds of people, shouting ``Allah is great!'', began breaking
free from the cordon of police when the cortege went out of the
Royal Palace through the Gate of Ambassadors near the Mosque
Souna.
</P>
<P>
Crying women, elderly and children shouted ``Hassan, Hassan,
the glory!``, ``Good-bye, Oh Hassan!'' and ``We have lost our
father!''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Marks 20th Anniversary of War with Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Sunday led a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
the war with former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, joined by his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri
Museveni, was held at a Tanzania People's Defense Forces camp in
the Kagera Region on the border with Uganda.
</P>
<P>
While Mkapa laid a spear and shield at the memorial tower for
600 Tanzanian fallen soldiers, Museveni laid a wreath at another
tower which lists all the dead.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of the Defense Forces General Robert Mboma laid a
sword, and members of the armed forces mounted a colorful guard of
honor, followed by two guns of salute, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
On October 28, 1978, the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin declared war
against Tanzania by invading the latter's territory. The war ended
in July 1979 with Amin losing the war and fleeing his country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing villagers at Muhutwe in Bukoba Rural District, where
Museveni took asylum and prepared to topple Idi Amin, Museveni
commended Tanzania for fighting for the independence of many
African countries, including Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is an exceptional nation in supporting the liberation
movement in Africa," he said, adding that other countries in the
world should emulate the spirit.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who was accompanied by his wife Spesiaza Kasibwe,
also hailed former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and Mkapa
for maintaining peace and tranquility in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Mkapa said Tanzania is not only open
to east African countries but also to states in other parts of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania will make sure that the defunct East
African Community will be re-launched to meet the demand of people
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Private Security Service Booms in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Private security companies have
emerged as a major business proposition in recent years in
Bangladesh, the national news agency BSS reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of security service providers now stands at over 200
and covers areas in and outside the capital city of Dhaka, and
some of these companies are quite large, employing as many as over
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The total number of guards and other staff in the security
companies is around 50,000, sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government, in line with its policy of encouraging foreign
investment in the field of private security, last year permitted
one foreign company to operate in the country, and then recognized
the private security system as an industry with its inclusion in
the value added tax net in the 1997-98 budget.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the government's incentives, security companies
have employed mostly ex-servicemen and other young men, creating
jobs for thousands of unemployed youths.
</P>
<P>
The companies are now mostly involved in supplying uniformed
guards to clients, though some have recently introduced electronic
gadgets, alarms and access control systems.

<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Committees of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) at all levels have organized Party members over the
past few days to study the decision of the CPC Central Committee
to ban Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Cao Bochun, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional
Committee of the CPC, urged leading officials in the region to
conscientiously study the decision, obtain a better understanding
of the importance of this struggle, and assert strong leadership.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yunlu, governor of Guizhou Province, said, "We should
launch a campaign among Party members for education on Marxist
materialism and atheism.
</P>
<P>
Liao Xun, director of the Hainan Provincial Social Development
Research Center, said the decision on banning Falun Gong enjoys
popular support among the broad masses of people, and that the
practice of Falun Gong by some Party members shows there is a need
to offer widespread education on dialectical materialism to all
Party members.
</P>
<P>
Mao Rubai, secretary of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional
Committee, said, "We must guard against the erosion of theism,
hold high the great banner of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping Theory, oppose all sorts of erroneous tendencies, and
assure that the thinking of officials and ordinary people is
identical with the Party's decision and the Marxist scientific
outlook.
</P>
<P>
Through study, many Party members who had practiced Falun Gong
now have handed over to their work units books, cassette and video
tapes, and other materials related to Falun Gong. They also vowed
to break away from Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Okays Plan to Host 2003 SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has approved the Philippine Olympic Committee's (POC) proposal for
the Philippines to host the 2003 Southeast Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
POC president Celso Dayrit said he received Monday a letter
with a stamp of approval of President Estrada dated July 24.
</P>
<P>
"We're happy with this development as our president has
approved our recommendation letter to hold the biennial event here
in 2003," said Dayrit.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said the first thing to do after the government's
approval is to prepare an official recommendation letter informing
the SEA Games Federation of the Philippines' bid to host the
regional meet.
</P>
<P>
"We're going also to write an advance letter to Vietnamese
sports officials to also inform them of our plan to host the event,
" added Dayrit.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said he will submit the Philippine bid on August 5 when
the SEA Games Federation officials meet in Brunei, this year's
host of the games.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, one of the four ASEAN countries which have never
hosted the event, has expressed also its intention to host the SEA
Games after Malaysia's turn in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Other SEA Games members which have not yet hosted the event are
Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines has the right, if we follow the alphabetical
sequence, which is the SEA Games norm. The Philippines has
priority but SEA Games Federation will have a final say," said
Dayrit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippines Sports Commission (PSC) chairman Carlos
Tuason said if the country wins the bid, a committee similar to
the 1991 Manila SEA Games organizing committee will immediately be
formed.
</P>
<P>
Despite Vietnam's intention to host the event, Dayrit is still
optimistic the Philippines would win the bidding since the latter
has the experience and the facilities, and can host more events
SEA Games member countries would want from the host.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which last hosted the event in 1991,
calendared 31 sports, while this year's host Brunei could only
host 21 sports, Dayrit said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Official Reiterates Federal Solution for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' government on Monday
reiterated that it maintains a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation as
a solution to the longstanding issue of division of the island.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is also in favor of a federal solution,"
government spokesman Costas Serezis said, adding that regarding
"internal issues, the two communities should enjoy the highest
possible level of autonomy,"
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the federal government should have the
necessary power to guarantee the unity of the state.
</P>
<P>
Serezis said Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will handle
these issues if and when negotiations on Cyprus commence.
</P>
<P>
Serezis' words came in response to the remarks made by British
envoy for Cyprus Sir David Hannay.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Hannay had said in London that "a federal state
with a weak central government and strong wings will be the
solution" for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Hannay also said it was very important "that the political
equality of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots at all levels is
achieved."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General is expected to invite the two sides
in Cyprus for unconditional talks on all issues in the autumn of
1999.

<HEADLINE> Party Members Urged To Recognize Nature And Harm Of Falun Gong (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While teaching his followers to "always tell the truth," Li
himself has changed his own date of birth to coincide with the
reincarnation of Sakyamuni; and while repeatedly speaking of "
forbearance," Li has instigated Falun practitioners to attack
anyone who disagreed with him, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that Falun Dafa has harmed the socialist
ethical and cultural progress, and is doing enormous harm to the
whole of society," the article continues.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that some Party members still think
that believing in Falun Dafa doesn't necessarily mean being
superstitious; this constitutes another major misconception.
</P>
<P>
In spreading his Falun Dafa, says the article, Li Hongzhi has
employed a series of superstitious activities, such as spreading
the doomsday theory, crowning himself as the "only savior" of the
world to build up a personal cult, formulating a series of rules
and regulations to control the Falun Gong practitioners, and
libeling anyone who disbelieved in him by calling them "demons."
</P>
<P>
The article points to the fact that as a result of Li's
deception, some Falun practitioners have knelt before and
worshipped Li's picture day and night, while regarding their own
parents as "demons" and even murdering them.
</P>
<P>
"What else but extreme superstition could such activities be?"
it asks.
</P>
<P>
The article concludes by saying that the current struggle
against Falun Dafa is a "serious ideological and political
struggle" which has a bearing on the fundamental faith of
communists, on the fundamental ideological foundation with which
people throughout China can unite and strive together, as well as
on the future and destiny of the Party and the state.
</P>
<P>
"All CPC members who participated in any Falun Gong
organizations or practiced Falun Dafa must draw a clear
ideological line of demarcation against Falun Gong, voluntarily
break away from it, and return to the correct side of the Party,"
the article urges.

<P>
All Party members and the people throughout the country should
fully understand the importance of and deepen the political
struggle against Falun Gong and its organization, the article
urges.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the importance of dealing with the Falun Gong issue,
noting that Falun Gong has made use of "health exercises" to
defraud the people, and even captured some Party members and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that Falun Gong's organization had been
engaged in activities against science, the government, and society,
and has attempted to develop into a political force to contend
with the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the decision to deal with Falun Gong and its
organization is timely and necessary, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The serious problem with Falun Gong is that it is creating
disturbances at a time when the Party and the government are
concentrating on dealing with major international and domestic
events, and when China's reforms are entering a crucial stage, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on the people across the country to expose
Falun Gong's fallacies and make greater efforts to carry the

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
pledged Monday to take a series of measures to eliminate poverty,
which he said was an "intolerable social shame" dogging his
nation.
</P>
<P>
In his second State of the Nation Address delivered before the
joint session of the 11th Congress, Estrada said his government
will create 6.4 million new jobs for the poor during his term.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government's aim is to reduce poverty
incidence from 32 percent to a range of 25 percent to 28 percent
by the time he steps down in 2004.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the process of eradicating poverty, its
alleviation would continue through a series of programs aimed at
improving social services and providing the poor with better
opportunities to lead a decent and productive life.

He noted that his government is embarking on a full-scale
program to modernize the agriculture sector and develop the
countryside, where two thirds of poor Filipinos live, to carry out
this objective.
</P>
<P>
Government efforts will also be focused on ensuring food
security and greater access to quality education and primary
health care, providing low-cost shelter to the poor, intensifying
rural infrastructure buildup, uplifting the life of marginalized

<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that in spreading its lies and fallacies, Li
Hongzhi and his illegal Falun Gong organization have said that the
world is coming to doomsday, and Li is the only savior for the
human race.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Li Hongzhi's words are nothing new,
and are ridiculous. In the past decades, the Chinese people have
witnessed great changes while fighting bravely in their pursuit of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the
Chinese people emancipated themselves, the article says.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese people continue their efforts to further change
their fate by deepening reforms and expanding the policy of
opening up and promoting China's modernization drive, Li Hongzhi
calls himself a savior for the Chinese people. Thus, Li and his
Falun Gong are against the will of the people and the tide of
history, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Li knows nothing about science, but he spread pseudo-science to
cheat people, it says, noting that he even fabricated his birth
date to prove that he is the reincarnation of Sakyamuni, the
founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The article says that rather than being a savior, Li's
fallacies have killed many of his followers.
</P>
<P>
With Li Hongzhi's true face being exposed, the Falun Gong
organization has collapsed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on Party members and government officials to
uphold dialectical materialism and historical materialism to fight
idealism and create a sound psychological and social environment
for China's reforms, opening up, and modernization.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Physicist Blasts Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- He Zuoxiu, a well-known Chinese
theoretical physicist, said here today that Falun Gong, an illegal
organization which was banned by the central government, has
seriously threatened the social stability and brought hazards to
people's health.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old scientist, who has engaged himself in fights
against superstition and pseudo-science, lashed out at the
fallacies of Falun Gong at a forum held by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
He said Li Hongzhi's "doomsday prediction", which claimed that
doomsday is coming, is one of the basic Falun Gong malicious ideas.
Li imitated the failed doomsday predictions of some Western cults,
without giving an exact date for doomsday. Instead, he boasted
that he was the sole "savior" and could delay the arrival of
doomsday.
</P>
<P>
The scientist, who helped compile the book "Exposing Pseudo-
science" in 1995, also urged people to understand the danger of
Falun Gong. He suggested that scientific knowledge should be
popularized to reduce the factors inducing superstition and pseudo-
science
</P>
<P>
Professor He's speech, which was based on his rich experience
in fighting against superstition and pseudo-science, was very
instructive for people to learn the true face of Falun Gong and
its fallacies, said Lu Yongxiang, president of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific education should be strengthened to improve people'
s awareness of pseudo-science. China will witness more rapid
development if all people adopt the scientific spirit and a
scientific attitude," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Persists Through Terrifying Waves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 26, (Xinhua)-- Snow Dragon, the Chinese
Arctic Expedition ship, is forcing its way forward despite waves
as high as three to four meters, as the members of the expedition
persist in their research.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 23, this first Chinese expedition to the North
Pole encountered its greatest storm as the expedition team carries
out an oceanic survey in the Bering Sea.
</P>
<P>
It has remained cloudy and foggy since then, with occasional
rain, temperatures of 3-6 degree Centigrade, and heavy winds
whipping up high waves.
</P>
<P>
Since last Saturday, some members of the expedition have become
seasick, and by this noon, there were fewer people at the dining
hall for lunch.
</P>
<P>
Qin Weijia, the assistant to the chief scientist, said that,
although the storm has brought great difficulty to the surveying
work, scientists have carried out their research strictly
according to plans. He also said that the surveying projects
around the Bering Sea may be half completed tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to weather forecasts, storms in the surveying region
may grow weak in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
This first Chinese scientific expedition to the North Pole,
which departed from Shanghai on July 1, has finished the first
stage of its research in the Chukchi Sea.
</P>
<P>
Because of the severe ice conditions, the Snow Dragon had been
blocked in the fixed-ice region of the Arctic Ocean. The ship then
backed to the Bering Sea out of the Arctic Circle, and was able to
begin surveying in the Bering Sea ahead of schedule. The ship is
expected to return to the Arctic Ocean to finish the last stage of
its research on the ice early in August.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Volume Likely to Exceed Last Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's trade minister said here
today that the total import and export volume of the country this
year will very likely exceed that of last year, despite a decline
in exports.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), made the remark while meeting with visiting
Pakistani Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"China's national economy has grown steadily since the
beginning of the year, and the country will take a series of new
measures to keep the economy going for the rest of the year," he
said. "Under these circumstances, total foreign trade is very
likely to reach a volume larger than last year."
</P>
<P>
China's exports declined 4.6 percent in the first half of the
year to 83 billion U.S. dollars. But imports during the period
surged 16.6 percent to 75 billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total
trade volume to 158 billion US dollars, up 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shi stressed that as the national economy shows a strong growth
momentum, export growth will gradually recover from its current
negative posture, while strong economic growth will also prompt
the increase of imports.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister also said that ups and downs in the use of
overseas investment are normal, as he alluded to a possible drop
of overseas direct investment in China this year.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have investment increase every year," he said. "I
think we will still have a relatively large overseas investment
volume this year, and it will flow in the direction we encourage
it to go."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani chief minister, who arrived at the invitation of
east China's Jiangsu Provincial Government, said that Pakistan
upholds the "One China" policy, and wishes to expand trade and
economic cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Speakers Pledge to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
legislative bodies on Monday pledged full cooperation in helping
move forward the peace process, which has advanced little since
former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do all we can and take all measures to strengthen the
peace," Israeli Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg said at
a news conference with visiting Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) Speaker Ahmed Querie (Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala's visit to the Knesset is the first ever by a senior
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Burg described his private talks with Abu Ala as "very good,"
saying they agreed upon that peace is not only matters between
leaders, but also between ordinary peoples, for whom the
legislative bodies represent.
</P>
<P>
He also plans to invite his Syrian, Jordanian and Lebanese
counterparts to visit the Knesset, Burg said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala said "there would be enough work to do" for the two
legislative bodies since the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has
moved into a "critical stage."
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala promised to work together and cooperate with the
Israeli Knesset to help push forward the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Burg, a veteran lawmaker from the Labor Party led by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, initiated Abu Ala's visit, saying the aim is
to create a process in which the Israeli and Palestinian
legislators will exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who ousted hard-line former prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May elections, has reached out to Israel's Arab
neighbors, calling for a comprehensive and lasting peace which
will end the 100-year regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
The moderate ex-army chief has pledged to push forward the
peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria simultaneously. He
will meet Arafat Tuesday for a second summit since he took office
on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Burg sent an invitation to Syrian President Hafez Assad Sunday
for a visit to Israel and a speech in the Knesset, and would like
to see Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat
in the Knesset, the local daily Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his intention at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
But his invitation to Abu Ala has caused controversy in the
Knesset, with opposition lawmakers accusing him of elevating the
status of the PLC to a parliament level. The PLC was elected in
1996 according to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"This is almost recognition of a Palestinian state," said
Naomi Blumenthal, Knesset member from the right-wing Likud party,
which was trounced in the election two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Interim Likud leader Ariel Sharon said the time is not ripe for
such a visit because the PNA does not recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference held in the Knesset hall, a right-wing
lawmaker shouted at Burg while he was answering questions by
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Defending his invitation, Burg said before the meeting that
the visit was a clear-cut sign that the PNA recognizes Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But Abu Ala refuted this claim at the news conference, saying
the Palestinians also have rights over Jerusalem according to
U.N. resolutions and the status of the city should be discussed in
the final status talks according to Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle
East war and claimed the whole city as its "eternal and united"
capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a
future state.

KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat assured the parliament Monday that the government is
fully committed to solving the Kalapani territorial dispute with
India.

Mahat told the parliament that the presence of the Indian army

Both India and Nepal lay claim to the Kalapani area in
far-western Nepal which is now occupied by Indian troops.

Mahat also said that the Nepali government will initiate a

Bhutanese refugees now living in eastern Nepal. Seven rounds of
ministerial talks between the two Himalayan kingdoms have failed

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council
Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) paid a private visit to the
Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Monday, the first such visit by a
senior Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg, who initiated the invitation,
welcomed Abu Ala at the entrance to the Knesset compound. The two
then walked together into the Knesset for a tour and a private
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight in and around the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Burg, a veteran lawmaker from the Labor Party led by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, said the visit was aimed at getting to know
each other in order to create a process in which the Israeli and
Palestinian legislators will exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be that the government is dealing with peace and
people below are dealing with peace and the Knesset does nothing
related to peace," he told the local daily Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who ousted hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in the May elections, has reached out to Israel's Arab neighbors,
calling for a comprehensive and lasting peace which will end the
100-year regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
The moderate ex-army chief has pledged to push forward the
peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Burg sent an invitation to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
Sunday for a visit to Israel and a speech in the Knesset, as did
the late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, the local daily Haaretz
reported.
</P>
<P>
He would also like to see Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat in the Knesset, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But his invitation to Abu Ala has caused controversy in the
Knesset, with opposition lawmakers accusing him of elevating the
status of the PLC, elected in 1996 according to
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, to that of a parliament.
</P>
<P>
"This is almost recognition of a Palestinian state," said
Naomi Blumenthal, Knesset member from the right-wing Likud party,
which was trounced in the election two months ago. She called the
visit "unacceptable and inexplicable."
</P>
<P>
Interim Likud leader Ariel Sharon said the time is not ripe
for such a visit because the PNA does not recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
But Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, also a Likud Knesset member,
said he believes the visit constitutes recognition by the
Palestinian side of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. Burg
agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials denied the claim, saying that Jerusalem
is one of the issues due to be discussed in the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and claimed
the whole city as its "eternal and united" capital. The
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future
state.

and cooperation with China, Gleuber Vieira said.

</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, CCT will sell its counterpart 49

Clement Mak, chairman of CCT Telecom, said that under this
share sale agreement, HKNet will benefit from technological
expertise of NTT Communications Corporation which will further
strengthen its Internet and telecommunications service in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 59 Cases of Injury and Death Related to Falun Gong, Reported in Founder's Home Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 59 cases of Falun
Gong related injury and death have been reported in northeast
China's Jilin Province, where Falun Gong originated, a preliminary
investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
The investigation discovered that at least six people killed
themselves after practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinghua, a farmer in Liushuhe Village of Baishishan Town
in Jiaohe City, was one such example.
</P>
<P>
After beginning the practice of Falun Gong in 1996, Zhang held
Falun Gong Founder Li Hongzhi to be God. He said he could become
an immortal by practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, 1997, the 32-year-old farmer said he had reached
the highest level of practitioners, so he went to a nearby boiler-
house to test his ability.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the burning flames in the boiler, Zhang bragged
that he could enter the flames and come out of the chimney sound
and fit. When stopped by the boiler-keepers, he managed to climb
to the top of the chimney and jumped to the ground.He was severely
wounded and lost consciousness immediately.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's wife, Wang Juxiang, who also practiced Falun Gong along
with her husband, refused to take Zhang to hospital. Instead, she
brought Zhang home, and knelt down before a portrait of Li Hongzhi
to beg the "master" to save her husband. But Zhang died anyhow.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also found that at least 23 other Falun Gong
practitioners died because they refused to see doctors to cure
their diseases. And the diseases of 10 others worsened after they
practiced Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The China Youth Daily reported on Monday that the mass practice
of Falun Gong in more than 1,500 Falun Gong units in Jilin
Province has stopped, and most heads of the units have quit.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Lixun, head of the Falun Gong Jilin Provincial Branch,
said he decided to draw a clear line of demarcation against Falun
Gong after he became aware of its social consequences.
</P>
<P>
" Falun Gong organized practitioners to protest near
Zhongnanhai, and against some news organizations, and those are
wrongdoings," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Crush Rebellion, Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
vowed Monday to crush rebellion and crime syndicates in the
country, and urged the rebels to return to the mainstream of
society and join the government in uplifting the living standards
of people.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Nation Address before a joint session of
the 11th Congress, the president said the restoration of peace and
order in the country is a vital component in the realization of
his administration's goal to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the economy will only prosper in an atmosphere of
stability so he is more committed than ever to fighting
criminality and rebellion even as he extends the hand of peace to
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
"The rebellion, we must crush. The rebels we must save, unless
they persist in their rebellion," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said rebellion has blocked not only the government's
poverty alleviation efforts but also the nation's progress as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government wants peace. Instead of holding
peace negotiations in another country or neutral territory, his
administration has decided to hold negotiations at the community
level, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also strongly warned criminal syndicates,
especially those engaged in drug trafficking, that his
administration will hit them hard.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's efforts in fighting crime have
resulted in remarkable reductions in criminal activities because
of the vigilance of the government's crime-fighting agencies at
all levels.

MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian paratroops controlling the
Slatina airport in Pristina, Kosovo, used firearms Monday for the
first time since their deployment in the Yugoslav province on June

</P>
<P>
Quoting the Russian Defense Ministry, Tass said three

They fled the site after paratroopers tried to detain them.
Three warning shots were fired, Tass said.

By Monday, 1,915 Russian paratroopers have arrived in Kosovo.
So far, Russia has moved 71 pieces of armor, 235 trucks, 11

</P>
<P>
Four big landing ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet with 220
more Russian paratroopers are on their way from Russia to the

<HEADLINE> Party Members Urged To Recognize Nature And Harm Of Falun Gong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency today
released a Special Commentator's Article urging all members of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) to fully recognize the political
nature and serious harm of Falun Gong and support the CPC Central
Committee's decision to ban Falun Gong exercises nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Founded by Li Hongzhi, the Falun Gong organization was banned
by the Chinese authorities last Thursday as an "illegal
organization" spreading superstition and fallacies and disrupting
social order in the name of physical fitness exercises.
</P>
<P>
"The Party Central Committee's decision to ban Falun Gong has
great significance for strengthening Party building, maintaining
the vanguard role and purity of the Party, and safeguarding the
overall situation of reform, development and stability," says the
article, titled Have a Clear Recognition of the Political Nature
and Serious Harm of Falun Dafa (Falun Gong).
</P>
<P>
According to this article, there remain several misconceptions
among some CPC members who were involved in the practice of Falun
Dafa, and it is necessary to help these Party members to see the
truth.
</P>
<P>
"One misconception is that Marxist faith is not contradictory
with the practice of Falun Dafa, and Party members can believe in
both Marxism and Falun Dafa," the article says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the article says, Marxism adheres to a world outlook
and methodology based on dialectic materialism and historical
materialism, while Li Hongzhi, who preaches that social
development was arranged by God and controlled by himself, is a
strong advocate of idealism.
</P>
<P>
"If a Party member believes in Li's fallacies and has faith in
Falun Dafa, he will surely betray Marxism, lose his ideological
and political capability to differentiate right from wrong, fall
captive to idealistic heresies, and finally lose credit as a
communist," says the article.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Redoubled Flood-Fighting Efforts on Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji urged
people along the Yangtze River to maintain high vigilance and make
careful inspections of the river embankments to ensure the safety
of major cities and people's lives, during his visit to Hunan
Province from July 23 to 25.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sweltering hot weather, Zhu inspected water-control
projects in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province on
the afternoon of July 23, visited flood victims in the Ziyang
District on July 24 where a secondary dyke had broken, and toured
the Yongji section of the Yangtze and the Chenglingji hydrologic
station on July 25. Wherever he went, Zhu had cordial talks with
officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and local
people fighting the flooding, encouraging them to make persistent
efforts to insure the safety of the Yangtze River embankments.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation at some sections of the Yangtze is more
serious than it was last year, as more heavy rains are expected in
the region shortly, and a number of embankment reinforcing
projects have yet to be completed, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels, especially
leading officials, should bear full responsible for flood-fighting
and relief. Patrols along the river dykes should be carried out
around-the-clock, and hidden perils must be eliminated once they
are discovered, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all localities to make proper arrangement for flood
victims, help the old, the weak and women escape the danger areas,
and provide them with food and clean water.
</P>
<P>
Continued efforts will be made to plant trees and grass along
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, reduce river silt,
and crack down on inferior water-control projects. Those who
detain and embezzle government funds earmarked for key water
projects must be dealt with in accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, residents have been moved out of dam areas,
saving them from flooding and playing a vital role in adjusting
flood control. More investment will be used to build villages for
those being resettled, and ensure that all state subsidies are
sent to the farmers, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Party Members Urged To Recognize Nature And Harm Of Falun Gong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article defines another major misconception among some
Falun Gong-practicing Party members as the belief that Falun Dafa
is also a kind of science.
</P>
<P>
"Comrades holding such a view have been confused by the pseudo-
science mask of Li Hongzhi and have regarded a hodge-podge of
cultural rubbish and superstitious and heretical ideas as so-
called 'supernatural science'," the article declares.
</P>
<P>
Various facts have shown that Li and his Falun Gong have an
extremely anti-science nature and have denied all scientific truth,
says the article. Li once even slandered science as an "evil cult"
that should be held responsible for the moral decay of human
society.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li, who often stole scientific terms to "decorate"
his theories, lacks basic scientific knowledge. For example, he
used the term "light year," a distance measurement unit in
astronomy, as a time measurement unit, confused nuclear fusion
with nuclear fission, and blindly assumed that the surface
temperature on Mars (whose Chinese name literally means "planet of
fire") is much higher than that on Earth.
</P>
<P>
The article also criticizes some Party member's wrong concept
that Falun Dafa, which claims to advocate "truth, kindness and
forbearance" and to have the ability to "upgrade" people, is
conducive to the promotion of socialist ethical and cultural
progress in China.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance'
principle preached by Li Hongzhi has nothing in common with the
socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve,
" says the article.
</P>
<P>
In its promotion of socialist ethical and cultural progress,
the CPC is encouraging the people to foster a pioneering spirit,
the virtues of frugality and perseverance, and the constant
pursuit of self-cultivation and self-improvement. The Party hopes
that all citizens will cherish lofty ideals, become well-educated,
and have a high sense of morality and discipline, says the article.
</P>
<P>
However, the article says, the "truth, kindness and forbearance
" principle preached by Li and his Falun Dafa teaches people to
adopt an attitude of escapism and to indulge themselves in
meaningless exercises aimed at "happiness in the next life," thus
greatly undermining the Party's efforts.

<HEADLINE> India to Make Nuclear Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- India has started the process
for making an indigenous nuclear submarine while its navy is
looking for multiple capabilities of quick-reaction strikes,
electronic warfare and surveillance, authoritative sources in the
Indian Navy said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The highly-classified nuclear submarine project had already
started and was coming up well, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Designs of the submarine had been finalized and a fund totaling
300 million rupees (7 million U.S. dollars) has already been
allotted for the project this year, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
This project apart, PTI reported, several other major projects
were also underway, including the production of two submarines in
five years for which required money had already been sanctioned.
The letter of intent for this project was issued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While several warships and vessels were being de-commissioned
in recent years, the sources said, the newer ones were far more
versatile, flexible and potent.
</P>
<P>
They said that India's Delhi, Brahmaputra and Kora class ships
inducted or produced by the navy were now capable of carrying 16
surface-to-surface missile launchers compared with four for most
of the navies in the world.
</P>
<P>
India also intended to buy a Russian aircraft carrier "Admiral
Gorshkov" and talks were held with a Russian team recently but a
"few technical aspects" were yet to be tied up, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the navy intended to invest mostly on
military hardware to sharpen its "teeth" and maximize its
firepower and strike capabilities.
</P>
<P>
PTI reported Monday that India's first nuclear solid storage
surveillance facility (NSSSF) was commissioned in Tarapur in the
west state of Maharashtra, by the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
(BARC).
</P>
<P>
The NSSSF is the second step towards management of high-level
radioactive waste of the three-level strategy for management of
the nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
India has become the fourth country in the world to have such a
facility after Britain, France and Japan, according to the PTI.

<HEADLINE> Angola Appeals for International Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Assistance and
Resettlement Albino Malungo has appealed to the international
community for assistance, saying the country is in need of about
200 million U.S. dollars in humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be used to help refugees and residents affected by
the war, he said in Lisbon, Portugal, after attending a United
Nations annual meeting in Geneva, the official Angola News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the United Nations has asked the
international society to provide Angola with 105 million dollars
in humanitarian aid, but less than 40 million dollars was raised.
</P>
<P>
Malungo suggested that creditor countries could help Angola by
relieving its debt or postponing its debt service.
</P>
<P>
Angola's current refugee problem is"very serious" due to
renewed civil war in the southern African country, said the
minister. He appealed to the international community to assist
the1.7 million refugees, 750,000 forsaken children or orphans and
over two million people affected by the war .
</P>
<P>
Since the international aid is far from enough, the Angolan
government recently changed the relief strategy to self-relief
through agricultural production so that the refugees could be
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to use the major amount of the relief
fund on purchasing seeds, farm tools and other means of
production. The minister expressed his hope that the new strategy
could win support internationally and hence solve the problem of
the shortage of fund.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Seeks International Help to Save Angkor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk
 called on bigger countries to help save Cambodia's ancient Angkor
temples which have been seriously damaged by nature and looters.
</P>
<P>
The king made the call in his message responding to a letter
from his daughter Princess Norodom Bopha Devi, who is minister of
culture. The message sent from Beijing and dated Sunday was
obtained here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the king expressed his deep concern over
reports of the damages to Cambodia's temples.
</P>
<P>
"I would ask our royal government to inform great nations about
the serious destruction on the temples so they can come and help
us save the Angkor," the king wrote. He is now receiving medical
treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Bopha Devi said in her letter that the temples in the Angkor
area are seriously damaged by both the nature and criminals.
</P>
<P>
The temples of Angkor, built between the 9th and the 13th
centuries, were already registered as a world heritage site.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains and big trees are the main factors causing the
damage to and collapse of many temples in the Angkor area, the
princess said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the lack of protection and looting also
threaten the most popular tourist site in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists on Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists said they have
found the fallacies of Falun Gong because they are holding up a "
mirror" that can expose any monster.
</P>
<P>
The mirror is science, they said, which has been denouncing
Falun Gong's head Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The basic theory Li has used to challenge science is the "
doomsday theory" which predicts that the Earth will blow up soon.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Earth has already exploded twice, triggered by
his masters.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Zhao Pengda, president of China Geology
University, the Earth has a history of 4.6 billion years and it
has never exploded, and geological changes have played the
critical role in creating the current face of our planet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiansheng, from the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, said
that stars explode because of their heavy quality. However, our
Sun will not see such an explosion because it is small, to say
nothing of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the "doomsday theory" is to deify Li Hongzhi as
the "super hierarchy" who can control the entire universe,
according to He Zuoxiu, academician of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have also tested Li Hongzhi's doctrines of "
Truthfulness, Benevolence and Tolerance."
</P>
<P>
He Zuoxiu pointed out that the fact that Li changed the date of
his birth to coincide the birthday of Sakyamuni, the founder of
Buddhism, fully demonstrates his untruthfulness.
</P>
<P>
Li has claimed that his theory is the most profound and superb
in the world, one that explains all the mysteries of the universe.
However, the scientists said that Li just borrowed some scientific
words to concoct a false theory, and Li actually knows nothing
about science.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fact that many practitioners have died as a
result of practicing Falun Gong, and that many were instigated by
Li to attack the government and media departments in no way can
be called tolerant, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
But why has Li Hongzhi attracted two million followers
including some well-educated people in just seven years?
</P>
<P>
"This is because the society has been experiencing great
changes," said Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, pointing out that in a diversified society, some
erroneous ideas emerge which are contrary to scientific theories
and the Party's doctrine of "seeking truth from facts."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Gaofeng, vice president of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, urged that scientific information be disseminated as
part of a great effort to abolish superstitious ideas.
</P>
<P>
"We must equip the people with the weapon of science, and teach
the masses of youngsters to learn and love and respect science. It
is imperative for the nation to improve its scientific level,"
said Zhao Pengda.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Wang Yue, president of Beijing Science
and Engineering University, it is not merely an issue of science.
"We must hold high the banner of Marxism and materialism, and
develop a correct world view and life attitude," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to be Second Largest Oil Exporter: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is making efforts to be the
world's second largest exporter of crude oil this year or early
next year, said Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a statement carried by the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) that the current rates of Iraqi crude oil exports
make it rank the second in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), only next to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said that Iraq would continue increasing its output
capacities and bring them to a daily production of more than 3.5
million barrels during next year from the current 2.2 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, now in its sixth phase
which took effect on May 25, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its nearly 24
million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said if the oil prices on world markets can maintain
the current level which has risen to 19 dollars per barrel, the
country would be able to fulfill its export quota.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was just able to export 3 billion dollars of oil in the
fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, and 3.9 billion dollars in
the fifth phase due to the low prices on world markets and severe
lack of spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister said that Iraq has received oil
equipment and spare parts worth 50 million dollars under the
fourth phase, while it has received nothing from contracts of the
fifth phase.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth and fifth phases of the oil-for-food deal,
Iraq was allowed to purchase 300 million dollars worth of spare
parts in each phase for its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
On the current visit made by Indian Oil Minister
K. Ramamurthy who arrived here on Saturday to attend the 13th
session of Iraqi-Indian joint committee of economic and trade
cooperation, Rashid said this session reflected both countries'
desire to cement trade and economic relations between them.
</P>
<P>
Ramamurthy told INA upon arrival on Saturday that India is
keen on consolidating cooperation with Iraq in the oil, trade,
agricultural and industrial fields.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Continue to Eradicate Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China has been strengthening its
crackdown on the fallacious Falun Dafa headed by Li Hongzhi by
confiscating his works and persuading people not to believe in his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
In the island province of Hainan, law enforcers have seized
more than 300 Falun Gong books and 190 VCDs and tapes. Officials
said that all the shops in the province have stopped selling Falun
Gong related materials.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, scientists and medical experts are continuing their
publicity campaign. Hu Peicheng, a leading psychiatrist, said that
Falun Gong has taken advantage of people's desire to cure diseases
and to be saved by a superman.
</P>
<P>
Hong Zhaoguang, a chief cardiologist, said that psychotherapy
can aid patients to some extent. However, this has been used by
Falun Gong practitioners in a wrong way.
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists agreed that the biggest danger of practicing
Falun Gong is that the practitioners are easily confused mentally,
and tend to believe in things that do not exist.
</P>
<P>
"This disease, caused by superstition, is hard to cure," said
psychiatrist Zhang Chongpei.
</P>
<P>
Gao Tian, a musician, said that modern people are under
extremely high pressure, pushing them to look for relief. In this
regard, psychotherapy is effective if it is used in a scientific
way, but Falun Gong gave it an erroneous explanation, causing
people to suffer greatly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangxue and his wife Yu Guizhi have spent three years
practicing Falun Gong and both became ill as a result. Zhang, a
retired official in Henan Province, said that from his experience
he knew that Li Hongzhi has played three tricks.
</P>
<P>
"First, he has denounced science and excluded alternative
theories. Second, he has used the cover of Falun Gong to make
money. Third, he has taken advantage of the practitioners to reach
his political goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another retired official, Wang Aiyan, told his story of
opposing Falun Gong. He said that several years ago one of his
friends asked him to practice Falun Gong, but he refused. "I am a
Communist Party member. I have my belief. However, Falun Gong
advocates superstition and obscurantism, which go against science
and civilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tong Xiulin is an elderly woman who once suffered from many
diseases, but she has recovered by taking medicine and practicing
Taijiquan. "My experience has exposed the absurdity of Falun Gong,
" she said.

<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The dirham maintained its strength in 1998 by
appreciating against most major currencies, said a latest report
by the Central Bank of the Untied Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"The UAE dirham continued to strengthen during 1998,
benefiting from its fixed parity with the U.S. dollar which
witnessed marked improvement in its exchange rate against most
major currencies," the Gulf News daily Monday quoted the report
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the dirham appreciated 1.5 percent against the
Deutschmark, 1.6 percent against the Dutch guilder, 1.1 percent
against the French franc, 4.7 percent against the Italian lira
and 8.1 percent against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency depreciated by 1.1 percent and 0.3
percent against the pound sterling and the Swiss franc
respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman, a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member,
will hold the 5th Muscat International Fair from October 25 to 29,
the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fair, one of the biggest and most successful in the Gulf
region, is organized every two years by the Omani Ministry of
Trade and Industry and the Omani Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair will have the total participation of all
Omani industrial zones, and it will be attended by many
countries, including Germany, Turkey, Iran, and fellow GCC members
the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the fair will be on investment, commercial
consultancy, human resources, finance and banking, education,
science and technology, commercial partnership, agriculture,
tourism services, construction, communications, and information
technology.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrians are expected to get access to mobile
phone services in November with the operation of 45,000 to 60,000
lines, said Director General of the Syrian Telecommunications
Authority Makram Ebeid.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al Hayat Monday quoted Ebeid as saying that
the authority has received offers from several companies to
provide the mobile phone equipment free of charge for one-year
probation period.
</P>
<P>
The offers have been made by the German "Siemens" company which
is currently implementing the projected one million lines in
Syria, the Swedish "Ericsson" company which is undertaking a new
one-million-line project, and Lebanon's "Anfiscom" which is
carrying out a similar project in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Iran's plans to ease restrictions on gold
imports will have a beneficial impact on Dubai's gold market, Gulf
News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iran, in a bid to boost the development of
non-oil sectors, is considering a policy which will allow imports
of up to two tons of gold bullion every month.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news and will be to the advantage of Dubai gold
bullion and jewelry traders, as most of Iran's gold procurements
are from Dubai," industry sources were quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
India, Dubai's largest gold re-export market, decided to
reduce gold imports from Dubai last year, which has had its
impact on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Because of India's move, "there is after all an excess of 20
tons of bullion in the market now. This will in all likelihood be
channeled to Iran," gold traders said.

<HEADLINE> South Africa, HK Try to Boost Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin Monday held talks with Hong Kong's
financial secretary Donald Tsang to try to boost trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Tsang arrived in South Africa Sunday with a group of 12
business leaders from a wide range of industries as well as senior
Hong Kong trade officials.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is the highest-level official in the Chinese special
administrative region to visit South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is expected to hold talks with South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday. He will also meet Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel, other ministers and business executives.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) regards
South Africa, in its own right, and as the gateway to the much
larger southern sub-Saharan region, as an attractive proposition
for Hong Kong entrepreneurs," Tsang was quoted as saying in a
statement by the South African Foreign Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of formal ties between South Africa and
China in 1998, Tsang said, the HKSAR could play an even more
active role as a "bridge through which increased trade and
investment would flow between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and the HKSAR stood at more than one
billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will be in the country until August 5.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Energy Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China is pursuing sustainable
development of its energy resources in the forthcoming five-year-
plan period, which will give priority to improving the structure
and raising utilization efficiency.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by officials from the State Development
Planning Commission at an international seminar that opened here
today. Sustainable development of China's energy technology and
international financing in this area are major topics under
discussion at the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the country hopes to reduce its environmental
pollution through the implementation of its Tenth Five-year Plan (
2001-2005).
</P>
<P>
China's fast-paced economic growth in the last 20 years has
compounded its environmental problems, while posing a major
obstacle to sustainable development. And the lack of advanced
technology and shortage of funds are major obstacles China faces
in implementing an environment-friendly energy policy.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the State Development Planning Commission, the two-
day seminar has gathered an impressive array of delegates from
governments, international organizations, and financial
organizations, including the UNDP, the International Energy Agency
(IEA), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Proposes Rule to Curb Forced Shares Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Investors
Association (MIA) Monday proposed a mandatory rule in mortgage
agreements to prevent financiers from resorting to forced selling
when the aggregate value of securities under collateral is lower
than the market value.
</P>
<P>
Forced sale of shares was one of the major factors which
depressed the share market to the 262-point level on September 1,
1998, MIA said in its memorandum presented during the second
session of the Finance Ministry pre-Budget dialogue 2000 here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MIA proposed the setting up of a statutory reserve fund to
be supervised by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), saying 10
percent of the net profits made by stockbroking firms should be
transferred to this fund and the reserve be used only in the
purchase of government securities and gilt bonds.
</P>
<P>
The MIA proposed that regulatory authorities take stringent
measures to restrict inter-company loans to prevent the siphoning
of corporate funds by manipulative directors and corporate
"carpenters."
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency and delay in the dissemination of information
could promote to market manipulations and insider trading
activities, it said, adding such a situation is highly detrimental
to the minority holders of warrants besides making the capital
market "woolly."
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the government consider reducing the
capital exit levy from 30 percent (if repatriated within a period
of up to 12 months) imposed on September 1 last year to 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Has Emerged From Economic Crisis: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said here Monday that his administration has succeeded in bringing
his country out of the Asian currency crisis in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Nation Address at the joint session of the
House of Representatives and the Senate, Estrada said that the
country's gross national product (GNP) surged by 2 percent, while
the gross domestic product (GDP) went up by 1.2 percent in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the inflation rate went down to 8.4
percent in the first half of 1999, and the figure even went down
to 5.8 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
"we have emerged from the Asian crisis. We are now in pursuit
of our vision of a prosperous and poverty-free Philippines. The
future is for us to shape," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the decline in interest rates, the stabilization
of the peso against the dollar and the increase in tax collection
efficiency, enabling the government to collect total revenues
amounting to 462 billion pesos (12.1 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998.
</P>
<P>
"Our success was the result of effective governance. It was a
matter of having the right policies, being supported by competent
and dedicated cabinet members, respecting the freedom of the
market, managing and budgeting our resources right and acting
quickly before the danger grew or the opportunity disappeared," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada also called for congressional support in
the enactment of priority measures, including the Medium-Term
Philippine Development Plan for 1999 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
Estrada came to office last July after he won the presidential
election in May 1998.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Regional Forum Expresses Regret Over Bombing of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Foreign ministers and
their counterparts from the grouping's dialogue partners,
attending a regional security forum in Singapore, Monday expressed
their deep regret over the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "expressed their deep regret over the tragic
incident involving the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in early May,
which had caused the loss of innocent lives and many casualties,"
said the chairman's statement issued at the end of the one-day 6th
meeting of the 22-member ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
"The ministers extended their sympathy and condolences to the
Chinese people and relatives of the victims and to all the
innocent victims of the Kosovo conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's 11-week air campaign against Yugoslavia
earlier this year caused the death of thousands of innocent lives.
On May 7, the U.S. launched a missile attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, shocking the world. Three people died and
many others were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 10 members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the grouping's 10 dialogue
partners including China, Russia, Japan and the United States, and
Mongolia and Papua New Guinea, attended the ARF meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cattle-Farming on Steady Increase in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cattle-farming in Mozambique has
been on steady increase of seven percent annually since 1993 when
the government implemented a restructuring program in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total heads of cattle reached over 400,000 in
the southern African country, according to Fernando Songane,
director of National Administration for Animal Husbandry.
</P>
<P>
If this momentum goes on with no serious natural disaster, he
said, the sector will surpass the record high of 1.4 million heads
of cattle as in 1974, the Noticias newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The director attributed the growth in the sector to the efforts
made by the Mozambican government, private entrepreneurs,
non-governmental organizations and international cooperation
organizations.
</P>
<P>
With the 1.85 million U.S. dollars provided by the African
Development Fund, Mozambique will import about 3,000 breeders from
South Africa, Zimbabwe and other neighboring countries and
distribute them at the end of August or in early September to
farmers in several provinces, Songane said.
</P>
<P>
The chosen farmers who obtain the breeders through loan, will
then return the loan in the form of money or cattle once the
animals breed.

<HEADLINE> West Wants African Force for Own Benefit: Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has accused the West of promoting the creation of an African
peacekeeping force only to protect its economic interests in the
continent, a weekly magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Rose el Youssef magazine quoted Moussa
as saying that western countries "are trying to use the African
states' inability to fund such a project to control the
continent's security."
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
accepted efforts by Britain, France and the United States to
assemble a mainly African peacekeeping force aimed at intervening
in cases of military skirmishes or full blown wars.
</P>
<P>
The Western nations' interest in forming such a force is only
to control areas that are economically strategic for the West and
protect their investments in Africa, Moussa was quoted as saying
by the pro-government weekly. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
If the peacekeeping force, which remains an idea that has been
discussed several times at OAU meetings, is formed, it would be
run by the 52-member OAU and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Western nations are trying to use the proposed
force as a tool "by using selection methods to choose the nations
that would participate in this force."
</P>
<P>
Several OAU bodies responsible for avoiding conflicts have so
far been ineffective in stopping the bloodshed that has drained
the continent's resources.
</P>
<P>
At the OAU's July summit in Algeria, leaders agreed to ban from
participation in future gatherings of heads of state who have come
to power through military means. They also forged a framework to
end the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, that still has to be
implemented.

Tang said that China is pleased to see that the elections in
Indonesia have been a success and come to an end, and its economy
has embarked on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
As a friendly neighbor of Indonesia's, China sincerely hopes
that Indonesia will enjoy stability and national harmony, its
economy will soon begin to grow in a sound way and the country
will continue to play its due part in regional and international
affairs, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas expressed satisfaction over the development of its
relations with China in a wide range of areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said there will be no change in Indonesia's policy of
promoting a friendly and cooperative relationship with China,
which he said will be further strengthened in political, economic
and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on issues
related to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that the role and the authority of the United
Nations should be respected, otherwise the pillar of the
international security structure would be undermined, thus
threatening the sovereignty of a vast number of developing
countries and creating chaos in the international order.
</P>
<P>
Alatas agreed with Tang that the principles enshrined in the
U.N. Charter should also find expression in ASEAN meetings.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Public Workers Hold 'Warning Strike' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 public-sector
workers staged a limited "warning strike" Monday to protest
against the government's privatization plan, warning of further
actions if their messages were not received by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut Labor Federation ordered workers in government
corporations ranging from the Ben-Gurion International Airport to
state telephone company Bezeq to stop work for three hours during
the period between 9:00 to 15:00 (6:00 GMT-12:00 GMT), allowing
them to decide for themselves when to strike.
</P>
<P>
The Ben-Gurion Airport was shut down from 10:00 local time,
preventing take-offs and landings. The national carrier EL Al has
moved 11 flights forward to leave before 8:00 local time, when it
was due to begin the strike, but other flights were delayed until
after the end of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike was in solidarity with workers at the state-owned
Mekorot water company, who have been striking for the past 22
days in a protest over privatization of the company.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut explained that the reason it had decided to
strike was in protest of "the policy of dismantling government
companies, laying off of permanent employees and hiring of
manpower contractors instead."
</P>
<P>
"It's not defined as a strike, but as a work stoppage,"
Histadrut spokesman Levy Morav said. "If they don't understand
the warnings, they'll have to accept longer strike," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China Using New Plane For Airborne Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
recently held an exercise using a newly developed plane for
airborne troops and a new type of parachute in the Dabie Mountain
area.
</P>
<P>
Airborne troops, large artillery pieces, ammunition, vehicles,
and materiel were airdropped to various points during the five-
hour exercise. One airborne officer explained that the plane does
not need to refuel during flights to any parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was also a place to try out a newly-designed
parachute for soldiers and materiel that allows them to be dropped
more accurately and allows paratroopers to make last-minute
adjustments before jumping.
</P>
<P>
Also taking part in the exercise were personnel from the
infantry, engineering corps, armored forces, chemical warfare
corps, and 10 other branches.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Iran Takes over Syria's Role on PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit has said that Iran has taken over the role formerly played
by Syria in supporting and harboring the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News Monday quoted Ecevit as saying that "we never
wish that the tension between Turkey and Iran leads to a heated
confrontation. But it is a fact that after Syria halted its
support of the PKK to a certain extent, Iran took over Syria's
role."
</P>
<P>
Turkey once accused Syria of supporting the PKK which had its
headquarters in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are seriously anxious about that, but we want to resolve
the issue (between Turkey and Iran) through diplomatic means,"
Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that a recent series of
accusations directed by Iran at Turkey were "flimsy pretexts."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to allegations that Turkish fighter jets
have bombed Iranian border regions, that Ankara was behind the
massive demonstrations against the clerical administration in Iran
and, most recently, that Turkish troops have crossed into Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Referring to two Turkish soldiers who were arrested by Iranian
authorities on Thursday, Ecevit said that the soldiers crossed
the border by mistake.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Turkish
Charge D'affaires to Iran Kut Sezgin three times within a week in
a protest to Turkish aggression against Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry sources, who asked not to
be named, has told Xinhua that Turkey and Iran decided to set up
a temporary committee to investigate the incidents along the
border areas between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Playing Bigger Role in Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized businesses in
China's Hubei Province, a traditional industrial center, are
getting more vigorous and are contributing 60 percent of the local
industrial added-value output.
</P>
<P>
Some 830,000 of them are township enterprises and 40,000 are
privately owned. In the township sector, small and medium-sized
firms accounted for 70 percent of the total output value in 1998,
and provided 1,190 yuan for each farmer, or 55 percent of the per-
capita income.
</P>
<P>
Although some companies are small they have helped spur local
technological renovation and have become an important source of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Donghu High-Tech Development Zone and the Wuhan Economic
and Technological Development Zone, which are the home of many
private, high-tech businesses, had a combined industrial output
value of 1.8 billion yuan in the first 5 months of this year,
accounting for 21 percent of the province's total.

<HEADLINE> Competition Key to China's Success, Says WB Chief Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chief Economist of the
World Bank (WB), Joseph Stiglitz, cited competition as the key to
the huge success in China's reform policies over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a paper at the invitation of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, Stiglitz, who is also the WB's Vice Senior
President, said Sunday that "China's recent experience is one of
the greatest economic success stories in history."
</P>
<P>
The noted economist further expressed the belief that
competition is central to the success of any economy and has
played a big role in China's success in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
When comparing China's reform with that of the Russia, he said
China extended the scope of competition without privatizing state-
owned enterprises, whereas Russia privatized a large fraction of
its economy without doing much to promote competition.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, Russia's output is over 50 percent below
the level it had attained almost a decade ago, while China
sustained double-digit growth for almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said policy-makers of many transitional economies have
in the past given too much emphasis on privatizing public assets
to the neglect of the role of competition, which is vital for a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
He warned that privatization would not be able to improve
efficiency in the absence of necessary regulations and competition.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz further suggested that wherever possible, changes of
ownership structure should be preceded by the introduction of
greater competition.
</P>
<P>
Again on China, he said, the country is lucky, because its vast
market not only makes it possible for a large number of
enterprises to exist and compete in most industries, but also
attracts a large number of foreign firms competing to enter the
market, hence bring more benefits in both trade and investment to
China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he acknowledged that government-imposed and
historical barriers have resulted in competition not being as
strong as it might be in China.
</P>
<P>
For example, he noted, while competition in retail sector is
quite strong, it has remained limited at the wholesales level.
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that local and provincial authorities
sometimes take actions which impede competition and factor
mobility across provinces, making it more difficult to establish
nation-wide enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The WB Chief Economist said though China has done much to
establish the foundation of the market economy, enormous
challenges remain ahead, if there is to be long-term sustainable
and equitable growth.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues that have to be attacked are the creation of
effective regulatory structures and the development and
enforcement of strong competition policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz, who arrived here Wednesday as guest of the Chinese
Ministry of Finance, left China Sunday.

ANKARA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
Monday left Ankara for a one-day working visit to Egypt in a bid
to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Egypt, Demirel said that Turkey and
Egypt will sign 12 agreements or protocols on cooperation in the
political, economic and cultural fields during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Ankara attaches "great importance" to

the two main pillars of stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News Monday quoted Demirel as saying that Turkey
and Egypt should make the best of every opportunity to consolidate
peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>

"Turkey will continue to render strong support for the success
of the Middle East peace process. Egypt plays a significant and
constructive role and has made invaluable contributions in the

</P>
<P>
The Turkish president added that "we look forward to the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Likely to Form Larger Financial Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The ten financial
institutions which were recapitalized by Malaysia's Danamodal
Nasional Bhd (National Capital Fund Corporation) may be merged
among themselves, a Danamodal official said.
</P>
<P>
Danamodal, which was set up specially to recapitalize weak
banks, has to date injected 6.2 billion ringgit (1.63 billion U.S.
dollars) into the ten financial institutions -- MBf, RHB Bank,
Arab-Malaysian Bank, Oriental Bank Berhad, Arab-Malaysian Finance,
BSN Commercial, Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, United Merchant
Finance, Sabah Bank and Perdana Merchant Bankers.
</P>
<P>
The possible merger is in line with calls by the government for
financial institutions, particularly those that are small, to
merge into larger entities, Danamodal's managing director Mohamad
Daud Dol Moin said in Langkawi, northern Malaysia, Monday where
the four-day fourth Langkawi International Dialogue (LID) is
going on.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Daud is part of a specialist team that is giving its
hands-on experience in undertaking recovery measures at the LID
which kicked off Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We may merge the ten institutions among themselves," the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted him as telling
reporters during a break at the LID.
</P>
<P>
He said that by being bigger and well capitalized, they will be
well placed to take on international competition when Malaysia is
committed to further liberalize its financial services sector
under the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Mohamad Daud, Danamodal has received
very encouraging inquiries from global financial institutions to
take the financial institutions over or buy a strategic stake in
them and Danamodal has referred all the proposals submitted by the
large global financial institutions to the Ministry of Finance and
Bank Negara (State Bank) for further action.

sales, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The recovering economy has very positive impact on SMIs and
they are now in a position to borrow more to expand their capacity
and increase production," she said.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Small and Medium Industries Development Corporation
(SMIDEC) at the end of 1998 showed that the SMI sector has the
resilience to remain competitive and to make the adaptations to
meet the challenges brought about by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It was heartening to note that 89 percent of the small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) surveyed expressed confidence in
maintaining their competitiveness in the market," she said.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs are expected to contribute 19.7 percent to growth
domestic product (GDP) this year, Rafidah said, adding that the
figure was expected to be higher as the economy improves further.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that the economic crisis had resulted in the
closure of some SMI enterprises, particularly when tight monetary
policies were implemented, causing disruption in operations and
severe liquidity problems. By the end of last year, an estimated
10 percent of SMIs in the manufacturing sector had ceased
operation due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs most affected by the turmoil were those in the
machinery and engineering, and transport equipment industries,
particularly those dependent on domestic market.
</P>
<P>
SMIs undertaking exports or supplying to export-oriented larger
industries benefited from the cheaper ringgit against major
currencies, Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
The minister advised SMIs which are having difficulty in
getting financing from financial institutions to report to the
National Economic Action Council (NEAC).

KUNMING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The heavy rains that have hit
China's Yunnan Province have caused floods that have killed 31
people and affected more than 400,000 people in the northeastern
part.
</P>
<P>
They have affected some 26,700 ha. of farmland and disrupted
water and electricity supplies and telecommunications in some
counties.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan usually has a mild climate and even distribution of
rainfall, but in many parts there has been no rain since last
winter. Then, the first week of July, a change in the weather
brought heavy rainfall to several cities and counties, causing
economic losses worth 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists say that Yunnan could have the heaviest
flooding in decades this flood season. But, in the meantime,
because of the province's geographical variations, 400,000 ha. of
its 1.3 million ha. of farmland are still suffering from a severe
drought.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, floods and landslides in neighboring
Sichuan Province have killed 26 people since July and have
affected the lives of 1.79 million others and affected 80,600 ha.
of farmland in 34 counties, causing losses of 330 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Getting Funds To Cover Cost Of China's Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 44 billion yuan (5.3 billion
US dollars) has been raised for construction work on the dam at
the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of China's Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam Project began in 1993 and is expected to
cost 203.9 billion yuan. The main source of funds will be
increased electrical power charges.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, which
is in charge of the project, has made an effort to find new
channels and in the first six months of this year, got 3.4 billion
yuan from corporate bonds, interbank loans, and foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese banks have also helped support the project. The
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Construction Bank
of China, and Bank of China recently signed loan agreements with
the project developer. From 1999 to 2003, ICBC and the
Construction Bank of China each will provide the Project
Development Corporation with 4 billion yuan worth of commercial
loans.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam will be built in three stages and will
take 17 years to finish. By 2009, it will be the world's biggest
hydro-electric power plant both in total capacity and annual
average generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
There will be 26 generators with a per-unit generating capacity
of 700,000 kilowatts installed on the left and right banks of the
river. Overall generating capacity is estimated at 18.2 million
kilowatts and annual generating capacity is estimated at 84.68
billion kilowatt hours (KWH), or about a seventh of China's total
in 1992.

<P>
NANJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists working for the
military have developed a new mine detector that can be used under
various climatic and geological conditions.
</P>
<P>
The one-kilogram detector has 3 probes that can function in
temperatures from 40 degrees below zero Centigrade to 50 degrees
above zero.
</P>
<P>
By using the new device, Chinese troops have cleared mines from
a 2,000-sq-km area, without a single mishap.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in a Nanjing engineering research institute
belonging to the the People's Liberation Army's General Armament
Department spent 10 years developing the mine detector. The
scientists say that it can find various types of land mines
containing a tiny amount of metal.
</P>

ZHENGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector in central
China's Henan Province has reported improvements in profits and
efficiency in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Industry's profits were up 143 percent over last year's
corresponding period to 2.6 billion yuan, according to the
provincial statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Deficit-ridden enterprises managed to cut losses by 20 percent
on an annual basis and the state sector reported better
performance, with 377 million yuan in profits in the January to
June period, compared with losses of 424 million yuan for the same
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of these figures, a provincial official says that
industrial performance allows no optimism because the record
growth followed a drastic drop in industrial production last year
and there are still major problems such as increased marketing
costs, with some state enterprises operating in the red.

<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is ready for the 22nd
Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the first UPU
Congress to be held in China, the organizing committee says.
</P>
<P>
It will be held at the Beijing International Convention Center,
which has been equipped with a printing shop to print congress
materials, and improved facilities to ensure a supply of coffee
and other refreshments for the nearly 2,000 representatives from
188 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Continental Hotel, where most of the participants will stay,
has spent 5 million yuan improving its computer and telephone

foreign languages majors from universities in Beijing to work as
interpreters and receptionists.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, who is chairman of the organizing

<HEADLINE> Eight Feared Drowned in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is still searching
for eight people who might have got drowned after a fishing boat
capsized in Lake Victoria at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The boat capsized after a group of bandits attempted to rob the
fishing gear of the people on the boat with slash knives and
clubs, a local newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the struggle, the boat capsized and many fell into
water, Paul Ntobi, the regional police commander of Mara on the
southern border of the lake, was quoted by The Guardian as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ntobi said none of the bodies have been recovered but rescue
efforts are still going on.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, a canoe sailing in the same lake capsized
in a storm, leaving one person dead and seven others missing.

<HEADLINE> Most Immigrant Doctors Unemployed in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Immigrant doctors in New
Zealand are driving taxis and delivering pizza because they
cannot get registration to practice in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted in May and released recently by
the Alliance, an opposition political party in New Zealand, 89 out
of the 112 overseas trained doctors surveyed were unemployed and
receiving the unemployment benefit.
</P>
<P>
The 23 doctors with jobs were in low paid, manual work, often
part-time.
</P>
<P>
"Their positions included pizza delivery driver, taxi driver,
fruit picker, cleaner, laborer, casino dealer, cocktail maker,
fast food worker, factory worker, supermarket shelf-stacker,
newspaper delivery person, nurse aide and homecare giver," the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the doctors surveyed were from Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Medical Council of New Zealand only recognizes
qualifications from Australia, Canada, South Africa, Britain,
Ireland and the United States. It requires immigrant doctors from
other countries to pass written and clinical exams to qualify for
registration, even though the country's Qualifications Authority
recognizes their overseas qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, who are applying for registration, have to pay
high exam fees and have no help to study or get clinical
experience to prepare for the exams. The clinical exam fee alone
will cost 2,250 NZ dollars (about 1,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The exams are wide-ranging, covering areas which the doctors,
most with many years of experience, do not intend to practice in
their specialty areas.
</P>
<P>
The survey urges the Medical Council to take measures to solve
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Agro-industry to Get Boost in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government is working on
modalities to decentralize the supply of inputs so as to boost
agriculture in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Monday quoted Lusaka Province Minister Sonny
Mulenga as saying at the opening of the 19th provincial and
agriculture show over the weekend that transport costs would be
eliminated if inputs were taken close to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga also encouraged peasant farmers to concentrate on
growing traditional crops to create food security.
</P>
<P>
Small scale farmers who grow 75 percent of maize in the country
should take agriculture as a business if they are to succeed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for small scale farmers to form
cooperatives, saying very few farmers have taken advantage of the
cooperatives act which was introduced in parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga further re-affirmed the government's commitment to
supporting small scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the show chairman Duncan Chataya disclosed that the
1998/1999 agriculture season is expected to produce about 100,000
tons of maize.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the late supply of inputs by the food
reserve agency of the country.

<HEADLINE> Wool Trading to Go Live on Internet in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Wool growers and buyers in New
Zealand will soon be able to do business on the Internet in what
the country's wool industry claims is a world first, the Dominion
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Woolnet, to go live in September, will cut selling costs and
open new business opportunities, the Wellington-based newspaper
quoted Lance Wiggins, managing director of developer WoolPro, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
WoolPro is a subsidiary of the New Zealand Wool Group.
</P>
<P>
Wiggins said Woolnet will present large volumes of wool to
international processors keen to work directly with growers.
</P>
<P>
Buyers must have a New Zealand bank account, he said, adding
transactions will be conducted privately in the database, not on
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
On delivery date, the buyers will confirm the wool has arrived
and the bank transaction will go ahead, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
He said the money will stay in a trust account of ASB Bank, a
bank in New Zealand, for 48 hours while levies and any charges are
deducted. The grower will then get the balance. WoolPro's
commission will be half the present commission costs.
</P>
<P>
Registrations will be taken from the first week in August and
demonstration in wool growing centers will start this week,
according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Trade Deficit Reaches New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's trade deficit
has reached a new record high of 1.7 billion NZ dollars (over 900
million U.S. dollars) in the year to June 1999, Statistics New
Zealand said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The result was much worse than local economists had expected,
with the consensus among a poll of analysts being 1.49 billion NZ
dollars (790 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The disappointing news released by the government statistical
organ pushed down the NZ dollar from 0.5315 U.S. dollar to 0.5299
U.S. dollar in local foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show New Zealand has gone on an imports spending
spree in the year, while its export sector has remained flat. In a
year, the deficit has widened from 599 million NZ dollars (318
million U.S. dollars) to 1.7 billion NZ dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local economists had expected a better result because New
Zealand's June monthly trade figures usually show an improvement.
The country has not recorded a deficit for the month of June in
13 years, but in June 1999 it spent 188 million NZ dollars (100
million U.S. dollars) more than it exported.
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in car imports was the main reason, according
to Statistics New Zealand. Spending on foreign cars has climbed
since the New Zealand government removed tariffs on them last
year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has also been hit by the weak NZ dollar,
which fell three percent in June.

<HEADLINE> Probe Into Soeharto Halted if No Evidence Found, Says Indonesian Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's acting Attorney
General Ismudjoko Monday said probe into former president Soeharto
would be halted if no evidence was found.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't find enough evidence, of course, the inquiries
will be halted," Ismudjoko said during a hearing with House of
Representatives Commission I on law, security and foreign affairs
here.
</P>
<P>
He said he found many technical problems in the inquiries
because the violations had occurred long time ago.
</P>
<P>
Ismudjoko, whose office is in charge of the probe, said last
week that his office has taken a humane stance and suspended the
probe, citing the ill health of the former president.
</P>
<P>
"Let him rest until he really recovers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 78, was admitted to the Pertamina Hospital here on
July 20 after complaining of severe headaches, and doctors said he
had suffered a light stroke.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced to quit in May last year, is accused
of massive corruption during his 32-year reign.

<HEADLINE> Internet Brings Chinese Scientists At Sea Closer To Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 26 (Xinhua) -- When the great Chinese
navigator Zheng He sailed to Southeast Asia 600 years ago, his
crew knew that they would live in isolation for years. Nowadays,
crew members on China's first expedition to the North Pole are in
daily contact with their family members these days.
</P>
<P>
The ship's computer center routinely helps members of the
expedition communicate with their colleagues and share feelings
about maritime life with friends and relatives, via satellite
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Zou Bin, in charge of e-mail, says that e-mail is
received and sent four times a day and because satellite signals
are sometimes weak, 4 other scientists monitor the satellite
system when e-mail is sent or received.
</P>
<P>
Some team members have brought digital cameras and can send
pictures from the ship, the Snow Dragon, to wives, husbands,
children or parents in Beijing, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Xiamen,
Hangzhou and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
There are two computers on the 34-year-old captain's desk, one
desk-top, one portable, where he spends his free time. He set up
an information website that became popular with the crew in no
time and many of the scientists have added their manuscripts to
the website, which contains weather reports, research projects,
pictures, popular science information, humorous news reports, the
week's menu, entertainment, and news from home.
</P>
<P>
If one measured the distance between the North Pole and Beijing
in a straight line, it would be 5,582 kilometers, according to
Prof. E Dongchen, of Wuhan's Surveying and Mapping University, the
expedition's assistant leader, but computers have shortened the
distance.

</P>
<P>
Komura said the development of the two countries' relations is

<HEADLINE> China Urges ARF to Focus on Confidence Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said at the Sixth ASEAN Regional Forum here on Monday that
the forum should continue to focus on confidence building and
China supports ASEAN in continuing to play a leading role in this
aspect.
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge scope for developing and deepening cooperation
in confidence building among ARF participants," Tang said at the
one-day forum.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts in this field should continue in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-pacific, peace, development and cooperation
continue to be policy objectives of most countries, and
multilateral security dialogue and cooperation in the region have
maintained a fairly good momentum and confidence-building
cooperation in specific areas is being implemented one by one, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But "some destabilizing factors have developed further. The
Cold-War mentality has by no means died out in the regional
political and security arena," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"The tendencies of strengthening military alliances and
resorting to intervention against the historical trend are
growing. And the arms race has also shown the tendency of coming
back," he told the forum, which is being attended by foreign
ministers from ASEAN's 10 member countries, its 10 dialogue
partners including China, Russia, Japan and the United States, and
Mongolia and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
ARF members have made useful explorations over the years on how
to strengthen cooperation and promote stability under the new
circumstances, and these exploratory efforts, though still in the
nascent stage, have already produced new security concepts and new
security-seeking modalities in embryo, he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the main points as the following:
</P>
<P>
-- First, to abide by the purposes and spirit of the U.N.
Charter and other universally recognized norms governing
international relations, respect each other and treat each other
as equals.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability in the Asia-pacific are dependent on many
factors, and the most important one is the development of
state-to-state relations on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence. It is all the more important for major
countries shouldering important responsibilities for regional and
international peace to establish and develop long-term stable and
healthy relations with one another on the basis of these
principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asian people have had painful and unforgettable memories of
the strong bullying the weak and willful foreign interference into
their internal affairs, which should not be the choice for
building peace in the Asia-Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Second, to conduct dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of
seeking common ground while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
The ARF is made up of countries of different size and they
differ in values and social system and do not share exactly the
same security interests and concepts. In view of the diversity in
the Asia-Pacific, the main issue affecting security in the region
is still lack of trust among nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Differences should not become obstacles to cooperation, he
said. "It is precisely because there are differences that there is
a need for countries to increase dialogue and deepen mutual
understanding, and herein lie the main element and effective way
for security cooperation in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Without building up confidence, multilateral security
cooperation will have no chance of making continuous progress, nor
will it be able to truly play its role," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Third, to resolve disputes between states through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific is faced with traditional and new security
problems and the best way to resolve the disputes for good is
through peaceful means instead of resorting to force. To
strengthen military alliances and build up armament will only
aggravate distrust among countries, give rise to new instability
and even generate confrontation, he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Fourth, to seek gradual progress and adopt decisions by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
While people have different views and expectations about the
process of security dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific,
its pace of progress and what it should cover, China believes that
a more ideal model is one of gradual progress, consensus, taking
on easier questions first and accommodating the comfort level of
various sides, as advocated by ASEAN, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is to this model that we should, to a significant extent,
attribute the achievements that the ARF has scored in a short
period of five years while it took other regional organizations
decades to make the same progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
In short, the multilateral security dialogue and cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific should aim at and feature mutual respect instead
of the strong bullying the weak, mutual cooperation instead of
confrontation; and seeking consensus instead of imposing one's own
views on others, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the afore-mentioned Chinese assessment and the
conditions in the region, we maintain that the forum should
continue to focus on the building of confidence," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China favors and supports the ARF progress toward its
established objectives. At the inception of the ARF, China
expressed its opinion in favor of a three-stage development plan
for the forum and this position remains unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for whether to launch the discussion on the preventive
diplomacy, the Chinese side believes that it is necessary to first
discuss fully the concept, definition, principles and scope of the
preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region so as to reach a
basic consensus," he said.
</P>
<P>
The whole process of the ARF and all its activities should be
consistent with its purpose and nature, namely ARF is a political
and diplomatic forum aiming to enhance understanding and trust and
promote dialogue and cooperation, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
China fully affirms the progress made by the ARF in the past
five years, he said. "Despite the difficulties it faces, ASEAN is
still giving great attention to and vigorously promoting the
regional security dialogue and cooperation. We highly appreciate
what ASEAN has done and firmly support it in continuing to play a
leading role in the forum."
</P>
<P>
As a member of the region and a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council, China always attaches great importance to peace
and stability in the region and has made consistent efforts to
maintain them, the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
China has over the past year taken an active part in various
ARF activities, put forward new proposals on confidence building
and sponsored some cooperation projects, he said, adding that
China has also maintained a good momentum of good neighborliness
and friendship with its surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
The stability and development of China itself is its biggest
contribution to regional peace and security, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
The ARF serves as a multilateral consultative forum aimed at
promoting confidence building, developing preventive diplomacy and
working out approaches to conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the 22-member ARF, which was initiated in 1993,
are discussing regional and international security issues.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Poll Results Not Endorsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Elections
Commission (KPU) Monday failed to endorse the results of the June
7 parliamentary election because less than the required two-thirds
of KPU members signed the results finally compiled earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Of the 53 KPU members, 22, including five government
representatives and five major political parties' representatives,
signed the poll results and three others abstained. KPU Chairman
Rudini, leader of the Deliberation, Work and Cooperation Party,
and representatives of other 27 minor political parties rejected
the results.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1999 General Election Law, if less than two-thirds of
the KPU members sign, the results cannot be declared officially
valid.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the commission will constitutionally
render the responsibility to the president if it fails to validate
the poll results.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie will take over the election
commission's responsibility to sign the election results if the
election commission refuses to do it," State Secretary/Minister of
Justice Muladi said recently.
</P>
<P>
The June 7 general election was Indonesia's first democratic
poll since 1955 and was carried out smoothly, without the feared
mass bloodshed. But the count had been beset by delays.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Election Committee (PPI) has concluded the vote
count on July 15, giving the bulk of the 462 seats at stake to
five major parties. The main opposition Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI-P) came in first with 33.74 percent of
votes, followed by the ruling Golkar Party with 22.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in third place is the National Awakening Party with
12.61 percent, followed by the United Development Party (10.71
percent) and the National Mandate Party (7.12 percent).
</P>
<P>
However, the PPI election returns are tentative because the
final results will be issued by the KPU.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election to
compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives
(DPR). The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the military, whose
members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Court Gives Citizens Greater Access To Court Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court announced recently that anyone above the age of 18
can have a look at documents related to the court's decisions, to
ensure the fairness of its judgments.
</P>
<P>
These documents include all those used during a trial or
resulting from it, the court explains.
</P>
<P>
Ma Aidi, head of the court, says that giving citizens access to
court documents is a very positive move because it puts their work
under closer scrutiny by the people.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing court has been working seriously to increase the
transparency of its trial procedures for several years, and
granting citizens greater access has been regarded as an important
move since June of last year, when the court first allowed
citizens to sit in on trials.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,700 people have witnessed the proceedings in some 23,00
cases, according to the court, and for the past year the court has
received fewer complaints or appeals against its verdicts, showing
that the court has improved its work, a court spokesman says.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Starts Three-day U.S. Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin arrived on Sunday in the United States, starting his
three-day U.S. visit aimed at mending the Russian-U.S. relations
strained by NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Seattle, Stepashin had talks with Boeing and
Microsoft and he is scheduled to fly here Tuesday to meet U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's visit is the first by a Russian prime minister
since his predecessor Yevgeny Primakov turned back to Russia on
the way to the United States after NATO started bombing Yugoslavia
in March.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing has pushed the Russian-U.S. ties to its lowest
since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's visit will be another effort to repair the ties
after Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin met in
Germany during G-8 summit last month.
</P>
<P>
Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Gore, told reporters
on Friday that the meeting between Gore and Stepashin will focus
on security-related and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Russians need to be talking to each other about the
passage of START II...new things in relationship to all kinds of
weapons but also in relationship to defensive weapons and
ballistic missile defense, a new ABM Treaty," Fuerth said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin is also due to meet with officials of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine of Newsweek said in its Sunday edition that
Stepashin hoped to receive 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in loans from
the IMF during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was quoted as saying that Moscow's relationship with
NATO is at an "impasse."
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned with NATO expansion eastward," Stepashin
said, adding that serious damage has been done by the U.S.-led
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to the Russian-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> India's Cotton Exports to Fall in 98-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- India's cotton exports are
likely to fall further in the 1998-1999 cotton year and may touch
150,000 bales due to the low international prices and poor
quality.
</P>
<P>
After a commendable export performance of 1.687 million bales
in 1996-97, exports were down to a mere 350,000 bales in the
following year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian Cotton Mills' Federation (ICMF), many
cotton mills already closed down between April 1998 and May 1999
and more may follow.
</P>
<P>
The demand for domestic cotton has also taken a beating
following an increase in imports and this has made the going even
more difficult for millers.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of the year ending this September,
exports so far have been only 66,000 bales and the ICMF believes
that total exports would not exceed 150,000 bales during the
current cotton year.
</P>
<P>
According to ICMF estimates, Indian cotton prices are about
10-15 percent higher than the international price.

The South Korean group, which has undertaken a major financial

<HEADLINE> Balkan FMs Propose Special EU Fund for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Albania,
Bulgaria and Macedonia on Sunday recommended that the European
Union establish a regional facility to provide financial resources
for reconstruction projects in Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, contained in a Joint Position on the
Implementation of the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe and
adopted by the three ministers after a meeting in Sofia on Sunday,
will be presented to an international summit on the Stability Pact
scheduled for July 30 in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The document proposes that the EU create a concrete fund to
meet the urgent needs of the Balkan countries worst affected by
the NATO military campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers suggested that each country in the region
should establish an investment fund for financing of
infrastructure projects implemented in the country, and that the
fund would be accumulated from the payments of the respective
country's financial obligations to the Paris Club and other
creditors.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that projects of regional and cross-border
importance should be financed within the framework of the
Stability Pact.
</P>
<P>
Such projects include Corridor No.8 (highways, railways,
telecommunications and oil pipelines linking the three countries),
construction of a power cable line connecting the three countries
and interconnection of their power grids.
</P>
<P>
"Don't expect specific amounts of money to be named in Sarajevo.
Mostly political decisions will be made there," Albanian Foreign
Minister Paskal Milo told reporters after the Sofia meeting.
</P>
<P>
But he said he believed that the Stability Pact summit will
pave the way for talks on the specific projects, scheduled to
start in September.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova said the Sarajevo
summit will mark the beginning of an arduous road for the
countries in the region to move along together.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov noted that, as
usual, the money for reconstruction will be less than the spending
on war and devastation.
</P>
<P>
The three agreed to host different working tables for tackling
separate issues, on democratization, economic reconstruction and
security, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers' meeting, the first of its kind, was
initiated by Macedonia. The next one will take place in Albania.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's road death toll rose
to 503 persons during the first quarter of 1999, of whom 182 were
pedestrians, according to the latest statistics issued Sunday by
the Sri Lankan Department of Road.
</P>
<P>
The next highest category of road deaths were motorcycle riders
of whom 88 were killed during this period.
</P>
<P>
The statistics for the first quarter of this year of the
all-island accidents revealed that there had been 503 fatal, 844
grievous, 2,800 non-grievously injured and 8,937 damage causing
accidents.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the pedestrians and motorcycle riders who were
killed, 20 pillion riders, 69 pedal cyclists, 48 drivers, 77
passengers and 19 others were also killed in accidents.
</P>
<P>
Following the increase in the number of vehicles and
consequently the number of accidents in the country, it is
proposed to introduce a new demerit, driver improvement point
system.
</P>
<P>
Under this system, traffic offenses will be categorized and
given minus points on the seriousness of the offense which will
lead finally to the cancellation of licenses for repeated
offenses.

<HEADLINE> China Vows Not to Tolerate Action for "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people will not tolerate any action for "Taiwan independence" or
any attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland, Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan told a regional security forum here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"China's territory and sovereignty are indivisible and brook no
violation or interference," Tang said at the Sixth ASEAN Regional
Forum.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, which is a
historical fact and also the consensus of the international
community, Tang said. "The Taiwan question is purely an internal
matter of China."
</P>
<P>
"If there occur any action for Taiwan independence and any
attempt by foreign forces to separate Taiwan from the motherland,
the Chinese government and people will not sit back and do
nothing," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A stable, developed and reunified China is a positive factor
for peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region, Tang told
the 22-member forum, which is being attended by ASEAN's 10
members, its 10 dialogue partners including China, Russia, Japan
and the United States, and Mongolia and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved by the age-old Chinese civilization that
prosperity and development are associated with unity, while war
and conflict come with separation," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"To stick to the one China principle is the basis for
stabilizing and developing the cross-straits relations, is where
the fate of the Chinese nation lies and bears on tranquillity of
the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To act against this principle and against the historical trend
will not enjoy popular support and is doomed to failure," Tang
added.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the one-day meeting of the ARF, which was
initiated in 1993, are discussing regional and international

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's State Oceanographic Bureau
has reported that the red tides along China's northern and
southern coasts have started to recede, but it has warned that the
pollution still exists.
</P>
<P>
The red tide measuring about 680 square kilometers at its
largest extent has disappeared from waters south of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, said a report of today's
China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the large areas of algae blanketing 400 sq. km. of
sea waters off Raoping, south China's Guangdong Province, have
begun to shrink after persisting for two weeks, and it may take
another three to four days for it to disappear, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"However, during this period, the algae may emit toxic
substances while it dies and decays, polluting the sea water and
sharply reducing the oxygen content in the water, " Qian Honglin,
vice-director of the SOB's South China Sea Bureau, was quoted as
warning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have been tracking the development of the
red tide in the past week, and advising local fishermen on how to
avoid or reduce economic losses resulting from the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Fish breeders had already taken the precaution of moving their
fish and other aquatic products to safer waters, thus reducing the
economic losses.

HEFEI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of Science

five times the amount it now gets over the next three years,
according to a decision made Sunday jointly by the Ministry of
Education, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
The university is now a leader in synchronous radiation and
high-temperature superconductor research, and also operates many

</P>
<P>
Fully one-seventh of the academicians at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering below the age of
60 are graduates of the university.
</P>
<P>
However, this is only one of ten universities which will
benefit from the Ministry's "Transcentury Project." Beijing
University, Qinghua University, Nanjing University, Fudan
University, and the Shanghai Jiaotong University are also included
in the project.
</P>
<P>
"These universities are crucial for the acceleration of the
educational level in China, and we aim to make them world-class
institutions within the next three years, schools which will
nurture talent and engage in high-level research projects in the
next century," said Minister of Education Chen Zhili.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Houses Torched in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Maluku provincial
capital of Ambon has turned to a dead city following a clash
between the residents of Poka village and those living in the
Perumnas housing complex on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses, shops and small stalls in Poka village of
Baguala subdistrict and two cars were vandalized and set ablaze
following the clash, according to the Antara News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
Six people were injured during the clash in which the rival
parties used machetes, lances and arrows.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted local inhabitants as saying the clash was
triggered by their impatience due to the stone-pelting to their
houses by a group of unidentified people in the last four days.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the violence was a follow-up to the
stone-pelting toward the inhabitants of Perumnas on July 23.
</P>
<P>
Although the clash had been settled and under the control of
security personnel, the city was practically abandoned by its
residents.
</P>
<P>
Shops along the main streets and some supermarkets and
department stores were closed while no traders were seen on the
sidewalks. Only few public transport vehicles were operating while
security guards were on alert at strategic points prone to unrest.
</P>
<P>
The incident forced some 1,000 inhabitants in the area to take
refuge in some houses of worship, military installations and
university premises.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested at least 36 people allegedly caught
committing arson and carrying weapons, including home-made
firearms. Security authorities also seized dozens of swords,
arrows, spears and firearms from the conflicting groups.
</P>
<P>
The situation was still tense on Sunday afternoon as some
houses were still burning, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed hundreds of people this
year.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. Most
of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.

<P>
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has called for increased efforts
in flood control along the Yangtze River. The call was made in a
speech delivered at a conference on flood-control work on July 13,
which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that he was "very concerned" about the flood-control
situation along the Yangtze, and that three points need to be
emphasized to overcome floods this year: conducting a sound
analysis of the flood-control situation, drafting thorough plans
and making good preparations for flood-prevention, and ensuring
the quality of water control projects.
</P>
<P>
"The flood-control work is of great significance this year
since we are to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of
New China, and Macao is expected to return to the embrace of the
motherland," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
-- A commentator's article calls for strengthened discipline of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the process of solving the
Falun Gong problem.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that some Party members have
participated in Falun Gong activities and some even became leading
members in the illegal organization, bringing a negative influence
on society.
</P>
<P>
This situation requires the strengthening of the Party
discipline to tackle the slackness among some Party organizations,
the article says, adding it is critical that the Falun Gong
problem be first dealt with from within the Party.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- A commentator's article released by Xinhua News Agency
points out that Lee Teng-hui, a man widely condemned for his
separatist remarks, is indeed a "troublemaker" who has sabotaged
relations across the Taiwan Straits and jeopardized the stability
of the Straits and the island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has become extremely isolated. He and his
followers have tried to ease the pressure from anti-separatists
and people against the "independence of Taiwan" by whitewashing
his separatist remarks and activities with sophism, saying that
his "two States" remarks only demonstrate the "facts", and that
the Taiwan authorities have not changed their policy toward the
mainland, and intend to further promote talks and negotiations
across the Taiwan Straits. But their self-contradictory words just
do not hold water, the article says.
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council and other departments have expressed
their support for the government's stand on the issue of Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and their discussions
focused on bilateral relations and the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Tang is in Singapore for the Sixth ASEAN Regional Forum, the
Post-Ministerial Conference and the China-ASEAN Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
-- The Falun Gong organization, apart from its illegal status,
has also violated the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens,
according to leading Chinese legal experts.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong organization have violated the
human rights of its followers by preaching against taking medicine
and consulting doctors, said Wang Liming, professor at the Law
School of the Beijing-based Remin University of China.

These measures include further improving investment environment,
giving priority to huge investment projects, working hard to
assist the province's 61 large state-owned enterprises in
attracting foreign investment, and encouraging non-state-owned
enterprises to use foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Increase in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents continue to increase
at an alarming rate, with more than 6,000 deaths annually in the
past five years, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News Monday
quoted Vietnam's National Traffic Safety Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commission's statistics show that 19,975 traffic accidents
occurred throughout the country in 1998, resulting in 6,067 deaths
and more than 22,700 injuries.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, 2,883 people were killed
and 10,999 injured in 9,656 road accidents across the country.
</P>
<P>
The commission blamed speeding for 33 percent of these cases,
violations of traffic rules and regulations for 38 percent,
driving under the influence of alcohol for 8.5 percent and other
reasons, including old vehicles and equipment, for the remaining
20 plus percent.
</P>
<P>
The commission cited poor driving conditions on roads and
bridges, careless driving and a lack of comprehension of traffic
regulations as main causes of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Narrow, poorly-maintained roads also underlie the increase in
the number of traffic accidents, they said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also pointed to the disregard of most motorists
for other vehicles, drivers and traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said it is necessary to educate people to
abide by the traffic laws.

<HEADLINE> Pele: Brazil to Quit Bid for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer legend Pele
suggested on Sunday that Brazil should quit from its bid for the
2006 World Cup considering the current economic situation and the
existing sports facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Arrived here for the second under-15 continental soccer
tournament, Pele said that Brazil has only one stadium that meets
the requirement for World Cup tournament, and his country was also
adversely affected by the financial crisis in Asia, and not ready
to invest much for the sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
The former Brazilian sports minister said that he will not
support Brazilian bid for the moment as his country is unable to
host such a gathering within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Africa should have the priviledges to host the
World Cup as it has never been held in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Germany, Britain, South Africa, Morocco and Brazil
are bidding for the hosting right for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Eight teams from Brazil, Italy, Colombia, Spain, the United
States, Ecuador, Portugal and hosts Venezuela are competing in the
nine-day under-15 continental soccer tournament.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuauhtemoc Blanco scored four
goals to pace the hosts Mexico for a dominating 5-1 victory over
Saudi Arabia in the Confederations Cup here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At Azteca stadium, Blanco put the hosts ahead with two goals in
the first 18 minutes before Jose Manuel Abundis scored the third
in the 21st minute with a long shot.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Mexico didn't lose its aggressiveness as
Saudi Arabia had little control of the ball.
</P>
<P>
After Saudi forward Marzouk Al-Otaibi converted a penalty kick
in the 63rd minute, Blanco countered four minutes later with
another goal on a header and completed his scoring spree in the
77th minute with another header.
</P>
<P>
After each goal, Blanco flipped up his jersey to display what
appeared to be a photo of his son printed on a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
"I told them in the locker room at halftime that they should go
out there thinking we were tied 0-0, and that they should keep
looking for goals, that should be an attitude we have in every
match," Mexcian manager Manuel Lapuente said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi manager Milan Macala said "we played a good game after
going 0-3 in those 20 minutes of constant Mexican attacks. We
managed to score, but that fourth goal seemed to kill our morale."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egypt tied Bolivia 2-2 in Group A.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Finance Minister John
Fahey Monday confirmed that the federal government was considering
a national health inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Fahey said that the government was looking at the proposal and
that Health Minister Michael Wooldridge would make a decision
after examining the benefits that might flow from an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"The government has always recognized health as a priority," he
 said on the ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Whether there is a need for a wide-ranging inquiry is
something the minister will examine and make a decision on in due
course," he added.

<P>
Australia's state and territory leaders last week called for a
Productivity Commission inquiry into the health system.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Prime Minister John Howard responded at the time
that the states were creating a false sense of crisis. He said
rational solutions were needed, rather than "saber rattling."
</P>
<P>
Fahey also said on Monday that the government had put an
enormous amount of effort into health.
</P>
<P>
"We have ensured there is a considerable boost in funding to
the states for health," he said.

<P>
ROME, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States defeated Italy for
a dominating 4-1 victory in Ancona on Sunday, setting up its final
clash against Russia for the top honor of the women's Federation
Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
As Monica Seles lost her first singles and withdrew from the
tournament later, it became a sister act for the United States in
the tournament as Venus and Serena Williams recorded their three
straight wins in the reversed singles and doubles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Venus and Serena Williams routed their opponents by identical 6-
1, 6-1 scores before they teamed up to win the doubles 6-2, 6-2
against Adriana Serra Zanetti and Tathiana Garbin.
</P>
<P>
With Venus' win in the opening singles, the sisters accounted
for the four victories that sent the U.S. team into the finals
against Russia, which beat Slovakia 3-2 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
With the sisters making their Fed Cup debut, the U.S. squad
went into the match heavily favored. An upset victory over Monica
Seles raised a faint hope for the Italians, but it was quickly
dashed by the overwhelming performance by the sisters.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams defeated Rita Grande in just 50 minutes, after
Venus Williams downed Italian top player Silvia Farina in 51
minutes including five games at love.
</P>
<P>
Serena, originally designated to play only doubles with her
sister, was appointed to replace Seles after she was diagnosed
with tendinitis in her right arm and lost her first singles to
Farina.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who have won the Fed Cup 15 times, will play
Russia on September 18-19 in California.

<P>
WINNIPEG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Unglamorous American Bernard
Williams snared up the gold medal for the Pan Am glamour event --
men's 100m race while Chandra Sturrup from Bahamas contributed her
country's first gold by clinching the women's title.
</P>
<P>
Williams, apparently not affected by two false starts, turned
in a strong finish to wrap up the victory, producing a sharp kick
with 20 meters remaining to win in 10.08 seconds, his personal
best.
</P>
<P>
Williams, pre-tournament underdog to his fellow American
Timothy Harden who placed fourth and Canadian Brad McCuaig, who
was disappointingly buried at the bottom, billed the win as his "
best ever victory".
</P>
<P>
"I relaxed before the race but tonight tried my best running
for gold," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Mayola Fernandez had a blazing start and also posted his
personal best of 10.10, but had to settle for the silver. Top
qualifier Claudinei Silva of Brazil took the bronze 0.03 seconds
further adrift.
</P>
<P>
The field was considered relatively weak as all the sprint big
names including world record holder American Maurice Greene opting
not to compete.
</P>
<P>
Bahamas' Sturrup overcame a stumbling start to win the women's
100m in 11.10, showing her talents midway through and storming to
the finish line ahead of American Angela Williams in 11.16.
</P>
<P>
Jamacain P.A.Dowdie placed the third with at 11.20.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier men's 800m race, American Johnny Cray scored a
photo finish victory over his Cuban opponent N. Tellez Santana,
setting a new Games record of 1:45.38 to take the gold. Santana,
narrowly beaten up with a time of 1:45.40, had to settle for the
silver.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Cautious about Pan Am Olympic Qualifier Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- It is a good idea to add more
Olympic qualifiers to the Pan Am Games but it will take time, says
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must go step by step, because all the sports are different,
" the IOC chief said on his tour to the ongoing Pan Am Games. "It
can be a good idea."
</P>
<P>
Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports
Organization, said earlier this week that making the every sport
in the Games an Olympic qualifier was the key to the Games'
survival.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 28 Olympic sports being held at this event serve
as Olympic qualifiers, including baseball, water polo, cycling,
shooting and volleyball, pushing up the caliber of the competition.
Some bigger sports that would attract more attention, such as
basketball, have separate qualifying tournaments.
</P>
<P>
But Samaranch was more cautious than his old friend Rana.
</P>
<P>
The most powerful man in the international sports admitted the
Pan Am Games are in perfect position to act as qualifiers because
they are held a year before the Olympics. But he said the trick is
to convince the separate international federations, who are trying
to cash in on their qualifying tournament to make money.
</P>
<P>
Pan Am organization had strenuously lobbied to have the
Winnipeg basketball competitions doubling as the qualifying
tournament for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but unfortunately, the
Confederation of Pan American Basketball Associations (COPABA),
the ruling body for basketball in North and South America,
reportedly demanded more than three million US dollars for the
right to host the Olympic qualifier.
</P>
<P>
That price tag turned out to be too high for Pan Am organizers
who was finally forced to give up.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch knew that much better than to make a quick judgment
on the Olympic qualifier idea.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard, who spent yesterday watching sports that caught
his interest and presenting the medals, said he likes Winnipeg,
capital of Manitoba Province and center Canada's heartland.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed the city," he said. "The wonderful opening ceremony.
"
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to see three or four more sports before he
leaves.

<HEADLINE> McCuaig Ready to Shine in Bailey's Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Brad McCuaig is grateful and glad
that Donovan Bailey isn't here. The sprinter from Calgary, Canada
now got the chance to step out of shadow and shine on his own.
</P>
<P>
The up-and-coming sprint star went into tonight's men's 100m
race at University of Manitoba Stadium as the lone Canadian
qualifier after managing to finish the second in his semifinal
yesterday. His qualifying time stood 10.48 seconds, well off the
10.18 he clocked at the Canadian national championships on the
same track barely a month ago.
</P>
<P>
But with the celebrated Olympic champion Bailey opting not to
compete in the 100m, McCuaig says it's his time to shine.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be 'Let it loose (today) in the final.' I'm
running to medal and I feel good." The 28-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
McCuaig, member of the Canadian 4X100m Olympics gold-winning
quartet in 1996, said he has no ill will towards Bailey. In fact,
he said Bailey's decision have led to his greatest accomplishments
on the track.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted the absence of the former world record holder
from the Pan Am Games until he competes in the relay next week isn
't a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting here giving a press conference and he's not,"
McCuaig laughed. "It's kind of good. I'm trying to look at the
good side of a bad situation... Donovan's decision-making seems to
be working for him. But I'm not in any kind of position to turn
down an opportunity to represent Canada at anything."
</P>
<P>
"I love being on the national team. For me, it's a dream I'm
living right now."
</P>
<P>
Bailey snubbed an official approach to represent his country in
Pan Am 100m event after being overlooked for the glamour event by
the Canadian Athletics Federation (CAF) because he finished behind
Bruny Surin and McCuaig at the nationals.
</P>
<P>
After Surin pulled out to concentrate on the world
championships in Seville, Spain next month, the CAF went back to
Bailey who refused emphatically.
</P>
<P>
The best qualifying time for the final starting 7:30 PM today
came from Claudinei Silva's 10.19 seconds.
