<HEADLINE> 31 Acts Announced for Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woodstock '99 will be busting with bands  
appealing to an audience not even born when the original concert 
took place 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dave Matthews Band, Jewel, Metallica and Alanis Morissette  
are among those appearing at the three-day Woodstock '99 festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect about 250,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three more days of mud, noise and logistical nightmares?''  
said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. ``Wouldn't miss it for the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festival is scheduled for July 23-25 at Griffiss Park, an  
abandoned Air Force base about 50 miles west of Albany. Ticket 
sales begin April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will also feature Korn, Limp Bizkit, Fatboy Slim, Sugar  
Ray, Creed, Counting Crows, Rage Against the Machine, Rusted Root, 
the Brian Setzer Orchestra, George Clinton and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the acts that played the original Woodstock, held in  
Bethel in 1969, were among the performers for the latest show. 
</P>
<P>
	Six acts that played the 25-year anniversary concert, which drew  
an estimated 350,000 people to Saugerties, N.Y., are coming back: 
Metallica, Aerosmith, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sheryl Crow, Live and 
Collective Soul. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also promise better security than at the first two  
Woodstocks, which were overrun by gatecrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is a fortress,'' said promoter John Scher of  
Metropolitan Entertainment. ``It's about as hard to get into as it 
is to get out of a prison.''

<HEADLINE> Condren, Zito Seek 3rd Derby Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- William Condren is content. He's in  
Kentucky in the spring with a Derby hopeful, and he is involved 
with two men he calls friends. 
</P>
<P>
	One is George M. Steinbrenner, the boss of the New York Yankees,  
who sold Condren an interest in Wondertross, who was bred in 
Kentucky by Steinbrenner's Kinsman Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is trainer Nick Zito.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nick knows a lot about the first Saturday in May,'' Condren  
said Wednesday outside of Zito's barn at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wondertross, second by a nose to Vicar in the Florida Derby  
March 13, runs well in the Toyota Blue Grass on Saturday, on May 1 
he will parade to the strains of ``My Kentucky Home.'' Condren and 
Zito will wait anxiously to see if the colt can put them into the 
Derby winner's circle for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a first Derby victory for Steinbrenner, who has  
owned three starters and co-owned another. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito won the race in 1991 with Strike the Gold and in 1994 with  
Go for Gin. Condren co-owned both colts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's doubtful if anybody gets more of a kick out of the Derby  
than Zito, who grew up on the streets of New York. Some trainers 
will tell you, or try to tell you, the Derby is not that big a 
deal. Zito is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito can get emotional just talking about the Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to finish off the `90s the right way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That would be by snapping a tie with trainers Bob Baffert and D.  
Wayne Lukas for the most Derby wins in the 1990s. Baffert, of 
course, won the last two Derbies with Silver Charm and Real Quiet. 
Lukas won with Thunder Gulch in 1994 and with Grindstone in 1996. 
He also won with the filly Winning Colors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing off the `90s the right way for Zito might not be the  
right way for Condren and Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito could also win the Derby with Stephen Go Even, owned by  
Stephen Hilbert. Stephen Go Even has won all three starts this 
year, including an impressive win in the Gallery Furniture.com 
Stakes on March 27 at Turfway Park. His next start will be in the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has two Derby starters in General Challenge and Prime  
Timber, 1-2, respectively, in last Saturday's Santa Anita Derby. 
Lukas has Charismatic, fourth at Santa Anita, in the Derby and he 
probably will have Cat Thief, who will start in the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Condren got into this year's Derby picture because of Zito and  
Steinbrenner's son, Hank, who runs his father's racing and breeding 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wondertross finished second in the Remsen on Nov. 28 at  
Aqueduct in the final start of his four-race 2-year-old campaign -- 
during which he won twice -- Steinbrenner got offers to sell an 
interest in the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``George was not interested in a partnership,'' Condren said.  
``But Hank convinced his father that it was commercially prudent to 
sell a portion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condren recalled that Steinbrenner told his son, ``Call Nick  
Zito,'' with whom Steinbrenner has had horses. Zito called Condren, 
and when Condren bought an interest in Wondertross, the colt was 
taken from trainer John Tammaro Jr. and given to Zito. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his deal with Steinbrenner, Condren said, ``I am the  
managing co-owner and the horse runs in my colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Wondertross win the Kentucky Derby, you can bet Condren's  
colors would look like pinstripes to his partner -- the Boss.

<HEADLINE> Schools Urged Over Internet Smut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries that want federally  
subsidized Internet hookups should adopt policies to shield 
children from inappropriate material on the Internet, the Clinton 
administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Irving, chief of the Commerce Department's National  
Telecommunications and Information Administration, urged the 
Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the Internet 
subsidies program, to require public schools and libraries to have 
such policies in place as a condition of receiving the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	These policies should ``offer reasonable assurances to parents  
that safeguards will be in place in the school and library setting 
that permit users to be empowered to have educational experiences 
consistent with their values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irving said the administration prefers this approach rather than  
ordering schools and libraries to use filtering or blocking 
software to keep kids away from the seamy side of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisan legislation pending in the Senate would require  
schools and libraries to install such computer software, but lets 
them decide the technology to use.

<HEADLINE> Media Giants To Sell Music Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to beef up their presence online, media  
conglomerates Seagram Co. and Bertelsmann AG are banding together 
to sell music over the Internet. Their efforts will face tough 
competition from the likes of Amazon.com and CDnow, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, through their respective music subsidiaries  
Universal Music Group and BMG Entertainment, plan to leverage their 
relationships with hundreds of musicians to attract Web surfers 
with access to stars, video and audio clips and other proprietary 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture announced in New York Wednesday would add  
Universal artists to five existing Web sites run by BMG which cater 
to specific musical tastes, such as peeps.com for hip-hop artists 
and twangthis.com for country music. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites are linked to a new online music store, getmusic.com,  
which would also offer CDs from other labels. All the sites are 
currently running, but the companies expect to launch revamped 
versions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishing under labels such as Geffen, A&AMP;M, Arista and RCA, the  
two companies control about 40 percent of the American music 
market, representing artists across many genres including Beck, 
Kenny G, Motley Crue, Shania Twain and TLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies have been scrambling to come up with online  
music strategies as it becomes easier to download bootleg music 
from the Internet. They are hoping to agree on a digital standard 
that would allow them to control the downloading of music and 
ensure that the companies and artists receive royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the companies are not talking about letting users  
download music themselves, although the move to establish a 
platform in cyberspace could clearly set the stage for such efforts 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the project received lukewarm views from  
industry analysts, who say that the effort may need to evolve 
before finding success with new consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of building an online sales site around specific  
music genres, record companies may be putting the cart before the 
horse,'' said Melissa Blane, an analyst with the Yankee Group 
consulting company in Boston. ``First-time online music shoppers 
are more likely to go to a general music site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Amazon, I wouldn't be afraid right now,'' agreed  
James McQuivey, a senior analyst with the consulting group 
Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	One challenge for the companies is to make sure their online  
sales efforts don't hurt relations with their traditional sales 
outlets. Leading music retailer Musicland Stores Corp. said it 
didn't necessarily see the BMG-Universal project as a threat, but 
Tower Records vice president Mike Farrace said: ``We're never happy 
when a supplier goes into competition with us. We think it's a bad 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMG already runs a mail order music club, which competes with  
the Columbia House direct sales unit run by Time Warner Inc. and 
Sony Corp. The online operations of BMG's music club would not be 
affected by the arrangement with Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to BMG, Germany-based Bertelsmann also owns the  
publishing houses Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell, and has a 
half interest in Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-based Seagram, traditionally known as a whiskey  
maker, has been building up its entertainment holdings, which 
include the Universal movie studio.

	Yugoslavia Says Kosovo War Is Over  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia urged refugees to return  
home today, declaring ``peace has prevailed in Kosovo'' and saying 
its 14-month war against ethnic Albanian separatists was over. But 
Western officials feared those same refugees would be used as human 
shields against NATO attacks. Meanwhile, NATO jets continued 
unleashing fierce attacks against Yugoslavia early Friday on the 
16th day of the U.S.-led air assault. President Clinton earlier 
today insisted that NATO can still win in Kosovo without sending in 
ground troops.

	Negotiator Arrives in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A former Cypriot president arrived  
here today to try to win the release of three American prisoners of 
war. Although the government has made no promises, senior officials 
greeted Kyprianou warmly and showed no sign of wanting his mission 
to fail. He is expected to meet with President Slobodan Milosevic 
tomorrow. But Serbia's hard-line vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, 
tried to throw a damper on the visit, saying that releasing the 
three Americans to Kyprianou was ``out of the question'' and they 
should be tried as ``terrorists.'' 

</P>
<P>
	China Premier Denies Spying  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today denied that  
his country has been involved in nuclear-weapons spying, but he 
promised President Clinton to cooperate in investigations of 
alleged espionage. Zhu also rejected U.S. charges of human rights 
abuses in China as ``unfair'' and an intrusion in its internal 
affairs. But the two leaders claimed important progress on the 
contentious issue of trade. Clinton then hosted an official White 
House dinner for Zhu featuring musical performances -- one of their 
shared passions.

	Judge Sides With NAACP in Fla. Case  
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Daytona Beach's plan to restrict traffic  
during this weekend's Black College Reunion is unconstitutional, 
U.S. District Judge Patricia C. Fawsett ruled today. Fawsett agreed 
with the NAACP and three Daytona Beach residents that the city 
unfairly singled out the event. The NAACP and the residents argued 
that the city had never taken such restrictive action against Bike 
Week or spring break, two largely white gatherings that draw larger 
crowds. The judge banned the city from enforcing the restriction, 
which would allow beach access only to residents, hotel guests and 
those conducting business.

	Clinton To Push Patients' Rights  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodding Congress to pass a ``patients bill of  
rights,'' President Clinton will use a Philadelphia pep rally 
tomorrow to extend new health care protections to federal workers. 
Figures that Clinton intends to release show that a package of 
several new benefits for 9 million federal employees will cost less 
than $10 per person each year. The president will also announce a 
new ``Internet petition,'' where computer users can register their 
support for new regulations that would mandate that HMOs and other 
managed care plans provide the same benefits to all covered 
patients.

<HEADLINE> Tot-Killer's Mom Is Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK, Va. (AP) -- A woman who slept off a night of partying while  
her 2 1/2-year-old daughter drowned her 10-month-old son in the 
bathtub was sentenced to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Barrett, 27, received the minimum sentence Wednesday, as  
recommended by a jury that convicted her of felony homicide and 
child neglect in February. A judge allowed her to remain free on 
$25,000 pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to testimony, Ms. Barrett's two children were in her  
boyfriend's care last April 17 when she came home around dawn from 
a night of partying and beer drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	When he went to work, she sent the girl to her room to play and  
put the baby on the floor nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barrett went to sleep on the sofa and didn't wake up until  
her boyfriend returned and found Joshua Barrett face down in water 
in the bathtub. Joshua was covered with a blanket, a laundry basket 
and toys that his sister had stacked upon him. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors never suggested that Ms. Barrett meant to harm her  
son, but said she knew the little girl was sometimes rough with the 
baby and put her social life ahead of her maternal 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had argued that the death was a tragic  
accident, not a crime. ``This is a strange and unique case'' to 
seek a homicide conviction for, attorney Michael Lee said. ``All 
she did was fall asleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted of felony homicide, a form of second-degree  
murder defined as accidentally killing someone during a felony. The 
felony, the jury decided, was child neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barrett's mother, Diana Barrett, has custody of the girl,  
now 3 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Reconvene Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia,  
Democrats are planning a renewed push for legislation dealing with 
health care, campaign finance and an increase in the minimum wage 
when Congress reconvenes next week after a two-week spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and several lawmakers are expected to travel  
to Philadelphia on Friday to sign an online petition calling on 
Republicans to pass a ``patients bill of rights'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic-aligned organizations, including the AFL-CIO and  
Families USA, have posted the petition on their Web sites. It 
includes a call for access to out-of-network medical specialists, 
as well as the right to sue HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have said they intend to bring health  
legislation to the floor this year, although they have no immediate 
plans to do so. The right to sue has been a sticking point in the 
past, with Clinton and the Democrats insisting on it and 
Republicans objecting. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is planning an extensive series of briefings on  
Yugoslavia for lawmakers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Several congressional officials say they expect the top leaders  
of both parties in both houses to meet with Clinton at the White 
House Monday night for an update on the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia and efforts to deal with the flood of refugees from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger group of lawmakers is expected to be invited to meet  
with the president at the White House on Tuesday. In addition, 
administration officials are likely to be dispatched to the Capitol 
later in the week to brief rank-and-file lawmakers in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the air campaign has taken place since the House and  
Senate began their two-week break last month. Senior lawmakers have 
had briefings in the interim with national security adviser Sandy 
Berger and other top administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats intend to shine the spotlight on campaign finance  
reform next Wednesday, the first day lawmakers are free to sign a 
petition demanding the measure be brought to the House floor by the 
Republican majority. Sponsors of the bill -- designed to shrink the 
amount of money spent in political campaigns -- say they expect a 
substantial majority of rank-and-file Democrats to sign the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes signatures of a majority of all House lawmakers, or  
218, for the petition to succeed, a numerical impossibility unless 
some Republicans join the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's most prominent GOP advocate of a campaign finance  
overhaul, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, isn't expected to 
sign, at least for the time being. A spokesman, Eric Friedman, said 
Shays is ``still working with the (GOP) leadership about getting to 
the floor.'' Shays signed a similar petition last year, as did 
other Republicans, and Democrats say they expect they would again 
if it is necessary to force the legislation onto the House floor.	   Last year, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to bring 
the legislation to the floor only after the petition neared the 
218-signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides say there also have been discussions with the  
White House in recent weeks about staging a public ceremony with 
the president to dramatize the call for an increase in the minimum 
wage, now $5.15 an hour. GOP aides have held a series of meetings 
recently to try to prepare for what some Republicans believe will 
be an inevitable vote to increase the wage floor. Rep. Jack Quinn, 
R-N.Y., who has ties to organized labor, has proposed legislation 
that would increase the minimum wage at the same pace as inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal is for a 50-cent-an-hour increase this  
year, followed by a similar increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are hoping to reach a House-Senate agreement quickly  
on their budget for the next fiscal year. Both houses want to set 
aside the entire Social Security surplus, but must agree on the 
specifics. Clinton's budget, by contrast, would spend some of the 
Social Security surplus on domestic programs. GOP House leaders had 
been scheduled to trumpet their own budget during a two-day tour of 
the Midwest this week, but they scrapped the plan at the last 
minute, citing the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The emerging GOP budget also leaves room for a large tax cut  
over the next several years. Clinton's signature is not required on 
the budget, which establishes guidelines for later tax and spending 
bills. Passage of the budget would pave the way for work on 
individual spending bills, where the White House would have the 
customary leverage of a veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also hope to reach House-Senate agreements over the  
next few weeks on bills on education and a missile defense system 
that Clinton will sign.

<HEADLINE> Judge Sides With NAACP in Fla. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Daytona Beach's plan to restrict traffic  
during this weekend's Black College Reunion is unconstitutional, a 
federal judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia C. Fawsett agreed with the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and three Daytona 
Beach residents that the city unfairly singled out the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge banned the city from enforcing the restriction, which  
would allow beach access only to residents, hotel guests and those 
conducting business. Others would have to park their cars and take 
a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP and the residents argued that the city had never taken  
such restrictive action against Bike Week or spring break, two 
largely white gatherings that draw larger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the city's plan violated the First Amendment's  
guarantees that the right of assembly not be tied to a person's 
economic or status or residence. She did not rule on the 
allegations of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defendants have not proffered a rational explanation for why  
BCR as an event should be singled out and subjected to greater 
restrictions than other events,'' Fawsett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 people are expected for the weekend  
gathering, where the crowds transform the main beachside road into 
a street party. It is scheduled to begin Friday.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Restoration Moved Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Trying to placate environmentalists, the Army Corps  
of Engineers has released a new, $7.8 billion plan that calls for a 
speedier cleanup of the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We guess there are more people now happy about the plan than  
the first one,'' Jacquelyn Griffin, spokeswoman for the corps in 
Jacksonville, said Wednesday. ``Everyone is so delighted. ... We 
have something for the common man and agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan was changed after environmentalists and scientists  
complained the original proposal, announced by Vice President Al 
Gore, took too long. Under the new plan, many key components would 
be completed by 2020 rather than 2025. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress will debate the corps' plan in July after the public  
and government officials discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to restore traditional water flow through the  
Everglades to save the animal population that has dipped by 90 
percent among some species. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 years ago, engineers for the corps built a water  
management system using a series of canals and levees throughout 
South Florida. That process endangered the Everglades by allowing 
water from nearby farms and development to flow into the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps now must balance the water management needs for the  
area while still protecting the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Reed, environmentalist and former assistant interior  
secretary, said the plan is scientifically sound and must go 
forward without delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot wait until we have all the details and all the  
answers,'' Reed said. ``If we become paralyzed by this desire and 
fail to act immediately, we will miss what is very likely our last 
golden opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups like the Sierra Club hail the accelerated  
timetable but say the plan still lacks toughness. It doesn't call 
for buying land from sugar cane growers, said to be one of the 
major polluters of the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is sugar so quiet?'' asked Rodrick Tirrell, the Everglades  
co-chair for Florida Sierra Club. ``The happier they are with this 
plan, that throws a question mark in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Buker, a vice president of U.S. Sugar Corp. in Clewiston,  
said the company welcomes the changes if they don't compromise the 
success of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want it done as fast as possible, but you don't want to  
build something too quick that doesn't work,'' he said. ``We assume 
the engineering will be there.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Hoax Sends Stock Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street has always trafficked in rumors. But  
as an online hoax demonstrated this week, the lightning speed of 
the Internet can give a scam a big head start on the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	A bogus report on PairGain Technologies posted Wednesday on the  
World Wide Web boosted the company's stock price 31 percent before 
the story was debunked. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident caught the attention of regulators and reminded  
investors, especially impulsive day traders, that the speed and 
simplicity of the Internet can also wreak havoc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has become the world's largest conference call,''  
said Anthony Elgindy, an online trader who runs Pacific Equity 
Investigations, a research firm. ``And plenty of the people talking 
about stocks have hidden motives for what they're saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one yet knows the source or the motives behind the fraudulent  
report on PairGain, which appeared early Wednesday on 
Angelfire.com, a Web site that allows surfers to create personal 
Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said PairGain, a Tustin, Calif., maker of  
telecommunications equipment, would be acquired by an Israeli firm, 
ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its current market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders leapt on the hot tip, buying up shares and touting the  
stock in chat rooms run by Yahoo! The report appeared credible, 
with quotes from company officials, and the page was a near-perfect 
replica of the Web site run by financial news giant Bloomberg LP. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain shares, which closed at $8.50 Tuesday, rose as high as  
$11.12 1/2 on Wednesday before company officials confirmed the report 
was untrue and the page was yanked from the Internet. The stock 
settled back to close at $9.37 1/2, on volume of 13.7 million shares. 
On an average trading day, about 2 million shares of PairGain 
change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume Thursday was down to 1.2 million shares as PairGain  
slipped 25 cents to close at $9.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain and Bloomberg officials said Thursday that they had  
turned the matter over to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which wouldn't confirm details of any investigation. But legal 
experts said the perpetrator of the PairGain hoax could find 
himself charged with securities fraud and wire fraud, and could 
face five to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses to investors who took the bait are tough to tally.  
Dozens of stock traders lamented the hoax in postings on investment 
chat rooms, but none were forthcoming about their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	A few chastised themselves for responding so quickly to the  
PairGain rumor. ``Let's raise our requirements for allowing 
ourselves to be impressed,'' wrote one trader. ``Criminality 
deserves no admiration,'' wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet rumors spread over the Internet have been the lifeblood of  
the growing ranks of day traders, who try to make quick profits 
from the twists and turns of corporate America. News of the latest 
merger, a stunning shakeup, a strong profit report, is readily 
accessible at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
	And in chat rooms or message boards, thousands of anonymous  
traders encourage each other to buy, sell, or hold. Chief executive 
officers, waitresses and teen-agers alike can log on and offer 
investment advice without ever disclosing their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet makes people less accountable,'' said Elgindy.  
</P>
<P>
	It also makes it relatively easy to reproduce and transmit  
information, whether it's genuine or fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duplicating the look and feel of a Bloomberg news report would  
be pretty easy for any graphic designer,'' said John Delaney, 
co-chairman of the new media practice at Morrison &AMP; Foerster, a New 
York law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bloomberg spokeswoman said the company was not aware of any  
previous attempts to reproduce its site. A number of Internet 
service providers said they routinely remove pages that violate 
copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are becoming more sensitive to violations that affect  
their business and individuals are more likely to press government 
to crack down on such scams when it affects their own pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll see more cases of Internet fraud,'' Delaney  
said. ``The Web means that scoundrels are able to disseminate 
fraudulent information far more widely and much more quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman Launches Senate Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman, one of the stars of  
the Republican Party, launched a bid for the Senate on Thursday 
with the formation of a fund-raising committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, she ended  
speculation about her political future with the announcement that 
she intends to run for the Senate seat being vacated by three-term 
Democrat Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she would need upwards of $10 million to compete in the  
2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, New Jersey's first female governor would become the  
state's first female senator. Whitman, 52, would also have to cut 
short by one year her second term as governor, which runs through 
January 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I can contribute a great deal for the state of New  
Jersey in the United States Senate,'' Whitman said. ``But I also 
have a real understanding that this is the best job I could have, 
right here, right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, she said, she would be ``outspoken on issues like  
taxes, smaller government, like empowering people and getting 
government out of their lives and understanding that every right 
answer is not in Washington, that it tends to be closer to the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman ran for the Senate in 1990, her first statewide race.  
She nearly beat heavily financed Democratic incumbent Bill Bradley 
in a campaign that targeted Democratic Gov. Jim Florio's tax 
increases. Three years later, Whitman used that argument to defeat 
Florio. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman gained national prominence for her tax cuts, and fended  
off persistent speculation that she was on vice presidential short 
lists during her first term. She then had to survive a surprisingly 
close race for re-election in 1997, when Democrat Jim McGreevey 
targeted the state's high auto insurance rates and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She is a social moderate who supports abortion rights, something  
that may hurt her on the national stage but is considered an asset 
in a Senate run in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Florio has set up an exploratory committee for the Democratic  
Senate nomination. A Quinnipiac College poll released last week 
gave Whitman a comfortable lead in a potential race against Florio. 
</P>
<P>
	Florio said he would relish a run against Whitman.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I welcome the opportunity,'' said Florio. ``We have  
a clear contest between two different philosophies and two 
different people from two drastically different backgrounds.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gun Restrictions Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A state law that bars some shooting enthusiasts  
from using human images for target practice is being challenged by 
gun-rights advocates who want to riddle photos of Adolf Hitler with 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wouldn't you want to encourage people to shoot at somebody  
like that?'' said Stephen Halbrook, an attorney for gun owners, who 
argued in federal court Wednesday that the law violates freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect last fall, was written to prevent  
people from practicing shooting humans. It is believed to be the 
only one of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It prohibits certain gun clubs from shooting at targets  
depicting ``human figures, human effigies, human silhouettes or any 
human images.'' Law enforcement offficers are exempted. 
</P>
<P>
	The law only applies to gun clubs and target ranges with new  
state licenses that give them permission to own ``large capacity'' 
automatic or semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 300 or so gun clubs in Massachusetts, none is believed to  
have applied for that license, said Michael Yacino, executive 
director of the Gun Owners Action League, the lead plaintiff in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that makes the law moot, at least for now, Halbrook  
said using Hitler's image for target practice is a form of 
expression protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler has been a popular shooting target for decades. His image  
became even more popular at Massachusetts target ranges in November 
after a gun publication called the Outdoor Message published a 
photograph of Hitler superimposed on a bull's-eye target with the 
words ``Never Again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the reverse side were newspaper reprints from 1938 describing  
Kristallnacht, the night Nazis ransacked Jewish businesses and 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors said gun owners who want to practice shooting  
at Hitler or someone else are free to do so at the many clubs that 
don't have the license for semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing at pictures or silhouettes is ``permitting you to  
practice shooting at human beings,'' said Edward J. DeAngelo, an 
assistant attorney general. The state is well within its power to 
discourage that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs say that notion is ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
	``We mustn't take things so seriously that we think that  
somebody's going to shoot at a picture of a human image and then go 
on a rampage and shoot humans,'' Halbrook said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Dad Finds Self in a Pine Mess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Children climbing trees?! This has got to stop!  
</P>
<P>
	That's pretty much the message Anthony Avellino said he got from  
two park rangers last month. They handed him a $1,000 ticket after 
his daughters, ages 9 and 11, and their 11-year-old friend were 
caught climbing a Japanese white pine in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``My children have been climbing trees for nine years,''  
Avellino said. ``Please give me a warning. I will make sure that it 
will not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But officials said it was too late -- the tree was damaged. They  
said they will bring photographs of broken boughs to environmental 
court to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Avellino said he would fight the ticket, which cites him for  
``destruction, defacement or abuse of a tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the wackiest ticket ever given in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
	There was the so-called pee-wee wee-wee case, in which the  
grandmother of a 4-year-old was given a $50 ticket for letting the 
boy deposit a ``noxious liquid'' on city property. (The lad 
urinated on a bush.) 
</P>
<P>
	Or the deli owner ordered to pay $1,000 for damaging a honey  
locust tree by chaining his bicycle to it; a judge dismissed the 
charge. Or the 23 winter-solstice revelers who were fined $50 for 
dancing around a beach bonfire without Parks Department permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of the pine fine began on March 21 when Avellino, a  
New York restaurant manager, took his daughters Leah and Rebecca 
and their friend Darrayn to Central Park to knock a softball 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls soon got bored and decided to climb trees instead.  
They went into a special grove where pine trees get extra care and 
chose a Japanese white pine, one of only about a dozen in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks Department spokesman Edward Skyler said Thursday that the  
trees, which have soft boughs, are not indigenous to New York and 
cost several thousand dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Two park rangers ordered the children down.  
</P>
<P>
	Avellino said the children were sitting still in the tree  
telling each other stories, and that they were startled by the 
ranger and while complying with the order one child broke a branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Skyler said the rangers saw at least three branches fall and  
noticed several others broken and two or three more lying on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	A warning was out of the question. ``The damage was done,''  
Skyler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no posted signs, how's a park patron supposed to know  
that tree-climbing is forbidden? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of things that you cannot do in parks that are  
not posted,'' Skyler said. ``If we listed every rule, we'd have 
more signs than trees.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Arrest Rape Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Police have arrested a man suspected in dozens  
of rapes and robberies in New York City over the past six years, a 
case linked to the fatal shooting of an unarmed African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Issaac Jones, 38, lives less than a mile from the Bronx  
apartment building where four white police officers shot Amadou 
Diallo to death Feb. 4 as they searched for the rapist, Police 
Commissioner Howard Safir said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was killed by officers who  
reportedly thought he was about to turn a weapon on them. The men, 
who fired 41 shots at Diallo, hitting him 19 times, have been 
indicted on second-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir said police believe Jones raped and robbed 51 women in 39  
incidents dating to 1993, sometimes attacking several women at one 
time. Jones, who was arrested Tuesday, faces rape, robbery and 
other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a judge Wednesday dismissed charges against 1,166  
people arrested during 15 days of peaceful protests over the Diallo 
shooting. Among those arrested were the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former 
New York Mayor David Dinkins, and actors Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and 
Susan Sarandon.

<HEADLINE> Tourists' Families Present Reward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- It took a moment for the deer hunter to  
realize what he had stumbled upon: A charred car with a few spots 
of red paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he spotted the license plate -- and Jim Powers suddenly  
remembered the three missing sightseers whose rental car the FBI 
had been trying to find for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday the families of Carole Sund, her 15-year-old  
daughter Julie and 16-year-old friend Silvina Pelosso presented 
Powers with the $50,000 reward they had posted for information on 
the car's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Mr. Powers finding the car, I don't know where we'd be  
in this investigation,'' said Mrs. Sund's mother, Carole 
Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our hero, by the way,'' said her husband, Francis  
Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
	His call last month was the biggest break for authorities trying  
to find out what happened to the trio during their trip to Yosemite 
National Park in mid-February. The next day, the burnt bodies of 
Mrs. Sund and Silvina, an Argentine exchange student, were found in 
the car's trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie's body was found a week later near a reservoir outside the  
park -- an hour's drive from the car.

<HEADLINE>  A Longer, Meaner Augusta National  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Augusta National tried its new set of teeth  
on 96 players in the first round of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara predicted tougher times for the  
field because of Augusta National's get-tough policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of new places to get into trouble we've never  
had before,'' O'Meara said. ``It will be interesting to see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National has struck back, retaliating against graphite  
shafts, titanium drivers and souped-up golf balls with the most 
sweeping changes in the course's 68-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pine trees have been planted, rough grown, tees moved back,  
bunkers reshaped, greens raised and mounds shaved in a new Masters 
examination of golfing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The facelift, presided over by new Masters chairman Hootie  
Johnson, created instant criticism. Most players think that far 
from ``Tiger-proofing'' Augusta National it has reinforced its 
reputation as a long-hitter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th hole in particular has been toughened. It's no longer a  
drive and a wedge 400-yard par-4. The tee was moved back 25 yards 
and pine trees planted left and right of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Masters champion Gary Player said of the hole:  
``Bobby Jones would turn over in his grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, players could easily drive over the ``Eisenhower  
Tree'' at the edge of the left fairway and have a short iron to the 
green. Now, short hitters have to rifle the ball between Ike's tree 
on the left and the new pines on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were caroming balls off the tree during practice and  
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit the tree and it's like a light bulb goes off over  
their head,'' said a spectator, watching the show. ``It's a harder 
hole now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power hitters, however, might have a solution. John Daly pulled  
out his driver in a practice round, took a mighty swing and the 
ball cleared ``Ike's Tree'' on the 17th hole and landed some 300 
yards down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	President Eisenhower hated the pine tree that continually  
blocked his shots on the 17th fairway. He suggested one time that 
the offensive tree be sawed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Roberts, the late Masters chairman, heard Eisenhower's  
complaint and replied by naming the tree ``Ike's Tree'' and 
ordering more fertilizer and water for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern technology and livelier golf balls made the tree a  
non-factor until the tees were moved back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, smiles the smile of a  
sly young fox when he talks about the changes. He believes the 
``Tiger-proofing'' has only served to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 17 in particular is a huge advantage for the long  
hitter,'' Woods said. ``The Eisenhower tree doesn't bother me. I 
just hit the ball over it without even thinking about it. The 
shorter hitters have to work the ball around the tree and probably 
hit 5-irons to the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six-times Masters champion Jack Nicklaus wishes officials hadn't  
given a facelift to golf's Mona Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Hootie Johnson I wish he hadn't made them, but the  
changes he made are quite good,'' Nicklaus said. ``I like what they 
did on 17. It's played too short and too easy for too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara birdied No. 17 on the way to his Masters title last  
year. He said the hole now demands more respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hit it over the top of the tree now,'' O'Meara said.  
``The course is longer now and it favors the longer hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman said changes on No. 17 made it a ``dogleg straight  
hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely favors the longer hitter who can carry the  
tree,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Moving the tee back 25 yards on the 575-yard, par-5 No. 2 and  
shifting a fairway bunker to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising the green 2 feet on the 455-yard, par-4 No. 11;  
removing two bunkers; and creating a large bunker in the back. 
Rae's Creek to the left of the green was widened and raised a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grading the mounds to the right of the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15;  
planting 20 pine trees on the right; removing the mound on the 
right of the green and planting six pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The course has been remeasured from 6,925 to 6,985 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The rough is 1 3/8 inches high and will create devilish flying  
lies. It's still far below the 4-inch rough at the U.S. Open or the 
3-inch rough at the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough creates a little uncertainty when you're playing the  
ball into the greens,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the changes were made to ``try to keep up with the  
world of golf. It's the most significant changes ever made at 
Augusta and we're just trying to stay in tune with the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the motive for the changes was to ``require greater  
accuracy off the tee and put certain hazards back into play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, said the manipulations  
will raise scores. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  A Longer, Meaner Augusta National  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Augusta National tried its new set of teeth  
on 96 players in the first round of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara predicted tougher times for the  
field because of Augusta National's get-tough policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of new places to get into trouble we've never  
had before,'' O'Meara said. ``It will be interesting to see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National has struck back, retaliating against graphite  
shafts, titanium drivers and souped-up golf balls with the most 
sweeping changes in the course's 68-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pine trees have been planted, rough grown, tees moved back,  
bunkers reshaped, greens raised and mounds shaved in a new Masters 
examination of golfing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The facelift, presided over by new Masters chairman Hootie  
Johnson, created instant criticism. Most players think that far 
from ``Tiger-proofing'' Augusta National it has reinforced its 
reputation as a long-hitter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th hole in particular has been toughened. It's no longer a  
drive and a wedge 400-yard par-4. The tee was moved back 25 yards 
and pine trees planted left and right of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Masters champion Gary Player said of the hole:  
``Bobby Jones would turn over in his grave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, players could easily drive over the ``Eisenhower  
Tree'' at the edge of the left fairway and have a short iron to the 
green. Now, short hitters have to rifle the ball between Ike's tree 
on the left and the new pines on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were caroming balls off the tree during practice and  
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit the tree and it's like a light bulb goes off over  
their head,'' said a spectator, watching the show. ``It's a harder 
hole now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power hitters, however, might have a solution. John Daly pulled  
out his driver in a practice round, took a mighty swing and the 
ball cleared ``Ike's Tree'' on the 17th hole and landed some 300 
yards down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	President Eisenhower hated the pine tree that continually  
blocked his shots on the 17th fairway. He suggested one time that 
the offensive tree be sawed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Roberts, the late Masters chairman, heard Eisenhower's  
complaint and replied by naming the tree ``Ike's Tree'' and 
ordering more fertilizer and water for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern technology and livelier golf balls made the tree a  
non-factor until the tees were moved back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, smiles the smile of a  
sly young fox when he talks about the changes. He believes the 
``Tiger-proofing'' has only served to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 17 in particular is a huge advantage for the long  
hitter,'' Woods said. ``The Eisenhower tree doesn't bother me. I 
just hit the ball over it without even thinking about it. The 
shorter hitters have to work the ball around the tree and probably 
hit 5-irons to the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six-times Masters champion Jack Nicklaus wishes officials hadn't  
given a facelift to golf's Mona Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Hootie Johnson I wish he hadn't made them, but the  
changes he made are quite good,'' Nicklaus said. ``I like what they 
did on 17. It's played too short and too easy for too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara birdied No. 17 on the way to his Masters title last  
year. He said the hole now demands more respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hit it over the top of the tree now,'' O'Meara said.  
``The course is longer now and it favors the longer hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman said changes on No. 17 made it a ``dogleg straight  
hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely favors the longer hitter who can carry the  
tree,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Moving the tee back 25 yards on the 575-yard, par-5 No. 2 and  
shifting a fairway bunker to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raising the green 2 feet on the 455-yard, par-4 No. 11;  
removing two bunkers; and creating a large bunker in the back. 
Rae's Creek to the left of the green was widened and raised a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grading the mounds to the right of the 500-yard, par-5 No. 15;  
planting 20 pine trees on the right; removing the mound on the 
right of the green and planting six pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The course has been remeasured from 6,925 to 6,985 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The rough is 1 3/8 inches high and will create devilish flying  
lies. It's still far below the 4-inch rough at the U.S. Open or the 
3-inch rough at the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough creates a little uncertainty when you're playing the  
ball into the greens,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the changes were made to ``try to keep up with the  
world of golf. It's the most significant changes ever made at 
Augusta and we're just trying to stay in tune with the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the motive for the changes was to ``require greater  
accuracy off the tee and put certain hazards back into play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, said the manipulations  
will raise scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to shoot 18-under again like Tiger did,''  
Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
	His prediction for the winning score?  
</P>
<P>
	``Eight or 10-under will be a great score,'' he said. ``The  
course is really playing mean and tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just the way members at Augusta National want it.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 117.94 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Thursday, sending the Dow  
Jones industrials further into record territory, as a drop in 
European interest rates calmed investor worries about upcoming 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 117.94 at 10,203.25,  
taking the index past the closing high of 10,085.31 it set 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators today were also higher. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index shook off early losses and 
was up 18.17 at 2,562.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the rally, which followed a mostly flat  
morning, to two interest rate cuts in Europe. The Bank of England 
lowered short-term rates to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent, while 
the European Central Bank cut its main refinancing rate to 2.5 
percent from 3 percent, a greater cut than had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are sensitive to changes in interest  
rates, rose on the expectation that the cut by the British central 
bank would help keep U.S. rates low as well. The cut also drove 
bond prices higher, which helped feed the rally in stocks, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup rose 1 5/16 to 73 and American Express advanced 2 1/2 at  
128 15/16. Both are Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s strong earnings reported Wednesday and the bond market  
rally were the two biggest factors in the stock market rally, said 
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
``We see signs that the economy is growing and most pre-earnings 
announcements are out of the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! fell 7/16 to 208 after running up sharply earlier in the  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart was up 3 13/16 at 101 5/16, rose after reporting an 11  
percent increase in sales from stores open at least a year during 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which reported earnings in line with analysts'  
expectations, up 3/8 to 114 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer fell 1 1/4 to 45 3/16. Intel fell 1 3/16 to 130  
15/16, as microchip stocks dropped in response to a disappointing 
earnings outlook from Advanced Micro Devices, which fell 7/8 to 15 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders were still cautious about upcoming earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	HMOs were among the biggest losers after Humana, down 4 7/16 to  
11 3/4, warned it would fall short of first quarter earnings 
estimates. PacifiCare dropped 5 7/8 to 61 7/8 and United Healthcare fell 
4 13/16 to 45 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you disappoint, you're taken out behind the barn and  
spanked,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief of market strategy for A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street received more good news about the economy. The Labor  
Department reported the number of Americans claiming unemployment 
benefits rose last week but remained at less than 300,000 for the 
10th consecutive week, the longest such stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.23 at 1,342.12.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 673.7 million shares, up 
slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 7.31 at 623.54 and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.64 at 718.94.

<HEADLINE> `Melissa' Suspect Appears in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of spreading the so-called  
``Melissa'' computer virus appeared in court for the first time 
Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or 
``Yes, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge advised David L. Smith, 30, of the charges against him  
and informed him of his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are charged with some serious offenses,'' Judge John A.  
Ricciardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and  
charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and  
shut down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless 
dancer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with interruption of public communications,  
conspiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for 
the offense is 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains free on $100,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not answer questions as he entered and left the  
courthouse. His lawyer, however, spoke with reporters and 
questioned whether the virus was as destructive as authorities 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this more akin to a graffiti artist or an international  
cyber terrorist?'' said Edward F. Borden Jr. ``Whoever authored the 
Melissa virus probably fits the former rather than the latter.''

<HEADLINE> Skittish Disney Drops 'Dogma' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miramax Films co-chairmen Bob and Harvey  
Weinstein intend to form a separate firm to buy the rights to 
``Dogma,'' saying parent company Disney felt the movie disparaged 
Roman Catholics and shouldn't be released under its label. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers will buy the film rights to director Kevin Smith's  
religious satire for about $11 million. They will then sell 
domestic rights to a third party and negotiate with international 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney is a target that's too vulnerable in a situation like  
this,'' Harvey Weinstein says in today's Los Angeles Times. ``They 
make family movies and a protest could hurt them unnecessarily. 
(Disney Chairman) Michael Eisner and (studio chief) Joe Roth have 
been so good to Bob and myself -- they give us so much latitude -- 
that we said, 'If this is a corporate problem for Burbank, let's 
solve it for them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Weinstein said Disney never asked him to shelve the film,  
The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Miramax was at odds with its parent  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Miramax released the British film ``Priest'' about a  
homosexual Catholic priest. Although the film got strong reviews, 
some Catholics demonstrated against Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the Miramax film ``Kids'' was released under an  
NC-17 rating. Because of Disney's policy not to release NC-17 
films, Miramax set up a separate distribution to release the movie 
about adolescents using drugs and engaging in sex. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Dogma,'' Ben Affleck and Matt Damon play angels who try to  
return to heaven after they are banished. The film also stars Chris 
Rock, who plays a trash-talking 13th apostle. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the picture's plot elements: a female descendant of Jesus  
works in an abortion clinic; a Skeeball-obsessed God; a Christ 
figure giving a thumbs-up salute. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious groups, including the Catholic League for Religious  
and Civil Rights, have complained about the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who directed ``Clerks'' and ``Chasing Amy,'' has  
described himself as a practicing Catholic and said, ```Dogma' is 
in no way blasphemous or worthy of the mild controversy that seems 
to be brewing around it.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,197.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday, lifting the Dow  
Jones industrial average to another record high, as a drop in 
interest rates eased investor fears about upcoming corporate profit 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 112.39 to 10,197.70, taking the blue-chip index  
past the closing high of 10,085.31 it set Wednesday. It was the 
Dow's third record close this week; the index has gained 365 points 
over the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index and  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, also set new closing highs for the 
third time this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks,  
rose 28.96 to 2,573.39 despite a lackluster performance from 
stalwarts Dell and Intel. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 17.09 to 1,343.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Two interest rate cuts in Europe -- one by the Bank of England  
and the other by the European Central Bank -- helped the stock 
market cope with worries about upcoming earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cuts sent prices higher and yields lower in the U.S.  
bond market -- the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.44 
percent from 5.50 late Wednesday. That trend pleased Wall Street 
because reduced borrowing costs will take less of a toll on 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are particularly sensitive to changes in  
interest rates, closed higher, with Citigroup up 1 5/16 to 73 and 
American Express advancing 1 15/16 at 127 3/4. Both are Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates in Europe could also prompt more spending  
in that region, which would help U.S. companies that do business 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders have treaded cautiously in recent days amid  
warnings that some companies' first-quarter earnings would be 
disappointing. Even the Dow's 121-point surge Wednesday was 
evidence of a wary market -- investors were avoiding risky 
technology stocks and seeking the relative safety of blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks of Dow companies with a big international presence rose  
moderately Thursday, including Coca-Cola, up 1 15/16 to 60 7/8 and 
drug giant Merck, up 1 7/16 to 81 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``People finally realize how important foreign economies are to  
the domestic industry,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief of market 
strategy, for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks fluctuated through the session as traders were  
encouraged by a strong Yahoo! earnings report late Wednesday but 
remained cautious about other company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! fell 1 3/4 to 206 11/16 after running up sharply earlier in  
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer fell 1 7/16 to 45 and Intel fell 1  
1/16 to 131 1/16, as some high-tech stocks dropped in response to a 
disappointing earnings outlook from Advanced Micro Devices, which 
fell 5/8 to 15 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy March sales reports helped most retailers, including Dow  
component Wal-Mart, which rose 4 3/4 to 102 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which reported earnings in line with analysts'  
expectations, down 1/2 to 114. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest mover on the Dow was chemical maker Union Carbide,  
which rose 5 1/2 to 51 3/8 on takeover speculation. Union Carbide is 
frequently the subject of merger rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street received more good news about the economy. The Labor  
Department reported the number of Americans claiming unemployment 
benefits rose last week but remained at less than 300,000 for the 
10th consecutive week, the longest such stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see signs that the economy is growing and most pre-earnings  
announcements are out of the way,'' said Barry Berman, head trader 
for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee, referring to earnings 
warnings from some companies that periodically have unnerved the 
market in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders still had reason to remain cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	HMOs were among the biggest losers after Humana, down 4 to 12  
3/16, warned it would fall short of first quarter earnings 
estimates. PacifiCare dropped 6 7/16 to 61 5/16 and United 
Healthcare fell 6 to 44 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you disappoint in this market, you're taken out behind the  
barn and spanked,'' Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 838.93 million 
shares up from 813.37 million in the previous session. Composite 
volume came to 1.03 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.05 to 624.28 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.63 to 721.93 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.121 to  
399.89.

<HEADLINE> Gore Site Spawns High-Tech Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's attempt to speak  
nerd-talk to computer programmers has developed into a high-tech 
faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	A message hidden in the programming code for Gore's presidential  
campaign Web site touts his support for sharing software codes. But 
the high tech aficionados who went looking behind the scenes found 
the entire site is built using products from Microsoft Corp. -- a 
company that refuses to share its programming code. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's saying he's all for buying American cars and  
then driving around in a Honda,'' said Jim Jagielski, a core 
developer of the Apache software that powers most Internet Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not hard for an Internet user to peek behind the scenes of  
Gore's Web site. Simply go on the World Wide Web to algore2000.com, 
choose ``View'' from the menu on top of the screen and click on 
``Source'' or ``Source Code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the tanned and happy image of Gore is replaced with  
this message: 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for checking out our source code! ... The fact that you  
are peeking behind the scenes at our site means you can make an 
important difference to this Internet effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site invites computer programmers to share their ideas about  
how to improve the Web site, ``in the spirit of the open-source 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Open source is a registered trademark referring to the free  
distribution of software codes. Gore's support of open source 
programming follows a growing movement in the high tech community 
to share and communally improve the codes behind software. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice defies Microsoft Corp.'s competitive practice of  
keeping its software source code private, so that it can surprise 
consumers with new developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, for example, is an operating system that makes computers  
run, similar to Microsoft's Windows. But unlike Windows, anyone can 
download Linux code for free and develop it in new ways. Apache's 
Web server programming code is also made readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	John Witchell, a partner at USWeb who developed Gore's site,  
said Thursday that in reaction to input from Web site visitors, 
they are going to shift to a true open source operating system and 
server in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an honest initial attempt,'' said Witchell on  
Thursday. ``What you will soon see is a Web site that is widely 
respected in an open environment. We're going to get better and 
better at this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time in recent weeks that Gore has tripped  
up technically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore drew ridicule from the high-tech community when he said in  
an interview that he helped create the Internet, a remark he later 
blamed on being tired. And just minutes before launching his 
campaign into cyberspace Tuesday, Gore's campaign staff rushed to 
remove questions from the Web site that asked children for their 
names, e-mail addresses and zip codes -- a practice soon to be 
outlawed on some Internet sites by legislation Congress approved 
last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rallies for Patients Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and more than 100 Democrats  
are staging old-fashioned pep rallies and a newfangled Internet 
petition drive in this year's fight for the ``patients' bill of 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was flying to Philadelphia today to renew his  
argument for new regulations on HMOs and other managed care plans. 
A dozen or more House Democrats were joining him by bus from 
Capitol Hill, where they were starting the day by unveiling a new 
Web site where computer users can sign a petition supporting the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 90 Democrats are fanning out across 32 states for their  
own campaign-style rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are going to take this fight on the road,'' said  
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``We're going to use the latest 
technology, this information superhighway, to give voice to the 
people in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their no-holds-barred push for legislation that died in the  
Republican-led Congress last year is emboldened by Democratic gains 
in November's congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients' bill of rights is one of the president's highest  
priorities for the year, and given the changes in the Congress this 
year, we believe we have an excellent chance of getting a serious, 
real bill enacted,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee approved a more limited HMO bill on a  
party-line vote last month, but there has been no action in the 
House yet. Democrats complain the Senate bill would only cover 
about 48 million Americans who are in health plans regulated solely 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton headed to Philadelphia armed with new figures that show  
his executive action last year extending such protections to 9 
million federal employees is costing less than $10 per person per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was being joined at Memorial Hall today by Joan  
Bleakley of Woodbridge, Va., the latest person to be trotted out by 
the administration in its attempt to put a human face to the policy 
argument. Bleakley says she sustained permanent vision loss in one 
eye after her HMO delayed approval for her to see a specialist for 
what turned out to be a developing aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the legislation argue new regulations will drive up  
health costs and ``open the door to more lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps trial lawyers who pocket most of the money, but  
does nothing to help patients get proper care when needed,'' said 
Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, which has 
run television ads in 19 states over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials contend that the 285 health plans that  
serve federal workers also serve private citizens and are providing 
these guarantees for just a few extra dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same things can be applied for all Americans,'' said Chris  
Jennings, Clinton's top health policy aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The president does not have the power to unilaterally extend to  
federal workers the most controversial -- and most expensive -- 
provision that Democrats are pushing: the right to sue health plans 
and collect damages when they withhold treatment. Nor has Clinton 
required the plans to pay for ``medically necessary'' care, as 
determined by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, Clinton was newly requiring federal workers' health  
plans to adopt two popular provisions: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The mandatory release of information about customer  
satisfaction, the quality of doctors and hospitals, and how doctors 
are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The allowance for patients to stay with their doctors for 90  
days, even if the doctor is dropped from the network, if patients 
are in the middle of a treatment or pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Requirements already in place -- for Medicare and Medicaid  
patients as well -- include the right to coverage for reasonable 
emergency room trips, the right to see specialists outside the 
network if needed and referral-free access to 
obstetricians-gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is housed on the Web site of the consumer group  
Families USA. Up for about a week, it had more than 4,000 
signatures by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>

<P>
	Spring storms swept through the Plains and Midwest on Thursday,  
while late-season snow hit the mountains of the West Coast. Warm 
weather shined from the Great Lakes to the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms brought high winds and hail from Nebraska through  
Iowa and into Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas. The stormy weather 
stretched south into Kentucky and east into South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes broke out in Iowa and eastern Nebraska, damaging homes  
and businesses in each state. A truckload of pigs overturned on a 
highway west of Lincoln. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, a 38-year-old suffered broken ribs and back  
injuries when her mobile home was badly damaged by high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	On the West Coast, rain and mountain snow in the higher  
elevations stretched from Washington state into central California. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snow closed roads in the Sierras of western California,  
the latest in a series of wet snowstorms that has dumped up to 7 
feet in the mountains. The snow stretched into western Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Spring prevailed in the East, with warm weather and southerly  
winds from the Great Lakes to the East Coast. Fair to partly cloudy 
skies stretched through the mid-Atlantic states into the Southeast.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra's Hamstring Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who  
sustained a slightly pulled hamstring while sliding home Wednesday 
night, may not play again until the home opener next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra missed Thursday night's game game against the Kansas  
City Royals and probably won't play Friday night at Tampa Bay, Red 
Sox spokesman Wilburn said, adding that it was possible Garciaparra 
might miss the entire weekend series. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, a two-time All-Star who finished second last year  
in AL MVP voting, injured the left hamstring in Boston's 6-0 
victory over Kansas City. He was 2-for-7 in Boston's first two 
games at the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Donnie Sadler.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As NATO took its air war to the  
heart of Belgrade and the hills of Kosovo, a former president of 
Cyprus said Yugoslavia would expect an easing of the bombing 
campaign if it were to hand over three captured U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is only too evident that Yugoslavia has been upset by last  
night's heavy bombing,'' Spyros Kyprianou, who has offered to 
travel to Belgrade to try to win the servicemen's release, said in 
Athens, Greece. ``They now expect some parallel relaxation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has refused to make any concessions to gain  
the soldiers' release. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier in Belgrade, loud explosions rocked a densely  
populated neighborhood in the city center. On a major artery 
leading from the main railway station, near the avenue where most 
foreign embassies are, a huge plume of dust and smoke could be seen 
after the strike, shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	A vacant, seven-story military building was hit, its courtyard  
was demolished and interior walls smashed. Across the street, 
workers removed shattered glass from a hotel's window frames. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO criminals ... hit the heart of Belgrade,'' reported  
Belgrade TV, showing the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strike on Belgrade, overnight attacks on population  
centers were far less intense than on previous nights since the air 
campaign began, according to Yugoslav media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said the latest wave of airstrikes instead  
focused on police and army units scattered in rural areas of the 
southern province of Kosovo. A NATO military source in Brussels 
said targets hit included ground vehicles in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Small Yugoslav units have been blamed for most of the atrocities  
against ethnic Albanians, and targeting them in the hills and 
forests of the largely rural province has proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes on roads and bridges in Kosovo are hampering the  
ability of Serb forces to get around the province, according to 
accounts today by French journalists who entered western Kosovo 
accompanied by members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. One of 
the accounts, on RTL radio, said KLA forces are using a satellite 
telephone to help NATO identify Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania's parliament on Wednesday approved NATO plans to send in  
24 U.S. Apache attack helicopters -- a move that should bolster the 
alliance's firepower against the Yugoslav tanks and armor. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies have vowed to keep up the pressure on Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic until he pulls back his forces from 
Kosovo and allows ethnic Albanian refugees to return under the 
protection of an international security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the airstrikes, ethnic Albanians made up 90 percent of  
the 2 million people in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the dominant 
republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kyprianou, speaker of the Cypriot Parliament who has  
had a close relationship with Yugoslav leaders, still hoped to fly 
to Belgrade from Greece to try to make arrangements for the release 
of three American soldiers captured March 31 by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyprianou had said earlier today that a series of contacts with  
Greek and Russian diplomats left him confident he would be able to 
free the three Americans, who were seized while on a reconnaissance 
mission on the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he suggested the latest airstrikes had led to  
reservations on the part of Yugoslav officials, but he also said he 
still hoped the Americans might be freed during the coming weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO could reciprocate by responding to the numerous  
international appeals for a cease-fire, at least over the Orthodox 
Easter weekend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin has said the United  
States is insisting the soldiers be released unconditionally 
because they ``shouldn't have been held in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marios Karoyan, an aide to Kyprianou, said the U.S. Embassy in  
Athens assured the ex-president he could fly safely in and out of 
Belgrade during daylight but that bombing would resume at night. 
Karoyan urged NATO to stop bombing for a night if Kyprianou cannot 
complete his mission in a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he thinks it is necessary, he will spend the night in  
Belgrade irrespective of the bombing as he's determined to complete 
his humanitarian mission,'' Karoyan said, adding that ``the 
Americans might respond themselves by assisting this effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any release could be a sign that Milosevic was seeking a way out  
of the confrontation with NATO, which began punishing airstrikes 
March 24 to force him to accept a Western peace deal to end 
fighting in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's leadership announced a unilateral cease-fire with  
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army effective Tuesday night in advance 
of Orthodox Easter, celebrated this weekend by Eastern rite 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders vowed to continue the air campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to strikes on Belgrade and Kosovo, industrial and  
garrison towns were targeted in the latest wave of NATO attacks, 
Serb media reports indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Six missiles struck the provincial town of Cuprija, 55 miles  
south of Belgrade, early today, Studio B television reported. 
Yugoslav media also reported explosions late Wednesday in Pancevo, 
an industrial town just north of Belgrade that has been repeatedly 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hit was the industrial town Kraljevo, 75 miles south of  
Belgrade on a road leading toward Kosovo, Serb TV said. The 
missiles struck ``mostly on civilian targets,'' the report said. No 
other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northwestern town of Sombor, near the Hungarian border, a  
raging fire was shown on Serb TV, but the report did not specify 
what was hit. The town, which has a large garrison and a military 
airport, has been targeted for three days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent BETA news agency reported that a factory in  
Lucani, 55 miles south of Belgrade, had been hit. The town, which 
has a large chemical plant that makes rocket fuel, has been 
repeatedly struck. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not possible to independently confirm the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities sealed the borders with Macedonia and  
Albania on Wednesday after forcing more than 450,000 refugees out 
of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees who had been waiting on the Yugoslav  
frontier to leave the province have been turned back to villages or 
towns said to have been ravaged by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees ... were told to return to their places of  
residence -- whatever is left of those places,'' said Doran Vienneau 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which 
has been monitoring the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Albanian border, Yugoslav guards could be seen laying  
what appeared to be mines and digging fortifications just inside 
their territory. On the Albanian side, soldiers today dug trenches 
and checked old bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA claimed Serb forces massacred at least 51 civilians,  
including 12 children, during a raid on the village of Celina, 
southwest of Pristina. A statement by the rebel Kosova Press listed 
names and ages for all the alleged victims.

<HEADLINE> Braves Begin Aaron Salute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Let the celebrations begin and the bitterness  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves started a season-long salute Thursday night  
honoring Hank Aaron on the 25th anniversary of his historic 715th 
home run that broke Babe Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig, NL president Len Coleman and Al Downing,  
who surrendered the historic homer, were among the many on hand to 
honor Aaron during a 45-minute ceremony prior to the Braves' game 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know 25 years ago ... when I hit that home run to beat the  
Babe's record, it was truly one of the most remarkable evenings 
that I have ever had in baseball,'' Aaron said following a 
two-minute standing ovation from the big crowd at 50,000-seat 
Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``But tonight tops it all,'' said Aaron, now 65 and a Braves  
senior vice president. ``This is truly a wonderful day for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute has helped Aaron, who finished with 755 home runs,  
forget his somewhat bittersweet memories of the chase to beat Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	As he closed in on the record, Aaron received hundreds of  
thousands of parcels of mail, many filled with hate because there 
were people who did not like the idea that a black man from Mobile, 
Ala., was going to pass Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the hurt was the fact that then-commissioner Bowie  
Kuhn was not even at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on the night 
when Aaron broke the record. Kuhn was at a dinner in Cleveland and 
sent one of his assistants, Monte Irvin, in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked me 15 years ago, you would have found  
a much angrier person, but time has a way of healing things,'' he 
said during news conference, seated between his wife, Billye, and 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him a few times since then,'' he said of Kuhn, ``but  
have not talked to him about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, Braves chairman of the board Bill Bartholomay and Tom  
Johnson, chairman and CEO of Cable News Network, each spoke 
glowingly of Aaron. Hall of Famers Lou Brock, Frank Robinson and 
Phil Niekro also took part in the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was honored with video tributes and two songs performed by  
Kenny Rogers -- ``The Greatest'' and ``Heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, there was the unveiling of the Hank Aaron Award, which  
was announced in February. It will go to the best hitter in each 
league at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an award to be named in perpetuity after you for the  
rest of your life tells me that no matter what happens to me, my 
grandchildren and my great grandchildren will be able to say that 
their father had an award named in his honor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, in a news conference earlier, presented the award -- a  
handsome wooden plaque with an engraved silver bat atop home plate 
-- to Aaron, as the first winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why so long? That's a tough question to answer,'' Selig said.  
``But I think this is the appropriate time. It's something that 
should have happened long ago. Like a lot of things in life, I wish 
it had been a happier experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said he had wished his march to surpass Ruth had been  
similar to the chase shared last season by Mark McGwire and Sammy 
Sosa as both surpassed the single-season mark of 61 home runs by 
Roger Maris. McGwire finished with 70 and Sosa with 66. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have that opportunity and I often thought that if I  
only had just a little bit of that, it would have made me feel a 
whole lot different,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was the first that will take place during the  
regular season at major league parks to celebrate Aaron's feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron began his major league career in 1953 and spent his entire  
23 years in either Milwaukee or Atlanta, breaking the revered 
Ruth's record of 714 career home runs on April 8, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	It came off Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth  
inning with the Braves trailing 4-1 and two runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball sailed over the left-center field fence at  
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, just across the street from the 
current stadium, as the crowd of 53,775 roared. It was caught in 
the bullpen by Braves reliever Tom House at 9:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron played two more years in Milwaukee before retiring.  
</P>
<P>
	He has more RBIs (2,297), extra-base hits (1,477) and total  
bases (6,856) than anyone in baseball history. He ranks second in 
at-bats (12,364) and runs (2,174), third in games (3,298) and hits 
(3,771), ninth in doubles (624). During a 23-year career, he batted 
.305. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, President Clinton led a celebration in Atlanta of  
Aaron's 65th birthday and baseball named the hitting award for 
Aaron. In addition, the charity event raised $1 million for The 
Chasing The Dream Foundation, which was started five years ago by 
the Aarons for underprivileged youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The check was presented to Aaron by CNN's Johnson during the  
ceremony, which concluded with Aaron and his wife taking a spin 
around the field in a golf cart while fireworks went off in the 
distance to the delight of the cheering fans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the hitting award will go to the hitter with the most  
hits, home runs and RBIs, Selig said. In future years, it will be 
selected by a panel.

<HEADLINE> White Wants Women Out of Lockers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie White has a new issue: he's against  
allowing reporters of the opposite sex into the locker rooms of 
professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see any legitimate reason for forcing male athletes to  
walk around naked in front of women who aren't their wives,'' the 
retired defensive end and ordained minister wrote in an opinion 
piece published in Thursday's editions of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``women athletes also shouldn't be forced to deal with  
male reporters while they're changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White's article, adapted from his book, ``Fighting the Good  
Fight,'' urges players and spouses to stop open locker room 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go all the way to the Supreme Court, if need be,'' he wrote.  
``I just hope that if that happens, one of the exhibits before the 
court isn't a film of Reggie White singing in the shower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, 37, created controversy a year ago with a speech to the  
Wisconsin Legislature in which he attacked homosexuality and used 
racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Hammond, an NFL spokeswoman, said the league's open  
locker room policy is working. ``They are professionals and they 
are doing their jobs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But White claims many players are unhappy about the practice of  
allowing women in locker rooms, which has been in effect for two 
decades in all four major professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot of female reporters and camerawomen ogling  
guys in the locker room,'' White wrote. ``There's not much a player 
can do about it, which leads to a high level of frustration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Talk about taking the notion of `public figure' to  
an extreme!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left for White with his agent, Jimmy Sexton,  
in Memphis, Tenn., on Thursday afternoon was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	White offered a solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if players aren't willing to talk to female  
reporters,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can interview athletes outside the locker room. And if  
female reporters complain that this gives their male counterparts 
an unfair advantage, perhaps the best solution is to ban all 
reporters and cameras from locker rooms.''

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets rallied Thursday, with some  
indexes hitting levels unseen for more than a year as Wall Street's 
record finish helped spread optimism throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, a surge in high-tech issues pushed up the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index to a 12-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 292.19 points,  
or 1.77 percent, to close at 16,846.69 -- its fourth straight day of 
gains and the highest close since March 26, 1998, when it finished 
at 16,980.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders got some of their encouragement from New York, where the  
Dow Jones industrial average set a new record Wednesday in its 
third close at about the 10,000-point level. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar slipped against the  
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 120.76 yen, down 0.02 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 121.35 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors poured money into Hong Kong shares. The Hang Seng  
Index ended up 112.97 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 11,727.84 
after soaring 4.9 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean stock prices rallied for the seventh consecutive  
day, encouraged by expectations a recent fall in local interest 
rates will encourage more investors to buy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kopsi index ended up 1.2 percent, or 7.83 points, at 681.19,  
its highest level since Sept. 19, 1997, when it closed at 689.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian shares closed at a record high, with traders buying  
into financial companies and media conglomerate News Corp. -- which 
said Tuesday it intended to buy out the 50 percent stake in 
Fox/Liberty Networks it doesn't already own from Liberty Media 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The All Ordinaries index rose 26.6 points, or 0.9 percent, to  
3,056.2. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>

<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Blue chips were virtually unchanged. The Composite  
index rose 0.01 point to 556.58. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose, buoyed by the central bank's  
latest cut in the reserve requirement of banks, which analysts 
believe could put more money into the market. The PSE index rose 
34.71 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,104.88. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed higher for a fifth consecutive session,  
defying analysts who predicted the rally had run out of steam. The 
benchmark Straits Times Index rose 19.29 points, or 1.2 percent, to 
1,641.61. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares rose to a four-month high, boosted by  
gains in technology stocks and the bullishness surrounding U.S. 
blue chips. The Weighted Price Index rose 137.52 points, or 1.9 
percent, to 7,273.41. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares ended higher, driven by gains

<HEADLINE> British American Tobacco OKs Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shareholders of British American Tobacco PLC, the  
maker of Lucky Strike, Kent and other cigarettes, voted 
overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of acquiring rival Rothmans 
International BV in an $8.1 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between the world's second- and fourth-largest  
cigarette companies must still get regulatory approval from 
agencies in the U.S. and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT chairman Martin Broughton said the company has received one  
of two clearances it needs from U.S. authorities and expects the 
other approval shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission has already approved the deal.  
Discussions with Australia's Competition and Consumer Commission 
are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced their planned merger in January. The  
companies would have a combined market share of more than 16 
percent, second to Philip Morris Cos., which has 17 percent of the 
world market. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT did not provide a breakdown of the shareholder vote, and  
calls seeking information from the company's offices went 
unanswered Thursday evening.

	Yugoslavia: Kosovo Offensive Over

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia urged refugees to return  
home today, declaring ``peace has prevailed in Kosovo'' and saying 
its 14-month war against ethnic Albanian separatists was over. But 
Western officials feared those same refugees would be used as human 
shields against NATO attacks. The United States pledged that NATO 
will press ahead with the bombing campaign. Meanwhile, a former 
Cypriot president arrived in Belgrade to try to win freedom for 
three captured U.S. soldiers. His task could prove difficult: A 
hard-line Serbian vice premier ruled out any release as long as the

encountering considerable anti-aircraft fire, particularly during 
night flights. But a 32-year-old F-15E pilot said morale is high 
even though the missions are dangerous. Members of Congress

freedom'' to enhance their lives, Clinton said. Zhu denied that 
China's spies have stolen secrets from American research

	FAA To Test Y2K Computer Fixes

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration will try the  
first live test of its Year 2000 air-traffic computer fixes this 
weekend. Late Saturday and early Sunday, the agency plans to split 
the computers controlling air traffic around Denver International 
Airport and spin the clock ahead to Jan. 1, 2000, in half of the 
systems. The radar systems will track both commercial flights and 
an FAA Lear Jet flying over Colorado. The likely result of the Y2K 
glitch is that air traffic controllers will spread planes apart to 
enlarge existing safety buffers, creating flight delays.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Study Engine Backfiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Backfiring Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engines,  
which power hundreds of passenger jets worldwide, have raised 
concern among pilots and attracted the scrutiny of federal 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	No crashes have been blamed on the backfiring, which reportedly  
have happened during takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some of the backfiring is mild, others have caused  
balls of flame to shoot out of the engines and forced pilots to 
shut down power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it is stepping  
up scrutiny of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Hartford company has been working on the problem with  
the PW4000 engines since 1993. While the incidents of backfires 
have decreased, the problem is not fixed, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA already has ordered that modified engines be installed  
by June 30. It is preparing a second order regarding methods to 
determine whether the engine should remain flying, said Robert 
Guyotte, manager of the FAA engine certification branch in 
Burlington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 170 backfires of PW4000s have been reported since  
1992, and less than 20 of those happened with engines that Pratt 
has modified since the problem was reported, Guyotte said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after series of violent backfires by a PW4000 engine that  
a United Airlines 747 lost power on takeoff from San Francisco and 
nearly struck San Bruno Mountain last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Although pilot error was determined to play a role in the  
near-crash, the PW4000 has been implicated in other near-disasters 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the same engines on a China Airlines jet backfired a  
month later during takeoff from a Taiwan airport. The same engine 
was responsible for two backfires on Delta Air Lines jets in the 
last six months. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, four United Airlines jets equipped with the PW4000  
backfired while taking off from Indianapolis, New York, Dusseldorf, 
Germany and Montevideo, Uraguay. In each case, the planes landed 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The PW4000 was introduced in 1987. Since 1993, representatives  
of Pratt and the airlines that operate the engines have been 
working as a team to study needed improvements, Pratt spokesman 
Mark Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a problem,'' Sullivan said. ``Reducing the number of  
surges in jet engines is something we've been working on since we 
started making jet engines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three years, about 85 percent of the estimated 2,000  
engines in service have been modified, Sullivan said. The remainder 
must be modified by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, Pratt has reduced its occurrence of backfires from  
one surge per 8,000 flights to one surge per 32,000 flights, 
Guyotte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The design changes that Pratt has made has reduced the rate,''  
said Guyotte. ``They weren't as effective as we had hoped they 
would be in reducing the number of surges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are nearly 2,000 PW4000 engine in service, powering almost  
600 Boeing 747s, 767s and MD11s and Airbus A300s and A310s spread 
among 60 airlines.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Narrows Income Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security benefits help boost many older  
women out of poverty, but even so, about one in five elderly widows 
and one in four older single or divorced older women are poor, a 
new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security cuts about in half the gap in poverty rates  
between elderly women and elderly men,'' said Robert Greenstein, 
executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
Nevertheless, poverty ``still remains too high among women who 
aren't currently married,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The research center used 1997 Census data to measure the impact  
Social Security benefits have on lifting elderly Americans' incomes 
above the federal poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly individuals were considered to be poor in 1997 if they  
had income below $7,698 a year; or below $9,712 for elderly 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Women get a particularly good deal from Social Security,  
according to the study, released Thursday. Although women pay 38 
percent of all Social Security payroll taxes, they get 53 percent 
of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that's because women live longer than men, and Social  
Security benefits rise each year to keep up with inflation. Also, 
women make up the bulk of those who collect the special Social 
Security benefits that spouses, widows and widowers are entitled to 
receive even if they never worked themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security generally provides bigger retirement checks to  
people who earned more during their working lives, and men tend to 
earn more than women. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the program somewhat mitigates that by taking into  
account a higher percentage of low-wage workers' earnings when 
calculating their retirement benefits -- and that helps women. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors mean Social Security narrows the gap between the  
poverty rates for elderly men and women -- compared with what senior 
citizens would have if they didn't get any Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Without monthly Social Security checks, 52.6 percent of women  
ages 65 and older would be poor, compared with 40.8 percent of men 
-- a gap of 11.8 percent, the study found. But with Social Security, 
14.7 percent of elderly women were poor, compared with 8.2 percent 
of men -- cutting the old-age poverty gap between the sexes to 6.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, women who are not married when they are elderly do not  
benefit as much. Even with Social Security benefits, the poverty 
rate among elderly widows is 20.3 percent, and for single and 
divorced women it is 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the study found that without income from Social  
Security, 47.6 percent of elderly Americans -- 15.3 million people -- 
would have been poor in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security benefits cut that poverty rate by  
three-quarters, to 11.9 percent, or 3.8 million senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> Young, Thrifty Chisox Set To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- This year's marketing slogan for the Chicago  
White Sox is a simple one: ``The Kids Can Play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will anyone come and watch?  
</P>
<P>
	The young White Sox -- young, if you don't count 30-year-old  
Frank Thomas and 35-year-old Darrin Jackson -- play their home 
opener Friday against the Kansas City Royals, following an 
impressive three-game opening series in Seattle where they won two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Surly Albert Belle and his frown went off to Baltimore, and  
clubhouse leader Robin Ventura headed to the New York Mets. The 
subtractions of their big contracts helped the Sox chop its payroll 
to $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And when they hit the field Friday, the White Sox will feature a  
team with only five players making $1 million or more, including 
Thomas' hefty $7 million and another $5 million to one of 
baseball's most underachieving pitchers the last two years -- Jaime 
Navarro. That's in contrast to the cross-town Cubs, whose 
opening-day payroll featured 15 players making at least $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox drew just 1.39 million fans last season to new  
Comiskey Park that opened in 1991, a facility that lacks the charm 
and flavor of today's retro stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no neighborhood ambiance, no taverns and restaurants  
like the ones that surround Wrigley Field and attract the Yuppie 
crowds. So the White Sox are counting on a hustling, aggressive 
brand of baseball and a youth movement to bring the fans back. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's average age is 26.2, second youngest in the majors  
behind the Florida Marlins (25.9), and the Sox have 20 players 
making under $300,000 -- a bargain in today's baseball market. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Mike Caruso, who is 21, made 35 errors a year ago as a  
rookie but has shown improvement after working on a new throwing 
motion this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso was also a .306 hitter last season after making the huge  
one-year leap from Class A. 
</P>
<P>
	Age, he says, should not be a factor in performance.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are a young team, but that doesn't matter,'' Caruso said.  
``I don't want to ever use that as an excuse if we lose a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in his second stint with the Sox, is an exception on  
the roster in terms of in age. But the veteran will keep playing as 
long as he hits like he did in Seattle, where he was 9-for-13 with 
a pair of homers in the three games against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	``As hot as Darrin in, I'll go with him as long as I can,'' Sox  
manager Jerry Manuel said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Hopes To End Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today he was readying  
new proposals on ending the Kosovo conflict, but other officials 
said Moscow's efforts were making little progress because of NATO's 
unflinching stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said Russia was pressing for a meeting of foreign  
ministers of Russia and the G-7 industrial nations to find a 
solution, but gave no other details. ``Russia insists that the 
meeting takes place as soon as possible,'' he told journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Western nations appear to be moving toward the idea of such a  
meeting, Russian officials said. But with six of the G-7 nations 
taking part in the NATO attacks, it was not clear what such a 
meeting could achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin ruled out supplying weapons to Yugoslavia despite  
demands from Russian opposition parties. ``Russia will not supply 
military hardware to Yugoslavia and will not get drawn into the 
conflict in the Balkans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian diplomats working to find a solution said they are  
making little progress because NATO insists Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic accept its terms to end the conflict. Yeltsin 
continues to urge NATO to accept Milosevic's offer of a cease-fire, 
already rejected by the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is eager to boost its international status by finding a  
political solution for the crisis to reassert its international 
status at a time when its military power has collapsed and its 
economy is in shambles. U.S. officials reportedly hope that Moscow 
can serve as a diplomatic conduit to Belgrade, to help to arrange a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who has headed Russia's diplomatic  
efforts, said he was not optimistic that a quick solution could be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have a magic formula to solve the crisis in  
Kosovo,'' he said late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov was to meet today with Knut Vollebaek, chairman of the  
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the 
secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, Loic Hennekinne, 
to discuss a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia won't curtail oil supplies to Yugoslavia, Gennady  
Seleznyov, speaker of the lower chamber of parliament, said today 
in Belgrade, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Russia 
reportedly is Yugoslavia's main source of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes have targeted oil facilities to try to  
immobilize Yugoslav military forces by depriving them of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev said  
after talks in Bonn with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer 
that his efforts to get talks going had failed, ITAR-Tass reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is also considering changes in its defense forces to beef  
up combat units and improve their readiness because of the NATO 
airstrikes, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said.

<HEADLINE> Chemotherapy, Exhaustion Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They say they are ``bone-tired,'' so fatigued  
their arms and legs feel heavy. Simple things like taking a shower, 
even eating a full meal, are exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cancer patients will feel this extreme fatigue for weeks or  
months. This feeling is considered the No. 1 side effect of cancer 
and largely is caused by the chemotherapy or radiation necessary to 
fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet few patients seek or receive treatment for fatigue, a lapse  
cancer specialists now are trying to remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like an iceberg sitting there underneath the surface.  
It's a lot bigger problem than people seem to appreciate,'' said 
Dr. Tejpal Grover of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The Houston 
center just opened a comprehensive fatigue clinic to uncover what 
causes each patient's exhaustion and help them fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want patients to say, 'Gosh maybe there's something that  
could be done, and I need to talk to my doctor about that,''' said 
Chicago nurse Marnie McHale of the Oncology Nurses Society, which 
this week started a campaign to educate patients and their 
caregivers about cancer fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatigue long was discounted as a serious problem and only now is  
being researched aggressively. Studies suggest that over 75 percent 
of cancer patients suffer serious fatigue. It limits their ability 
to work, attend school or perform daily activities. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a mental toll -- ``chemo brain'' some call it -- where  
patients cannot concentrate, are forgetful or depressed. It even 
can hinder rigorous cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a recent survey of 379 cancer patients found only 9 percent  
of those who suffered fatigue were treated with prescription drugs 
or blood transfusions. While medication is not always appropriate, 
experts say that number should be higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is dispelling the myths that there is no  
help for fatigue, or that fatigue only could mean the cancer is 
worsening so patients are scared to mention it, says the Oncology 
Nursing Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients and doctors also may not communicate well.  
</P>
<P>
	Patients have different degrees of fatigue, caused by different  
problems that require customized, comprehensive care that 
oncologists may be too busy battling the tumor to offer, Grover 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Anemia is a leading culprit, because radiation and many powerful  
chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells also kill blood and 
bone-marrow cells. Medicines, such as Epogen or Procrit, that boost 
blood-cell production or blood transfusions may help. 
</P>
<P>
	Undertreated pain is another big cause, limiting patients'  
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Some new studies suggest mild exercise programs help, because  
constant rest actually makes patients quickly lose muscle strength, 
thus worsening fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	At M.D. Anderson's fatigue clinic, doctors are finding patients  
who were so busy fighting cancer that nobody noticed they also have 
thyroid problems or other energy-sapping diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Tumors can compete for a body's nutrients at the same time that  
chemotherapy-caused nausea depletes calories and spurs dehydration. 
There are medicines to minimize nausea, and nutritionists may 
suggest easier-to-tolerate, high-nutrient meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes help can be creative: Put a seat in the shower or a  
rolling stool in the kitchen to conserve energy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are not solutions for all patients and doctors do not  
fully understand cancer fatigue. That is frustrating to patients, 
as is finishing treatment and still being fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute notes that some cancer survivors  
can take years to regain energy. Still, ``patients put high 
expectations on themselves'' to get back to normal, and may lose 
family support once treatment ends, McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new campaign, oncology nurses are educating patients  
and caregivers about fatigue, helping them plan ways to conserve 
energy and cope with cancer treatment and urging them to seek 
medical care when fatigue strikes. For more information, nurses 
will answer e-mailed questions at www.cancerfatigue.org.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodding Congress to pass a ``patients bill of  
rights,'' President Clinton will use a Philadelphia pep rally 
Friday to extend new health care protections to federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also announce a new ``Internet petition,''  
where computer users can register their support for new regulations 
that would mandate that HMOs and other managed care plans provide 
the same benefits to all covered patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures that Clinton intends to release show that a package of  
several new benefits for 9 million federal employees will cost less 
than $10 per person each year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new provisions requires health plans to release a  
host of information about how they pay doctors, customer 
satisfaction and the quality of doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The other requires plans to let patients stay with their doctors  
for 90 days, even if the doctor is dropped from the network, if 
they are in the middle of a treatment or pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already extended the same provisions to patients in  
Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House hopes that the real-life experience with federal  
workers will blunt GOP arguments that new requirements drive up 
costs. The 285 health plans that serve federal workers also serve 
private citizens, officials note, and they are providing these 
guarantees for just a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world has not stopped turning,'' said Chris Jennings,  
Clinton's top health policy aide. ``The same things can be applied 
for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will be joined in Philadelphia by about 18 congressional  
Democrats pushing his ``patients bill of rights'' legislation. 
Another 90 Democrats plan similar events in 32 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are going to take this fight on the road,'' said  
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``We're going to use the latest 
technology, this information superhighway, to give voice to the 
people in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial -- and most expensive -- provision that  
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health 
plans and collect damages when they withhold treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	An equally contentious provision that would require health plans  
to pay for ``medically necessary'' care, as determined by doctors. 
Clinton doesn't have the power to unilaterally extend either of 
those provisions to the federal workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration already has required that health plans  
covering government workers pay for reasonable emergency room trips 
and allow patients to see specialists outside the network if needed 
and obstetricians-gynecologists without a referral. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee approved a more limited HMO bill last month,  
but there's been no action in the House yet. Democrats complain 
that bill would cover only about 48 million Americans who are in 
health plans regulated solely by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of new federal legislation complained that any  
increase in costs is significant for many Americans and said the 
Democratic bill would simply ``open the door to more lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps trial lawyers who pocket most of the money, but  
does nothing to help patients get proper care when needed,'' said 
Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, which has 
run television ads in 19 states over the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new petition Clinton is announcing is housed on the Web site  
of the consumer group Families USA. Up for about a week, it had 
more than 4,000 signatures Thursday afternoon. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Serb: US Captives Won't Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid fears that refugees are  
becoming human shields now that Yugoslavia has sealed its borders, 
Serb media claimed today that ethnic Albanians were voluntarily 
returning to Kosovo. A Cypriot lawmaker arrived in Belgrade to seek 
the release of three captured U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou, speaker of the Cypriot parliament, said he  
planned to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday and 
that the Americans might be freed during the long Orthodox Easter 
weekend, starting today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hardline Serbian vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, told  
reporters that freeing the three was ``out of the question'' and 
that the soldiers should be tried as terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is leading an undeclared war against  
Yugoslavia,'' said Seselj, leader of the extreme nationalist 
Serbian Radical Party allied with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for Belgrade, Kyprianou said the Yugoslav  
government expects NATO bombing to ease if it turns over the 
American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, however, has ruled out any concessions to  
gain the soldiers' release, though NATO arranged for safe passage 
today of Kyprianou's flight. 
</P>
<P>
	As night fell today, several thousand people -- chanting  
``Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia'' -- gathered on two major bridges in 
Belgrade and the remaining Danube River bridge in Serbia's 
second-largest city, Novi Sad, serving as volunteer human shields 
against NATO attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Before dawn today, NATO warplanes and missiles took aim at the  
heart of Belgrade and against government troops in the hills of 
Kosovo in what the alliance said was a systematic bid to break the 
Yugoslav military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will prevail,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told  
American pilots today at the Aviano air base in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Yugoslavia sealed its borders and choked off a flood  
of refugees from Kosovo, Serb media said ethnic Albanians were 
voluntarily heading back into the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing footage of long lines of cars and road signs pointing to  
destinations inside Kosovo, state TV said refugees had initially 
wanted to cross into neighboring Macedonia but had ``decided to 
return'' to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half a million Kosovars have fled or were driven out of  
Kosovo in the two weeks since the NATO bombing campaign began, the 
greatest mass displacement seen in Europe in half a century. Those 
reaching refuge in neighboring states have described a systematic 
campaign of terror against them by Serb troops and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Western military officials said the latest wave of air attacks  
focused on Serb police and army units scattered in rural areas of 
Kosovo. Small Yugoslav units have been blamed for most of the 
atrocities against ethnic Albanians, and targeting them in the 
hills and forests of the largely rural province has proven 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes on roads and bridges in Kosovo are hampering the  
ability of Serb forces to get around the province, according to 
accounts today by French journalists who entered western Kosovo 
accompanied by members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. One of 
the accounts, on French RTL radio, said KLA forces are using a 
satellite telephone to help NATO identify Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have attacked the nervous system, we have attacked the  
central system as well, that is to say a part of the brain that is 
conducting the operations,'' French Army Chief of Staff Gen. 
Jean-Pierre Kelche told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets in the latest wave of attacks included Belgrade, where  
loud explosions rocked a densely populated neighborhood in the city 
center just before midnight. On a major artery leading from the 
main railway station, near the avenue where most foreign embassies 
are located, a huge plume of dust and smoke could be seen after the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	A seven-story military building -- a vacant one -- was hit, its  
courtyard was demolished and interior walls smashed. Across the 
street, blue-smocked workers removed shattered glass from a hotel's 
window frames. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO criminals ... hit the heart of Belgrade,'' said Belgrade  
TV, showing the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strike on Belgrade, overnight attacks on population  
centers were far less intense than on previous nights since the 
2-week-old air campaign began, Yugoslav media reports indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, said today it was not responsible for the  
widespread damage in Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Commodore David Wilby, briefing reporters at NATO  
headquarters said that while NATO has attacked military targets 
around Pristina, including the police headquarters, televised 
photos showed much more widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO has certainly not caused the reported widespread and  
random damage which we believe has been orchestrated by Serbian 
forces,'' said Air Commodore David Wilby, briefing reporters at 
NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal officials in Pristina declared a day of mourning for  
what it said were 10 victims of NATO strikes early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicting reports continued to emerge, meanwhile, about the  
fate of 10,000 refugees declared missing after Macedonia emptied 
out a makeshift refugee camp on its border Tuesday night and early 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees still has not been able  
to account for them, spokeswoman Paula Ghedina said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia challenged the UNHCR's account of a missing 10,000,  
saying today the aid agency had simply not properly estimated their 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee officials also did not know the fate of thousands  
apparently turned back by the Yugoslavs at Morini, the main 
crossing point into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies have vowed to keep up the pressure on Milosevic until  
he pulls back his forces from Kosovo and allows ethnic Albanian 
refugees to return under the protection of an international 
security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians made up 90 percent of the 2 million prewar  
populace of Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in 
Yugoslavia. Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists 
began 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's leadership announced a unilateral cease-fire with  
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army effective Tuesday night in advance 
of Orthodox Easter, celebrated this weekend by Eastern rite 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders vowed to continue the air campaign until  
Milosevic withdraws special police units from Kosovo and accepts 
the peace plan, which includes 28,000 NATO-led troops to enforce 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not possible to independently confirm the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest air activity followed a dramatic move Wednesday by  
Yugoslav authorities to seal off the borders with Macedonia and 
Albania -- after forcing more than 450,000 refugees out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees who had been waiting on the Yugoslav  
frontier have been turned back to villages or towns said to have 
been ravaged amid the campaign of forced expulsions of the ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials including Germany's defense minister, Rudolf  
Scharping, and Britain's International Development Secretary Clare 
Short have voiced fears that the refugees were being forced back 
into Kosovo for use as human shields against NATO air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Marshal Sir John Day, deputy chief of the defense staff,  
told a British military briefing that attacking NATO forces ``take 
every precaution'' to make sure they avoid targets where refugees 
may be used as human shields, but ``at the end of the day the 
responsibility is Milosevic's.''

what it said were 10 victims of NATO strikes early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicting reports continued to emerge, meanwhile, about the  
fate of 10,000 refugees declared missing after Macedonia emptied 
out a makeshift refugee camp on its border Tuesday night and early 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees still has not been able  
to account for them, spokeswoman Paula Ghedina said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia challenged the UNHCR's account of a missing 10,000,  
saying today the aid agency had simply not properly estimated their 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee officials also did not know the fate of thousands  
apparently turned back by the Yugoslavs at Morini, the main 
crossing point into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies have vowed to keep up the pressure on Milosevic until  
he pulls back his forces from Kosovo and allows ethnic Albanian 
refugees to return under the protection of an international 
security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians made up 90 percent of the 2 million prewar  
populace of Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in 
Yugoslavia. Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists 
began 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's leadership announced a unilateral cease-fire with  
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army effective Tuesday night in advance 
of Orthodox Easter, celebrated this weekend by Eastern rite 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western leaders vowed to continue the air campaign until  
Milosevic withdraws special police units from Kosovo and accepts 
the peace plan, which includes 28,000 NATO-led troops to enforce 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not possible to independently confirm the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest air activity followed a dramatic move Wednesday by  
Yugoslav authorities to seal off the borders with Macedonia and 
Albania -- after forcing more than 450,000 refugees out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees who had been waiting on the Yugoslav  
frontier have been turned back to villages or towns said to have 
been ravaged amid the campaign of forced expulsions of the ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials including Germany's defense minister, Rudolf  
Scharping, and Britain's International Development Secretary Clare 
Short have voiced fears that the refugees were being forced back 
into Kosovo for use as human shields against NATO air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Marshal Sir John Day, deputy chief of the defense staff,  
told a British military briefing that attacking NATO forces ``take 
every precaution'' to make sure they avoid targets where refugees 
may be used as human shields, but ``at the end of the day the 
responsibility is Milosevic's.''

<HEADLINE> Congress To Reconvene Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia,  
Democrats are planning a renewed push for legislation dealing with 
health care, campaign finance and an increase in the minimum wage 
when Congress reconvenes next week after a two-week spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and several lawmakers are expected to travel  
to Philadelphia on Friday to sign an online petition calling on 
Republicans to pass a ``patients bill of rights'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic-aligned organizations, including the AFL-CIO and  
Families USA, have posted the petition on their Web sites. It 
includes a call for access to out-of-network medical specialists, 
as well as the right to sue HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have said they intend to bring health  
legislation to the floor this year, although they have no immediate 
plans to do so. The right to sue has been a sticking point in the 
past, with Clinton and the Democrats insisting on it and 
Republicans objecting. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is planning an extensive series of briefings on  
Yugoslavia for lawmakers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Several congressional officials say they expect the top leaders  
of both parties in both houses to meet with Clinton at the White 
House Monday night for an update on the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia and efforts to deal with the flood of refugees from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger group of lawmakers is expected to be invited to meet  
with the president at the White House on Tuesday. In addition, 
administration officials are likely to be dispatched to the Capitol 
later in the week to brief rank-and-file lawmakers in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the air campaign has taken place since the House and  
Senate began their two-week break last month. Senior lawmakers have 
had briefings in the interim with national security adviser Sandy 
Berger and other top administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats intend to shine the spotlight on campaign finance  
reform next Wednesday, the first day lawmakers are free to sign a 
petition demanding the measure be brought to the House floor by the 
Republican majority. Sponsors of the bill -- designed to shrink the 
amount of money spent in political campaigns -- say they expect a 
substantial majority of rank-and-file Democrats to sign the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes signatures of a majority of all House lawmakers, or  
218, for the petition to succeed, a numerical impossibility unless 
some Republicans join the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's most prominent GOP advocate of a campaign finance  
overhaul, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, isn't expected to 
sign, at least for the time being. A spokesman, Eric Friedman, said 
Shays is ``still working with the (GOP) leadership about getting to 
the floor.'' Shays signed a similar petition last year, as did 
other Republicans, and Democrats say they expect they would again 
if it is necessary to force the legislation onto the House floor.	   Last year, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to bring 
the legislation to the floor only after the petition neared the 
218-signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides say there also have been discussions with the  
White House in recent weeks about staging a public ceremony with 
the president to dramatize the call for an increase in the minimum 
wage, now $5.15 an hour. GOP aides have held a series of meetings 
recently to try to prepare for what some Republicans believe will 
be an inevitable vote to increase the wage floor. Rep. Jack Quinn, 
R-N.Y., who has ties to organized labor, has proposed legislation 
that would increase the minimum wage at the same pace as inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal is for a 50-cent-an-hour increase this  
year, followed by a similar increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are hoping to reach a House-Senate agreement quickly  
on their budget for the next fiscal year. Both houses want to set 
aside the entire Social Security surplus, but must agree on the 
specifics. Clinton's budget, by contrast, would spend some of the 
Social Security surplus on domestic programs. GOP House leaders had 
been scheduled to trumpet their own budget during a two-day tour of 
the Midwest this week, but they scrapped the plan at the last 
minute, citing the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The emerging GOP budget also leaves room for a large tax cut  
over the next several years. Clinton's signature is not required on 
the budget, which establishes guidelines for later tax and spending 
bills. Passage of the budget would pave the way for work on 
individual spending bills, where the White House would have the 
customary leverage of a veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also hope to reach House-Senate agreements over the  
next few weeks on bills on education and a missile defense system 
that Clinton will sign.

<HEADLINE> St. Francis, Pa. Hires New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LORETTO, Pa. (AP) -- St. Francis College on Thursday hired Bobby  
Jones as men's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who was associate men's coach at Minnesota since 1997,  
replaces Tom McConnell, who resigned after a 9-17 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to develop a long-term relationship with  
the college and the community and building a successful program,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones coached for a Minnesota team that was 37-26 over two  
years, including a 20-15 mark in 1998 and a NIT championship. The 
Golden Gophers were 17-11 last season, losing in the first round of 
the NCAA tournament to Gonzaga after allegations surfaced that a 
tutor wrote papers for some members of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was listed among the top 10 recruiters in 1995-1996 by a  
basketball magazine, and was an assistant in 1994 to Pitt coach 
Ralph Willard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Jones has the experience and credentials we need to  
develop a strong and successful program and to build upon a proud 
St. Francis College basketball tradition,'' said the Rev. Christian 
Oravec, president of the college. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was an assistant at Western Kentucky from 1992-1994, where  
he also played for four years under current Minnesota coach Clem 
Haskins.

<HEADLINE> Same-Sex Harassment Ruling Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A company is appealing a judge's ruling  
that a female employee sexually harassed two female coworkers by 
calling them names that included derogatory terms for female body 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was believed to be the first in the nation involving  
verbal sexual harassment between same-sex co-workers, an attorney 
in the case and a gay-rights group said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that harassment can be  
illegal when the offender and victim are the same sex. That case, 
however, involved physical harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The administrative law judge's ruling, made in January, stems  
from a complaint that two Ball-Foster Glass Container Co. workers 
filed with the state Equal Rights Division against the company in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayme Thiede and Marcia Graf, who work in the box shop at the  
company's Burlington plant, accused Ball-Foster of refusing to 
discipline a co-worker, Janet Koyen, for harassing them despite 
repeated complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	According to their complaint, Koyen repeatedly used abusive  
language that included words that also could have a sexual 
connotation. 
</P>
<P>
	State Administrative Law Judge Larry Jakubowski in Milwaukee  
ruled Jan. 11 that the women had been sexually harassed and ordered 
the company to pay them a total of $21,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball-Foster insists the women weren't sexually harassed because  
it involved an ongoing dispute that included little more than 
name-calling among co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As rude and offensive as it might be for someone to walk in  
and call you a name, it's not against federal law,'' said Jeffrey 
Mallamad, an Indianapolis attorney for the Muncie, Ind.-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiede and Graf still work at the plant. Koyen was fired in  
October 1996 after she was accused of sending a threatening letter 
to the plant nurse in an incident unrelated to Graf and Thiede's 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	None could immediately be reached for comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cronyism Blamed for CEO Paychecks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Too many CEOs are too cozy with the compensation committees that  
decide their pay, the AFL-CIO said in a report that blames cronyism 
for helping fuel skyrocketing executive paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade union cited such companies as Carnival Corp., whose  
CEO Micky Arison sits on the compensation committee that created 
his nearly $6 million pay package. Both the CEO of Hillenbrand 
Industries and his uncle serve on a company compensation committee, 
according to the report published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In part due to spiraling stock options, the average CEO of a  
major corporation made $7.8 million, or 326 times more than the 
$24,000 earned by a typical American factory worker in 1997 -- a 
trend that is drawing mounting ire. In Germany, in contrast, the 
average CEO makes just 25 times the average worker's wage, 
according to the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the inscrutable Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan  
Greenspan has taken an unusual poke at CEO pay, saying in February 
that a lot of such compensation is ``not directed to the value they 
are producing for their shareholders, who are paying the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naming friends, relatives and business partners to compensation  
committees helps fatten pay stubs, many believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping such committees independent is ``truly the first line of  
defense against inappropriate pay packages,'' said Ann Yerger, 
director of research at the powerful Council of Institutional 
Investors, an association of 100 of the nation's largest pension 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies are trying to remove cronies from their  
compensation committees. For example, company lawyers and 
investment bankers aren't as prevalent on such panels, Ms. Yerger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a step in the right direction,'' she said.  
``Unfortunately, there's room for improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO agrees. ``CEO pay is clearly out of control and  
conflicted 'country-club' boards are some of the main culprits,'' 
said Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO based its report on data from the Investor  
Responsibility Research Center, which found that nearly 150 
directors of companies on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index had 
conflicts of interest. The Center studied the companies' 1998 and 
1999 proxy statements, which by law must report committee members' 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the companies cited in the report, however, saw no  
problem with their committee composition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it poses any conflict of interest, or we  
wouldn't have him there,'' said Tim Gallagher, spokesman for 
Miami-based Carnival, referring to CEO Arison's slot on the 
compensation committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillenbrand Industries CEO W. August Hillenbrand serves on one  
of two company compensation committees: the body that decides if 
pay packages -- including his own -- are competitive, said David 
Robertson, human resources vice president at the hospital equipment 
and casket maker. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the committee decides matters related to the CEO,  
Hillenbrand excuses himself, said Robertson, adding ``he's in no 
way involved in any decision in any adjustments to his own 
salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One academic has recently argued that cronyism doesn't lead to  
inflated CEO pay. Although abuse of position occurs, directors are 
under too much scrutiny to act unprofessionally, says Catherine 
Daily, a professor of management at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study of 194 Fortune 500 companies suggests that affiliated  
directors are not systematically ``more generous in awarding CEO 
compensation than more independent committees,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many in Corporate America are concerned, saying CEOs have  
been too cozy too long with the men and women who decide their pay. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lauer, CEO of shipping company Oglebay Norton, has taken a  
stand on the issue by drawing no salary and getting a bonus capped 
at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And although two members of the Cleveland company's compensation  
committee do business with the firm, he plans to forbid such 
connections when the two members step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an absolutely clean (relationship), no  
friendship, no business deals,'' he said. ``I don't want any 
perception that we have any kind of a linkage that way.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> TWA Pilot Testifies About Flight 800 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A former TWA pilot who helped investigate  
the crash of Flight 800 admitted today telling a writer he would 
give ``priority'' to finding a piece of evidence that might prove 
the plane was shot down by a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	But Capt. Terrell Stacey testified that even before meeting  
author James Sanders, who was writing a book on the 1996 crash, he 
had become frustrated and concerned over the way the FBI and 
National Transportation Safety Board were conducting the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply to questions, he said the agencies seemed to be  
ignoring or pushing aside certain aspects that he considered worth 
closer scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet exploded off the Long Island coast on July 17, 1996,  
just minutes after leaving Kennedy Airport for Paris. All 230 
people aboard were killed, including 53 TWA employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says the Boeing 747 jumbo jet was destroyed by a  
fuel tank fire of unknown origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey is the government's star witness against Sanders, 53, and  
his wife, Elizabeth, 52, a former TWA flight training supervisor. 
They are accused of stealing documents and a swatch of seat fabric 
allegedly stained with missile fuel residue. The FBI says the 
stains actually were from glue. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey -- a 33-year TWA veteran who had flown the doomed plane  
from Paris to New York the day before the crash -- was originally 
charged along with the Sanderses. He agreed to testify against 
them, and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He faces up to a year in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey admitted earlier to agreeing to steal the cloth at the  
alleged urging of Mrs. Sanders, who wanted to ``bring the 
information to the American public'' about the plane's being downed 
by a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	In the phone conversation with Sanders, Stacey -- unaware he was  
being taped -- said he was ``making it a priority'' to get the 
fabric, and also would look for other materials as soon as 
investigators moved out of a certain area of the Long Island hangar 
where they wreckage was being reassembled. Today, he acknowledged 
it was his voice on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey testified that Mrs. Sanders first contacted him about  
helping solve the crash mystery. At the time, her husband was 
writing a book claiming that the U.S. Navy had inadvertently shot 
down the jumbo jet, and then engaged in a coverup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey had been assigned by the TWA to assist investigators.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite nervous and uncomfortable,'' he said of his  
meetings with Sanders. ``The confidentiality had to be maintained, 
and it compromised my position in the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main prize for Sanders was a small scrap of seat fabric  
bearing a mysterious, reddish stain. The author had it tested by a 
laboratory, which found the stain ``consistent with solid missile 
fuel residue'' -- a discovery described in his 1997 book, ``The 
Downing of TWA Flight 800.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said the stain was from the glue used to fasten seat  
covers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Equal Pay for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says the United States has  
``the opportunity of a generation'' to establish equal pay for 
working women. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, on Wednesday hosted a discussion 
with four women who told of their battles to address salary 
disputes with lawsuits as well as on-the-job diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was held to commemorate Equal Pay Day, which is today.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are still those who claim that this is a made-up  
problem, that any wage gap between men and women can be explained 
away by the choices women make,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a sizable gap between men's and women's  
salaries that can best be explained by one phenomenon: the 
continuing presence and the persistent effect of discrimination, 
sometimes in very subtle ways,'' said the first lady, who practiced 
law in Arkansas while her husband pursued his public service 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton -- who counted himself among ``a small but vocal radical  
caucus'' of husbands whose wives have outearned them -- said 
Congress should take advantage of the nation's low unemployment and 
booming economy and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act introduced last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would allow women to sue their employers for  
unlimited compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to the 
limited damages and back-pay awards now available under federal law 
to remedy pay violations. That would bring women on par with other 
minorities in wage discrimination matters. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's Council of Economic Advisers reported last year  
that women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns, a 
narrower gap than in 1963, when President Kennedy signed the 
original Equal Pay Act. Then, women workers earned 58 cents for 
every dollar paid to male workers. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his fiscal 2000 budget, Clinton has requested $14  
million for efforts to close the wage gap between men and women.

<HEADLINE> Japan 3, United States 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAUCHI, Nigeria (AP) -- Japan beat the United States 3-1 Thursday  
at the FIFA World Youth Championship, putting the Americans in 
danger of first-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans (1-1) are third in Group E with three points,  
trailing Cameroon (2-0) and behind Japan (1-1) on goal difference, 
with the Japanese plus-1 and the Americans minus-1. The top two 
teams in each of the six groups advance to the second round along 
with the four best third-place teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, the Japanese were a very good team and deserved  
the win today,'' U.S. coach Sigi Schmid said. ``We gave them too 
much space to work, and in this type of competition you cannot 
afford to give space. They did very well with their offensive 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which opened with a 1-0 win over England,  
plays Cameroon on Sunday at Bauchi in its final first-round game. 
Cameroon beat England 1-0 earlier Thursday in the under-20 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	With a win, the Americans would advance, and a tie would give  
them a chance depending on Sunday's other games. They also could 
advance with a loss, depending on other results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still very confident that we will advance,'' Schmid said.  
``Cameroon will be a very difficult opponent, but we know that our 
goals in this tournament ride on playing well on Sunday. We will be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, which lost to Cameroon 1-0 in its opener, went ahead of  
the Americans in the 12th minute when Nick Downing accidentally 
redirected a 25-yard drive into the penalty area past goalkeeper 
Nick Rimando into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
	Naohiro Takahara made it 2-0 seven minutes into the second half,  
but Ryan Futagaki, a fourth generation Japanese American, scored 
from 16 yards out off Shaun Tsakaris' corner kick in the 73rd 
minute, pulling the Americans within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsuo Ogasawara got Japan's final goal with five minutes  
remaining.

<HEADLINE> LVMH Drops Bid for Gucci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton plans no further  
talks to acquire Italy's Gucci fashion house, which on Thursday 
rejected a sweetened takeover bid by the French maker of luxury 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members at Gucci Groep turned down the $85 a share offer,  
which was increased from $81 a share, calling one condition of the 
proposal ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH said it refrain from launching a formal takeover bid for  
Gucci until its lawsuit against the Italian company runs its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled for April 22 before a Dutch court to  
discuss LVMH's request for an investigation into Gucci's management 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH hopes the findings of such an investigation would void the  
shares Gucci issued to its employees and to French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute in an effort to dilute LVMH's existing 
stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Bell Chiefs, FCC To Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications Corp. and Ameritech Corp.  
will talk to federal regulators about placing conditions on their 
planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard asked  
the chiefs of both local Bell telephone companies last week to do 
that after raising ``serious concerns'' about whether their merger 
would benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to meet with commission staff to explore the  
issues that you have identified,'' SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. 
and Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert said in a joint letter 
Wednesday to Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the chiefs said their companies have been providing  
detailed information about their merger to the FCC and continue to 
believe that the merger should be approved without conditions. 
Neither they nor Kennard said what conditions might be set. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard wants discussions to begin this month and to conclude by  
late June. The FCC could make a decision on the matter shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC approval is the last major regulatory hurdle for the deal,  
which has been cleared by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, valued at $57 billion when it was announced last  
year, would create the nation's largest local phone company. It 
would control 57 million, or one-third, of the nation's local phone 
lines spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in letters to the companies' chiefs last week, wanted  
to know how the FCC can be assured that the public will receive the 
benefits the companies say will result from the union. He said 
Wednesday he was ``pleased'' the companies had decided to 
participate in the process he had outlined and looked forward ``to 
resolving this matter expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger won't interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability to open their local phone markets to other 
companies that want to provide competing local phone and other 
communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre and Notebaert, in their letter, said the merger ``can  
only increase our willingness to open our local markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key component of the merged company's strategy, the chiefs  
said, would be providing long-distance services to local phone 
customers. To obtain FCC permission to do that, the company must 
open its local markets to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs also said the merged company's plan to provide local  
phone and other services in 30 markets outside its combined 
13-state local region also would boost competition. Such a move 
would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging, the new company will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside its region, the chiefs 
said. It will also be in a stronger position to provide new 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech and SBC representatives said they expect the FCC to  
approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,197.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday, lifting the Dow  
Jones industrial average to another record high, as a drop in 
interest rates eased investor fears about upcoming corporate profit 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 112.39 to 10,197.70, taking the blue-chip index  
past the closing high of 10,085.31 it set Wednesday. It was the 
Dow's third record close this week; the index has gained 365 points 
over the past four sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index and  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, also set new closing highs for the 
third time this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks,  
rose 28.96 to 2,573.39 despite a lackluster performance from 
stalwarts Dell and Intel. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 17.09 to 1,343.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Two interest rate cuts in Europe -- one by the Bank of England  
and the other by the European Central Bank -- helped the stock 
market cope with worries about upcoming earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cuts sent prices higher and yields lower in the U.S.  
bond market -- the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.44 
percent from 5.50 late Wednesday. That trend pleased Wall Street 
because reduced borrowing costs will take less of a toll on 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are particularly sensitive to changes in  
interest rates, closed higher, with Citigroup up 1 5/16 to 73 and 
American Express advancing 1 15/16 at 127 3/4. Both are Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates in Europe could also prompt more spending  
in that region, which would help U.S. companies that do business 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders have treaded cautiously in recent days amid  
warnings that some companies' first-quarter earnings would be 
disappointing. Even the Dow's 121-point surge Wednesday was 
evidence of a wary market -- investors were avoiding risky 
technology stocks and seeking the relative safety of blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks of Dow companies with a big international presence rose  
moderately Thursday, including Coca-Cola, up 1 15/16 to 60 7/8 and 
drug giant Merck, up 1 7/16 to 81 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``People finally realize how important foreign economies are to  
the domestic industry,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief of market 
strategy, for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks fluctuated through the session as traders were  
encouraged by a strong Yahoo! earnings report late Wednesday but 
remained cautious about other company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! fell 1 3/4 to 206 11/16 after running up sharply earlier in  
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer fell 1 7/16 to 45 and Intel fell 1  
1/16 to 131 1/16, as some high-tech stocks dropped in response to a 
disappointing earnings outlook from Advanced Micro Devices, which 
fell 5/8 to 15 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy March sales reports helped most retailers, including Dow  
component Wal-Mart, which rose 4 3/4 to 102 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which reported earnings in line with analysts'  
expectations, down 1/2 to 114. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest mover on the Dow was chemical maker Union Carbide,  
which rose 5 1/2 to 51 3/8 on takeover speculation. Union Carbide is 
frequently the subject of merger rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street received more good news about the economy. The Labor  
Department reported the number of Americans claiming unemployment 
benefits rose last week but remained at less than 300,000 for the 
10th consecutive week, the longest such stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see signs that the economy is growing and most pre-earnings  
announcements are out of the way,'' said Barry Berman, head trader 
for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee, referring to earnings 
warnings from some companies that periodically have unnerved the 
market in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders still had reason to remain cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	HMOs were among the biggest losers after Humana, down 4 to 12  
3/16, warned it would fall short of first quarter earnings 
estimates. PacifiCare dropped 6 7/16 to 61 5/16 and United 
Healthcare fell 6 to 44 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you disappoint in this market, you're taken out behind the  
barn and spanked,'' Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 838.93 million 
shares up from 813.37 million in the previous session. Composite 
volume came to 1.03 billion shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.05 to 624.28 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.63 to 721.93 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.121 to  
399.89.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Up 97.68 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Wednesday, taking the Dow Jones  
industrial average to a new high, after financial stocks received a 
boost from a cut in interest rates in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 97.68 at 10,182.99,  
taking the index past the closing high of 10,085.31 it set 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators today were also higher. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index shook off early losses and 
was up 16.34 at 2,560.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the rally, which followed a mostly flat  
morning, to the Bank of England's decision to cut short-term 
interest rates to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks rose on the expectation that the cut by the  
British central bank would help keep U.S. rates low as well. 
Financial stocks, which benefit from lower rates, rose again after 
leading the market higher Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup rose 11/16 to 72 3/8 and American Express advanced 3 1/16  
at 129 1/2. Both are Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Dow stock, Wal-Mart, up 3 3/8 at 100 7/8, rose after reporting  
an 11 percent increase in sales from stores open at least a year 
during March. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the market's gains, traders were uneasy about earnings  
reports, which have started to trickle in. Investors seemed 
reluctant to make big commitments until they have a better idea 
about how companies fared in the just-ended quarter. Companies will 
begin reporting in earnest next week. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which reported earnings in line with analysts'  
expectations, fell 15/16 to 113 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer fell 7/8 to 45 9/16 on the Nasdaq market, as  
investors awaited the outcome of the company's analysts' meeting 
Thursday. Intel fell 1/2 to 131 5/8, as microchip stocks dropped in 
response to a disappointing earnings outlook from Advanced Micro 
Devices, which fell 1 to 15 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs were among the biggest losers today.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was skittish despite more good news about the  
economy. The Labor Department reported the number of Americans 
claiming unemployment benefits rose last week but remained at less 
than 300,000 for the 10th consecutive week, the longest such 
stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.36 at 1,341.25.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were about even with advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.9 million shares, up 
slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 6.50 at 622.73 and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.24 at 718.54.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Decide McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors say Whitewater figure Susan  
McDougal is a selfish woman who broke the law because she hated 
Kenneth Starr. Her lawyer maintains she justifiably refused to 
cooperate with Starr's investigation of President Clinton and his 
wife because of the independent counsel's ``Third Reich'' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges and countercharges were made Wednesday during  
closing arguments that capped an often contentious five-week 
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice trial for the woman 
who, along with her deceased former husband, James, was the 
Clintons' business partner in the Whitewater real estate dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were to begin deliberations today.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge's instructions to the panel state that in deciding two  
criminal contempt charges against Mrs. McDougal they may not 
consider whether she believed Starr wanted her to lie in order to 
``get'' the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	But jurors may consider Mrs. McDougal's concerns in deciding the  
single obstruction of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	To acquit her on the criminal contempt charges, jurors will have  
to find that Mrs. McDougal had what the judge's instructions call 
an ``innocent reason'' for refusing to answer questions. They also 
will have to find that Mrs. McDougal did not ``act corruptly'' to 
impede justice if they are to acquit her on the obstruction charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse Wednesday, prosecutors said ``lingering  
questions'' exist in the Whitewater investigation even though Mrs. 
McDougal finally answered during her testimony some of the 
questions she previously had refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Mrs. McDougal's attorney, Mark Geragos,  
mocked testimony from Whitewater prosecutors who said they only 
wanted the truth from Mrs. McDougal and were not out to get the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something so offensive for them to say with a straight  
face they wanted to look to see if they could clear the president. 
How dumb do they think we are?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who was convicted of four Whitewater-related  
felonies in 1996, testified that James McDougal later urged her to 
say she had sex with the president to mollify prosecutors eager to 
get Clinton for something and thereby escape further prosecution 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something you expect to see in the Third Reich,''  
Geragos told the jury. Mrs. McDougal has denied any intimate 
relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers told jurors the suggestion that  
prosecutors wanted Mrs. McDougal to reveal a relationship with the 
president was an ``inflammatory allegation, an astounding 
allegation, an allegation that's absolutely unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She portrayed Mrs. McDougal as a chronic liar and  
publicity-seeker who reveled in telling a phony story of 
persecution in TV interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``She craved the spotlight. She enjoyed the attention. And that  
was probably her real reason for not testifying, not those lame 
excuses,'' Myers told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers noted that Mrs. McDougal said she appreciated Clinton  
providing testimony at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when she had information that, according to her, would  
help demonstrate the president's innocence, she selfishly refused 
to provide it to the grand jury or to anyone,'' Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also argued to jurors that they had to weigh Mrs. McDougal's  
credibility against that of two of Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is more credible? Two career federal prosecutors versus  
the defendant who is convicted of four felonies?'' Myers asked, 
referring to her own co-workers on Starr's staff, Ray Jahn and 
Hickman Ewing, who testified in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Bears Offer Center Wiegman $1.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears on Thursday decided  
to hold onto center Casey Wiegman, matching the Miami Dolphins' 
$1.4 million, two-year offer for the lineman. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Support in Two Key States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush's Republican  
presidential bid picked up support Thursday in two key states -- New 
Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary,  
Bush was endorsed by Sen. Judd Gregg. And Rep. Jim Nussle said he 
will support Bush in Iowa, where precinct caucuses are the first 
test of the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a leader in this country to renew the national spirit  
and bring pride back to the presidency,'' Gregg said. ``I believe 
George W. will do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nussle said he liked Bush because, ``He brings people together,  
and he's not a Johnny-One-Note on an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown that Bush and Elizabeth Dole are far ahead of  
any other potential Republican candidates, including Gregg's 
colleague from New Hampshire, Sen. Bob Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who formed a presidential exploratory committee a month  
ago, has raised more than $7 million. He has promised to remain in 
Texas until the Legislature's scheduled adjournment in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush took heat in Texas for his stand on gay hate  
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The pastor of the world's largest gay church accused Bush of  
pandering to religious conservatives by opposing a proposed 
hate-crimes bill and adoptions by homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the world to believe that he is a compassionate  
conservative. We want the world to know that his compassion does 
not extend to all the citizens of Texas,'' the Rev. Michael Piazza, 
senior pastor of Cathedral of Hope, said on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said his views on both issues have remained consistent -- he  
wants children adopted by married men and women and opposes special 
rights based upon sexual orientation.

<HEADLINE> Skittish Disney Drops 'Dogma' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miramax Films co-chairmen Bob and Harvey  
Weinstein intend to form a separate firm to buy the rights to 
``Dogma,'' saying parent company Disney felt the movie disparaged 
Roman Catholics and shouldn't be released under its label. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers will buy the film rights to director Kevin Smith's  
religious satire for about $11 million. They will then sell 
domestic rights to a third party and negotiate with international 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney is a target that's too vulnerable in a situation like  
this,'' Harvey Weinstein says in today's Los Angeles Times. ``They 
make family movies and a protest could hurt them unnecessarily. 
(Disney Chairman) Michael Eisner and (studio chief) Joe Roth have 
been so good to Bob and myself -- they give us so much latitude -- 
that we said, 'If this is a corporate problem for Burbank, let's 
solve it for them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Weinstein said Disney never asked him to shelve the film,  
The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Miramax was at odds with its parent  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Miramax released the British film ``Priest'' about a  
homosexual Catholic priest. Although the film got strong reviews, 
some Catholics demonstrated against Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the Miramax film ``Kids'' was released under an  
NC-17 rating. Because of Disney's policy not to release NC-17 
films, Miramax set up a separate distribution to release the movie 
about adolescents using drugs and engaging in sex. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Dogma,'' Ben Affleck and Matt Damon play angels who try to  
return to heaven after they are banished. The film also stars Chris 
Rock, who plays a trash-talking 13th apostle. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the picture's plot elements: a female descendant of Jesus  
works in an abortion clinic; a Skeeball-obsessed God; a Christ 
figure giving a thumbs-up salute. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious groups, including the Catholic League for Religious  
and Civil Rights, have complained about the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who directed ``Clerks'' and ``Chasing Amy,'' has  
described himself as a practicing Catholic and said, ```Dogma' is 
in no way blasphemous or worthy of the mild controversy that seems 
to be brewing around it.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Strikes Could Foil GOP Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The still-increasing costs of the U.S.  
confrontation with Yugoslavia are complicating Republican plans to 
deliver an election-year tax cut and their pledge to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone. 
</P>
<P>
	With private and government analysts saying the Kosovo crisis  
could cost the United States $2 billion or more, Congress will have 
to find a way to pay for it. Added to the price tag will be the 
expenses of moving 20,000 refugees to Guantanamo naval base in Cuba 
for what officials say may be a six-month stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs are likely to be dwarfed by the $111 billion federal  
surplus the Congressional Budget Office expects this year. But that 
surplus comes entirely from the Social Security trust fund -- money 
congressional Republicans have pledged not to use for anything 
other than helping senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of stuck on their own rhetoric here,'' said  
Richard May, a consultant and former GOP staff director of the 
House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to propose using expected budget  
surpluses to pay the Yugoslavia expenses. But many Republicans are 
eager to avoid battling him over paying for troops even as they 
remain in the field, and numerous GOP aides predicted that Congress 
would go along and use the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be honest, that it's coming straight out of Social  
Security,'' said one Republican Senate leadership aide, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. The aide said Republicans could argue they 
promised to leave Social Security funds alone ``when we were not at 
war. You can't not pay for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that viewpoint is likely to be contested. Conservative Sen.  
Rod Grams, R-Minn., said he would prefer to pay the Yugoslavia 
costs by making across-the-board cuts in other spending, even if it 
means a confrontation with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one who ordered the bombing,'' Grams said. ``He  
should figure out a way to pay for it without putting the taxpayers 
in a hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Yugoslavia crisis persists and Congress does not pay all  
the bills until fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Republicans face 
another problem. 
</P>
<P>
	They have promised an $800 billion, 10-year tax cut beginning in  
2000, as the presidential and congressional election campaigns are 
under way. Because virtually all of next year's surplus also will 
come from Social Security, Republicans have been planning a modest 
$15 billion tax cut for 2000 that would be paid for by raising 
revenue and cutting spending elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been hoping to pump up the 2000 tax cut by  
using new, higher surplus estimates that are expected this summer. 
Concerned that the new surplus estimate for 2000 might be smaller 
than hoped for, Republicans now must worry that the costs of Kosovo 
might absorb much of the new money, leaving less for tax 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may imperil the tax cut in the sense that it won't be as  
big as some of us hoped,'' said Stephen Moore, budget analyst for 
the conservative-leaning Cato Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no official cost estimates yet for the Balkan  
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	One federal official who spoke on condition of anonymity said  
the Pentagon has told White House officials that the price tag 
already has hit $500 million and could reach $2 billion soon -- 
excluding a massive infusion of U.S. ground troops or the costs of 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a private  
research organization, estimates the cost of the first two weeks of 
bombing at $450 million to $600 million, said budget analyst Liesl 
Heeter.

<HEADLINE> Humana Expects Lower Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Shares of Humana Inc. plummeted 38  
percent today after the health maintenance organization warned that 
higher medical costs would mean lower-than-expected earnings for 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville, Ky.-based company said operating earnings will  
be between 20 cents and 24 cents per share for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts were expecting 34 cents, according to a  
survey by First Call. Shares of Humana fell $6.06 to $10.13 in 
heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana said it will record $90 million in additional medical  
claims expenses during the first quarter, largely because the HMO 
will have to pay considerably higher rates to hospital chain 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. as part of a new contract in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, which owns more than 20 percent of Florida's  
hospitals, threatened to not contract with Humana in the state 
unless the HMO paid higher fees. But the two companies reached a 
deal last week, just hours before the old contract would have 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal affected Humana's 1.3 million members in Florida, who  
were in danger of losing coverage for using the 56 Columbia/HCA 
hospitals in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana's increased expenses also included $35 million to  
strengthen the company's medical claim reserve and a $5 million 
payment to Columbia/HCA to resolve disputes lingering from the 
companies' previous contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Columbia contract reflects the changed dynamics of our  
industry and the end of an era between Humana and Columbia,'' said 
Gregory H. Wolf, Humana's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although its immediate financial impact is adverse, the  
contract represents a new cost factor which we can address in our 
upcoming premium pricing actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf defended Humana's deal with the hospital chain, saying its  
Florida members would have been ``greatly inconvenienced by a 
termination of services'' with Columbia/HCA and the possible 
disruption of their health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding the hard decisions we made this quarter, our  
business is fundamentally sound,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.2 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico.

<HEADLINE> IBM To Offer All PC Products Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM plans to offer its entire PC product line  
for sale over the Internet -- much like rivals Dell Computer, 
Gateway and Compaq Computer -- as it goes directly after the small 
business and consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new strategy runs the risk of alienating the resellers  
and retailers of IBM machines that have made Big Blue one of the 
world's top computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Code-named Project Odyssey, IBM's plan focuses on luring small  
businesses and consumers as new customers, said Edward Barbini, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM already enjoys substantial revenues from its Web site -- an  
estimated $38 million a day. That includes sales of some personal 
computers, but most of the revenue comes from computer servers, 
memory chips and networking gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, only 7 percent of IBM's e-commerce revenues come  
from sales to small business or consumers, which often perceive IBM 
products as designed for large-scale operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, this is another avenue for (small businesses) to  
reach IBM,'' said Barbini. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's online sales totaled $3.3 billion last year and are  
expected to exceed $10 billion in 1999. In 1998, IBM had $81.7 
billion in revenue overall. 
</P>
<P>
	They hope to increase online sales not only through the sale of  
PC products, but also by selling the services that will enable 
companies to conduct their business online, Barbini said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein, president of the Dallas-based Channel Marketing  
Corp., said IBM's planned move is the latest in the growing trend 
of PC manufacturers selling directly to the business or consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, IBM's upgraded focus on direct sales runs the risk of  
alienating the computer resellers who have traditionally sold IBM 
products and now will be competing against IBM for the same 
business, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbini said, however, that IBM would be working with the  
businesses that sell IBM products to help them secure 
revenue-generating service and installation contracts. In this 
instance, both IBM and the partner would make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Service revenues were one of the bright spots in IBM's  
fourth-quarter report, jumping 20 percent while overall revenue 
rose only 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein wasn't as optimistic, saying the discouraging outlook  
recent issued by Compaq could be blamed partially on its recent 
move to sell computers online. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein believes Compaq sales are declining because its  
resellers didn't want to compete with Compaq and instead focused on 
selling products from other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, it's a risky move on IBM's part,''  
Goldstein said.

<P>
	Humana Inc.'s stock plunged 25 percent Thursday as the health  
maintenance organization warned that a sudden jump in medical costs 
would mean lower profits in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rising costs stem from last week's agreement to pay  
15 percent more for hospital care provided by Columbia/HCA 
Healthcare Corp. in Florida, where Humana has 1.3 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The two health care behemoths settled an acrimonious contract

access to Columbia's 56 Florida hospitals. 
</P>
<P>

according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Humana fell $4 to $12.19 in Thursday's trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana said it will pay $90 million in additional medical  
expenses during the first quarter, largely because of the new 
Columbia contract. In past years, Humana only gave single digit 
increases to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, which owns more than 20 percent of Florida's  
hospitals, had threatened to not contract with Humana in Florida 
unless the HMO agreed to the 15 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana's rising costs also included $35 million to strengthen  
the company's medical claim reserve and a $5 million payment to 
Columbia/HCA to resolve disputes lingering from the previous 
contract between the companies. The new contract is worth about 
$350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Columbia contract reflects the changed dynamics of our  
industry and the end of an era between Humana and Columbia,'' said 
Gregory H. Wolf, Humana's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said its Florida members will likely face higher premiums  
and a cut in benefits because his company is paying considerably 
more to keep Columbia's hospitals in its network this year. Wolf 
warned that Humana has made no promises to renew the Columbia deal 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf defended Humana's deal with the hospital chain, saying its  
Florida members would have been ``greatly inconvenienced by a 
termination of services'' with Columbia/HCA and the possible 
disruption of their health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Humana had backed down to Columbia, Wolf said: ``We did  
the best thing for our members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.2 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico.

<HEADLINE> Missing Atheist Search Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The search for missing atheist leader Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair has intensified, and the arrests of two former 
cellmates on firearms charges may unlock the mystery of her 1995 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair, whose 1963 Supreme Court case led to the ban on  
organized prayer in public schools, vanished from San Antonio with 
her son, granddaughter and $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the Easter weekend, the FBI and the Texas Department of  
Public Safety scoured a 5,000-acre ranch in Camp Wood, Texas, about 
100 miles from San Antonio, in a search a DPS spokesman said was 
connected to the disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The search apparently turned up nothing, the San Antonio  
Express-News reported today, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The O'Hairs may have been dismembered and placed in 55-gallon  
metal drums buried at the site, the newspaper also reported. 
Investigators reportedly are focusing on a man who once leased the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the cellmates who has emerged in the investigation is  
David Waters, a convicted murderer who was the office manager for 
Mrs. O'Hair's organization, American Atheists, before the 
disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say the other, Gary Karr, admitted helping to  
dispose of four bodies, one of which may have been a man who 
vanished after going to meet Waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and prosecutors have not publicly linked either Karr or  
Waters to the O'Hair case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, said Waters has been accused  
of being involved in the disappearance and denies it. Ganne said a 
federal prosecutor told him: ``Your client could get the death 
penalty. People are rolling over on your client and he better get 
right with God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair became famous in the 1960s when she helped wage the  
Supreme Court battle that removed prayer from public schools. She 
later tried to remove the phrase ``In God We Trust'' from U.S. 
currency and stop potential jurors from saying ``so help me God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. O'Hair, her son Jon Murray and granddaughter Robin  
Murray vanished, authorities wondered whether they were victims of 
foul play or had merely run off with their organization's money. 
Others suggested that Mrs. O'Hair, who was 77 and ailing, had gone 
off to die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray over her. 
</P>
<P>
	Several tantalizing leads went nowhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, Karr and Waters were charged last month with violating a  
law barring felons from having weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Bill O'Leary testified at a bail hearing last month  
that Karr, 50, of Novi, Mich., admitted helping to dispose of four 
homicide victims in Texas, including one with its head and hands 
hacked off. 
</P>
<P>
	A headless, handless body was found in a ditch near Dallas in  
1995, and DNA testing identified it as that of con man Danny Ray 
Fry, a friend of Waters'. Investigators and Fry's family say, 
before he disappeared, he had planned to meet Waters in Texas to 
work on a deal involving a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary did not identify the four victims or mention the  
O'Hairs. But he said Karr flew from Texas to New Jersey with one of 
the four victims before money was wired from a Newark bank to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Express-News reported that Jon Murray flew to Newark the  
week before he disappeared to expedite the wire transfer of 
$600,000 in atheist funds from New Zealand to San Antonio via New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary did not say where the four bodies were buried, and  
Karr's lawyer, David Helfrick, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters met Karr when the two were cellmates in Illinois. Waters,  
who had already served time for beating a teen-ager to death, was 
back in prison for assaulting his mother while Karr was in for 
kidnapping and armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Water was released in 1987. He quit as the office manager of  
American Atheists in 1993 and admitted stealing $54,000 from the 
group's accounts. Waters was given probation and ordered to repay 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Karr was freed in 1995, four months before the O'Hairs  
disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Signs of Genocide Seen in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he sees  
signs that Serbian authorities are committing genocide in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all gross violations, genocide knows no parallel in human  
history,'' Annan told the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission on 
Wednesday. Each time, such as after the ``organized mass killings'' 
of Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda, the world says ``never again,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, genocide continues, Annan said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Though we have no independent observers on the ground, the  
signs are that it may be happening once more in Kosovo,'' Annan 
said. ``The vicious and systematic campaign of `ethnic cleansing' 
conducted by the Serbian authorities in Kosovo appears to have one 
aim: to expel or kill as many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations must develop a way to punish violating  
countries that claim their ethnic problems are an internal affair 
in which the world has no right to interfere, Annan said. 
Yugoslavia has made such claims about its treatment of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to improve enforcement ``may have come to late for the  
desperate thousands'' of people expelled from Kosovo and the 
hundreds or thousands ``who have been murdered simply for who they 
are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will not have come too late for the United Nations if  
it emboldens us to enter a new century with a renewed commitment to 
protecting the rights of every man, woman, child -- regardless of 
ethnic, national or religious belonging,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights observers applauded the speech. ``It's the first  
time I can remember that a secretary-general has even referred to 
ongoing abuses before the commission, much less called those 
atrocities by their name,'' said Reed Brody of the advocacy group 
Human Rights Watch.

	Humana said it will pay $90 million in additional medical  
expenses during the first quarter, largely because of the new 
Columbia contract. In past years, Humana only gave single digit 
increases to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia, which owns more than 20 percent of Florida's  
hospitals, had threatened to not contract with Humana in Florida 
unless the HMO agreed to the 15 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana's rising costs also included $35 million to strengthen  
the company's medical claim reserve and a $5 million payment to 
Columbia/HCA to resolve disputes lingering from the previous 
contract between the companies. The new contract is worth about 
$350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Columbia contract reflects the changed dynamics of our  
industry and the end of an era between Humana and Columbia,'' said 
Gregory H. Wolf, Humana's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said its Florida members will likely face higher premiums  
and a cut in benefits because his company is paying considerably 
more to keep Columbia's hospitals in its network this year. Wolf 
warned that Humana has made no promises to renew the Columbia deal 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf defended Humana's deal with the hospital chain, saying its  
Florida members would have been ``greatly inconvenienced by a 
termination of services'' with Columbia/HCA and the possible 
disruption of their health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Humana had backed down to Columbia, Wolf said: ``We did  
the best thing for our members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.2 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Ends Mitsubishi Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese unit of DaimlerChrysler AG has  
terminated an auto sales support venture with Mitsubishi Motors 
Corp. after a decade-long partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture, Mercedes-Benz Auto Service Inc., was dissolved on  
March 31 when Mitsubishi Motors sold its 49 percent stake to 
DaimlerChrysler, a spokesman for the German automaker said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had outlived its original purpose,'' said DaimlerChrysler  
Japan Holding Ltd. spokesman Isato Mochida, noting a recent 
expansion in the number of auto dealerships in Japan which handle 
Mercedes cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz Japan Co. and Mitsubishi Motors established the  
joint venture in 1998 to provide marketing support to dealerships 
selling Mercedes autos in the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dissolution of the joint venture, Mercedes models  
will still be sold through Mitsubishi-linked dealerships, Mochida 
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks For Talks With Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Eighteen years after breaking diplomatic  
relations, the United States has asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan to arrange face-to-face talks with Libya, U.S. officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're willing to have such a meeting,'' said Peter Burleigh,  
the deputy U.S. ambassador, explaining that it would likely include 
Britain and would focus on the steps that Libya must take before 
U.N. sanctions can be lifted permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh's request to Annan to arrange talks with Libya's U.N.  
Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda, first reported in The Boston Globe on 
Thursday, came about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. initiative marks a significant change in Washington's  
attitude toward Libya following its handover Monday of two suspects 
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, which triggered the suspension 
of U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the United States still considers Moammar Gadhafi's  
government a pariah state, suspected of terrorist activities. 
Washington refused to lift U.S. sanctions after the handover of the 
two Libyans for trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law, and 
Libya's U.S. assets remain frozen. Americans are also essentially 
banned from trading with Libya or traveling there. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Washington's agreement to a meeting, which is expected to  
take place in the next few weeks, is an important step in ending 
Libya's isolation. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said a resumption of diplomatic relations, which were 
broken in 1981, would likely be raised at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain also broke diplomatic ties with Libya, in 1984. But  
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said that in recent 
months he has met frequently with the Libyan ambassador to clarify 
the U.S.-British offer last August to try the two Libyans in the 
Netherlands under Scottish law. 
</P>
<P>
	So a future meeting including the Americans and the  
secretary-general, while welcome, is ``no big deal for me,'' 
Greenstock said, noting that Britain has already offered to resume 
consular relations with Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council issued a statement Thursday welcoming the  
handover of the two Libyans, noting the automatic suspension of 
sanctions and expressing its ``deep appreciation'' to the 
governments of South Africa and Saudi Arabia for their help. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the council considers lifting sanctions permanently,  
Annan must report within 90 days on Libya's compliance with other 
council demands -- including Libya's renunciation of terrorism, its 
cooperation with the trial and its commitment to compensating 
victims' families if the two men are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the issue that have to be addressed in a way that's  
acceptable to all parties,'' Burleigh said, explaining why 
face-to-face talks were necessary.

<HEADLINE> Gophers Coach Haskins Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The words sounded almost desperate when  
trouble came, a proud man clinging to his carefully built 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you know me, what I stand for as a man, as a person?''  
Clem Haskins said on the night he was confronted with accusations 
of academic fraud in his basketball program at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's claims by a former tutor, and accusations since  
then that Haskins gave hundreds of dollars to a former player, have 
tarnished the character and threatened the career of an old-school 
coach who only two years ago was held up as a model for winning the 
``right way'' in the murky world of big-time college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of Haskins' program is expected to take  
several months, but speculation is rampant that it could end with 
the university seeking a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins declined to return several telephone calls in  
preparation for this story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope somewhere in this whole thing the people of Minnesota  
remember he did a lot of positive things,'' said Butch Moening, who 
coached former Gophers star Sam Jacobson at Park High School and 
now is athletic director there. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins came to Minnesota after another NCAA probe in 1986.  
While the program he left behind at Western Kentucky became the 
subject of another investigation in 1988, Haskins rebuilt the 
crippled Golden Gophers on the strength of his no-nonsense 
personality and his ability to coax the most out of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month's accusations suggest plenty of gray area in the  
world of right and wrong that Haskins espoused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very surprised if this is true in its entirety,'' said  
Western Kentucky sports information director Paul Just, who has 
known Haskins since the coach starred as a player at the school. 
``But you never know what's in between. That's the catch on these 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There never seemed to be anything in between with Haskins  
throughout his 13 seasons with the Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherited a program that had been hit with NCAA restrictions  
following an investigation of Jim Dutcher's tenure. The Gophers 
lost 21 consecutive Big Ten games early in Haskins' career, but the 
team regrouped. Haskins led Minnesota to the Final 16 in his third 
season and a regional final in his fourth year, where a 93-91 loss 
to Georgia Tech kept the Gophers from their first trip to the Final 
Four in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers sputtered for the next several years, but Haskins  
finally took them to the Final Four in 1997, where the best season 
in school history (31-4) ended two wins short of a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is that era, the time between Haskins' biggest successes  
on the national scene, that has come into question. 
</P>
<P>
	At Haskins' request, the university allowed the academic  
counseling unit for the men's basketball team to be separated from 
the counseling units for the school's other teams and put under 
control of the athletic department. It was in this insulated 
environment that former tutor Jan Gangelhoff says she did research 
papers, take-home exams and other course work for at least 20 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two years I was there, I never did a thing,'' former  
guard Russ Archambault, a little-used freshman on the Final Four 
team, told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press when it first reported the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has denied Gangelhoff's claims. He also denies later  
ones by Archambault, who said Haskins gave him cash -- $200 to $300 
at a time. Haskins kicked Archambault off the team during the 
second half of the 1997-98 season for violating unspecified team 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in his coaching career that Haskins has  
been accused of paying players. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, two years after Haskins moved to Minnesota, eight  
former Western Kentucky players told the Courier-Journal of 
Louisville that cash, clothes, and other improper benefits were 
given to members of the team through boosters and coaches between 
1981 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who coached at his alma mater from 1980-86, denied  
those accusations. In 1989, the NCAA determined there was no need 
for an investigation of Western Kentucky's program, citing 
insufficient reliable evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Thomas Meredith also pointed out that no  
one named in the claims -- including Haskins -- remained at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am firmly convinced that our current basketball program is  
operating within the guidelines set by the NCAA,'' Meredith said in 
his 1989 report to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to school work, Haskins admits he had a shaky  
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew up as the son of a poor farmer in rural Kentucky and  
didn't start school until 8. He first attended a one-room school 
for blacks until the third grade, and he often missed large chunks 
of school to work on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of his enormous basketball ability and his hard work  
in the classroom, Haskins overcame that slow start. He has been a 
strong advocate for academics during his coaching career and 
believes in the importance of his players earning their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	At Western Kentucky, Haskins set up the same type of academic  
counseling structure he later brought to Minnesota. Former Western 
Kentucky athletic director John Oldham, who coached Haskins in 
college and gave him his first coaching job, lauds Haskins for that 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I did a good job by ... staying on top of (players)  
to go to class,'' Oldham said. ``But coach Haskins was the one to 
put the money where his mouth was. He was the first to hire an 
academic advisor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said Haskins would do whatever it took to see his players  
succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would do anything he could to help a kid  
academically, because he wanted his kids to graduate,'' Oldham 
said. ``I don't think he would cheat, but I think he would do 
everything but cheat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not many Minnesota players have been graduating. NCAA  
records showed the school's male basketball players have the worst 
record of earning diplomas in the Big Ten -- about one of every four 
who entered as freshmen from 1983 to 1991 graduated, compared to a 
conference average of about one in two. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the university returned oversight of basketball player  
counseling to an academic services unit instead of the athletic 
department. McKinley Boston, the school's vice president of student 
development and athletics, cited poor communication as the major 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue, who often clashed with Haskins before she  
retired recently as director of academic counseling, gave another 
reason: She said the university was afraid the arrangement would 
jeopardize its NCAA accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' words from his 1997 autobiography ``Breaking Barriers''  
suggest the tug between his values and the pressure to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how many games or championships I've won, it's the  
lives that I've touched along the way,'' Haskins wrote. ``Along the 
way, of course, you need to win enough games in order to earn the 
respect of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Respect. If there's one thing that I've always strived for in  
my life it's that I want to earn people's respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the story broke last month, Haskins held fast to the moral  
high ground, even though the contrast between his words and the 
allegations against him leaves a cloudy picture of what matters 
most to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put winning and losing ahead of what's right,''  
Haskins said. ``Some people sell their souls to win. I don't do 
that. Never have, never will.''

<HEADLINE>  Top Female Jockey Krone Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months ago, while hanging on for her life in  
the starting gate at the Fair Grounds as a crazed horse tried to 
throw her, jockey Julie Krone came to this realization: ``I don't 
want to do this anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, thoroughbred racing's winningest female rider sat  
comfortably behind a small table in the press box at Aqueduct and 
said she's retiring April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a constellation of reasons for me to retire,'' said  
Krone, who won 3,541 races and more than $80 million in purses over 
an 18-year career. ``I'm on top, I'm 35 years old, I don't want to 
get hurt anymore, and I've got nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 4-foot-10 1/2, 100 pounds, Krone not only became the only female  
to win a Triple Crown race -- she won the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard 
Colonial Affair -- but was an inspiration for other females to excel 
in sports previously dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been an inspiration for not only me, but for every girl  
that came along,'' jockey Diane Nelson said. ``I can remember a 
change happening, when you had big outfits, and the nice horses, 
and people would take a chance on a girl. It wasn't an oddity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, said there are no  
definite plans for the future, adding she has ``many options.'' 
Among those are working in television -- ``I'd love to be able to 
work in TV during Derby week'' -- dabbling in art and photography 
and continuing her education toward a psychology degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, who rides this weekend in Florida and Maryland, will end  
her career the following Sunday at Lone Star Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her career was plagued by injuries, she appeared to be  
in top form after finishing third in the Fair Grounds jockey 
standings with 84 winners. She also surpassed the 3,500-win mark 
and won five races in a day on two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were too many aches and pains.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this Olympic runner I read about (who set three  
world records the summer she decided to quit),'' Krone said. ``I'd 
go to sleep at night, and my ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd 
think, `I just want to get this over with.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her impressive run of success in 1987, five years  
after winning her first riding title at Atlantic City. She became 
the first female to win riding titles at major tracks such as 
Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1989, she was 
the nation's third-leading rider with 368 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, she was a regular on the New York circuit and a year  
later won a career-best $9.1 million in purses. In '92 and '93, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1993, she became the third jockey to win five races  
in a day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte were the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 days later, Krone went down in a spill and severely  
fractured her right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws 
to reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time  
at Gulfstream. Krone broke both hands, but never regained her top 
form until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race, then added two more winners before the fracture 
was diagnosed a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later, and on Feb. 16 she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a student of the game and a student of horses,'' Hall  
of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens said. ``She was interested in the 
training part, too. She worked hard in the mornings and she worked 
hard in the afternoon. ... For her to win 3,500 is remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her accomplishments in 1993, Krone was selected one of  
Glamour Magazine's 10 Women of the Year and one of five ``Women of 
the Year,'' along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, by CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
	But what Krone takes with her are memories of inspiring young  
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``When some little girl comes up to me beaming and she goes, `I  
play soccer with the boys, and I'm the best scorer and you're my 
hero and I read about you,' those are the times I feel I made a 
difference,'' Krone said. ``If I made a little girl more brave than 
she might have been and perhaps put a spark under someone who was 
having a bad day, those can be the best moments.''

<HEADLINE> Stores To Accommodate Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Swifty Marts, a convenience store chain in the  
Southeast, agreed with the Justice Department on Thursday to modify 
all its 53 stores to accommodate customers with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-court settlement resolves allegations that Suwannee  
Swifty Convenience Stores, located in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, 
violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by failing to provide 
refueling assistance or accessible parking and routes for disabled 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Swifty Mart, based in Tallahassee, Fla.,  
will bring 16 of its stores into compliance by May of this year. By 
November 2000, the remaining 37 Swifty Mart stores will provide the 
same accessible features, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stores were purchased in August 1997 by ES &AMP; ES Acquisitions  
Corp., which later formed Swifty Mart Corp.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mayor Nabbed on Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Gerald ``Ajax'' Ackerman doesn't look  
like a typical mayor, with his flowing red beard, ponytail and 
leather duds. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't have the background of a typical mayor, either. He  
admits he's a former drug and alcohol addict who prefers to ride 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	For this close-knit city of 37,000, electing such a man to the  
mayor's seat took what one councilman described as ``a lot of 
trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That trust may have been shattered Wednesday, as the man who  
used his story of struggle to help young people was charged with 14 
counts of sexual misconduct involving children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This community just feels violated,'' said City Council member  
Cliff Schrader. ``They put a lot of faith and trust in Ajax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The usually flamboyant and outspoken Ackerman stood silent  
during his arraignment in a courtroom crowded with more than 50 
people. He was released on $25,000 bond after the judge entered an 
innocent plea on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, 42, was charged with six counts of first-degree  
criminal sexual conduct, five counts of criminal sexual conduct, 
two counts of production of child abusive material and one count of 
indecent exposure. The charges involve four girls, ages 9, 14, and 
two who are 11, police Capt. Brian Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman is accused of taking pornographic photos of some of the  
girls and appearing with them in some, Moeller said. Police spent 
four hours Tuesday night searching Clear Choices, a counseling 
facility that Ackerman runs, and confiscated two computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Johnson, 38, sends her daughter, Lindsey, 6, to Clear  
Choices. The news of Ackerman's arrest shocked her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She enjoyed going there. They played games -- they just made  
Easter bunnies,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``She thought the world of him. 
... She'll never go again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, honored five years ago by the National Association of  
Social Workers, became mayor -- a mostly ceremonial role, since the 
city has a city-manager form of government -- in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he moved here in the late 1980s, he has been considered a  
role model for kids and a motivation for others trying to break 
free of their addictions. He has worked part-time at a mental 
health center and a HIV/AIDS clinic, opened Clear Choices and 
volunteered at a shelter for runaways. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who once welcomed him to this community about an hour  
north of Detroit voiced outrage Wednesday, while others expressed 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he kind of let his community down,'' said Donna  
Stranyak, 36, a waitress at the downtown Cavis Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her patrons, Randy Arnott, 47, a laborer and longtime  
resident, doesn't believe the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't see him do that,'' he said. ``It could be some  
kind of hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Ackerman could face life in prison, but would more  
likely get a 16- to 23-year prison sentence, said prosecutor Mona 
Sayed. 
</P>
<P>
	An alcoholic at 14, Ackerman was in and out of rehabilitation  
facilities for most of his 20s before sobering up. 
</P>
<P>
	He is separated from his wife, and the two are seeking a  
divorce. He has a 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing in the city charter calls for the mayor's removal  
because of felony charges, but City Council member Anita Ashford 
said she thinks he should resign as a ``last act of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Wrubel, 27, a mortgage loan processor, said she thinks  
the community will rally around Ackerman. ``There's so many kids 
and so many people that look up to him,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schrader isn't sure how the community will react.  
</P>
<P>
	``You reach out and you trust somebody and that trust is  
violated -- and how do you trust again?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Suspect's DNA Linked Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man suspected of raping dozens of women --  
sometimes more than one at a time -- has been linked by DNA evidence 
to 17 attacks, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspect Issac Jones, 34, raped 51 women in 39 different  
attacks. In the latest incident, on Feb. 14, two women were raped 
and robbed in an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was arrested Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Police say he is the man they were searching for when four  
officers shot and killed an unarmed immigrant on Feb. 4, a killing 
that sparked protests by hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Jones lived less than a  
mile from the immigrant, Amadou Diallo, and many of the rapes took 
place in his Bronx neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was held without bail on charges of rape, robbery,  
possessing a weapon and possessing stolen property. He has 
confessed to four rapes, Safir said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Dole, his court-appointed attorney, declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones worked as a floor polisher in the General Motors Building  
in Manhattan. Stephanie Wright, a secretary for a law firm, told 
the Daily News that Jones called her ``Ma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a son to me,'' Ms. Wright said. ``He was always  
smiling, laughing and giggling. He was sweet, he made me laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who live in the 10-story apartment building where  
Jones shared an apartment with his girlfriend said he kept to 
himself, but sometimes threw loud parties. 
</P>
<P>
	A police sketch of the rapist had been posted in the building's  
lobby.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Jackpot Still Unclaimed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With no one stepping forward to claim the nation's  
second-largest lottery jackpot, the story going around Boston on 
Thursday was that the winner of the $197 million prize was an 
immigrant cab driver with a family to support. 
</P>
<P>
	That, at least, was what they were saying down at the Town Taxi  
garage, with which the winner -- supposedly a Nigerian immigrant 
known only as ``Patrick'' -- was said to be affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	According to this rags-to-riches story, he drove a cab 60 hours  
a week, starting before daybreak, to support his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kicked back, quiet, never causes a bit of trouble,'' said John  
Ford, vice president of Town Taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no one seemed to know Patrick's full name, where he  
lived or where he went Wednesday morning after driving from a cab 
stand at Logan Airport, a lottery ticket as his only companion. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has come forward. It's totally speculation,'' said  
Susan Frigoletto, a lottery spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-state Big Game drawing was held Tuesday night. All  
anyone seems to know for certain is that the winning ticket was 
sold at a store near the Town Taxi garage in Boston's Fenway 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said Patrick announced he held the winner after another  
cabbie recited the winning combination as cabs were lined up at the 
airport. At least two other taxi drivers supposedly saw his ticket 
before he drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	He never radioed Town Taxi, and dispatchers have not been able  
to reach him. Because he's an independent driver who leases his 
cab, he didn't have to return the car to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said one of the driver's friends called to say the cabbie  
had won the prize. Other than that, ``we just know he's hiding 
somewhere,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize, after taxes, will pay either a lump sum of about $70  
million, or 26 annual payments of about $5.1 million. 
Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan and Virginia 
take part in the Big Game lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	If the prize is claimed by one person, it will be the largest  
lottery jackpot ever won by an individual in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest jackpot was won by 13 Ohio machinists who  
pooled their money and split a $295 million Powerball prize in 
July.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- A state lawmaker apologized to a colleague after  
telling her: ``You can't be Jewish. You don't have a big hooked 
nose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Barbara Blewster made the comment last week to Rep.

Leff and other Jewish lawmakers left to attend traditional Passover

oh prejudiced one.'' Leff said Blewster later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary to think that there's someone in the Legislature  
that's so uninformed,'' Leff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blewster said she was ``flabbergasted that my enjoyable, private

newspaper. I have no prejudice at all. I admire the Jews.''

<HEADLINE> 'Power Cola' Targets Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Royal Crown Co., a distant rival to Coke and  
Pepsi in the cola wars, has come up with a drink it calls a power 
cola loaded with extra caffeine and other energy boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	RC Edge, which began showing up in delis and convenience stores  
over the past month, is being marketed mainly to teen-age boys on 
the radio, in magazines and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	With 63 percent more caffeine than Royal Crown's flagship RC  
Cola, RC Edge packs a punch closer to that of Jolt Cola from Global 
Beverage Co. of Rochester, N.Y., and the high-caffeine citrus 
drinks Mountain Dew from Pepsi-Cola Co. and Surge from Coca-Cola 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	They all are aimed mainly at active teens.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing good about giving a sugary drink with a  
mildly addictive stimulant to kids,'' Patricia Lieberman, who has 
studied the effects of caffeine for the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, a public health advocacy organization, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the danger is that people served high-caffeine drinks  
may come to crave them over more healthful beverages like milk or 
fruit juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio ads planned for 25 major markets over the next few months  
irreverently depict RC Edge drinkers as kids who might take a 
chainsaw to a flower patch or hit golf balls through the 
principal's window. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are walking a fine line between having some fun and being a  
little mischievous,'' said Jeffrey Spencer, a top marketer for 
Royal Crown, based in White Plains, N.Y. He said there is nothing 
mean-spirited intended. 
</P>
<P>
	The beverage, which is being sold in 20-ounce cobalt blue  
plastic bottles sold one at a time, should be available nationally 
by May. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft drink industry analysts say Royal Crown needs a spark and  
that RC Edge appears to have been inspired by the recent popularity 
of functional drinks that do more than satisfy thirst. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the extra caffeine, RC Edge carries two  
marginally exotic ingredients -- Indian ginseng said to be ``prized 
for its ability to strengthen and assist the body's resistance to 
stress'' and taurine, an amino acid said to boost energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to create a new category of cola,'' Spencer said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Crown could use a boost. Its overall sales volume for  
brands that include RC Cola and Diet Rite drinks has tumbled 32 
percent over the past three years, according to figures from 
Beverage Marketing Corp., an industry research and consulting firm. 
In that same period, industrywide soft-drink sales rose 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	RC Cola accounted for 0.7 percent of the $56 billion U.S. soft  
drink market in 1998, Beverage Marketing figures showed. That was 
far behind the cola leaders Coca-Cola Classic at 20.6 percent and 
Pepsi-Cola at 14.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, RC Cola has been falling further behind the leaders  
as its sales volume sank 16.7 percent last year while Coke and 
Pepsi were up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If RC wants to sell more cola, it needs to differentiate  
itself from Coke and Pepsi,'' said beverage industry watcher, John 
Sicher of Beverage Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer hoped that by targeting males between ages 12 and 20,  
that RC Edge will bring new customers to the entire Royal Crown 
group of beverages. It also may appeal to college students, truck 
drivers and emergency room attendants who need to ward off sleep, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said each 8-ounce serving of RC Edge has 46.8 milligrams of  
caffeine compared with 28.7 in Royal Crown, 36.7 for Coca-Cola and 
24.7 for Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Crown is also planning to give away a million bottles of  
RC Edge to consumers and advertise in magazines like Thrasher and 
Snowboarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer said Royal Crown will spend $1.3 million on marketing  
the new drink through July. 
</P>
<P>
	That is only a fraction of the $100 million campaign that  
Pepsi-Cola said it was spending to introduce its Pepsi One starting 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live within our means,'' Spencer said.

<HEADLINE> W. Va. Voters To Decide on Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) -- There are 650 spacious  
rooms, three golf courses, 20 tennis courts, a spa and even 
whitewater rafting at The Greenbrier resort. It's five stars, all 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding the 6,500 acres of lush opulence nestled in an  
Allegheny Mountain valley is the rest of Greenbrier County, with an 
annual per capita income of $17,559 and an unemployment rate among 
the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	For Donna Linton, shelling out $768 for a night in one of  
resort's rooms, 121 estate houses or 33 suites may be beyond her 
means. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as a county voter, she will help decide if the resort  
that has catered to politicians, business magnates, the occasional 
movie star and royalty for 221 years becomes even more exclusive -- 
by opening a casino available only for overnight guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not opposed to gambling or anything,'' Linton said as she  
walked along a downtown street. ``It might benefit the people 
higher up. Personally, it doesn't matter to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choice facing Ms. Linton and the rest of the county's 34,700  
residents is between the promise of economic development and the 
side effects of introducing what would be West Virginia's first 
gambling hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street from The Greenbrier's luxurious entrance on West  
Main Street are shuttered storefronts and boarded-up shop windows 
in one block after another. 
</P>
<P>
	With an annual payroll of about $46 million, the resort is the  
county's chief economic engine. The hotel staff grows to 1,600 
during peak seasons, making it by far the largest employer in a 
three-county area. 
</P>
<P>
	Joblessness and low pay are helping buttress economic arguments  
in support of the casino. The hotel says the casino will create 100 
jobs, and would help retain most of the 750 employees let go during 
slow winter months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanda Lester, 46, an employee at the Stonehouse General Store in  
Lewisburg, 15 miles west of here, said a casino is ``another way to 
bring people to West Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to bring more business, more jobs,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, however, talk about the addictive nature of gambling  
and the potential ill effect on families, including divorce, abuse 
and suicide. They argue crime and unemployment would increase. 
</P>
<P>
	As each drive to broaden gambling ``continues to nudge our  
culture, our culture will be the worse for it,'' said Julian 
Sulgit, co-pastor at the Lewisburg United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature this year ended years of debate on the issue by  
authorizing a referendum on the casino in Greenbrier County. A vote 
has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure authorizes the Lottery Commission to issue one  
license for a historic resort -- and only The Greenbrier, which is 
listed as a National Historic Landmark, fits the description. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino is expected to gross about $11 million a year,  
according to a Tax Division estimate. The Greenbrier would pay 
about $4.2 million in taxes and $740,000 to the state Lottery 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $6 million would go to the hotel, which estimates  
it will cost about $5.9 million to operate a casino. That leaves a 
$150,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbrier County would receive 4 percent of the gross proceeds,  
which County Commission President Woody Hanna said is ``not an 
extreme amount of money'' for the county's annual budget of less 
than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a 2 percent tax on the casino's gross proceeds, included  
in the legislation authorizing the referendum, would pump $70,000 
into White Sulphur Springs' coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Wood, who owns The Tansy Shop, a clothing and antiques  
consignment store in Lewisburg, opposes relying on casinos for 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm personally against it,'' she said. ``Gambling in general  
creates an atmosphere and a situation where people would be 
vulnerable to it. There's enough with the lottery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 25 county residents has formed West Virginia  
Families Against Casino Gambling to consider ways to bar a casino. 
</P>
<P>
	For James Jones, the 33-year-old owner of Jones Hardware, the  
choice isn't easy: ``I'm religious, but at the same time, I think 
it's going to be a positive job source.''

<HEADLINE> Self-Employed Top IRS Audit Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The precise method used by the Internal  
Revenue Service to select income tax returns for audit is a closely 
guarded secret. But some red flags are known: unusually high 
itemized deductions or high deductions from the self-employed, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, what you're going to see is people who have  
something out of the ordinary on the return,'' said Mike 
Szalkowski, senior manager at Ernst &AMP; Young accountants in Atlanta. 
``For instance, a high mortgage interest deduction and low income. 
They look for things that don't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS audits less than 2 percent of the returns it receives  
and will not disclose exactly how it targets them. 
</P>
<P>
	From the agency's point of view, the only people who should fear  
an audit are those who are trying to cheat or those who do not have 
documentation for their deductions or other claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're entitled to a deduction, and you have the records to  
back it up, by all means you should take it,'' IRS spokesman Don 
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of audited tax returns are picked by IRS computers in  
Martinsburg, W.Va., using what is called the ``discriminant 
function,'' or DIF. These are top secret formulas designed to 
screen for returns that have a higher potential for payment of more 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other audits are selected through referrals from state and local  
governments, from criminal cases and by special enforcement 
programs such as those aimed at cutting down questionable tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York accountant Nick Morrow said statistics show two broad  
categories of tax returns are frequently flagged by the computers: 
Schedule C returns filed by the self-employed where deductions 
exceed 63 percent of income and Schedule A itemized deductions that 
are over 44 percent of adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	Because final audit decisions are made by humans at IRS and not  
machines, Morrow said people who fall into these categories should 
make sure their returns are not sloppy and that numbers are not too 
rounded, so they appear designed to just meet legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Other red flags include big deductions such as those for medical  
expenses, which must exceed 7.5 percent of a taxpayer's gross 
income, unusually large charitable contributions or casualty 
losses, large moving expenses or hobby losses and claims for 
business use of the home. The IRS also occasionally has targeted 
certain professions for extra scrutiny, such as lawyers and taxi 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, 1 million to 2 million individual returns are  
audited. By far the most common is the correspondence audit, in 
which the taxpayer receives an IRS letter asking for more 
information about one or two relatively simple items. 
</P>
<P>
	If the claims are documented, usually the case is closed. If  
not, the taxpayer gets another letter describing the additional 
taxes to be paid. A key reminder for taxpayers: Respond promptly in 
writing to every IRS letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love to see paper,'' said Morrow, personal finance  
director at Martin Geller CPA. ``Give them plenty of it, as long as 
it's relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More complex audits, often those involving business returns or  
investments, are handled in IRS district offices by revenue agents 
or tax auditors with greater training. Most professional preparers 
say taxpayers are better off if they have a lawyer or accountant on 
hand to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	But taxpayers who meet with the IRS alone should remember to  
take only the documents the government wants. It is not wise to 
start volunteering information. 
</P>
<P>
	``People start blabbing about stuff the IRS wasn't  
questioning,'' said Ernst &AMP; Young's Szalkowski. ``They definitely 
won't lend a deaf ear if you start talking about what you've 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two IRS documents, Publications 5 and 556, detail what happens  
in an audit, describe taxpayer rights and show how to appeal an 
audit. Both are available on the Internet at 
http://www.irs.ustreas.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the IRS Taxpayer Advocate's Office has a Problem  
Resolution Program available toll-free at 1-877-777-4778 to help 
resolve thorny tax disputes.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England cut its base lending rate by a  
quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent on Thursday, hoping to 
stimulate economic growth at a time of low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to reduce its base  
rate on loans to banks to a five-year low from 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came as a relief for manufacturers and labor  
unions, who have been hurt by the high value of the British pound, 
and also for homeowners paying mortgages as it could lead to lower 
consumer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Chambers of Commerce gave the cut a cautious  
welcome, noting that British interest rates remain higher than 
those of most other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the economy still fragile and inflationary pressures  
flat, a more significant cut was both workable and necessary,'' it 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Armitage, chief economist at the Engineering Employers'  
Federation, agreed, saying that British companies were at a 
competitive disadvantage. European competitors still could borrow 
more cheaply, and they could sell their exports for less because 
their currencies were weaker than the pound, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, The Royal Bank of Scotland took a contrary view and  
called the rate cut a mistake. It said the Bank of England has gone 
too far in easing access to credit and will have to reverse course 
next year by raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, the Bank of England gave no explanation for  
the cut, and the Treasury declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation has slipped below 2.5 percent, however, and analysts  
said the central bank may have felt it could safely resume its 
downward push on rates without stoking upward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England has slashed the base rate by 2.25 percent in  
the past seven months.

<HEADLINE> Spyglass To Acquire Navitel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Spyglass Inc. announced today an $11.3  
million deal to acquire Navitel Communications Inc., the developer 
of a Microsoft Windows CE-based software and applications program 
for Internet-enabled telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyglass will issue 1.25 million shares to Navitel stockholders  
and option holders, resulting in a transaction valued at 
approximately $11.3 million. It is expected to be completed within 
15 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Navitel, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has worked closely with  
Microsoft developing Windows CE-based software for information 
appliances. Navitel developed the software for Microsoft's 
``Hermes'' Web-enabled telephone platform. The prototype phones 
combined enhanced data capabilities such as Internet access and 
e-mail with traditional phone services such as voice messaging and 
caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows CE is operating system software used for devices that  
don't require a full-featured operating system like Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyglass announced Wednesday that it will license technology to  
Microsoft Corp. and work with the company to help accelerate the 
development of Windows CE-based products. Doug Colbeth, Spyglass 
president and chief executive officer, said the Navitel deal will 
help facilitate the services that Spyglass will provide to 
Microsoft under that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has used Spyglass' technology before. In 1995, it  
licensed Spyglass' Mosaic software code for its Internet Explorer 
browser.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Expected To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebounding crude oil prices, sparked by recent  
cuts in world production, are expected to cause gasoline prices to 
be about a dime a gallon higher this summer than last, the Energy 
Information Administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency predicted the average price for regular, self-service  
gasoline will peak at $1.18 a gallon in May and average $1.13 a 
gallon over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The price jump was attributed to an expectation of a continuing  
upward track in crude oil prices because of recent agreement among 
world producers to reduce production. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also have been affected, especially in California, by  
refinery problems. The average price for regular self-service 
gasoline in California peaked at $1.59 a gallon on April 5, which 
was 49 cents a gallon higher than a year ago, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency predicted that crude oil prices will continue to  
rise, with West Texas intermediate selling at $15.63 per 44-gallon 
barrel on Thursday moving to $18 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline demand this summer is expected to increase by 2 percent  
over a year ago because of continued economic growth and prices, 
though higher than last year, still moderate by historic standards, 
the agency said. Still, gasoline stocks were high, especially in 
the East, with no supply problems anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Information Administration is the statistical arm of  
the Energy Department.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia: Kosovo Offensive Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia urged refugees to return  
home Thursday, declaring ``peace has prevailed in Kosovo'' and 
saying its 14-month war against ethnic Albanian separatists was 
over. But Western officials feared those same refugees would be 
used as human shields against NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As the United States pledged that NATO will press ahead with the  
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, a former Cypriot president 
arrived in Belgrade to try to win freedom for three captured U.S. 
soldiers. His task could prove difficult: A hard-line Serbian vice 
premier ruled out any release as long as the NATO bombardment 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 16th day of the U.S.-led air assault, hopes for the  
prisoners' release were mixed with concern over thousands of ethnic 
Albanian refugees whose fate was unknown a day after Yugoslavia 
sealed off its borders and stopped their flight out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government, which says it is observing a unilateral  
cease-fire in Kosovo since Tuesday for Orthodox Easter, claimed the 
refugees were voluntarily heading back to their homes in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	As night fell Thursday, several thousand people chanting  
``Yugoslavia! Yugoslavia!'' gathered on two major bridges in 
Belgrade and the remaining Danube River bridge in the city of Novi 
Sad to serve as volunteer ``human shields'' against NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 10 p.m., air-raid sirens sounded in Belgrade.  
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou, currently the speaker of the Cypriot  
parliament, said he planned to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic on Friday and that the Americans might be freed during 
the long Orthodox Easter weekend. He called on NATO to reciprocate 
with a cease-fire over the holiday, something the alliance has 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj, leader of the influential Serbian  
Radical Party, told reporters Thursday that releasing the Americans 
was ``out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said only an  
unconditional release would be acceptable. ``Any attempt to use 
this as a bargaining chip is both illegal and immoral,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton insisted that NATO can still win in Kosovo  
without sending in ground troops, and expressed hope Thursday that 
the three servicemen would be freed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see the servicemen released because they  
never should have been detained in the first place,'' Clinton said 
during a news conference with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Iowa, said the bombing  
would continue, adding ``Milosevic knows what he has to do to bring 
this to a conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although NATO arranged for safe passage for Kyprianou's flight,  
alliance warplanes and missiles struck before dawn Thursday in 
Belgrade and against government troops in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also warned that Yugoslavia's state-run radio and  
television network could be one of its next targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has filled the airwaves with hate and with lies over the  
years and especially now. It is therefore a legitimate target,'' 
Air Commodore David Wilby told reporters at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said some Yugoslav television  
facilities already have been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Marshal Sir John Day said NATO forces would ``take every  
precaution'' to make sure they avoid targets where refugees may be 
used as human shields. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Still), at the end of the day, the responsibility is  
Milosevic's,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, Milosevic's government claimed that  
``peace has prevailed in Kosovo,'' and said its security forces had 
``ended the offensive, anti-terrorist activities'' against the 
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been fighting for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yugoslav government once again calls on all citizens of  
Kosovo not to leave their country, to live in harmony and 
cooperation, and in that way resist the bombs that kill regardless 
of nationality,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a million ethnic Albanians have fled or were driven out  
of Kosovo since the NATO bombing campaign began March 24, 
unleashing Europe's greatest mass displacement in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Those reaching refuge in neighboring states have described a  
systematic campaign of terror by Serb troops and police against 
ethnic Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the Serbian province's 
prewar population of 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO allies have dismissed Yugoslavia's claims of a unilateral  
ceasefire, saying the bombing campaign will continue Milosevic 
allows the return of all refugees, withdraws all troops and accepts 
a peace plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been impossible to confirm whether the cease-fire has  
taken effect on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	After targeting fuel depots, transport links and other  
infrastructure throughout Yugoslavia, Western officials say the 
latest wave of air attacks focused on Serb police and army units 
scattered in rural areas of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Small Yugoslav units have been blamed for most of the atrocities  
against ethnic Albanians, and targeting them in the hills and 
forests of the largely rural province has proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes on roads and bridges in Kosovo are hampering the  
ability of Serb forces to move around, according to accounts 
Thursday by French journalists who entered western Kosovo with KLA 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have attacked the nervous system, we have attacked the  
central system as well, that is to say a part of the brain that is 
conducting the operations,'' French Army Chief of Staff Gen. 
Jean-Pierre Kelche said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, claimed it was not responsible for the  
widespread damage in Kosovo's capital of Pristina and blamed Serb 
forces for gutting the heart of the once-bustling city. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Commodore David Wilby, briefing reporters at NATO  
headquarters said while NATO has attacked military targets around 
Pristina, including its police headquarters, televised photos 
showed much more widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO has certainly not caused the reported widespread and  
random damage, which we believe has been orchestrated by Serbian 
forces,'' Wilby told reporters at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal officials in Pristina declared a day of mourning for  
what it said were 10 victims of NATO strikes Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Zhu Share Evening of Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid differences over trade, human rights and  
other issues, President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji took 
a break Thursday to revel in an evening of music, one of their 
shared passions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't many leaders who understand both the intricacies  
of global finance and the intricacies of Beijing opera, and who 
voice both blunt political views and blunt musical opinions,'' 
Clinton said, toasting the premier at an official White House 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton teased Zhu about the premier's admission that Western  
opera puts him to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Yo-Yo Ma understands the pressure on him!'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The renowned cellist performed for the two leaders and more than  
200 dinner guests in an East Room decorated in red and gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu charmed the audience with his unabashed candor. He never  
actually took a nap, the premier insisted through a translator, but 
he often wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier also admitted ``he felt he couldn't move his legs''  
after shaking hands with everyone in the receiving line. ``I'm 
already 70 years old, not as young as President Clinton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a great sense of humor,'' said Rev. Billy Graham, an  
old friend of Zhu's who attended the dinner. ``I think he has 
turned China around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent corporate leaders -- from the head of America Online to  
the president of the Motion Picture Association of America-- warmly 
greeted the premier. Guests said it was important to focus on where 
alliances could grow despite varied tensions clouding the meeting 
between the two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``ichelle Kwan, noted AIDS researcher  
David Ho and filmmaker Joan Chen were among the other guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma said the evening's selections celebrated transnational themes  
-- and the power that music has to overcome differences between 
cultures and nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think of China and the United States as being countries  
that are far apart,'' Ma said, as he warmed up for his evening 
performance. But in music, the countries ``are not that far away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by pianist Sara Wolfensohn and Wu Man, who plays an  
ancient four-stringed lute called the pipa, Ma highlighted the 
variety in the evening's repertoire -- from George Gershwin's Three 
Preludes to a finale of Le Grand Tango by Astor Piazzolla. 
</P>
<P>
	Composer Bright Sheng specially arranged three songs in honor of  
the event, and Ma said the pieces reflected folks tunes that Sheng 
himself heard while growing up in Shanghai, interlaced with Sheng's 
U.S. training under Leonard Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is fabulous are the results that can happen when you have  
influences from one place and another coming together,'' Ma said. 
``To get into any art form, you have just one requirement -- you 
have to start from the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Clinton and Zhu talked quite a lot about music during  
the premier's visit, said White House social secretary Capricia 
Marshall. Like Clinton, the Chinese leader enjoys listening to 
music and on occasion, takes up an instrument himself -- a Chinese 
version of the dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president presented Zhu with an American-style dulcimer,  
handcrafted from Mountain View, Ark., as his official gift. First 
lady Hillary Clinton, noting the fondness of Zhu's wife, Madame Lao 
An, for flowers, picked out a set of four stained glass panels 
designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright as her gift. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the premier and his wife brought for the first family  
a giant sketch of the president, first lady and daughter Chelsea at 
the Great Wall, set in a cherry wood frame. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Room gave out a red glow as Ronald Reagan base plates,  
featuring a red border, lay on rose dante damask tablecloths. 
Vermeil flatware and gold candlesticks surrounded the table flower 
arrangements of Icelandic poppies, Raphaela roses and parrot 
tulips. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chef Walter Scheib prepared a dinner that both  
celebrated the arrival of spring and the premier's fondness for 
fresh vegetables. More than 20 vegetables, including such unusual 
finds as bayou asparagus, peppered the menu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time of year to be a chef,'' Scheib said.  
</P>
<P>
	A roasted salmon, dark enough to be accompanied by a red wine,  
and grilled chicken with vidalia onion glaze headlined the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The sumptuous feast also featured some specialties from abroad.  
The kitchen imported Chinese truffles, and dessert chef Roland 
Mesnier prepared an orange sherbet and tea parfait with tea brought 
by a friend from China. Glazed kumquat tartlettes, and miniature 
mango puddings -- a favorite in China -- rounded out the evening's 
sweets. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> ABC To Start Soap Opera Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you miss some of your favorite soap operas  
during the day, you may soon have a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday it is launching a cable  
television network devoted to soap operas early next year. Its 
prime-time schedule will consist of four ABC soap operas that were 
broadcast on Disney-owned ABC earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is programming targeted to a specific audience -- with an  
audience that is sizable and extraordinarily loyal,'' said Anne 
Sweeney, president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	With the network television business hurting financially, this  
venture represents a way for ABC to wring more revenue from its 
programming. Some ABC affiliates have opposed the idea, however, 
fearing that a nighttime airing of soap operas would drive away 
some of their viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing of the soap opera channel in Chicago and Houston  
revealed that it actually drove more viewers to the daytime airings 
because more people got into the habit of watching soaps, Sweeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said the new channel, which hasn't been named yet, is  
expected to feature movies and some original programming, although 
no specific plans were announced Thursday. One potentially fertile 
ground is rerunning classic shows; three of the current ABC dramas 
began in 1970 or before. 
</P>
<P>
	There's potentially a wide audience of current ``General  
Hospital'' fans who want to see the Luke and Laura episodes from 
the early 1980s, said Carolyn Hinsey, executive editor of Soap 
Opera Digest. The channel might also want to resurrect canceled ABC 
soaps like ``Ryan's Hope'' or ``Edge of Night,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women aren't staying home as much as they used to,'' Hinsey  
said. ``They're not folding laundry and watching their 
grandmother's soap operas. If they're offered a chance to watch 
them at another part of the day, I think it can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney-owned ABC had an advantage in launching a soap opera  
channel because it owns the dramas that it airs: ``General 
Hospital,'' ``All My Children,'' ``One Life to Live'' and ``Port 
Charles.'' Many soaps on other networks are made by independent 
production companies. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility some of these companies would lease their  
programs to the new cable outlet, but they would risk offending the 
broadcast networks that carry the shows during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely a market for it,'' said Derek Baine, a  
cable television analyst for Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates. ``I would 
just question how much flak they're going to get from their 
affiliates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had been talking about compensating affiliates as part of  
complicated negotiations where the network is also asking stations 
to help kick in for the costs of ``Monday Night Football.'' But 
those talks recently broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	Two recent developments may have emboldened ABC to move ahead  
with the soap opera channel despite the lack of an agreement. NBC 
announced an agreement to allow the USA cable network to air a new 
show, ``Sex Crimes,'' shortly after it is shown on the network. And 
Fox said this week it would take back commercial time from its 
affiliates to drive more revenue to the network.

<HEADLINE> Five Teens Killed in Calif. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) -- Five teen-agers were killed  
Thursday when their car, traveling at least 80 mph, drove off a 
freeway and crashed upside down in a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	Four young men died on impact in the 1 p.m. crash about 25 miles  
north of Los Angeles. The driver, a 17-year-old girl, was flown to 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia with head, chest 
and abdominal injuries. She died at 5:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the victims were not immediately released. The four  
men were all about 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver lost control when she tried to change lanes,  
California Highway Patrol spokesman Doug Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver and three of the men were ejected. It was not  
immediately clear whether the victims were wearing seatbelts, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Major Ice Shelves Melting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Global warming has speeded the melting of two  
Antarctic ice shelves, which lost nearly 1,100 square miles of area 
in the last year, U.S. and British researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Colorado and the British  
Atlantic Survey in Cambridge say regional warming has increased the 
annual melt season by up to three weeks over the past two decades, 
putting the Larsen B and Wilkins shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula 
in ``full retreat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite photos show the Larsen B ice shelf has continued to  
crumble after an initial small retreat in the spring of 1998, the 
researchers said Wednesday. Since November, another 660 square 
miles of shelf area caved away. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the peninsula, the Wilkins ice shelf  
retreated nearly 420 square miles in early March 1998, said Ted 
Scambos, a research associate at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder's National Snow and Ice Data Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The radar images showed a large area of completely shattered  
ice, indicating an ice front 35 kilometers (21 miles) back from its 
previous extent,'' said Scambos. 
</P>
<P>
	He said thousands of small icebergs had appeared, suggesting  
``that the shelves are essentially broken up in place and then 
flushed out by storms or currents afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Vaughan, a researcher with British Antarctic Survey, said  
ice shelves in the area have been in retreat for 50 years but those 
losses have only included about 2,700 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within a few years, much of the Wilkins ice shelf will be  
gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vaughan said the meltdown has few implications for the  
environment. Birds and animals are not known to rely on the ice 
shelves and there would be no increase in sea levels ``because an 
ice shelf is floating anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1940s, British researchers have reported an increase  
in mean annual temperature in the Antarctic of 4.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Summer temperatures now approach, and sometimes exceed 
32 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice shelves are floating plates of ice that are still attached  
to continents, which form when large glaciers flow toward the ocean 
in polar areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen B is about 2,700 square miles, the size of Delaware.  
Wilkins is nearly twice that size.

<HEADLINE> NATO Strikes Yugoslav Armor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO is taking the fight in Yugoslavia to Serb  
military forces in the field, striking armored vehicles with ``tank 
killer'' A-10 warplanes that may be re-enforced in the days ahead. 
But there is growing Pentagon concern that ethnic Albanian refugees 
could get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of civilians there that are innocent  
civilians, particularly Kosovar Albanians,'' Maj. Gen. Charles 
Wald, a senior official with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said 
Wednesday after Yugoslav authorities sealed off major border points 
in Kosovo to prevent refugee crossings. ``There aren't clear lines 
of where the bad guys are and the friendlies are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department listed nine Serb commanders whose troops  
may have committed war crimes, although U.S. officials said there 
was no specific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is eager for the release  
of three U.S. soldiers who were captured last week on the 
Kosovo-Macedonia border. A Cypriot mediator was going to Belgrade 
today to consider an apparent offer from Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to turn over the prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
	But Defense Secretary William Cohen declared today that the  
bombing will not be halted in order to secure their release. ``We 
are not going to have Mr. Milosevic ... use them to cause any 
cessation of hostilities. We are going to continue our campaign 
effort,'' he said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be returned immediately. ... There can be no  
conditions attached to their release,'' Cohen said, echoing 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to give anybody false hopes, but I think it is useful  
that the acting president of Cyprus is going there,'' Albright said 
Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' program. ``I would 
like to see them home. They are very brave Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spyros Kyprianou, speaker in the Cypriot parliament, was  
undertaking the mission for the release of Army Staff Sgt. Andrew 
A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Spc. Steven M. Gonzalez, 21, of 
Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of 
Smiths Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials maintain the reconnaissance team was abducted  
illegally by Serb forces, who claimed the men had crossed into 
Yugoslavia territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NATO airstrikes won't come to a halt during Kyprianou's  
mission, the Pentagon suggested the allied forces can ensure his 
safe passage to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Serb forces apparently shot down an unmanned U.S.  
Army reconnaissance aircraft over Kosovo in the second NATO 
aircraft loss since airstrikes began March 24. The first occurred 
March 27 when an F-117A stealth fighter-bomber went down outside 
Belgrade after it apparently was struck by a missile, although it's 
still under investigation. The pilot was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine, unmanned aircraft, known as a Hunter, is used  
as a surveillance aid that can transmit real-time video images to 
battlefield commanders. It is smaller and less sophisticated than 
the Predator, the other U.S. unmanned surveillance aircraft flying 
over Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is investigating the cause of the crash of the  
$300,000 to $350,000 drone. A defense official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said it appeared the Hunter was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes, taking advantage of clear weather, began  
intensifying this week on Serb troops, tanks, armored vehicles and 
artillery in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians remain under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been performing operations in what we call the  
engagement zone,'' said Wald, vice director for strategic plans and 
policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	An A-10 ``tank killer'' scored hits for the first time, hitting  
a column of armored vehicles, Wald said. Navy fighters from the USS 
Roosevelt aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea joined the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO planes also hit more fuel and ammunition dumps, roads,  
bridges, communications facilities, command and control sites, and 
barracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the fight right to where they live,'' Wald said.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, has  
indicated he may ask for a relatively small number of additional 
aircraft, including more A-10s and refueling aircraft, a defense 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian government has given its approval for basing 24  
U.S. Army Apache helicopter gunships on its territory for missions 
over Kosovo, but the Army says it will take more than a week to get 
them there from Germany because of time needed to assemble support 
personnel and ground rockets, and the strain refugee relief is 
putting on the air transport system in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bob Dole, who served Clinton as an envoy in  
Yugoslavia, said Wednesday he could not understand why it was 
taking so long to get Apaches in place and that it appeared 
military leaders were generally running into some political 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, he said the U.S.-led NATO effort was suffering  
from poor preparation but appeared finally to be achieving some 
goals. But he also questioned why Clinton would rule out U.S. 
ground troops -- ``telegraph your punches'' -- at the outset of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Gerald Ford said miscalculations by the White  
House have made the use of ground troops in Kosovo the only option 
short of NATO's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration overemphasized the power of  
airstrikes and underestimated the magnitude of the humanitarian 
crisis, Ford said in a telephone interview Wednesday from his home 
in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net result is they have two choices,'' he said. ``One  
choice is to go all-out and win the war with ground troops, or two, 
to quit and admit defeat.''

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo Sued by 49ers, Own Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Suspended San Francisco 49ers co-owner  
Eddie DeBartolo was sued by his own corporation and the football 
team Thursday, accused of owing the company $94 million and 
stalling a new stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and the 49ers, now run by  
DeBartolo's sister Denise DeBartolo York and her husband since 
DeBartolo became enmeshed 16 months ago in a Louisiana gambling 
fraud scandal, filed the lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said it is seeking repayment of the alleged debt,  
cutting DeBartolo's management ties to the team and ending a $10 
million financial interest claimed by DeBartolo in the $525 million 
stadium project, which has been stalled because of soaring 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plaintiffs bring this action only after exhausting all  
efforts, spanning two years, to resolve these disputes,'' the suit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokeswoman Leslie Hammond said the league did not have any  
immediate comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue sanctioned DeBartolo  
and fined him $1 million, saying he was guilty of conduct 
detrimental to the league for his involvement in the gambling fraud 
case. He also extended DeBartolo's NFL banishment until at least 
February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue forbade DeBartolo from exercising any authority over  
the 49ers' operations, and DeBartolo agreed not ``to retard or in 
any way impede'' the efforts to get a new stadium, according to the 
suit, which charges that DeBartolo violated that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue has said DeBartolo would face an additional $4 million  
fine if he violated its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo's spokesman called the lawsuit a ``sad and desperate  
act'' by York and her husband, John York. 
</P>
<P>
	``As events and the various lawsuits to come will demonstrate,  
Mr. DeBartolo is entitled to control of the 49ers following the 
lifting of his suspension, over $100 million of damages from the 
Yorks, and an immediate equal say in the running of the family 
businesses,'' said spokesman Rick Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avoid meeting their obligations, the Yorks have breached  
prior agreements, refused to attend shareholder meetings, and 
rebuffed all overtures at restoring family peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said they filed the lawsuit because ``Mrs. York will lose  
control of the board of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation at next 
Tuesday's annual meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Singer, a spokesman for the DeBartolo Corp., said he had  
``no idea'' what the $100 million referred to. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said the lawsuit was not about any personal dispute  
between DeBartolo and his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denise loves her brother very much but they have vastly  
different business styles,'' Singer said. ``What this really is 
about is this is a corporate lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said the $94 million debt incurred over a decade stemmed  
from DeBartolo's ``lavish personal lifestyle,'' a series of failed 
business attempts, and money owed to investors in other 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	League sources have said that under the league's sanctions,  
DeBartolo is forbidden from visiting the press box or the team's 
locker room. While he is free to attend games, he won't be allowed 
to sit in the owner's box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another clause includes a total prohibition on gambling, either  
by him personally or as part of his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, who pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a  
felony in connection with the gambling fraud case, could be 
reinstated by the league if he satisfies the terms of his 
banishment, Tagliabue has said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo retains the right to discuss some aspects of team  
operations with his sister and John York, now a vice president in 
the 49ers' front office. But any such discussions are to be 
strictly advisory and the Yorks are free to accept or ignore his 
advice.

<HEADLINE> Berra To Return for Yankees' Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yogi Berra returns to Yankee Stadium on Friday,  
ending his 14-year exile on a most appropriate day. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing the Yankees to a a 4-1 victory over Minnesota in  
1984, Berra uttered the final word on season debuts, coining the 
phrase: ``A home opener is always exciting, no matter whether it's 
at home or on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired the following year after a 6-10 start, and vowed  
never to return as long as George Steinbrenner owned the club. Last 
January, Berra ended the feud, saying simply: ``It's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Berra took over as the greatest living Yankee  
when Joe DiMaggio died on March 8. On Friday, he replaces the 
Yankee Clipper for the ceremonial first pitch after the World 
Series banner is raised in the Bronx for the second time in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always look forward to opening day at Yankee Stadium,''  
center fielder Bernie Williams said. ``We had a great year last 
year, and we're still enjoying the fruits of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone (20-7) makes his first start of the season, pitching  
against the Detroit Tigers' Beiker Graterol, who will be making his 
major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, still recovering from prostate cancer  
surgery, wasn't expected at the homer opener, but intends to be at 
the ballpark Sunday for the presentation of World Series rings. 
</P>
<P>
	With interim manager Don Zimmer heading the team, the Yankees  
began the season by winning two of three games at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``After losing the first game out here and winning two, I'm  
happy,'' Zimmer said before the Yankees returned home Wednesday 
night. ``We've got guys swinging the bat a little now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York won eight of 11 against Detroit last season, with Cone  
going 2-1, including two victories during a seven-day span in April 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off their 125-win season, which culminated with a World  
Series sweep of San Diego, the Yankees sold more than 2 million 
tickets before their home opener, a season record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel right winning the World Series last year and not  
having Yogi there,'' Steinbrenner said in January after Berra 
agreed to end their feud. ``I'm just happy he feels it's time to 
put this behind us. I'm glad he's said, `George, I forgive you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra has not been at Yankee Stadium for an official function  
since Steinbrenner hired Billy Martin to replace him in 1985, 
though he has occasionally showed up to visit friends. In a sign of 
the thawed relations with Steinbrenner, Berra attended a Yankees' 
spring training game last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years, I'd say, is long enough,'' Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Steinbrenner had told DiMaggio he could throw out the first  
pitch if he recovered in time. ... Andy Pettitte allowed four hits 
and stuck out five in four innings during an extended spring 
training simulated game. It originally was thought he would be 
sidelined 3-5 days after slightly spraining his right ankle 
Tuesday. ``It was a great day,'' he said. ``Both my ankle and elbow 
felt good. I felt better as it went along. I still feel a little 
naked out there facing hitters and that's normal.'' ... Pettitte 
and Darryl Strawberry, continuing his comeback from colon cancer 
surgery and lingering knee problems, will be at this weekend's 
series against the Tigers. ... The Yankees held an optional workout 
Thursday prior to their welcome-home dinner but closed it to 
reporters.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Pork Board Too Close to Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government audit raises questions about the  
close ties between a quasi-governmental board created to promote 
pork and the industry's trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	But the audit by the Agriculture Department's inspector general  
found no evidence the National Pork Board misused dollars collected 
from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our evaluation showed that the board basically used checkoff  
funds to finance pork promotion, research and consumer education 
projects,'' inspector general Roger Viadero wrote in an audit 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers contribute 45 cents of every $100 of animal value  
for a federally mandated checkoff fund. The money goes to the 
board, which later contracts promotion services through the 
National Pork Producers Council, the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	While the audit did not find ``misuse or loss of checkoff  
funds,'' the report concluded the board ``has relinquished too much 
authority to its primary contractor,'' the council, and ``has 
placed the NPPC in a position to exert undue influence over board 
budgets and grant proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The board has awarded all program grants to the NPPC since  
1996,'' Viadero wrote, recommending the board take actions to 
``accomplish appropriate separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council officials said the inspector general's concerns were  
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really stands out about this report is that it shows we  
did nothing wrong,'' NPPC President John McNutt said during a 
teleconference with the board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Viadero ``wants to dramatically change a well  
established and well functioning organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An arm's length relationship does exist between the National  
Pork Board and the NPPC,'' said Greg Boerboom, a producer from 
Marshall, Minn., who is chairman of the board's budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit comes amid a movement by some pork producers for a  
referendum on whether the checkoff should be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing separating the NPPC from the pork board except  
a couple of inches of Sheetrock. It says we're justified,'' Rhonda 
Perry, a Missouri organizer of the anti-checkoff effort, said about 
the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The board rents space in the council's Des Moines, Iowa,  
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said the group would announce next week it has enough  
signatures to force a vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, made up of 15 producers appointed by the agriculture  
secretary, was created by Congress 12 years ago to strengthen pork 
industry promotion. Last year, the program collected $47.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar programs are in place for other products such as beef,  
almonds and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems cited in the audit is that the board, with  
its staff of two, is understaffed and too reliant on the council to 
handle its duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board's dependence on the NPPC to administer subcontracts  
and carry out much of the board's work resulted in a weakened 
accountability over contributed funds,'' the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general recommended that USDA officials work with  
the board to develop a plan to ``accomplish appropriate 
separation'' from NPPC, including providing sufficient staff and 
accountability checks.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Surging at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index rose above 17,000  
points Friday morning for the first time in more than a year on the 
strength of bullish sentiment and another record finish on Wall 
Street. The dollar advanced against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 230.34 points, or 1.37 percent,  
to 17,077.03 points at the end of the morning session, marking the 
first time since March 1998 that the key index had climbed above 
the 17,000-mark. On Thursday, the average closed up 292.19 points, 
or 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.18 yen at late morning, up 0.42 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its level of 121.37 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, continued buying by foreign investors  
helped support share prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's sentiment is bullish due to gains in overseas  
markets (Thursday) and a continued favorable demand and supply 
picture,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday rose 112.39 points,  
or 1.1 percent, to close at 10,197.70. The blue-chip index soared 
past its closing high of 10,085.31 set on Wednesday, marking the 
Dow's third record close this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 10.58 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,355.65. 
The TOPIX closed up 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was higher against  
the yen early Friday in Tokyo, following Thursday's cuts in 
European interest rates, but later turned range-bound amid cautious 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank cut key interest rates by one-half  
percentage point to 2.5 percent in a measure to stimulate economic 
activity among the 11 nations that adopted the euro earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, countries or regions cut interest rates to spur  
lending and spending in a sluggish or recessionary economy. The 
downside, however, is that the lower rates also reduce the payoff 
on investments in the local currency and assets, making them less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 130.18 yen at midday, lower than 130.40  
yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.630  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.600 percent, pushing its price 
down to 101.48 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn Placed on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn, the $80 million free agent  
signed by the Anaheim Angels, was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list Thursday night because of a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``An injury like that can take anywhere from two weeks to six  
weeks to heal,'' said Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' team 
orthopedist. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn was injured when he fell into the Cleveland dugout  
chasing a foul pop in the first inning of Tuesday's opener. The 
All-Star first baseman stayed in the game for five innings, but was 
noticeably limping and pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has not played since being taken out. After two days with  
no significant improvement, the Angels decided to put him on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Chris Pritchett was recalled from Triple-A  
Vancouver to take Vaughn's spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn hit .337 with 40 home runs and 115 RBIs for Boston last  
season, then signed a six-year contract with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, with a long history of injuries to key players, now  
have Vaughn, center fielder Jim Edmonds and shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina on the disabled list.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Domino's Pizza mogul Tom Monaghan plans to  
spend $50 million of his pizza fortune to create a new law school 
aimed at producing lawyers sensitive to the moral consequences of 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be the West Point for Catholic laity in the  
years to come,'' said Monaghan, who recently sold Domino's Pizza 
for $1 billion. ``This is something I've wanted to do for some 
time, get out of the pizza business and get on to things that are 
more important.''

<P>
	The Ave Maria School of Law is scheduled to open in the fall of  
2000 in Ann Arbor with about 40 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bork, the conservative legal scholar and one-time nominee  
for the U.S. Supreme Court, has signed on as the first professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Dobranski, dean of Catholic University's law school in  
Washington, will serve as Ave Maria's dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law must be founded in a belief that there is an  
objective, moral order,'' Dobranski said in today's editions of the 
Detroit Free Press. ``This is something no law school does 
effectively.''

<HEADLINE> Eight Indiana Auto Dealers Sue GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eight Indiana auto dealers filed a  
class-action lawsuit Thursday against General Motors Corp., 
alleging that its new marketing plan illegally collects money from 
dealers to boost sales in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is the latest volley in a dispute between GM and  
some dealers over how $500 million in U.S. advertising money is 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, alleges  
that the automaker is using ``funds not belonging to it to 
advertise new General Motors products outside the area from which 
they were collected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The real question hinges on whose money is it?'' said Ron  
Smith, an attorney representing the Indiana dealers. ``It's a 
diversion of money without any local (dealer) control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana GM dealers have run joint advertising campaigns since  
the 1970s to supplement each dealer's individual advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ad groupings -- there are about 900 such groupings  
nationwide -- were financed by payments member dealers made when 
purchasing new vehicles from GM. By the late 1980s, the assessments 
equaled about 1 percent of the sticker price of cars and trucks 
sold by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting April 1, GM revamped the program, taking over how the  
money is spent. Among other things, GM is scaling back the number 
of advertising agencies used for local-advertising programs 
nationwide from about 60 to five or six. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also wants to spend more on advertising in areas of the  
country where sales are slow. 
</P>
<P>
	GM disagrees with the position of the auto dealers who filed the  
Indiana lawsuit, company spokeswoman Anne Marie Sylvester said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Various dealer lawsuits have been filed around the country,  
including one by 60 dealers in Illinois. A court settlement in 
Minnesota covered lawsuits filed in that state, western 
Pennsylvania and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute comes at a time GM is under pressure to improve  
results. Even though the auto market has been strong for most of 
the decade, GM's share of the U.S. market has been steadily 
falling.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Trooper Charged With Theft </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A state trooper accused of taking cash  
and credit cards from a man killed in a traffic accident has been 
fired and charged with theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael A. Grimes, 31, who joined the state police in December  
1997, was charged Wednesday with stealing from Eddie Jackson, 39, 
of Branson, Mo. He was freed on $5,000 bond after pleading 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimes could get 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if  
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was killed March 13 in an accident on Interstate 40. An  
arrest report said his wallet was given to Grimes by an ambulance 
company employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambulance worker told investigators he saw at least $500 in  
the wallet, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimes at first told investigators he never received the wallet,  
but later admitted he took $1,100 from it and spent it, and cut up 
credit cards and telephone calling cards, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Plan Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The International Air Transport  
Association has has rejected the revised financial rehabilitation 
plan of debt-laden Philippine Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents released Thursday by Manila's Securities and Exchange  
Commission show the industry group rejected the plan because it 
calls for a delay in the payment of some $32 million in IATA fees 
and payments to other airlines for about one year. The IATA wants 
the money sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, IATA suspended cash-strapped Philippine Airlines'  
membership after it failed to pay its dues. The suspension resulted 
in all but one of IATA's 231 members refusing to accept transfer 
passengers carrying PAL's tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mired in debts of over $2.2 billion, the airline presented a  
revised rehabilitation plan to the SEC last month. The plan has 
already been tentatively approved by the airline's major creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine Airlines' monthly billing arrears with IATA's members  
averaged $5 million, but a pilots' strike in June caused PAL to 
book thousands of passengers onto other airlines, which caused 
billing arrears to soar to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Being kept out of IATA could hinder PAL from securing transfer  
agreements for passengers and cargo with other airlines since IATA 
acts as clearinghouse for such ticketing and billing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	IATA said that as a non-member, PAL could not ``as a practical  
matter provide such services to their customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Approval of PAL's rehabilitation plan depends on the infusion of  
$200 million in fresh equity, which would give the new investor 
group 90 percent ownership in the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL closed operations in September because of labor and  
financial problems. It resumed domestic flights a month later, and 
has gradually restored limited overseas services since then.

<HEADLINE> SSI Benefits Narrow Income Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social Security benefits significantly help  
narrow the income disparities between women and men in old age, 
according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security cuts about in half the gap in poverty rates  
between elderly women and elderly men,'' said Robert Greenstein, 
executive director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit research center used 1997 Census data to measure  
the impact Social Security benefits have on lifting elderly 
Americans' incomes above the federal poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly individuals were considered to be poor in 1997 if they  
had income below $7,698 a year; or below $9,712 for elderly 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Women get a particularly good deal from Social Security, the  
study found. Although women pay 38 percent of all Social Security 
payroll taxes, they get 53 percent of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that's because women live longer than men, and Social  
Security benefits rise each year to keep up with inflation. Also, 
women make up the bulk of those who collect the special Social 
Security benefits that spouses, widows and widowers are entitled to 
receive even if they never worked themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security generally provides bigger retirement checks to  
people who earned more during their working lives, and men tend to 
earn more than women. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the program somewhat mitigates that by taking into  
account a higher percentage of low-wage workers' earnings when 
calculating their retirement benefits -- and that does help women. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors mean Social Security narrows the gap between the  
poverty rates for elderly men and women -- compared with what senior 
citizens would have if they didn't get any Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Without monthly Social Security checks, 52.6 percent of women  
ages 65 and older would be poor, compared with 40.8 percent of men 
-- a gap of 11.8 percent, the study found. But with Social Security, 
14.7 percent of elderly women were poor, compared with 8.2 percent 
of men -- cutting the old-age poverty gap between the sexes to 6.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who are not married when they are elderly do not benefit  
as much, Greenstein said. Even with Social Security benefits, the 
poverty rate among elderly widows is 20.3 percent, and for single 
and divorced women it is 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that black and Hispanic Americans draw a  
larger percentage of their old-age income from Social Security than 
whites. Elderly blacks rely on Social Security the most, getting on 
average 43.4 percent of their income from the retirement program, 
compared with 41.4 percent for Hispanics and 35.8 percent for 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Whites are more likely to have retirement income other than  
Social Security. For example, they're more than twice as likely as 
minorities to have personal investments, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the study found that without income from Social  
Security, 47.6 percent of elderly Americans -- 15.3 million people -- 
would have been poor in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security benefits, however, cut that poverty rate by  
three-quarters, to 11.9 percent, or 3.8 million senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Hit Three-Year Lows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled Thursday to 3-year lows amid fears  
Colombia will devalue its currency, creating a flood of cheap 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures continued their sharp retreat, while cocoa  
plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee fell for a second day on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York, losing nearly 5 percent in a single session, amid 
growing complaints from Colombian officials that exports are being 
hurt by an overvalued peso. 
</P>
<P>
	Since coffee is sold for dollars, producers with a weaker local  
currency often step up sales when the dollar is rising. Devaluing a 
currency would immediately cause the U.S. dollar to jump in value 
and provide greater profits to Colombian exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is the single-largest producer of the gourmet-blend  
arabicas favored by American and European consumers and the 
second-largest producer of coffee in the world behind Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a decision to devalue the Colombian peso could  
produce a ripple effect in other Central American economies, 
prompting other devaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian talks come at a time when U.S. markets are being  
flooded with cheap coffee as a result of large harvests in Brazil 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies in U.S. exchange-approved warehouses jumped again  
Wednesday, rising by 3,750 bags weighing 132 pounds each to 254,177 
bags. Another 40,000 bags were waiting to be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Further pressuring prices Thursday were unconfirmed reports that  
Ethiopia had lowered prices on all grades of its coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for May delivery fell $4.90 to $97.70 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil and refined crude products fell for a second day in  
futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid increasing 
skepticism about whether world oil producers will honor commitments 
to reduce output. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude retreated below $16 a barrel, giving back more of the  
gains that came after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and other oil producers agreed to cut 2.1 million barrels 
daily from world production beginning a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it may take months to determine whether producers  
are complying, and many market participants are noting that the 
producers never fully met a round of cuts agreed to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, several key refineries on the West Coast were coming  
back to full service, easing fears about spot gasoline shortages 
across the country before the heavy summer driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for May delivery of light, sweet crude fell 20 cents  
to $15.83 a barrel; May unleaded gasoline fell 0.99 cent to 49.52 
cents a gallon; May heating oil fell 0.43 cent to 40.84 cents a 
gallon; May natural gas rose 3.6 cents to $2.060 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures plunged to their lowest in five years on the New  
York Board of Trade amid reports of active selling out of Ghana, as 
world producers rush to unload plentiful crops before prices fall 
even farther. 
</P>
<P>
	With months to come before chocolate makers begin gearing up for  
a new candy season, analysts say the outlook for higher prices 
</P>
<P>
	May cocoa fell $55, or 4.8 percent, to $1,079 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Critics Fault Anti-Smoking Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Critics are calling on Philip Morris Cos. to  
dump its anti-smoking commercials and to give the money to an 
independent group that can run harder-edged ads aimed at 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philip Morris, the world's biggest tobacco company and the  
maker of the best-selling Marlboro cigarette brand, said Wednesday 
it would continue running its own ads which carry the theme 
``Think. Don't Smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Merlo, a spokesman for Philip Morris' domestic tobacco  
arm, said the company feels the ``peer pressure message is one that 
is valid in reaching this group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think there is any one single approach and we believe  
the approach that we have taken to the issue is a valid and 
worthwhile way of communicating this issue,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics, representing public health officials from 17 states  
and the American Cancer Society, said Wednesday the Philip Morris 
anti-smoking ads are not strong enough to convince youngsters most 
likely to start smoking to decide against doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics said the campaign is diluting the impact of  
stronger commercials such as one from California that shows a 
smoker inhaling a cigarette through a hole in her throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Connolly, director of the Massachusetts Health  
Department's tobacco control program, said he worries the Philip 
Morris approach ``could persuade policy-makers not to run the 
hard-hitting stuff'' as decisions are being made on a $1.45 billion 
national anti-smoking campaign expected to begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris announced last December that it would spend more  
than $100 million a year on a campaign to discourage youngsters 
from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the first year's budget was earmarked for  
anti-smoking advertising. The ads showed groups of youngsters on 
the bus, at school and on a stairway outdoors talking about why 
they choose not to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to smoke to prove myself,'' a girl says in one  
ad. ``My coolness is not on trial here.'' A boy in another ad says 
``We don't have to smoke to be different. Being ourselves is 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a new study conducted on behalf of three states that have  
been running their own anti-smoking campaigns suggested youngsters 
found the Philip Morris ads less compelling than ads from the 
states which often depicted the consequences of smoking in stark 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ads shown to about 120 youngsters in 20 different  
groups was a California commercial that showed a woman smoking a 
cigarette through a hole in her throat and a Massachusetts ad that 
showed an actor who once played the Marlboro Man as he lay dying of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the study, Teenage Research Unlimited, said teens  
rated the two ads from Philip Morris and a third ad from the state 
of Arizona called ``I Decide'' among the lowest every time. It said 
some teens said the ads failed to give them any good reasons not to 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't say these ads (from Philip Morris) are terrible. We  
say they are not the kind of ads that are hard-hitting and are 
found to be effective with younger people,'' said Randy Schwartz, 
director of the division of community and family health for the 
state of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz is also a co-chairman of a group that includes Maine,  
Massachusetts and 15 other states in an effort to stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	On behalf of the group, Schwartz wrote the head of Philip Morris  
Cos., Geoffrey Bible, asking the company to discontinue the ads and 
turn over funding for the campaign to an independent entity that 
would air ads more like those that the states were sponsoring.

<HEADLINE> Pentair To Cut 700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Pentair Inc., which makes power tools  
and water treatment equipment, is cutting about 700 jobs, or about 
7 percent of its work force, in an effort to reduce costs and 
become more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose brands include Porter-Cable, Delta, Century  
and Fleck Controls, also disclosed Thursday it plans to close its 
Lincoln Automotive manufacturing plant in Jonesboro, Ark., as part 
of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Pentair shares rose nearly 3 percent on the New  
York Stock Exchange, climbing $1 to close at $35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began trimming costs last June, taking steps to save  
$60 million through company-wide purchasing and shared 
administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest restructuring plan, Pentair expects to report a  
$38 million pretax charge against earnings in the first quarter. 
The new cost-cutting is expected to result in pretax savings of $5 
million in 1999, another $26 million in 2000 and an additional $30 
million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``This strategic restructuring strengthens our ability to meet  
our growth objectives,'' said Winslow Buxton, chairman, president 
and chief executive. The company employs about 10,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentair expects to meet or exceed analysts' consensus estimates  
of 59 cents per share before the charge in the first quarter, 
Buxton said. The company also expects to achieve or exceed 
analysts' consensus estimates of $2.86 per share for the year and 
is confident it can continue growing at 15 percent or more annually 
through 2000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fox To Take Ad Slots From Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another sign of troubled financial times for  
television networks, Fox has informed its affiliates that it will 
take 20 prime-time commercial slots each week that the stations had 
been allowed to sell for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which the News Corp.'s Fox network has the power to do  
unilaterally, will cut from 90 to 70 the number of 30-second 
commercials affiliates can sell. 
</P>
<P>
	How much this will cost affiliates is tough to judge. The price  
advertisers pay for commercial time depends on the ratings for 
individual shows. The New York Times estimated the network would 
gain between $50 million and $100 million a year; Variety said it 
would be between $150 million and $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox wouldn't say, and declined comment Thursday on the planned  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 24 Fox affiliates, saw its  
stock price tumble by 23 percent, or by $3.31 1/4, to close at $11.06 1/4 
a share Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Baltimore-based 
broadcaster said it could lose up to $10 million as a result of the 
giveback. 
</P>
<P>
	While it still makes money, Fox's profit margins have been  
shrinking as a result of factors that are similarly affecting rival 
networks: Programming costs are increasing at the same time as the 
audience size is declining. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has been involved in contentious negotiations because of its  
attempt to get affiliates to kick in part of the cost of 
broadcasting NFL games. Both Fox and CBS worked out deals with its 
stations to allay part of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some broadcasters have wondered whether networks would try to  
change the long-running system where NBC, CBS and ABC pay 
affiliates an annual fee to carry their programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have determined that it is necessary to make an adjustment  
to the economic relationship between the network and Fox affiliates 
to take into account the ever-widening imbalance in profits between 
us,'' said a letter delivered to affiliates this week from Fox 
network president Lawrence Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is planning to offer its affiliates a chance to buy back the  
20 commercials at a rate cheaper than what advertisers would pay 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first glance this is surely not in our economic interest,''  
Dennis Fitzsimons, the president of Tribune Broadcasting, owner of 
six affiliates, told the Times. ``It's something we're going to 
have to evaluate and see what our options are. We are not 
particularly happy about it.''

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Franco Scores Moral Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- People who lead the Masters, even for only  
the briefest of moments, do not come from where Carlos Franco did. 
</P>
<P>
	They do not come from places like Paraguay, with all of three  
golf courses, nor grow up in poverty so humbling that what little 
food is there for a family of nine gets shared while sitting on the 
dirt floor of a one-room shack. They do not learn to play the game 
barefoot, with borrowed clubs. They do not salvage golf balls from 
a water hazard, with fish nipping at their hands and snails slicing 
the soles of their feet, just to have something to play the game 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who doesn't risk anything, doesn't win anything,'' Franco said  
Thursday, slipping between Spanish and delightfully fractured 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-three-year-old Carlos Franco didn't win anything  
Thursday, unless moral victories count for something. He left 
Augusta National's stately old clubhouse behind with the sun 
climbing in a late-morning sky, quickly piled up birdies at Nos. 3, 
4, 8 and 11, and looked up to find himself suddenly leading the 
first round of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was aware,'' Franco said through a rueful smile. ``And then  
I felt the pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time it happened was the very next hole, No. 12, where  
he made bogey. It happened next at No. 15, where Franco hit a 
5-iron flush, but watched it dive into the pond fronting the green. 
He wound up making double-bogey there, added another at No. 16 and 
signed for even par. When his adventure was over, Franco was still 
buzzing, but he didn't need a leaderboard to tell him he was no 
longer leading the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of confidence, I think I can create something  
special here,'' Franco said. ``But I need to know more about the 
golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only tip he got coming into Augusta was from Seve  
Ballesteros. ``He helped me a lot, telling me to hit everything 
into the middle of the green.'' Then Franco paused, and shrugged 
his slight shoulders. ``Is not easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, nothing else about his golf career has been, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlos grew up as one of seven kids of the late Francisco Javier  
Franco, the greenskeeper at Asuncion Golf Club in Paraguay. To say 
his brood had a gift for the game doesn't tell the half of it. 
Today, there are only 28 golf professionals in the whole country, 
and five of them are Carlos' siblings. Even more remarkable is how 
that came to be. 
</P>
<P>
	In Carlos Franco's case, he said recently in a wide-ranging  
interview with Golfweek magazine, it started at age 8 without shoes 
and with whatever golf clubs and balls he could scrounge around the 
club. He won a pair of used shoes in a caddie tournament at age 14, 
when he was already a scratch player. Even so, he didn't own a full 
set of irons until a friend gave him one at age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1994, Franco was good enough to play on the Japanese tour and  
by last year, good enough to have secured a living, five wins and 
the No. 40 spot on the World Golf Rankings. Last November, Franco 
went through the PGA Tour's qualifying school, in part because he 
prefers to make the 7-hour commute from his home in Asuncion to 
Miami, rather than the 26-hour trip to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	But like most other things in Franco's unlikely career, the  
episode had as many downs as ups. Fighting his putter on the back 
nine of the final day, he snapped it in two and played the last 
five holes putting with his driver. He still got his PGA Tour card 
-- by a single stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco's best result in five starts since was a tie for third at  
the Honda Classic last month. But just when his game seemed to be 
peaking, he missed successive cuts, the first at The Players 
Championship. Franco did not make any excuses, but that was the 
same week that the assassination of Paraguayan Vice President Luis 
Maria Argana rocked his homeland, followed by the resignation and 
exile of the president and a military strongman widely blamed for 
the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something on my mind,'' he said. ``But for my job, it  
gives me no concerns. My concerns are for the poor people back 
home. For them, it is hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His heart was lightened a little bit Tuesday, though. Franco was  
playing a practice round by himself, getting his first look at 
Augusta, when six-time Masters champion Jack Nicklaus rolled up in 
a golf cart alongside the 12th tee. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco's first memories of this place were of watching Nicklaus  
on television, and here was the legend himself, still recuperating 
from hip-replacement surgery, asking to borrow a 6-iron at the 
155-yard hole. Nicklaus surveyed the distance one more time, 
switched to a 5-iron and knocked it on the green. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the ball land, Franco began applauding. Considering how  
he got there, maybe it should have been the other way around. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Duke Assistant Succeeds Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- The job of revitalizing Missouri goes to a  
man exactly half Norm Stewart's age. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is hoping Duke assistant Quin Snyder, a boyish  
32-year-old hired to a five-year contract on Wednesday, will relate 
to players his predecessor might have driven away in the past. 
Unlike Stewart, who resigned under pressure six days earlier after 
32 seasons -- saying his style was not to be a social worker -- 
Snyder believes the coach-player relationship doesn't have to be 
adversarial. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the same thing to his players in an informal first chat  
a few minutes before a campus news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I'll treat them with respect and I know they'll  
treat me with respect,'' Snyder said. ``I hope I can be many things 
to them. Yes, I hope I'm their friend. Being their friend doesn't 
preclude you from disciplining them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players liked what they heard, and gave their new leader a  
standing ovation, along with the rest of the fans in attendance at 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman point guard Keyon Dooling, who clashed with Stewart  
last season and considered transferring, didn't attend Stewart's 
farewell news conference. He was all smiles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could feel the vibes,'' Dooling said. ``There were a  
number of good vibes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For another freshman, center Pat Schumacher, the generation gap  
had suddenly dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he knows some of our music,'' Schumacher said. ``That  
would be pretty cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is the youngest coach in the Big 12, and one of the  
youngest in the nation. But Missouri athletic director Mike Alden 
didn't mind that Snyder has no head-coaching experience, and the 
former Duke point guard -- only 10 years removed from his playing 
career -- believes his youth can be an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also proved himself as the top assistant and recruiting  
coordinator the last four years under Mike Krzyzewski at one of the 
nation's perennial powers. Duke lost in the NCAA championship game 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder heeded advice from Krzyzewski, whom he called his mentor,  
and sought a school ``worthy of my passion.'' He also had been 
considered by Vanderbilt, San Diego State and Notre Dame, but knew 
he'd made the right choice when he surveyed the adoring crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing this here today, I'm convinced it's my turn to show you  
I'm worthy of your passion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who underwent hip replacement surgery on Sunday,  
said during the Final Four he felt Snyder was ready to become a 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had incredible high expectations for him as a player,  
then a coach, and as a friend,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He has 
surpassed my expectations in every way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder doesn't exactly inherit a team on the skids. Missouri was  
20-9 last season and lost to New Mexico in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament. At least three starters return, and there could be 
four if Albert White, who led the team in scoring, rebounding and 
assists, changes his mind about skipping his senior season to try 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the previous three seasons signaled the end for Stewart, who  
was a combined 51-47 in that period. Another sign he'd lost touch 
because of his gruff demeanor: in the last five years, nine players 
have transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has been involved in more than half of Missouri's  
games in 41 years as a player, assistant coach and head coach, was 
not consulted about the hire and did not attend the news 
conference. Alden said Stewart was at his winter home in Palm 
Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Other finalists were John Calipari, recently fired by the New  
Jersey Nets, and Bill Self of Tulsa. Longtime Stewart assistant Kim 
Anderson also was interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no coincidence the hire came on the first day of the late  
signing period, which continues through May 15. Missouri is hoping 
to close the deal on three top recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he met Snyder for the first time on April 1, the day  
Stewart resigned, and that there was an immediate connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was the Duke point guard from 1986-89, a period that  
included three trips to the Final Four. He is third on the school's 
career assist list with 575. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was respectful of his predecessor, to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	``What an unbelievable job he did,'' Snyder said. ``I'm very  
fortunate to have an opportunity to be his successor, to hopefully 
build on that foundation that his sweat and hard work laid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Stewart's half-court offense is headed for  
the history pages along with the coach who rolled up 634 victories 
at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see us push the ball,'' Snyder said. ``I want to  
run. Can we run, guys?''

<HEADLINE> ABC To Start Soap Opera Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is launching a cable  
television network devoted to soap operas early next year that will 
air in prime-time four ABC dramas that were broadcast on the 
network earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The soap opera channel will air 24 hours a day but its focus  
will be the prime-time showings of ``General Hospital,'' ``All My 
Children,'' ``One Life to Live'' and ``Port Charles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The soap opera channel can be to its fans what ESPN is to  
sports fans,'' said Anne Sweeney, president of Disney/ABC Cable 
Networks, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the network television business hurting financially, this  
venture represents a way for Disney-owned ABC to wring more revenue 
from its programming. Some ABC affiliates have opposed the idea, 
however, fearing that a nighttime airing of soap operas would drive 
away some of their viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing of the soap opera channel in Chicago and Houston  
revealed that it actually drove more viewers to the daytime airings 
because more people got into the habit of watching soaps, Sweeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC said the new channel, which hasn't been named yet, is  
expected to feature movies and some original programming, although 
no specific plans were announced Thursday. One potentially fertile 
ground is rerunning classic shows; three of the current ABC dramas 
began in 1970 or before. 
</P>
<P>
	There's potentially a wide audience of current ``General  
Hospital'' fans who want to see the Luke and Laura episodes from 
the early 1980s, said Carolyn Hinsey, executive editor of Soap 
Opera Digest. The channel might also want to resurrect cancelled 
ABC soaps like ``Ryan's Hope'' or ``Edge of Night,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women aren't staying home as much as they used to,'' Hinsey  
said. ``They're not folding laundry and watching their 
grandmother's soap operas. If they're offered a chance to watch 
them at another part of the day, I think it can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney-owned ABC had an advantage in launching a soap opera  
channel because it owns the dramas that it airs. Many soaps on 
other networks are made by independent production companies. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility some of these companies would lease their  
programs to the new cable outlet, but they would risk offending the 
broadcast networks that carry the shows during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely a market for it,'' said Derek Baine, a  
cable television analyst for Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates. ``I would 
just question how much flak they're going to get from their 
affiliates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had been talking about compensating affiliates as part of  
complicated negotiations where the network is also asking stations 
to help kick in for the costs of ``Monday Night Football.'' But 
those talks recently broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	Two recent developments may have emboldened ABC to move ahead  
with the soap opera channel despite the lack of an agreement. NBC 
announced an agreement to allow the USA cable network to air a new 
show, ``Sex Crimes,'' shortly after it is shown on the network. And 
Fox said this week it would take back commercial time from its 
affiliates to drive more revenue to the network.

<HEADLINE> March Retail Sales Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the nation's biggest retailers surged  
well above expectations in March, with a healthy U.S. economy and 
record-breaking pace on Wall Street encouraging Americans to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants, who reported their sales figures on Thursday, also  
said that they benefited from an early Easter, which shifted much 
of the holiday buying -- from candy eggs to floral sundresses -- into 
March from April a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong results, which were the best since last April and  
followed surprisingly robust gains in February, raised speculation 
that first-quarter earnings will top analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans feel secure, they feel confident and their spending  
patterns show it,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and 
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 8.4 percent in March. It rose 4.5 percent in February and was up 
3.9 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have been rising steadily in recent months thanks  
to the resilient U.S. economy, now in the ninth year of an 
expansion. Consumer confidence is at near-record highs, while 
unemployment and inflation levels remain at their lowest levels in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the stock market has resumed its march into record  
territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average crossing the 
10,000 mark for the first time last month and other indexes 
reaching new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow rose 112.39 to 10,197.70, its third record  
close this week. The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 also climbed to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling of wealth out there right now due to the  
stock market being as high as it is,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs 
the retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. ``That's helped make 
the last few months fabulous for retailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the  
number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose by 
11,000 last week but remained below 300,000 for the 10th 
consecutive week. That's the longest such stretch since 1973 and a 
reflection of the nation's 4.2 percent unemployment rate, a 29-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount chains fared the best in March, outpacing all other  
retail formats. Shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Kmart and 
Target for their wide selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reporting big gains last month were specialty clothing  
chains, such as Gap and Limited. Sales at consumer electronics 
chains rose sharply, as did revenues at stores offering home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specialty retailers and discounters definitely found the  
golden eggs in March,'' said Tara Schuchmann, who runs the 
Dallas-based hedge fund Tara Capital Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The only weakness was spotted at moderately priced department  
stores such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Co., which have 
lost business to the lower-priced discounters. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts were impressed with the March figures, some won't  
judge the performance until April's results are in hand because 
Easter came a week earlier this year and helped March sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also warned that global financial turmoil could begin to  
threaten American prosperity at any time in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have a good quarter and probably a good six  
months ahead,'' Barnard said. ``But what's to come will largely 
depend on what happens overseas over the next six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 18.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.1 percent, total sales down 2.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.1 percent, total sales up 10.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.7  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 16.8 percent, 
total sales rose 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 12.9 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 9 percent, total sales up 8.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 0.3 percent, total  
sales up 4.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 18 percent, total sales rose 9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 21 percent, total sales up 43 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Share Prices Rally / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices rallied today, pushing the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index to its highest level in more than a year. The 
dollar drifted lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 292.19 points,  
or 1.77 percent, to close at 16,846.69 -- its fourth straight day of 
gains and the highest close since March 26, 1998, when it finished 
at 16,980.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.76 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.02 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 121.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares were buoyed ahead of the settlement of April  
stock option contracts on Friday, along with continued buying 
interest from foreign investors and some domestic institutions, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreigners are still coming in steadily and I think domestic  
institutions, on balance, are net buyers,'' said Chuck Lambert, 
market analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest gainers were shares of computer software  
wholesaler Softbank Corp. and its over-the-counter market 
affiliate, Yahoo Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank soared $16.60, or 12 percent, to close at $151.70.  
Yahoo Japan skyrocketed $83,333, or 32 percent, to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo Japan's gains came after parent company Yahoo! Inc.  
reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market fell in early trading on profit-taking, but  
quickly climbed back into positive territory with active buying of 
steel and information-technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading volume was heavy, with about 826 million shares changing  
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's turnover of 709 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered declines 882 to 351, with 95 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent, to 1,345.07 
points. The TOPIX had closed up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar stayed in a narrow range,  
jostled by profit-taking and position adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no big players today, although some Japanese life  
insurance companies started buying at the 121.20 yen level,'' said 
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.57 yen and 121.63 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.40 yen, up from  
130.20 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.600 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.685 
percent, pushing its price up to 101.74 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> Whitman Begins Senate Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Republican Gov. Christie Whitman today  
launched her bid for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat 
Frank Lautenberg with the formation of a fund-raising committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-term governor, long seen as a GOP party star, ended  
speculation about her political future by kicking off an effort to 
become New Jersey's first elected Republican U.S. senator since the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman was scheduled to announce her U.S. Senate intentions at  
an afternoon Statehouse news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent Republican fund-raisers Lewis Eisenberg and Candace  
Straight, two longtime supporters of the governor and other GOP 
moderates, announced today they will head the fund-raising effort 
for the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christie Whitman has been a great governor and will be an  
extraordinary U.S. senator,'' said Straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, 52, is New Jersey's first female governor. She would be  
the state's first female U.S. Senator if she won. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's second term as governor is scheduled to end in January  
2002. She is banned by the state Constitution from running for a 
third consecutive term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman ran for the U.S. Senate in 1990, her first statewide  
race. She nearly beat heavily financed Democratic incumbent Bill 
Bradley in a campaign that targeted Democratic Gov. Jim Florio's 
tax increases. Three years later, Whitman used that argument to 
defeat Florio. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman gained national prominence for her tax cuts, but then  
had to survive a surprisingly close race for re-election in 1997, 
when Democrat Jim McGreevey targeted the state's high auto 
insurance rates and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A Whitman run could set up a rematch with Florio, who has set up  
an exploratory committee for the Democratic nomination for Senate. 
A Quinnipiac College poll released last week gave Whitman a 
comfortable lead in a ``what if'' race against Florio. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg, 75, a three-term Democrat, announced in February  
that he would not seek re-election. Whitman then said she would 
consider running.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Has Successful Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Kerry Wood, last season's NL Rookie of the  
Year, underwent reconstructive elbow surgery Thursday, with Dr. 
James Andrews transplanting a ligament in what's known as ``Tommy 
John surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will miss the entire 1999 season. The 21-year-old  
right-hander went 13-6 for the Cubs last season and struck out 20 
batters against Houston last May, tying a major league record. 
</P>
<P>
	During the surgery, Wood's torn ulnar collateral ligament was  
repaired and wrapped with a graft from his right forearm, a 
procedure pioneered on John's left elbow by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood missed the final month last season because of a sore elbow  
before returning to start Game 3 of the NL playoffs against the 
Atlanta Braves. He tore the ligament after making just 26 pitches 
in his first spring training start last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is scheduled to be released from the hospital Friday and  
then will travel to Chicago after two weeks to begin 
range-of-motion exercises, the Cubs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood struck out 233 last season, had a 3.40 ERA and allowed  
hitters just a .196 average. He was the fourth overall pick in the 
1995 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the pitcher who has been compared to fellow Texans Roger  
Clemens and Nolan Ryan is faced with the reality that his 95-mph 
fastball may not return. Rehabilitation usually takes about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes back, Wood will have to change his delivery some  
more, taking stress off the reconstructed elbow. The Cubs had 
already worked with him during the spring to stop throwing across 
his body.

<HEADLINE> Badge Is Favored in Wood Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Aquilino knows the streets of New York well.  
If he ends up traveling to the Kentucky Derby, the trainer will 
need directions. 
</P>
<P>
	Aquilino, a retired fireman from Engine House 234 in Brooklyn,  
trains Badge, the early-morning 3-1 favorite for Saturday's 
$600,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A win, or at least a strong showing in the 1 1/8-mile Wood, would  
give the 62-year-old Aquilino his first shot at the Kentucky Derby 
May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business, getting a horse to the Derby is everybody's  
dream,'' Aquilino said Thursday. ``It just might be a 
once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badge has won four of his last five races, including a 7 1/2-length  
victory in the Gotham Stakes March 21. Although he's not yet in the 
class of such top Derby contenders as Bob Baffert's duo of General 
Challenge and Prime Timber, or Carl Nafzger's Vicar, the 3-year-old 
son of Air Forbes Won is a horse to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you saw the Gotham, you have to believe Badge won't have  
any problem getting two turns,'' Aquilino said. ``When we ran him 
the last time around two turns (Jan. 28), he ran third and seemed 
to flatten out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was discovered Badge had a lung infection, which was  
treated with antibiotics, and the colt won his next race, the Best 
Turn Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still wasn't himself that day,'' said Aquilino, who worked  
for trainers John Tammaro, Howie Tesher and Frank LaBochetta while 
he was a fireman. ``But in the Gotham, he was 100 percent and you 
saw what he was able to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badge, owned by Southbelle Stables and named for the Eric  
Clapton song ``Badge,'' will be ridden by Shaun Bridgmohan. The 
colt tops a mediocre field of 11 3-year-olds, all of whom will 
carry 123 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 74 previous runnings, the Wood winner has gone on to win the  
Kentucky Derby 11 times, the last being Pleasant Colony in 1981. 
The last Wood entrant to win the Derby was the Nick Zito-trained Go 
for Gin in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, who will saddle Wondertross in Saturday's Blue Grass  
Stakes at Keeneland, has two horses in Saturday's Wood -- 
second-choice Adonis (4-1) and the Rick Pitino-owned The Groom is 
Red (15-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is: Badge (3-1, Bridgmohan);  
Karly's Harley (8-1, Edgar Prado); Bugatti (15-1, Robbie Davis); 
Adonis (4-1, Jorge Chavez); Cliquot (9-2, Rene Douglas); The Groom 
is Red (15-1, Craig Perret); David (12-1, Aaron Gryder); Robin 
Goodfellow (20-1, Joe Bravo); Machine To Tower (20-1, Cornelio 
Velasquez); Best of Luck (12-1, Jean-Luc Samyn), and Swamp (6-1, 
Richard Migliore). 
</P>
<P>
	The Wood is one of three major Derby prep races Saturday. The  
others are the Blue Grass, with Wondertross the favorite over 
Florida Derby winner Vicar in an eight-horse field, and the 
Arkansas Derby, where Answer Lively is favored over Ecton Park in a 
seven-horse field.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Considers Stronger Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A reform movement early this century persuaded  
voters to toss out corrupt political bosses and hire professional 
city managers -- the ``weak-mayor'' form of government common across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, in a vote closely watched by other cities,  
Cincinnati residents will decide whether to give the mayor more 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, the City Council member with the most  
votes assumes the largely ceremonial role of mayor. Under the 
proposed amendment, the mayor would be elected directly and would 
have authority to veto council actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest cities follow the ``strong-mayor''  
approach, but the council-manager model -- also used in Phoenix, 
Dallas and San Diego -- is much more prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Cincinnati, Miami and Worcester, Mass., have proposed  
switching to the strong-mayor form of government. Oakland, Calif., 
recently made the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls calls the current system ``a  
lottery, very much like Russian roulette.'' There's no guarantee 
the top vote-getter will have the personality, background or party 
affiliation voters or the council want for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've observed is that with a lot of the mayors, it seems  
to be a little easier to be more innovative and get more 
accomplished if you have a strong mayor,'' said Katie Cullen of the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	But others suggest the change could generate unnecessary  
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this passes, the bickering will be like World War III,''  
said Tom Luken, a former council member, mayor and congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	The election of former California Gov. Jerry Brown as Oakland's  
first strong mayor shows the potential. Just several months after 
taking office, Brown had fired three city department heads, 
including the police chief.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Employment Down 5.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- New figures from Boeing Co. show a 5.4 percent  
drop in companywide employment so far this year, reducing the 
number of workers at the troubled aerospace giant from 231,260 down 
to 218,700 workers as of April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest declines came from the Boeing Commercial Airplane  
Group, which had 108,3000 workers April 1, down 7.9 percent from 
117,590 at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state employment for Seattle-based Boeing stands at  
90,400 people -- down 8.2 percent from the year-end total of 98,440. 
</P>
<P>
	Other state totals included 29,400 in California, 20,100 in  
Kansas, 20,000 in Missouri, 5,250 in Pennsylvania, 5,000 in 
Arizona, 4,300 in Texas and 34,250 elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Reporter Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- A judge sentenced a reporter to  
jail for refusing to answer a prosecutor's question about his 
confidential sources for a story on alleged Medicaid fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Craig, a statehouse reporter for the Akron Beacon Journal,  
refused on Wednesday to tell a grand jury when confidential sources 
gave him information for the article. The newspaper's attorney said 
revealing when Craig received the information would have narrowed 
the list of possible sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Pleas Judge John Solovan found Craig guilty of contempt  
of court but suspended the jail sentence pending an appeal. The 
length of the sentence was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig did not name any sources. Disclosing when he received the  
information would have breached the reporter-source confidentiality 
agreement protected by Ohio's shield law, said Beacon Journal 
attorney Ronald Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists can't be hampered by the potential threat that we  
will divulge our sources every time we're asked,'' said Jan Leach, 
the newspaper's editor. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top federal safety official is urging  
automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first  
in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat 
where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought  
in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is sending that message to automakers in a speech he was  
delivering today at the World Traffic Safety Symposium in New York 
City, an event being held in conjunction with the New York 
International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared text, Hall warned: ``We need look no further  
than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of 
not doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags inflating in low-speed crashes have been blamed for  
killing 131 people, including 73 children. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hall sent the speech to top auto executives along  
with a letter urging them ``to discuss with your peers the need to 
reverse the trend of motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause 
of death among young Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children  
between ages 5 and 15. This decade, more than 60,000 children, 
infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about  
70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of 
federal crash data from 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal  
safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to 
learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck 
injuries. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Safety Board also has recommended automakers:  
</P>
<P>
	--Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars  
and light trucks, including the rear center seat, where they are 
often missing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they  
can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests 
rather than rise up at their necks. Most autos have adjustable 
shoulder belts only in the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.  
</P>
<P>
	In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was  
recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that 
child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto 
crashes. More than 80 percent of child seats are installed 
incorrectly, studies show.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Fires Miller Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. is putting a veteran from its  
Kraft Foods division in charge of struggling Miller Brewing Co. and 
installed two top marketing executives from its industry-leading 
tobacco business to help. 
</P>
<P>
	John D. Bowlin, who has run Kraft Foods International since  
August 1996 and has 20 years experience at various Philip Morris 
food businesses, was named Wednesday as chief executive of Miller, 
the nation's second biggest brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaced John N. MacDonough, who was fired after more than  
six years leading Miller. MacDonough, 55, had joined 
Milwaukee-based Miller from rival Anheuser-Busch Cos. in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlin, 48, also gets the title of president, a post that had  
been vacant, while MacDonough's job as Miller chairman is being 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Bowlin's second tour of duty at Miller, where he was  
president and chief operating officer under MacDonough for about 17 
months in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Goldman, who follows Philip Morris for the investment  
firm Merrill Lynch, said Bowlin laid the groundwork for a 
turnaround in the Kraft Foods business and is highly regarded in 
the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes at Miller come after a year in which its profits  
edged up 1.3 percent to $451 million even as sales fell 2.3 percent 
to $4.1 billion and its share of the U.S. beer market dropped 0.7 
percentage points to 21.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Shepard, executive editor at Beer Marketer's Insights, said  
Miller's sales volume and market share has fallen for four years in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Philip Morris management hasn't been exactly happy with the  
evolution of Miller from a volume or profitability standpoint,'' 
said Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Miller has also suffered numerous advertising missteps  
even as Anheuser-Busch was scoring with its frog and lizard ads for 
Budweiser, the category leader, and with a succession of popular 
ads for Bud Light. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a month ago, Miller dumped a quirky and frequently maligned  
advertising campaign aimed at recruiting more young adult drinkers 
to its flagship Miller Lite brand. The campaign, which featured 
outrageous situations like a magician's assistant who wound up with 
a rat under her armpit, disappointed distributors who complained it 
didn't help them sell beer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign echoes Lite's ``Tastes Great, Less Filling''  
campaign that helped establish light beers as a significant part of 
the beer industry in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads use retired sports stars like baseball's Mitch  
Williams and Lee Smith and other celebrities debating whether the 
hops or the smoothness account for Lite's taste. 
</P>
<P>
	Under MacDonough's tenure, Miller acquired Molson USA and  
introduced brands like Red Dog and the ice beers Icehouse and 
Molson Ice. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also unsuccessfully tried to launch a new beer called  
Miller as the company's flagship brand. The beer is still available 
in select markets but fell short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also dismissed on Wednesday were Miller's top marketing officer  
John P. Rooney and sales chief Christopher R. Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris named two marketing executives from its domestic  
tobacco business to the top marketing and sales posts at Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Mikulay, 47, becomes senior vice president of marketing  
at Miller while James R. Mortenson was named Miller's vice 
president of sales and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller executives said Wednesday they viewed the selection of  
new executive talent being installed at Miller as a sign of Philip 
Morris' commitment to the brewer. Rumors have periodically 
circulated in recent years that Philip Morris would sell Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller recently acquired several regional beer brands, including  
Hamm's, when Pabst Brewing acquired Stroh Brewing Co., and it has 
contracts to make beer for Pabst under a deal that should keep its 
facilities busier than ever.

	NATO Continues Kosovo Air Assault  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Pressing on with its air campaign,  
NATO jets struck on Orthodox Good Friday against an oil storage 
depot east of Belgrade. Other attacks were reported near a Serbian 
television relay station near Jagodina and along an electric power 
relay system near Valjevo, 15 miles south of Belgrade. The attack 
appeared to make good on a NATO threat to go after Serbian 
television sites for allegedly spreading ``lies'' about the 
U.S.-led air assault.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly all the lawmakers who accompanied  
Defense Secretary William Cohen to Europe for consultations on NATO 
airstrikes and to visit U.S. troops say the United States should 
not rule out a possible ground offensive in Kosovo. Cohen, whose 
delegation returned late Thursday after visits with NATO officials 
in Belgium and with American troops in Italy and Germany, said he 
would take that message to President Clinton. He reiterated the 
administration's position that ground troops would not be necessary 
to win the conflict against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 
forces.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In rejecting U.S. demands that China renounce  
the use of force against Taiwan, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji found 
an improbable ally -- Abraham Lincoln. Zhu recalled that Lincoln had 
resorted to force almost 140 years ago against secessionist 
Southerners to maintain the unity of the United States. No issue 
has caused more strains in U.S.-China relations than Taiwan and, in 
his joint news conference with President Clinton on Thursday, Zhu 
said he feared that China would be in a ``perpetual state of 
separation from the motherland'' if China were to rule out the use 
of force against the anti-communist bastion.

	US Senator: Trial Benefits Cambodia

<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Cambodia's plan to try a former Khmer  
Rouge leader with help from foreign judges and prosecutors can 
strengthen the country's institutions while providing 
accountability for the group's genocidal rule, a U.S. senator said 
Thursday. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, described the 
plan as a ``win-win'' situation. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 
agreed during a meeting Tuesday night with Kerry to have foreign 
participation in Cambodia's trial of former guerrilla commander Ta 
Mok. Human rights groups, the United Nations, the United States and 
other countries have said Cambodia's judicial system has neither 
the competence nor the political independence to hold a credible 
trial that will fully and fairly investigate Khmer Rouge crimes.

impotence drug. Yao Shen, Victor Yin and Wei Zhang were brought to 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where lawyers arranged their 
release on bail after a brief appearance before a U.S. Magistrate 
Judge. ``We're seeing more and more cases that involve Viagra,''

<HEADLINE> Unabomber's Brother Meets Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- During the long drive home after the  
trial of the Unabomber, David Kaczynski stopped in Salt Lake City 
to have breakfast with a man his brother tried to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Wright, the victim of the bomber's 11th attack, still picks  
pieces of shrapnel out of his face a decade later. He agreed to 
meet Kaczynski for breakfast that morning, and on Thursday the two 
met again -- this time, to demonstrate the power of forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical stereotype ... states that the victim and the  
perpetrator's family have to hate each other,'' Wright said at an 
anti-violence conference. ``It's my belief that there's an 
incredible amount of compassion and understanding that can be 
provided through a friendship with a person from the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Kaczynski, an Albany, N.Y., social worker, who first  
tipped the FBI to the possibility that his brother, Theodore, might 
be the anti-technology terrorist known as the Unabomber. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 attacks between 1978 and 1995, the Unabomber killed three  
people, injured 29 others and permanently changed such routine 
activities as opening the mail and boarding a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents raided Theodore Kaczynski's remote Montana cabin in  
1996 and found a trove of damning evidence, including a bomb. He 
pleaded guilty in a Sacramento, Calif., federal court on Jan. 21, 
1998, and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski reached out to his brother's victims, expressing  
his family's grief at the suffering they had endured. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, Kaczynski said, he wrote letters to victims and their  
families. But he had only a telephone number for Wright, so he 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so afraid I would get this blast of anger, and instead I  
got this kindness and encouragement,'' Kaczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was wounded in 1987 by a bomb disguised as a piece of  
wood left outside a Salt Lake City computer store. The attack 
generated the infamous sketch of a mustachioed suspect in a hooded 
sweatshirt and aviator sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski said Wright was so supportive that he was almost  
afraid to call him again. He worried that Wright might not be in 
such a forgiving mood the next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to save this beautiful gift he had given me,''  
Kaczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Kaczynski drove his battered white pickup truck back  
across the country after the trial, he called Wright and suggested 
they meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked for a while and I just had the sense of being  
immediately comfortable,'' Kaczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he was raised in a family where ``if you apologize,  
that's it -- you have to accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That and the call itself led Wright to believe that Kaczynski  
possessed a quality he seeks in friends: honor. The impression was 
reinforced at their breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really felt I had a genuine person across from me, who was  
concerned with things outside of himself,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Kaczynski and Wright called for new bridges -- not  
merely reconciliation between victims and the families of 
perpetrators, but an understanding that violence makes victims of 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgiveness is a very complicated word,'' Wright said. ``I  
prefer to believe it means letting go -- not unconditionally 
accepting an act and not forgetting the event or the family member 
who is no longer with you, but allowing yourself to love 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference at Naugatuck Valley Community-Technical College  
is organized annually in the memory of Melanie Rieger, a teen-ager 
killed by her former boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing the families of victims and victimizers together is not  
easy, Kaczynski said, but it can lead to wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best case, it's wisdom that has gone beyond knowledge  
and become hope,'' he said. ``There is a noble and generous quality 
in the human spirit that tells us that violence and cruelty don't 
have to win out in the end.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Has Successful Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Kerry Wood, last season's NL Rookie of the  
Year, underwent reconstructive elbow surgery Thursday, with Dr. 
James Andrews transplanting a ligament in what's known as ``Tommy 
John surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will miss the entire 1999 season. The 21-year-old  
right-hander went 13-6 for the Cubs last season and struck out 20 
batters against Houston last May, tying a major league record. 
</P>
<P>
	During the surgery, Wood's torn ulnar collateral ligament was  
repaired and wrapped with a graft from his right forearm, a 
procedure pioneered on John's left elbow by Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood missed the final month last season because of a sore elbow  
before returning to start Game 3 of the NL playoffs against the 
Atlanta Braves. He tore the ligament after making just 26 pitches 
in his first spring training start last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is scheduled to be released from the hospital Friday and  
then will travel to Chicago after two weeks to begin 
range-of-motion exercises, the Cubs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood struck out 233 last season, had a 3.40 ERA and allowed  
hitters just a .196 average. He was the fourth overall pick in the 
1995 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the pitcher who has been compared to fellow Texans Roger  
Clemens and Nolan Ryan is faced with the reality that his 95-mph 
fastball may not return. Rehabilitation usually takes about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes back, Wood will have to change his delivery some  
more, taking stress off the reconstructed elbow. The Cubs had 
already worked with him during the spring to stop throwing across 
his body.

<HEADLINE> Power Plant Blast Kills 1, Hurts 45 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A thunderous explosion rocked a power plant  
Thursday morning, killing one worker and injuring 45 people, four 
critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast tore a huge section from a building holding the six  
coal-fired generators at the Tampa Electric Co. plant on the edge 
of Tampa Bay, two miles from downtown. The explosion was heard at 
least 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to meet my maker or go to hell, and it  
made me want to get right with God,'' said Robert Worley, a worker 
who escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak of hydrogen gas was suspected as the cause of the blast,  
which happened as contractors tested a generator following routine 
maintenance, sheriff's deputies said. Hydrogen is used as a coolant 
for the generators. 
</P>
<P>
	TECO spokesman Steve Jenkins said the blast damaged just one of  
the generators. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bass, 52, who worked for a contractor hired to give the  
unit its spring tune-up, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 45 injured, at least 35 were taken to hospitals, said  
TECO spokesman Steve Jenkins. Four victims were critically burned. 
Many of the others suffered cuts and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, with a work force of about 250, was shut down after  
the blast. Jenkins said TECO would have to assess the damage before 
deciding when to fire up the plant again. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical service to customers was not interrupted.  
</P>
<P>
	TECO supplies power for 500,000 customers. The plant accounts  
for about one-third of the utility's generating capacity.

<HEADLINE> 3-Year-Old Hangs Onto Back of Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA PUEBLO, N.M. (AP) -- A 3-year-old girl who wanted to  
go for a ride clung to the rear of her father's truck for nearly 12 
miles as the vehicle reached speeds of up to 85 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Tafoya wasn't hurt in March 30 incident.  
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Lincoln Tafoya, said Monday he was taking his four  
other children to Pojoaque Elementary School and didn't know 
Chelsea had jumped onto the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we drove 10 to 12 miles before we were stopped,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tafoya credited a passing motorist, Connie Romero, with saving  
Chelsea's life after she flagged down his Ford Expedition about 20 
miles north of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very, very grateful to the lady who stopped us,'' he  
said. ``It's a miracle. God must have been watching over her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero was on her way to work when she spied Chelsea hanging  
onto the latch handle and windshield wiper, with her feet planted 
on a ridge above the license plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying, `Please, God, don't let this kid fall,''' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She honked and flashed her car's lights, but the truck didn't  
stop. Romero called state police on a cell phone and sped past 
Tafoya's vehicle on Route 502 until he finally stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shock when I saw my daughter come around,'' Tafoya  
said. ``She was scared to death and cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Chelsea told him she'd wanted to go for a ride and ``was  
having fun until we hit the main road.''

	The Baltimore-based broadcaster said it could lose up to $10  
million as a result of having to give up commercial spots to News 
Corp.'s Fox Network or having to buy back commercial spots from 
Fox. Sinclair owns 24 Fox affiliates, and said it and other Fox 
affiliates have been asked to give back 20 prime-time commercial 
spots a week to Fox.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Running Back Quits Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Charles Tharp, who led Hawaii in rushing the  
past two seasons, has quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach June Jones said Tharp told him Tuesday that he wanted to  
be released from his scholarship and transfer from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Wednesday that he wasn't sure why the running back  
wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that's his call,'' Jones said. ``My feeling is, if  
somebody doesn't want to be here, I don't want him here, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Tharp was suspended from the team for 30 days last month for  
violating an undisclosed athletic department rule. The suspension 
was extended by Jones to cover the team's ongoing spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Tharp had been invited to rejoin the team after the  
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp rushed for 796 yards in 1997, when he was chosen the  
Western Athletic Conference's Pacific Division freshman of the 
year, and 679 yards last season.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life for Texas Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- A 23-year-old man accused of masterminding  
the murder-for-hire of a father for his gun collection was 
convicted of capital murder on Thursday and sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	After about two hours of jury deliberation, Billy Don Wilson was  
convicted in last year's slaying of 46-year-old Mark Lund. 
</P>
<P>
	The life sentence was automatic because prosecutors did not seek  
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the victim's son, 16-year-old Brandon Lund, sought  
to have his father killed. Wilson's group of rough loners was 
willing to commit the murder for the elder Lund's military gun 
collection valued at over $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Lund changed his mind and tried to call off the hit, but  
Wilson and his gang refused. Dressed in black, they cut the phone 
line and crept through a window. After ransacking the house, Wilson 
pushed Lund onto a bed, shoved a pillow in his face and shot him in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Wilson's gang scratched a cross on Brandon Lund's face  
with her fingernail and slashed him across the throat with a knife, 
according to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mike Fouts argued that co-defendant Daniel  
Mullins was just as likely a triggerman as Wilson. Prosecutors said 
the evidence pointed to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials are pending for four other members of the group. One  
suspect testified against Wilson and said in court that he expects 
to plead guilty to burglary later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Lund, now 17, was charged with solicitation of capital  
murder. He was convicted in October and sentenced to two years in a 
juvenile prison.

<HEADLINE> Miller Eyes Cardinals, Changes Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Outside linebacker Jamir Miller changed  
agents. He's hoping he won't have to change teams as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that the Cardinals are interested in him,'' agent  
Leigh Steinberg said Thursday. ``It's the only team he's been with, 
so I would think that would be our starting point, and only if it 
was impossible to work something out would we take a look at other 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller fired agent Steve Baker and hired Steinberg on Wednesday.  
He did not return a telephone call to his home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Arizona's first-round draft pick in 1994, made $710,000  
last season while leading the Cardinals with a career-high 150 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the NFL's top young linebackers, the 25-year-old  
former UCLA star went into free agency anticipating that someone 
would offer him close to the $6.5 million-a-year salary of 
Baltimore's Ray Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, teams like Tennessee, Chicago and New England only  
nibbled at the bait. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals offered Miller a $6 million, two-year contract,  
then took back the offer and gave free agent Rob Fredrickson a $7.9 
million, four-year deal that left Miller's future with the team in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
	Fredrickson, who is 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds to Miller's 6-5 and  
260, was a first-round draft pick in 1994 and led the Detroit Lions 
in tackles (116) last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would describe him as confused and frustrated, because he  
felt the process was going to be a rapid one in free agency,'' 
Steinberg said. ``And to sit right there prior to the draft without 
a team was not his goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who also represents quarterback Jake Plummer and has  
a good relationship with Arizona's front office, doesn't expect the 
negotiations to pick up steam until after the April 17-18 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have the Nos. 8 and 21 picks in the first round,  
and might have a shot at Chris Claiborne of Southern California or 
Andy Katzenmoyer of Ohio State, but they also need help at 
offensive left tackle, fullback and wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing Plummer to a four-year contract extension that  
will pay him $13.25 million in bonus and salary this year, hiring 
Fredrickson, and anticipating a $5 million rookie pool after the 
draft, the Cardinals have little room left. 
</P>
<P>
	They could offer Miller either $1.5 million this season or $4  
million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to craft the best short-term solution here and maybe  
wait on the massive, long-term contract,'' Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ferguson, Arizona's vice president of player personnel, said  
the Cardinals expected to lose Miller when they decided to make 
wide receiver Rob Moore the designated franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never shut the door on Jamir,'' Ferguson said. ``That's  
No. 1. But certain things have changed. But when you put a player 
out in free agency to start with, like we did, we never really 
thought we'd have an opportunity, even, to maybe bring him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the door is there. It's open to a degree, but there's got  
to be a meeting of the minds.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc.'s first-quarter earnings easily  
surpassed analysts' expectations, helped by a surge of Web visitors 
and new deals with online businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! earned $16 million, or 7 cents a share, in the three  
months ended March 31. That was up from a profit of $3.3 million, 
or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time 
charges, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company would have earned 
$25.1 million, or 11 cents a share, in the recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings of 8  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues nearly tripled to $86.1 million from $30.6  
million as the number of visitors to its Web sites grew 5.4 percent 
in February alone. Yahoo! struck numerous new deals with online 
businesses, including retailers who paid for links on Yahoo!'s Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were announced after the market closed Wednesday.  
Shares of Yahoo! were off $2.43 3/4 a share at $206 in morning trading 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, one of the few Internet companies that actually makes  
money, said it is well positioned for further growth with its 
recent purchase of broadcast.com, the top provider of TV and radio 
programming on the Web, and its purchase of GeoCities, which hosts 
Web pages created by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect both of these acquisitions, which are not reflected  
in our first quarter results, to add substantially to the breadth 
of services we offer our global users, and advertising, merchant 
and business partners,'' said Yahoo! chief executive Tim Koogle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Balderston, an industry analyst with Redwood City-based Zona  
Research, said that big Internet companies like Yahoo! -- which has 
a market value of nearly $42 billion -- will have to begin 
generating bigger revenue if they are to maintain an investor 
enthusiasm that's pushed the Dow over 10,000 and made such 
businesses worth much more than they are actually producing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now Yahoo! and a lot of the Internet stocks still enjoy  
valuation based on infinite possibilities,'' Balderston said. ``At 
some point those are going to have to become probabilities and 
plausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the second most popular Internet destination, has sites  
with a range of features from chat rooms to news and search 
services. It announced a deal Monday to deliver its content and 
services to hand-held computers and devices for viewing the Web on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with Online Anywhere, Yahoo! will provide e-mail,  
personal calendars, weather and stock quotes. Online Anywhere's 
technology automatically formats the information to fit whatever 
device the subscriber is using, be it a large-screen television or 
a pocket-size, hand-held computer.

<HEADLINE> 4 Cops Arrested in Conn. Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Prosecutors have charged two Hartford  
police officers with coercing sexual favors from prostitutes under 
threat of arrest, and another officer and a former colleague 
pleaded guilty to related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``These officers betrayed their trust, but more importantly they  
betrayed the other officers in the department,'' Michael Wolf, 
acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Connecticut office, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, a federal grand jury has been investigating  
alleged corruption in the department, including the prostitutes' 
allegations and the possibility that officers were involved in two 
unrelated, unsolved slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrol officers Michael Basile, 41, and Jesus Rivera, 30, were  
charged with violating the civil rights of Hartford-area 
prostitutes. Both pleaded innocent Wednesday and were released on 
$100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Salvatore Abateillo III, 35, pleaded guilty to aiding  
and abetting Rivera. He said he was present during alleged sexual 
acts but did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Officer Jose L. Pizarro, 35, pleaded guilty to providing  
Rivera with a camera used to take nude pictures of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the alleged crimes happened while the officers were in  
uniform and on duty, prosecutors said. Abateillo, Basile and Rivera 
were suspended without pay, police Chief Joseph F. Croughwell Jr. 
said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Modestly Higher; Dow Up 1.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today, with  
investors trading cautiously while they awaited first-quarter 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
1.95 at 10087.26 after rising more than 48 points in earlier 
trading. The Dow closed at a new high of 10,085.31 Wednesday, but 
the overall market was mixed, reflecting a general mood of caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, broader stock indicators were up slightly. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index shook off early losses and 
was up 1.27 at 2,545.70. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was uneasy about earnings reports, which have started  
to trickle in, and traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments 
until they have a better idea about how companies fared in the 
just-ended quarter. Companies will begin reporting in earnest next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component IBM was down 1 7/8 at 184 5/8. General Electric, which  
reported earnings in line with analysts' expectations, fell 15/16 
to 113 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dell Computer were down 7/8 at 45 9/16 on the Nasdaq, as  
investors await the outcome of the company's analysts' meeting 
Thursday. Shares of Intel were down 1/2 to 131 5/8, part of a decline in 
microchip stocks in the wake of a disappointing earnings outlook 
from Advanced Micro Devices, which fell 1 to 15 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs were among the biggest losers today.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Humana Inc. fell 5 1/2 to 10 11/16 after the Louisville,  
Ky.-based HMO said its first-quarter earnings will fall more than a 
dime short of Wall Street expectations. The company blamed rising 
medical costs. Other HMOs fell in response to Humana's 
announcement, including Pacificare, which fell 4 1/2 63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was skittish despite more good news about the  
economy. The nation's biggest retailers, including Wal-Mart, Sears 
and Kmart, reported today their March sales jumped to 
better-than-expected levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported the number of Americans claiming  
unemployment benefits rose last week but remained at less than 
300,000 for the 10th consecutive week, the longest such stretch in 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.39 at 1,328.28.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were about even with advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 368.54 million shares, down 
slightly from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.54 at 617.77 and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.52 at 716.78.

<HEADLINE> Rough, Threesomes Slow Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The Masters went to threesomes for the first  
time since 1962. Afternoon play was as slow as a Saturday at a 
municipal course. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara's group played the first three  
holes in exactly one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Then O'Meara, amateur champion Hank Kuehne and Lee Westwood had  
to wait another 10 minutes before they hit their tee shots on the 
205-yard, par-3 No. 4. O'Meara hooked his ball into trouble and 
took a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a 90-minute weather delay made things even worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``Threesomes made play more difficult and longer,'' O'Meara  
said. ``A 6 1/2-hour round kind of takes it out of you. It wasn't a 
very good pace of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshly grown rough also contributed to the slowdown as players  
tried to figure whether a shot would fly without spin to the green. 
Augusta National traditionally has had little or no rough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you missed the green it was a guessing game,'' said  
Scott McCarron, who shot a 3-under-par 69. ``I know of one bogey I 
had because I hit a flier over the green. The rough is difficult to 
judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLUFF IS BACK:* Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan caddied for Tiger Woods in  
1997 when they teamed to win the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowan was without a bag after they split but he landed a new  
money-maker when Jim Furyk, the man with the helicopter swing, 
hired him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try it out and see how it works,'' Furyk said.  
``My intention and Mike's intention is that Mike is working for me 
full time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk said Cowan is one of the best professional caddies on the  
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate when I needed a caddie that he was available  
and wanted to work for me,'' Furyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk was in the last group to tee off on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARNIE TAKES A BEATING:* Arnold Palmer set a Masters record by  
playing in his 45th consecutive tournament, breaking a tie with Sam 
Snead. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the good part for the 69-year-old Palmer, who hasn't  
made a cut since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a four-times Masters champion, made double bogey on the  
first and second holes on his way to a 7-over-par 43 on the front 
nine. He finished with an 11-over-par 83. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AUGUSTA'S PAR-5s PLAY TOUGH:* The best way to go low at Augusta  
National is to destroy the four par-5s. However, changes to the 
course have spoiled that cakewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love shot a 3-under-par 69 without a birdie on a par-5.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have turned No. 15 into a scary hole,'' Love said. ``You  
can't hit it on the green with your second shot (because it's so 
fast) and you can't hit it on the green with your third shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masters officials had the mounds cut down in the right fairway  
which used to produce more distance. They also planted pine trees 
on the right to keep players from bailing out. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott McCarron said No. 15 ``is a big change. I used to hit it  
up on the hill and it kicked back to the fairway. Today I hit a 
3-iron in there and that's a club or two different.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FALDO FOLDO:* It was difficult to believe Nick Faldo had won  
two Masters titles in the 1990s the way he played on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo won in 1990 and 1996 but his game has been on a slow  
slide. He missed the cut in two tournaments this year, was 
diqualified in another, and finished 55th last week in the 
BellSouth Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Disaster was his playing companion on Thursday. He double  
bogeyed the 575-yard par-5 second hole on his way to a 4-over-par 
40. Coming home he got his first birdie on the par-3 No. 16, the 
only highlight for another 4-over-par 40 and an 8-over-par 80 
total. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Player, who is 63, beat Faldo by a shot.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SINGH ROLLER COASTER:* How can you shoot a 2-under 34 on the  
back nine at Augusta National and make only one par? Just read 
Vijay Singh's card.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Japan May Dissolve Kokumin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese financial regulators plan to dissolve a  
regional bank swamped with debt as part of a massive cleanup of the 
banking industry, news reports said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency has found that the Tokyo-based  
Kokumin Bank has a capital deficit of $412 million (50 billion 
yen), Kyodo News service reported, quoting agency sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A capital debt is the depletion of a bank's capital resources to  
the point where its liabilities eclipse its assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the bank can come up with funds from affiliated firms,  
the FSA and the Financial Reconstruction Commission, another bank 
regulator, will take action, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would involve either transferring the bank's operations to  
a public bridge bank or nationalizing it through a government 
purchase of its shares, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	FSA spokesman Noritaka Ono refused to comment on the report,  
while a statement released by Kokumin said the bank knew nothing of 
the government's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard anything yet from the Financial  
Revitalization Commission or the Financial Supervisory Agency,'' 
the bank's statement said. ``Given that we haven't been informed of 
the result of the inspection, currently the report isn't true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other media, including national broadcaster NHK, also reported  
that officials were moving to dissolve the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank examiners found that Kokumin, with 40 domestic branch  
offices and a total of $4.3 billion on deposit, had amassed a huge 
capital deficit by September 1998, a report in the Nihon Keizai 
business daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokumin Bank's huge prospective losses on its real estate loans  
have come to dominate its loan portfolio, leading the regulatory 
authorities to judge that it is insolvent, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is currently struggling to fight its worst recession since  
World War II, with many financial institutions trying to write off 
reams of bad loans left over from the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the FSA shifted the focus of its investigations  
from major banks to Japan's 64 regional banks and 60 second-tier 
regional banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokumin Bank will reportedly receive formal notification of the  
agency's findings next week.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Police in Brazil arrested a former  
legislator Thursday, hours after he was expelled from Congress 
under suspicion of ordering his predecessor's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Deputies voted 427-29 that Talvane Albuquerque  
was guilty of ``lack of decorum,'' after a wiretap revealed his 
connections with a hired killer from his home state of Alagoas, in 
Brazil's poor northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual expulsion late Wednesday makes Albuquerque  
ineligible to hold public office for eight years and strips him of 
immunity from criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Albuquerque in connection with the attempted  
murder of a radio reporter, then charged him with masterminding the 
shotgun slaying of Rep. Ceci Cunha, her husband and two in-laws in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque, who was first runner-up in last October's  
congressional elections, took office in her place. He has denied 
any involvement.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de  
Cuellar on Thursday criticized the United States and European 
nations for a lack of foresight in their airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to Peruvian radio station Radioprogramas from his home  
in Paris, Perez de Cuellar said the situation has deteriorated 
because the allied forces waited too long before acting and did not 
commit the ground forces needed to prevent Serb attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez de Cuellar, who led the United Nations from 1982 to 1991,  
also said that while the airstrikes are ``in one respect rigorously 
legal, they are a violation of the United Nations charter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the allies bypassed the U.N. Security Council because  
they knew Russia and China would have vetoed the airstrikes.

	SAN ANDRES LARRAINZAR, Mexico (AP) -- Hundreds of supporters of  
leftist Zapatista rebels stormed the town hall of this mountain 
village in southern Chiapas state Thursday and ran off the police 
who had seized the building a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest by masked rebel supporters, who shoved and shouted  
at police, signals the continued resistance to Chiapas Gov. Roberto 
Albores Guillen's plans to dissolve pro-rebel maverick town 
councils in the state, which the government says are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	San Andres Larrainzar, 460 miles southeast of Mexico City,  
served as the base for peace talks between the Zapatistas and the 
government before negotiations broke off in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel supporters seized the town hall about 11 months after the  
Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994, demanding 
greater democracy and Indian rights. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 Chiapas state police occupied the building Wednesday,  
claiming the rebel supporters had abandoned it.

They arrested the driver, who was headed north to Chihuahua, 235

</P>
<P>
	The same day, soldiers found 3 1/2 tons of marijuana in three

	``The fight must be based on cooperation, with respect to human  
rights and without interference in a nation's internal matters,'' 
German Health Minister Christal Nickels said.

developing a common plan to fight drug trafficking, money

<HEADLINE>  Top Female Jockey Krone Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months ago, while hanging on for her life in  
the starting gate at the Fair Grounds as a crazed horse tried to 
throw her, jockey Julie Krone came to this realization: ``I don't 
want to do this anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, thoroughbred racing's winningest female rider sat  
comfortably behind a small table in the press box at Aqueduct and 
said she's retiring April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a constellation of reasons for me to retire,'' said  
Krone, who won 3,541 races and more than $80 million in purses over 
an 18-year career. ``I'm on top, I'm 35 years old, I don't want to 
get hurt anymore, and I've got nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 4-foot-10 1/2, 100 pounds, Krone not only became the only female  
to win a Triple Crown race -- she won the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard 
Colonial Affair -- but was an inspiration for other females to excel 
in sports previously dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been an inspiration for not only me, but for every girl  
that came along,'' jockey Diane Nelson said. ``I can remember a 
change happening, when you had big outfits, and the nice horses, 
and people would take a chance on a girl. It wasn't an oddity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, said there are no  
definite plans for the future, adding she has ``many options.'' 
Among those are working in television -- ``I'd love to be able to 
work in TV during Derby week'' -- dabbling in art and photography 
and continuing her education toward a psychology degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, who rides this weekend in Florida and Maryland, will end  
her career the following Sunday at Lone Star Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her career was plagued by injuries, she appeared to be  
in top form after finishing third in the Fair Grounds jockey 
standings with 84 winners. She also surpassed the 3,500-win mark 
and won five races in a day on two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were too many aches and pains.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this Olympic runner I read about (who set three  
world records the summer she decided to quit),'' Krone said. ``I'd 
go to sleep at night, and my ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd 
think, `I just want to get this over with.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her impressive run of success in 1987, five years  
after winning her first riding title at Atlantic City. She became 
the first female to win riding titles at major tracks such as 
Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1989, she was 
the nation's third-leading rider with 368 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, she was a regular on the New York circuit and a year  
later won a career-best $9.1 million in purses. In '92 and '93, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1993, she became the third jockey to win five races  
in a day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte were the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 days later, Krone went down in a spill and severely  
fractured her right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws 
to reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time  
at Gulfstream. Krone broke both hands, but never regained her top 
form until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race, then added two more winners before the fracture 
was diagnosed a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later, and on Feb. 16 she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a student of the game and a student of horses,'' Hall  
of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens said. ``She was interested in the 
training part, too. She worked hard in the mornings and she worked 
hard in the afternoon. ... For her to win 3,500 is remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her accomplishments in 1993, Krone was selected one of  
Glamour Magazine's 10 Women of the Year and one of five ``Women of 
the Year,'' along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, by CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
	But what Krone takes with her are memories of inspiring young  
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``When some little girl comes up to me beaming and she goes, `I  
play soccer with the boys, and I'm the best scorer and you're my 
hero and I read about you,' those are the times I feel I made a 
difference,'' Krone said. ``If I made a little girl more brave than 
she might have been and perhaps put a spark under someone who was 
having a bad day, those can be the best moments.''

<HEADLINE> Round-the-World Balloon Lands in DC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The balloon that made aviation history by  
traveling nonstop around the globe was nearly lost to the wind when 
it landed in Egypt after its 20-day ride in the jet streams. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloonists Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard tore their billowy  
craft to keep it from dragging the gondola across the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bertrand and I were furiously trying to slash it with our  
knives, just to get the extra helium out,'' Jones said Wednesday 
after a ceremony to donate the torn and tattered balloon to the 
Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. ``We could 
have detached it and let it blow away in the wind, but we knew it 
was a piece of history and we really didn't want it to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in September, it will be on display at the museum  
alongside Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis airplane, Orville 
and Wilbur Wright's 1903 flyer and the Apollo 11 command module 
from man's first mission to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon, known as the Breitling Orbiter 3, will arrive at  
the museum after exhibits in Switzerland and London. The museum's 
``Milestones of Flight'' gallery is spacious, but it's not big 
enough to house the inflated balloon, which soars to 181 feet -- 
about as tall as the Tower of Pisa in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieces of the balloon, made of a thin, reflective synthetic  
material, will be displayed, but the main attraction will be the 
craft's high-tech gondola. About the size of two minivans, the 
gondola has a bunk, toilet, kitchen area, control panel, oxygen and 
nitrogen tanks, solar panels, satellite phones and a fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarters were tight, but the two balloonists say they did not  
exchange a cross word during their more than 26,500-mile journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have to overcome nature ... we had to harmonize with  
the wind,'' said Jones, a 52-year-old British pilot and balloon 
instructor. ``We just had to put our capsule into a position where 
Mother Nature could just take us in her arms. It was a wonderful 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their effort, Anheuser-Busch Cos. made good on its 1997  
pledge to give $1 million to the first balloon team to travel 
nonstop around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will share half the money. The rest will be used to  
support humanitarian projects around the world, said Marie Bodman, 
president of Breitling U.S.A. Inc., part of a Swiss company that 
makes watches and precision instruments and sponsored the balloon 
excursion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1984, eight ballooning teams, including five from America,  
have attempted the feat, said museum director Donald Engen. Jones 
and Piccard, 41, a Swiss doctor who specializes in psychiatry, were 
the first to succeed -- in 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They launched the balloon on March 1 in the Swiss Alps. When it  
landed March 21 in the desert, Piccard opened the gondola hatch, 
put his feet in the sand and thought about Neil Armstrong, the 
first man to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was so happy to be so far away, Piccard said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were so happy to put our footprint back on the Earth,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block Discussing Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. is negotiating to buy  
McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLP, an acquisition that would make Block the 
sixth largest accounting firm in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies confirmed Thursday's report in The Wall Street  
Journal, which said Kansas City-based Block hopes to announce a 
deal by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	While Block would not disclose any terms of the possible deal,  
the Journal said the price tag might be set at up to 25 percent 
above the value of McGladrey's annual revenues plus stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	McGladrey, based in Bloomington, Minn., had $296 million in  
revenues in its latest fiscal year, so the potential takeover could 
be valued at as much as $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be in line with recent industry trends in which  
publicly traded companies have been snapping up accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1997, Century Business Services of Cleveland,  
American Express and H&AMP;R Block have bought about 80 privately held 
accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	If Block acquires McGladrey, it would vault the company ahead of  
both Century and American Express, said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of 
Bowman's Accounting Report, an Atlanta-based publication. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Block has been pushing to transform itself from  
a traditional tax-preparation company into a one-stop financial 
advisory business. So far, Block has acquired two mortgage 
companies, a broker-dealer and five accounting firms.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Fear Message Not Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Republican activists complained  
Thursday that the party's appeals to voters are being drowned out -- 
first by impeachment and now by war. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathering for a three-day meeting of state GOP chairmen in this  
historic colonial village, party regulars sought ways to forge and 
communicate a winning message for the 2000 elections, when the 
White House and Congress are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it together for when it counts,'' said Mike  
McDaniel, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party and head of the 
GOP state chairmen's association. The group sponsored more than a 
dozen strategy sessions Thursday designed to improve the GOP's 
communications efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a number of Republicans predicted the work will do little  
good, at least for now, because few voters are paying attention to 
the GOP message. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of tax cuts, Social Security reform and better schools were  
lost in the debate over Clinton's fate in the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation and are playing second-fiddle to the conflict in 
Kosovo, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that the Clinton scandals and the Clinton  
crises have dominated the public's attention for a very long 
time,'' said Cliff May, Republican National Committee 
communications director. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this escalates and we end up getting ground troops, it  
drowns everything else out,'' said GOP strategist Ralph Reed, who 
served on a panel discussion about GOP message problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't out-shout the war,'' McDaniel said. ``Let it play  
out. When this thing is over, we can sing our message from the 
mountaintops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pollster Frank Luntz warned that the problem goes  
deeper than the Kosovo crisis. He said the Lewinsky controversy 
turned Americans off to news from Washington, making it harder for 
Republicans to spread their political message -- even after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some sort of economic calamity to change  
the atmosphere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Democrats also compete with headlines from Kosovo,  
Republicans say their job is tougher because the GOP has lost 
ground in the communications battle to Democrats since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've lost (the GOP message), but we did sort of  
misplace it for awhile,'' said Peggy Noonan, speechwriter for 
President Reagan. After seizing the House in 1994, the party ``got 
a little off our footing, a little demoralized,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Watson, chairman of the Maine GOP, stopped short of  
criticizing her own leadership, but said, ``The Democratic Party is 
fortunate to be full of good communicators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of unity, the party leaders signed a pledge to enforce  
Reagan's so-called 11th commandment: Thou shall not speak ill of 
another Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Party chairman Jim Nicholson said he will speak out against  
``personal attacks, bringing up information that is not in the 
public domain'' and lying about a rival's record. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted the hands-off drive is not intended to help or hurt  
any GOP candidate, though many party strategists view is as a 
benefit to early favorite George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is preparing for attacks from conservative  
publisher Steve Forbes, a failed 1996 candidate who dipped into his 
personal fortune three years to to air ads against eventual nominee 
Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Forbes' ads probably did not violate Reagan's doctrine because he 
was attacking Dole's legislative record. Dole, however, may have 
crossed the line when he called rival Pat Buchanan an extremist in 
1996, party officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson plans to meet privately with every GOP presidential  
candidate and urge them to comply with the Reagan doctrine. Having 
already talked with Buchanan, Nicholson will sit down during the 
chairmen's meeting with Forbes and potential candidate Tommy 
Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are attending the meeting, with little hope of picking up  
support. Bush is expected to win the backing of a majority of state 
chairmen.

<HEADLINE> Trucker Describes Slaying to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- The man who confessed to killing four  
women after walking into a sheriff's office and pulling out a 
woman's breast from his pocket has described a grisly killing to 
grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Ford, 36, was informed Wednesday that he had been indicted  
on one count of first-degree murder by grand jurors who heard the 
truck driver's tearful confession with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel heard details of a slaying in Humboldt County in  
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford allegedly picked up the woman as she walked near a shopping  
mall in Eureka. Her nude torso was found 12 days later in a slough. 
</P>
<P>
	The trucker did not know what killed the woman but tried to  
revive her, according to his interview with police. When he 
realized she was already dead, he allegedly decapitated her, 
severed her arms and breasts and cooked one breast in the oven, the 
Eureka Times-Standard reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford disposed of the body parts in various locations and burned  
the woman's clothing. He said he did not know her name or where she 
was from. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford told investigators he often picked up prostitutes and other  
women who hung around truck stops. He said it was not uncommon for 
women to stop breathing while they were having sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was arrested Nov. 3 after he walked into the Humboldt  
County Sheriff's Department and said he had hurt a lot of people. 
He pulled the breast from his coat pocket, saying the evidence was 
``the tip of the iceberg.''

	Serbs Say Refugees Return Willingly  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid fears that refugees are  
becoming human shields, Serb media claimed today that ethnic 
Albanians were voluntarily returning to Kosovo. Elsewhere, as night 
fell, several thousand people gathered on two major bridges in 
Belgrade and the remaining Danube River bridge in Serbia's 
second-largest city, Novi Sad, to serve as volunteer human shields 
against NATO attack. Earlier today, NATO warplanes and missiles 
took aim at the heart of Belgrade and against government troops in

But the hardline Serbian vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, told 
reporters that freeing the three was ``out of the question'' and 
that the soldiers should be tried as terrorists. NATO arranged for 
safe passage today of Kyprianou's flight to Belgrade, but the 
United States has ruled out any concessions to gain the soldiers'

achieve its hopes for the next century through the creation of a 
``strategic partnership'' with China. He highlighted such issues as 
nonproliferation, free trade and the mutual embrace of political 
freedom. With Zhu standing at his side, Clinton made only passing 
references in his formal remarks to the long list of issues that 
divide the two countries. China has been under fire from 
Republicans and others for alleged nuclear spying, campaign finance 
activities and for keeping its market closed to many U.S. products.

Washington's attitude toward Libya, although Moammar Gadhafi's

women ages 65 and older would be poor -- with income below $7,698 a 
year -- compared with 40.8 percent of men, the study found. But with 
Social Security, 14.7 percent of elderly women were poor, compared

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO forces took advantage of clear weather  
earlier today, intensifying bombing attacks on Serb troops, tanks, 
armored vehicles and artillery in Kosovo. But there is growing 
Pentagon concern that ethnic Albanian refugees could get in the 
way. Yesterday, Serb forces apparently shot down an unmanned U.S. 
Army reconnaissance aircraft over Kosovo in the second NATO 
aircraft loss since airstrikes began March 24. The first occurred

<HEADLINE> U.S., China: No Deal on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China failed to reach  
final agreement today on a market-opening deal that would have 
cleared the way for China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization. Both nations pledged to complete work by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, speaking after discussions with Premier Zhu  
Rongji, said both sides had made ``significant progress'' in 
clearing away the barriers to China's entry into the WTO but ``we 
are not there yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said both countries would pledge in a joint communique to  
resolve all the remaining issues in time for China to be included 
in the start of a new round of global trade talks in late November. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did announce agreement on one of America's major  
objectives in the meetings with Zhu, a separate deal in which China 
agreed to remove barriers to the sale of American beef, wheat and 
citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to achieve a full trade agreement today represented a  
disappointment for China, which has been trying for 13 years to win 
membership in the WTO or its predecessor organization, the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Zhu, appearing with Clinton at 
a joint news conference, said he believed trade negotiators from 
both sides had put a final agreement within reach. 
</P>
<P>
	China needs approval from the United States and other major  
trading powers for membership, but the administration has insisted 
it will not drop its objections until China agrees to a sweeping 
market-opening document. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sees high trade barriers as a chief reason  
for America's soaring trade deficit with China, which last year hit 
a record $57 billion, the largest for any nation except Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for a deal had grown in the past two weeks as China  
agreed to a number of U.S. demands. However, there were areas where 
China's market-opening offers did not meet U.S. demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was fearful that without the strongest deal  
possible it would be hard to get congressional approval, especially 
in the current climate of tense U.S.-Chinese relations. Members of 
Congress are upset over allegations of Chinese thefts of American 
nuclear secrets as well as a recent crackdown on dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today on agriculture, China agreed  
to lift its bans on shipments of wheat from the Pacific Northwest 
and citrus from Florida, Texas and California. 
</P>
<P>
	China had imposed long-standing bans on these products on the  
grounds of worries about plant diseases. U.S. producers, however, 
have long complained that the bans were not based on sound science 
but were hidden trade barriers. The Chinese also agreed to 
eliminate burdensome inspection requirements that had severely 
restricted the amount of U.S. beef that could be sold in China. 
</P>
<P>
	China also agreed to separate deals covering aviation and made  
moves earlier in the week to open up its vast telecommunications 
and insurance markets to U.S. companies as well as put a stop to 
widescale pirating of computer software by official Chinese 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	On aviation, China agreed to a deal that will double the  
frequency of flights between the United States and China. The 
agreement will add one new American airline and one Chinese airline 
to the three from each nation that currently have permission to fly 
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Reconvene Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia,  
Democrats are planning a renewed push for legislation dealing with 
health care, campaign finance and an increase in the minimum wage 
when Congress reconvenes next week after a two-week spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and several lawmakers are expected to travel  
to Philadelphia on Friday to sign an online petition calling on 
Republicans to pass a ``patients bill of rights'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic-aligned organizations, including the AFL-CIO and  
Families USA, have posted the petition on their Web sites. It 
includes a call for access to out-of-network medical specialists, 
as well as the right to sue HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have said they intend to bring health  
legislation to the floor this year, although they have no immediate 
plans to do so. The right to sue has been a sticking point in the 
past, with Clinton and the Democrats insisting on it and 
Republicans objecting. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is planning an extensive series of briefings on  
Yugoslavia for lawmakers next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Several congressional officials say they expect the top leaders  
of both parties in both houses to meet with Clinton at the White 
House Monday night for an update on the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia and efforts to deal with the flood of refugees from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A larger group of lawmakers is expected to be invited to meet  
with the president at the White House on Tuesday. In addition, 
administration officials are likely to be dispatched to the Capitol 
later in the week to brief rank-and-file lawmakers in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the air campaign has taken place since the House and  
Senate began their two-week break last month. Senior lawmakers have 
had briefings in the interim with national security adviser Sandy 
Berger and other top administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats intend to shine the spotlight on campaign finance  
reform next Wednesday, the first day lawmakers are free to sign a 
petition demanding the measure be brought to the House floor by the 
Republican majority. Sponsors of the bill -- designed to shrink the 
amount of money spent in political campaigns -- say they expect a 
substantial majority of rank-and-file Democrats to sign the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes signatures of a majority of all House lawmakers, or  
218, for the petition to succeed, a numerical impossibility unless 
some Republicans join the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's most prominent GOP advocate of a campaign finance  
overhaul, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, isn't expected to 
sign, at least for the time being. A spokesman, Eric Friedman, said 
Shays is ``still working with the (GOP) leadership about getting to 
the floor.'' Shays signed a similar petition last year, as did 
other Republicans, and Democrats say they expect they would again 
if it is necessary to force the legislation onto the House floor.	   Last year, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to bring 
the legislation to the floor only after the petition neared the 
218-signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides say there also have been discussions with the  
White House in recent weeks about staging a public ceremony with 
the president to dramatize the call for an increase in the minimum 
wage, now $5.15 an hour. GOP aides have held a series of meetings 
recently to try to prepare for what some Republicans believe will 
be an inevitable vote to increase the wage floor. Rep. Jack Quinn, 
R-N.Y., who has ties to organized labor, has proposed legislation 
that would increase the minimum wage at the same pace as inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal is for a 50-cent-an-hour increase this  
year, followed by a similar increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are hoping to reach a House-Senate agreement quickly  
on their budget for the next fiscal year. Both houses want to set 
aside the entire Social Security surplus, but must agree on the 
specifics. Clinton's budget, by contrast, would spend some of the 
Social Security surplus on domestic programs. GOP House leaders had 
been scheduled to trumpet their own budget during a two-day tour of 
the Midwest this week, but they scrapped the plan at the last 
minute, citing the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The emerging GOP budget also leaves room for a large tax cut  
over the next several years. Clinton's signature is not required on 
the budget, which establishes guidelines for later tax and spending 
bills. Passage of the budget would pave the way for work on 
individual spending bills, where the White House would have the 
customary leverage of a veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also hope to reach House-Senate agreements over the  
next few weeks on bills on education and a missile defense system 
that Clinton will sign.

<HEADLINE> Universal To Sell Propaganda Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Universal Studios plans to sell its interest  
in the commercial, music video and talent management businesses of 
Propaganda Films Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment entrepreneur Gary Beer, cable pioneer Jack Crosby  
and the investment fund SCP Private Equity Partners would buy 
Universal's share under the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This sale recognizes the value of Propaganda's nonfeature film  
assets, and is consistent with Universal's objective of focusing on 
its core movie business,'' said Rick Finkelstein, Universal's 
senior vice president for corporate development and strategic 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Propaganda Films is an independent Hollywood production company  
specializing in commercials, music videos, motion pictures and 
television programming. The company has offices in London, Chicago, 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's commercial division has produced television  
commercials for advertisers including Nike, Coca Cola and 
Microsoft. Its music video production are has worked with artists 
including Sting, Fiona Apple and the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer managed the Sundance Film Festival and was the chief  
executive officer and co-founder of the Sundance group of 
companies, including the Sundance Channel and the Sundance Cinema 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	SCP Private Equity Partners is a $265 million private equity  
fund based in Wayne, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Montreal-based Seagram Co., the parent company of  
Universal Studios, sold its art house labels October Films and 
Gramercy Pictures and the remains of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 
to media giant Barry Diller. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was yet another move to reduce the company's debt load  
since last year's $10.4 billion purchase of PolyGram's parent 
company PolyGram NV and to focus on its corporate movie business.

<HEADLINE> 2 Octuplets Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Two more of the surviving octuplets went home  
from the hospital Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chidi, the second born, and Chima, the fourth born, left Texas  
Children's Hospital in Houston. The baby girls joined three of 
their siblings and their parents, Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis Udobi, 
at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chidi weighed just over 6 pounds, 3 ounces when she left the  
hospital, and Chima weighed just over 6 pounds, 13 ounces. Both 
girls weighed under 2 pounds at birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Chukwu babies remaining at Texas Children's Hospital --  
Gorom and Ikem -- were in serious condition Thursday night. Hospital 
spokeswoman Tina Foster said Gorom, the youngest of the infants, 
and Ikem, the firstborn boy, both have had successful abdominal 
surgery and are closer to going home. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies were born in December, but the weakest, a girl named  
Odera, died a week after birth.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Williams Visits Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- One of the byproducts of the latest delay in  
finding an owner for the Washington Redskins is that general 
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner are finally assured 
they'll conduct next weekend's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	One player they'd love to have, Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams, visited Redskin Park on Thursday. Given that the top 
three picks could all be quarterbacks, the Texas running back could 
fall to the Redskins, who pick No. 5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in a position to trade up, and we will not trade  
up,'' Casserly said. ``However, there is a scenario that he could 
be there at No. 5, and it would very hard to pass up a player of 
Ricky Williams' potential at the fifth pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Casserly and Williams talked football, communications  
executive Daniel Snyder was across town working the phones to put 
together a group to buy the Redskins. His partners will include 
publishing executives Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, and he hopes 
to have a proposal ready as soon as the bidding is reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a junior partner in an $800 million bid that was  
withdrawn at a meeting of league owners in Atlanta on Thursday 
after it became obvious it would not get the votes necessary for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	New York real estate developer and New York Islanders part-owner  
Howard Milstein was unable to put together a financial plan that 
satisfied many owners, and others were concerned about Milstein's 
business style and whether he would become a maverick. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who had become disenchanted with Milstein because of the  
approval problems, plans to be the top man in his new group. First, 
however, the trustees of the estate of late owner Jack Kent Cooke, 
working with the NFL, must establish the rules for the next round 
of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees have the option of throwing open the bidding to  
anyone, limiting it to those who bid last time or taking the first 
bid that matches the $800 million Milstein-Snyder offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of the trustees did not return calls from The  
Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Milstein-Snyder group prevailed, Casserly and Turner  
might not have survived the change in ownership, negating the 
hundreds of hours of planning they've put into the April 17-18 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they at least have the comfort of knowing their plan will be  
put into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn to live with things in life,'' Casserly said of the  
uncertainty. ``You just have to adjust to what happens. You can't 
complain about it. I think it's important for everyone to stay 
focused on the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins probable first-round choice is Georgia cornerback  
Champ Bailey, but Williams becomes the automatic selection if he's 
still around. If he is, Bailey might be gone anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be a disappointment to Williams, who feels he should  
be the No. 1 overall pick. He recently dropped 20 pounds to satisfy 
concerns that he had put on too much weight, and says his 
appearance -- he showed up Friday sporting nose jewelry and 
dreadlocks -- gives his detractors more ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be being foolish,'' Williams said. ``But it seems like  
because I'm the way I am and I do things the way I want to do them 
and I'm not really a conformist, that people don't want to see me 
succeed sometimes.''

Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, a 6-4 guard from Bernardston, Mass., appeared in 32  
games, starting 21, averaging 11.6 points and two rebounds per 
game. Bean, a 6-foot-8 power forward from Fontana, Calif., played 
in 24 games last season, averaging 4.7 points and 2.4 rebounds per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Thursday, the school did not indicate  
whether the players immediately planned to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington led the Wolfpack in scoring in eight games, with a  
high of 26 in an 89-69 loss to Duke on Dec. 5. He was named to the 
Atlantic Coast Conference's all-freshman team and finished fifth in 
the league in 3-pointers per game (2.2). 
</P>
<P>
	Bean saw limited action this season, averaging 9 1/2 minutes per

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed for Cell Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Government advisers drew up proposed rules  
Thursday to control federal financing of research on ``master 
cells'' obtained from human embryos -- a promising area of science 
that has raised serious ethical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-member committee drafted a proposal that would permit the  
National Institutes of Health to pay for master cell studies only 
if researchers adhered to strict guidelines that would control how 
the cells were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells, called pluripotent stem cells, are the building  
blocks for nearly all of the tissues in the body. They are capable 
of growing virtually any human tissue. Researchers believe they can 
learn how to use the cells to make body parts or to correct some 
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cells only can be obtained from human embryos or from  
very early fetuses. A federal law bans government funding of embryo 
research and severely restricts fetal research. At least 75 members 
of Congress have said stem cells taken from human embryos are 
covered by the ban. Some religious organization also are opposed to 
the research. 
</P>
<P>
	Two privately funded researchers recently isolated pluripotent  
stem cells. NIH director Harold Varmus has proposed that these 
existing stem cell cultures are not covered by the ban because 
federal funds were not used to create them. 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus selected the committee of advisors to draw up rules to  
guide NIH should the agency decide to fund pluripotent stem cell 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed guidelines, federal grants would be forbidden  
to researchers who propose, as part of their research, to create or 
destroy a human embryo. Because removing stem cells kills an 
embryo, this would prohibit federal funding for creating new 
cultures of embryonic stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules also would forbid federal funding of research  
into the cloning of humans, or research that would create an embryo 
using stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, however, would permit federal support of research  
using existing stem cell cultures created by privately-funded 
scientists, such as the two stem cell lines created recently. 
</P>
<P>
	New embryonic stem cell cultures could be used in federal  
research, the rules state, only if privately-funded scientists 
obtained the cells from embryos that had been created for 
infertility treatment and were ``in excess of clinical need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Use of pluripotent stem cells from embryos created for research  
purposes also are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells from fetuses can be used, the rules say, if they are  
obtained ``after a spontaneous abortion or induced abortion or 
after a stillbirth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee of advisors also recommended a strict process of  
informed consent requiring that donors of fetal tissue or embryos 
be told about the potential use of the specimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed system, a stem cell research grant  
application would be considered first by an NIH science committee. 
If that group approves, then an oversight committee would determine 
if the proposal complies with the guidelines. Only then could the 
grant be considered for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Shirley M. Tilghman of Princeton University, co-chair of the  
advisory committee, said the proposed guidelines will put into 
final form and reconsidered by committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules then will be published in the Federal Register for 60  
days of public comment. Another advisory committee will evaluate 
the guidelines and make a recommendation to Varmus, who will make 
the final decision about funding of stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilghman said the proposed rules should be published ``in late  
spring.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Emphasize Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- To heck with tradition. The Tampa  
Devil Rays want to make sure games at Tropicana Field are lots of 
fun, too -- even if it means resorting to cheap theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	So, fans attending Friday night's home opener against the Boston  
Red Sox will be greeted by a midget, and more than 2,500 people 
will help the ceremonial pitch along a two-hour trek to home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	For celebrities, the Devil Rays have invited actor Bill Murray,  
Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Larry Doby and the renowned Florida 
A&AMP;M Marching 100 band. 
</P>
<P>
	Beanie Babies make their 1999 debut on Saturday, and you can  
catch home-run king Hank Aaron, too, if you stick around for the 
finale of the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of 3-foot-2 Dave Flood, who calls himself Dave the  
Dwarf, was the idea of Devil Rays marketing chief Mike Veeck, whose 
father shook up the American League by sending 3-foot-7 Eddie 
Gaedel to bat in a game for the St. Louis Browns 48 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Bill Veeck's midget, Flood's duties will be limited  
to off-the-field activities and promotions that include portraying 
the character Coco Lopez, Beach Bum, while interacting with fans in 
``The Beach'' seating section of the domed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-rostered position was assigned uniform No. 3.2 in  
keeping with Veeck's ``Off The Wall'' marketing campaign, designed 
to make games more fun as the Devil Rays try to improve on last 
year's 63-99 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the first pitch is thrown, (major-league baseball)  
becomes sacrosanct,'' Mike Veeck said. ``But the two hours before 
and the hour after that, it's not written in stone that it has to 
be by the book, if there is such a book ... Underneath this cheap 
theatrical goof is the heart of a traditionalist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doby, the first black to play in the American League when he was  
signed by Bill Veeck, will throw out the first pitch Friday night 
after receiving the ball from the 2,500-plus fans expected to pass 
it along a route through downtown St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who's celebrating the 25th anniversary of moving past  
Babe Ruth on the all-time home run list, will initiate a reading 
program for children and throw out the first pitch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Players also will find changes at Tropicana Field, most  
noticeably that the outfield walls in the power alleys of the 
hitter-friendly park have been moved back 10 1/2 feet to 370 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays also will unveil the Wade Boggs Count Board,  
which will keep track of the third baseman's pursuit of 3,000 
career hits. The Wade Boggs Seat, in the third row of a section in 
right field, marks the spot where Boggs hit the first home run in 
team history.

<HEADLINE> DC Transit Officials Warn of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mechanical breakdowns and malfunctions on  
Washington's subway system, which led commuters and tourists to 
mutiny during a rush-hour delay this week, threaten dependable 
service, transit officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail cars and other equipment on the 99-mile, 23-year-old system  
that extends into suburban Maryland and Virginia, are old, 
sometimes obsolete and plagued by deferred maintenance, said 
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials. 
</P>
<P>
	New cars are on the way and the authority's governing board is  
considering a request for millions more for repairs and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Repairs have been done piecemeal,'' said Lem Proctor, director  
of car maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem during Wednesday's evening rush hour focused  
attention on the system's mechanical troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Back-to-back breakdowns along a key tourist route prompted what  
officials described as a mutiny by passengers forced to get off two 
trains and wade into crowded platforms. Shouts and pushing followed 
at the station serving the Smithsonian Institution museums on the 
National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of tourists joined weary commuters in an effort to  
board the first available train. It took 25 minutes for transit 
police to clear the train when it reached the next station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they probably had a high level of frustration,'' said  
Richard White, the system's general manager. ``When we have a 
mechanical problem it does have a cascading effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transit officials said a malfunctioning door indicator led them  
to take the second train out of service, in accordance with a 
policy that safety indicators work properly when trains are in 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have asked the authority's governing board of  
appointed regional officials to spend $47.3 million over the next 
five years for repairs and new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could cut delays and offloading by 50 percent,'' said  
Charles Thomas, deputy general manager for operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300 of the 764 cars have traveled more than a million  
miles, and another 366 will reach that point by 2002. Delivery of 
110 new cars is expected over the next 26 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also targeted for replacement is an automatic car identification  
system, now outdated, used to track train movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is old and obsolete and the parts needed cannot be  
obtained anymore,'' Proctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 11, the Washington system has ordered train  
operators to run their trains on manual controls because of 
concerns about aging switching and signal relays. Transit officials 
said Thursday they did not know when the system might return to 
faster automatic operations.

<HEADLINE> 'Hawaii Five-O' Headed for Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Film 'em, Danno.  
</P>
<P>
	The TV series ``Hawaii Five-0'' will be made into a movie now  
that a rights dispute between CBS and the estate of the show's 
creator has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's producer, George Litto, and the widow of show  
creator Leonard Freeman prevailed in a 21-month arbitration battle 
with the network over film rights to the story about the island 
adventures of no-nonsense cop Steve McGarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major franchise,'' Litto said Wednesday. ``It's the  
kind of television show that became part of the fabric of society. 
McGarrett became the symbol, the epitome of the tough, honest, 
dedicated cop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Litto said he has a script and a large line of credit. He plans  
to approach studios and stars about getting a big-budget project 
off the ground. He hopes to be on location in Hawaii as early as 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said in a statement: ``We believe it would have been better  
for the project if we had prevailed in the arbitration, but 
obviously we did not. We wish Mr. Litto all the best with his 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series ran on CBS from 1968 to 1980.

<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of spreading the so-called  
``Melissa'' computer virus appeared in court for the first time 
Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or 
``Yes, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge advised David L. Smith, 30, of the charges against him  
and informed him of his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are charged with some serious offenses,'' Judge John A.  
Ricciardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and  
charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and  
shut down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless 
dancer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with interruption of public communications,  
conspiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for 
the offense is 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains free on $100,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not answer questions as he entered and left the  
courthouse. His lawyer, however, spoke with reporters and 
questioned whether the virus was as destructive as authorities 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this more akin to a graffiti artist or an international  
cyber terrorist?'' said Edward F. Borden Jr. ``Whoever authored the 
Melissa virus probably fits the former rather than the latter.''

<HEADLINE> WBC Proposes New Points System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The World Boxing Council proposed Thursday a  
new system to announce judges' points after the fourth and eighth 
rounds of title fights to avoid controversies like the one that 
marred a recent bout for the heavyweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have just mailed a letter to that effect today to the  
Washington, D.C., Athletic Commission for the next fight there and 
we are awaiting a reply,'' WBC executive secretary Eduardo Lamason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are in favor of that system, of announcing the  
points at the fourth and eighth round and the final score at the 
end, especially after what happened last time,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Boxing Association went even further Thursday with a  
proposal to apply ``open scoring'' -- announcing the points after 
each round -- in a fight on the same card, a scoring method not used 
in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But quite a number of people involved doubted it will work.  
</P>
<P>
	A fierce controversy erupted when the judges declared a draw in  
the March 13 unification title fight in New York's Madison Square 
Garden between Britain's Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield. The 
fans and almost everyone else were convinced that Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBC hopes that announcing points at the end of the fourth  
and eighth rounds will diminish the chances of controversy erupting 
over decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis held the WBC heavyweight crown, while Holyfield held the  
title for both the WBA based in Caracas, Venezuela, and the New 
Jersey-headquartered International Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury already was investigating whether the IBF sold  
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks, and it came 
under additional scrutiny from law enforcement agencies in New York 
after the Holyfield-Lewis bout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, WBC president Jose Sulaiman proposed the new  
system be implemented in time for the middleweight fight between 
Hassine Cherifi of France and American challenger Keith Holmes 
scheduled for April 24 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges' names would not be made public -- they would be  
designated as A, B, and C -- and only the local boxing commission 
and the WBC would know them, Sulaiman's proposal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBA's announcement said it will use open scoring when  
Sharmba Mitchell defends his super-lightweight world title against 
Reggie Green on the same card as the Cherifi-Holmes fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of open scoring is to let the public and the boxers  
know how the judges are scoring each round as the fight 
progresses,'' WBA vice president York Van Nixon said. ``It will 
allow parties to know how the fight is going and remove doubt at 
the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green's manager Barry Linde, among others, expressed his doubts.  
``I'm not against open scoring,'' Linde said. ``But this should be 
tested at a lower level, even the amateur level, to work the kinks 
out, not at a world championship fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green's camp has filed a protest with the WBA asking that the  
traditional scoring system be used. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBA had approved the idea during a meeting last week in  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the WBA's announcement reached Mexico City after working  
hours, WBC officials were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But several WBC officials flatly turned down just such an idea  
earlier this week. Talking to reporters Wednesday, Sulaiman said 
open scoring was tried in Mexico decades ago and ``proved to be 
very dangerous'' and in some cases caused riots among spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulaiman said the WBC pilot system is going to be proposed also  
to the nine continental boxing federations that make up the WBC, 
and then formally proposed as a general rule when the 500 WBC 
members meet in general assembly Sept. 20-26 in Moscow.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Defends China Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As he prepares for a meeting with Chinese  
Premier Zhu Rongji, President Clinton says U.S. ties with China 
have yielded security benefits for Americans on a range of foreign 
policy hotspots from northeast Asia to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu was talking with Clinton and other administration officials  
today on a number of contentious issues before a dinner Clinton 
will host in his honor tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from security issues, today's agenda included trade,  
Taiwan and human rights. Adding spice to the relationship were 
allegations of Chinese nuclear spying on the United States and 
newly published reports that the chief of China's military 
intelligence directed $300,000 to Clinton's re-election campaign in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration briefers declined comment on the two latter  
issues Wednesday on grounds that they were under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in a speech Wednesday that his policies of engaging  
-- as opposed to isolating -- China have yielded benefits for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of these links, the Clinton administration was able  
to negotiate a nuclear freeze with North Korea five years ago and 
it also persuaded China to stop selling weapons-related nuclear 
materials to Pakistan and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, known for his sense of humor, joked about the allegations  
that China stole nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos research lab 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in Los Angeles on Tuesday that China would celebrate the  
50th anniversary of communist rule this year by parading weaponry 
``developed by China itself, not by technology stolen from the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu arrived Wednesday night at Andrews Air Force Base in  
Maryland and had an unscheduled White House meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes said China has  
been the prime beneficiary of Clinton's efforts to cultivate closer 
ties with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's policies toward the United States are based on one  
perception -- that is the administration will continue its one-sided 
approach in favor of China,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit, the first by a Chinese premier in 15 years, comes at  
a time of great wariness between the two countries. China has been 
under fire from Republicans and others not only for the alleged spy 
and campaign finance activities but also for repressing dissent, 
refusing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and keeping 
its market closed to many U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding lengthy talks this  
week on proposals that would lead to a significant opening of 
Chinese markets. The discussions are part of China's bid to gain 
membership in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott expressed strong opposition  
Wednesday to U.S. efforts to facilitate China's entry into the WTO. 
China's membership in the Geneva-based WTO would do nothing to end 
China's ``predatory trade practices,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,  
urged Clinton to use Zhu's visit to step up pressure on China to 
respect human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Zhu is expected to voice his government's vigorous  
objections to the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also were expected to raise with the Chinese the  
issue of Americans missing from the Korean War. Pentagon documents 
show the administration has asked China to help account for several 
missing Americans, including two pilots apparently killed when 
their plane was shot down on a CIA covert mission in Manchuria in 
November 1952, and three other Americans believed to have been 
POWs. So far there has been little result.

<HEADLINE> Tammy Wynette Death in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing Tammy Wynette's  
doctor and husband of negligence in her death has ``no basis in 
fact,'' attorneys for the doctor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first comment from the camp of Dr. Wallis Marsh of  
Pittsburgh since the $50 million wrongful death lawsuit was filed 
Monday by three of Wynette's daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the facts become known ... it will be more than clear  
that Dr. Marsh, and the physicians from the University Medical 
Center who worked with him to develop Ms. Wynette's treatment plan, 
provided extraordinary medical care to a person who suffered 
extraordinary medical problems,'' read a statement from Marsh's 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The country star was found dead at home in April 1998 by her  
fifth husband, George Richey, also named in the suit. Marsh signed 
the death certificate and listed the cause of death as a blood clot 
in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three daughters have charged that Marsh didn't monitor Ms.  
Whynette's condition closely and overprescribed medication. They 
also said Richey didn't seek medical care for Ms. Wynette after 
being urged to do so by Marsh on the day of her death.

<HEADLINE> Hoiles Takes Orioles' Coaching Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Former Baltimore Orioles starting catcher Chris  
Hoiles, who was released three days before the season, has accepted 
the team's offer to become a roving catching instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles, who will be paid $3.75 million this year, will travel to  
the club's minor-league affiliates and work with young catchers on 
their mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go down and help some young kids fulfill their dreams,''  
he said during a pregame visit to the clubhouse. ``I'll go there 
and share the situations I know about, the experience I have -- and 
possibly help someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles admitted that watching the Orioles' first two games on TV  
from his home was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching all the activities that opening day brings was  
hard,'' he said. ``Being a part of it for nine years, that was the 
toughest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also found a silver lining while watching the Orioles  
fall behind Tampa Bay on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least I have an option now -- I can turn to `Saturday Night  
Live' or Letterman or something,'' said Hoiles. ``Before, I was 
drinking coffee at 11 o'clock. Now I'm ready to go to sleep.''

<HEADLINE> O'Meara Stays Focused at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Defending champion Mark O'Meara had that  
special feeling again Thursday standing over a birdie putt on the 
18th hole in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, O'Meara holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the last hole  
to win his first green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was an 8-footer that would give him a hard-earned  
2-under-par 70 to conclude a weather-delayed round that took 6 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't quite as nervous today as I was last year,'' O'Meara  
said. ``But I felt good over the putt like I did last year. It 
brought back memories knowing I could do it when I had to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good way to end what turned out to be a long, hard  
day. It was nice to get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara was only a shot behind those who finished their round.  
Four groups were still on the course when play was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans followed O'Meara although he was defending  
champion. He was ``third-fiddle'' behind David Duval and Tiger 
Woods when the first round began. 
</P>
<P>
	He had about 150 faithful followers while most fans trooped  
after Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, and Woods, ranked No. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara survived the day in his typical grinding style to prove  
once again it's foolish to overlook the man who won the Masters and 
British Open in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was a difficult day to stay focused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with my composure, the way I hung in there,''  
O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara's group didn't tee off until 1:12 p.m. and because  
officials decided to play threesomes the afternoon dragged along. 
</P>
<P>
	It took O'Meara's group of amateur Hank Kuehne and Lee Westwood  
one hour to play three holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then O'Meara hooked a tee shot on the par-3 No. 4 after the long  
delay and made bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just had to realize it was going to be one of those kind  
of days where you had to survive it,'' O'Meara said. ``I hit some 
good shots. I hit some bad shots. But I putted pretty well and that 
kept me going.''

<HEADLINE> Spacey Makes 'Iceman' Sparkle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Spacey is at home at Harry Hope's Bar,  
playing the would-be savior of the dead-beat denizens in ``The 
Iceman Cometh.'' As Hickey, he carries off the star role with an 
intensity perfectly shaded for each of his on-stage friends and 
riveting for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, written by Eugene O'Neill in 1939 and first on  
Broadway in 1946, opened Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. 
The revival of the work is based on the production at London's 
Almeida Theater, where it opened to acclaim last year. 
</P>
<P>
	When Spacey, as the joke-telling Hickey, first enters the bar,  
he's off-putting with his fast-talk -- like a vintage radio 
personality. But soon Spacey's delivery and pacing become 
mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey's father was a Midwestern preacher, and he's a salesman;  
it's obvious he has adopted speech rhythms that pull in a listener. 
It's plausible that this Hickey would spur the barflies out of 
their stupor. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Hickey tells a joke about his wife and the iceman. But  
now what he wants to do, at Harry Hope's 60th birthday party, is 
make the 15 folks who drink at the bar and sleep upstairs face 
their pipe dreams -- two words that become the play's mantra. They 
all have hope for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey sends them out -- today -- to act on their oft-stated  
intentions. They all fail, as he expected, but he believes their 
encounters with reality will bring them peace. But peace never 
comes, so Hickey tells them his wife's pipe dream and his solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Spacey, known for dark, mysterious characters in numerous films  
and in TV's ``Wiseguy'' series, is joined in ``Iceman'' by Tony 
Danza. Best known for the TV series ``Taxi'' and ``Who's the 
Boss?'', Danza is excellent as Rocky, an Italian bartender pouring 
and withholding drinks at the whim of Harry Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of young streetwalkers, played by Catherine Kellner and  
Dina Spybey, work for Rocky. And all three are vehement about not 
using the words ``pimp'' and ``whore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Pigott-Smith, who was Ronald Merrick in TV's ``The Jewel in  
the Crown,'' plays the important role of Larry. He's a former 
anarchist who left ``the movement,'' who now sits in the 
grandstand, observing, caring about nothing. But, despite what he 
says, Larry is often moved to caring and pity. And, while he is 
physically removed from the others, he still manages a lot of 
walking and gestures and twitches not seen in the last revival on 
Broadway in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	It's interesting how both interpretations work. In contrast to  
Jason Robard's 1986 starring role, in which he delivered Hickey's 
last-act monologue with hurricane force, Spacey makes a soliloquy 
seem like a brief conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the audience enter the theater to people dozing  
onstage, at the bar. Director Howard Davies and the actors have 
done an amazing job of making each character distinctive and 
interesting. So the audience is not confused or bored. Where lines 
are meant to be funny, they are delivered so well that they provoke 
big laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hazeldine plays Harry Hope. One man, young Don Parritt,  
joins his regulars. He has betrayed his anarchist mother to the 
police. Robert Sean Leonard is slightly too upscale but properly 
anguished as Parritt. Stephen Singer as Hugo spouts anarchist 
rhetoric. Willie (Michael Emerson) was a brilliant law student. Joe 
(Clarke Peters) recalls owning a gambling house. Patrick L. Godfrey 
and Ed Dixon as old campaigners almost restart the Boer War. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Tomorrow (Paul Giamatti) lost his job to drunkenness. Jeff  
Weiss and Richard Riehle play Hope's closest pals, an old carnival 
ticket-seller and a crooked ex-cop. Katie Finneran plays Cora, a 
tart, and Skipp Sudduth, her burly boyfriend Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The play's message, that people need pipe dreams to live,  
produces less gut emotion than intellectual power. 
</P>
<P>
	But power it is.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Panel OKs Gag Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee adopted  
a gag order on Thursday prohibiting board members from releasing 
any confidential information -- a rule punishable by expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came two months after SLOC president Mitt Romney,  
taking the reins as CEO of the organizing committee, promised a new 
era of openness in the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The gag order was adopted after some members complained they  
were learning more from press accounts than Olympic managers. But 
Romney said press leaks often occur when SLOC letters and faxes are 
sent to board members. He urged them to show restraint, especially 
with budget material. 
</P>
<P>
	The confidentiality order was a much-discussed impromptu item  
during a meeting at the Utah Capitol of SLOC's 20-member management 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved Romney's hiring of Fraser Bullock as  
executive vice president and chief operating officer. Bullock will 
begin work May 1. He replaces Dave Johnson, who was forced out in 
January amid revelations that Salt Lake boosters had used gifts, 
cash payments and other favors to win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to focus like a laser'' on SLOC finances and  
organizing, said Bullock, 44, managing director of Alpine 
Consolidated, a Utah firm that specializes in business 
consolidations. He worked with Romney at Boston-based Bain &AMP; Co, 
and the friends have known each other for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's new confidentiality order will not apply to its  
several ex-officio members who can't be replaced under any 
circumstance. They include Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake City 
Mayor Deedee Corradini or their designees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we're not going to ask the governor to resign'' for  
divulging information, said board member James Swartz, who 
sponsored the gag order. 
</P>
<P>
	It passed by a vote of 15-0 with Romney abstaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``The secrets of the company are the assets of a company,'' said  
Barry Sanders, SLOC's outside attorney. ``To tell a secret is to 
squander an asset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The order was refined several times before the voting. The final  
version wasn't limited to board members, so it apparently also 
applies to SLOC employees. It requires those who obtain ``any 
communication written or verbal'' that is marked confidential to be 
kept so. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule is punishable by expulsion, but it is not clear how  
SLOC will determine or prove a violation has occurred.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Abruptly Empties Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- For tens of thousands of Kosovo  
Albanians stranded in a fetid no-man's land between their homeland 
and Macedonia, deliverance came at a speed that left their last few 
belongings -- and their lives -- scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	People who had already lost their homes, lands and livelihoods  
in the forced flight from Kosovo found in rescue that they had 
still more left to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father, brothers and mother, and one child,'' said one  
woman, who gave her name only as Dita, listing the loved ones from 
whom she had been separated after Macedonia's decision to empty out 
a makeshift refugee camp on its border overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	By dawn Wednesday, Macedonian authorities had dispersed 35,000  
or more of the refugees from the squalid, septic border enclave. 
The majority were sent to NATO tent camps inside Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia sent 10,000 to neighboring Albania and 5,500 to  
Turkey, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The UNHCR was 
still trying to account today for 10,000 refugees bused to a 
destination still unknown to international aid workers, spokeswoman 
Paula Ghedina said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Brazda refugee center in Macedonia, Dita looked for her  
relatives. ``I think maybe they're here, but I don't see them,'' 
she said. ``I'm very worried about them. I don't know where to find 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia had been stung by international criticism of its  
slowness in moving refugees from the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces have been accused of expelling hundreds of thousands  
from Kosovo in response to the NATO bombing campaign, although the 
Yugoslav government says the refugees fled NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies said the camp had been rife for an epidemic.  
Journalists, although kept back from the scene by Macedonian 
forces, counted scores of graves appearing in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	When Macedonia finally acted, it acted quickly, shipping the  
refugees out on buses at a speed that caught humanitarian workers 
by surprise, leaving them mystified for much of Wednesday as to the 
refugees' whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	One refugee said he left his family to get bread, and came back  
to find them gone, hustled on to buses before he could say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Within 24 hours, the NATO camps in Macedonia swelled by 25,000,  
to about 44,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the camps, the newly arrived refugees sought out their  
families, some sobbing in the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Western aid workers had been anxious to see refugees escape the  
filthy conditions at Blace, but still were critical of the way the 
evacuation was carried out by Macedonian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we can attest to is the fact refugees usually do not  
leave the few items they have in their possession -- meaning tents, 
blankets, baby food, passports. And evidence of these were found in 
Blace,'' Ghedina said. ``So we do have quite a bit of concern that 
there was some degree of pressure placed on these refugees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs allegedly destroyed the Kosovo Albanians' documents before  
expelling them, and the UNHCR had been working to register the 
refugees -- not an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, chairman of the  
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, praised 
Macedonia for allowing the refugees' entry and clearing out the 
unhealthy border enclave. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he acknowledged that some refugees at Blace  
were filmed being taken away against their will. ``Forced removal 
is unacceptable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mom Implicates Son in Ark. Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- With apologies, tears and gestures of  
affection for her son, Gloria Kehoe testified he admitted killing a 
gun dealer and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be told, Chevie,'' Mrs. Kehoe said Wednesday from  
the witness stand. ``There's wrong and there's right. God won't let 
me live with it anymore. I'm very sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., are charged with racketeering, conspiracy and murder 
in an alleged plot to overthrow the government and set up the 
whites-only Aryan Peoples Republic in the Pacific Northwest. They 
could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they are accused of murdering gun dealer  
William Mueller; his wife, Nancy; and her daughter in January 1996. 
Selling guns taken from the family helped pay the men's living 
expenses, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kehoe flashed the sign language symbol for ``I love you''  
to her son when she took the stand Wednesday. She then recalled how 
her son told her that he and Lee donned FBI outfits, entered the 
Muellers' home in Tilly, Ark., and waited. They took the family by 
surprise, bound their hands with plastic ties and told them they 
were being arrested, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that Lee and her son gave the three electric shocks on  
the neck to make them pass out, believing they were acting humane. 
Then the pair put plastic over the Muellers' heads, she said, and 
Kehoe beat Mueller in the head with the butt of a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kehoe said her son bragged that he put the victims on ``a  
liquid diet'' by tossing their bodies into a western Arkansas 
bayou, where they were found in June 1996. They had been wrapped in 
plastic, bound with duct tape and weighted with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of telling the story, Mrs. Kehoe turned to her son  
and said: ``You know it's right, Bud. Don't look at me that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kehoe testified that she confirmed much of her son's story  
in later conversations with Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Mrs. Kehoe agreed with some suggestions  
that her husband was a tyrant and that Chevie committed crimes to 
please him. 
</P>
<P>
	The court session came to an abrupt end when defense lawyer Tom  
Sullivan began asking Mrs. Kehoe about the Christian Identity 
Movement, to which she and her husband belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan asked how members felt about pedophilia. He then asked  
specifically about how members of her family felt about the 
subject. After prosecutors objected, Mrs. Kehoe ran from the 
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Milstein Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Heated emotion and the cold reality of finances  
spelled doom for Howard Milstein. Now the search is on -- again -- 
for a new owner for the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, saying he wanted to get out before the process got  
``protracted'' and ``contentious'' when it was already both, 
withdrew his group's $800 million bid to buy the Redskins on 
Wednesday as it became apparent his group lacked the necessary 
support from NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have withdrawn with great sadness. ... In the end we  
complied with all the league's stated requirements and agreed to 
all of the league's additional conditions,'' Milstein said in a 
statement released at a special owners meeting. ``But we recognize 
that a protracted, contentious dispute over ownership would cripple 
the Redskins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's bid, which would have set a record for a U.S. sports  
franchise, was dogged from the start over questions about his 
finances and concerns he would be a litigious, maverick owner. 
Although worth an estimated $500 million, Milstein has his fortune 
tied up in real estate and did not have enough ready cash on hand 
to satisfy many owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Milstein got his father to supply $125 million for  
the deal, but many NFL owners viewed that as a loan rather than as 
liquid capital from the buyer. In a crucial vote, the league's 
finance committee met for 4 1/2 hours Wednesday morning and did not 
recommend approval of the sale, splitting 3-3 with one abstention. 
Without a positive recommendation, the sale was virtually certain 
not to get the 24 of 31 votes needed from the full ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein, a New York real estate developer and part-owner of the  
NHL's Islanders, then briefly addressed the full ownership. He made 
his case one final time before offering to pull out under an 
agreement brokered with input from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
Milstein left the room, and the owners voted 28-2-1 to accept the 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Milstein promised not to sue the league. In  
return, the league agreed to assume responsibility for a 
non-refundable $30 million deposit Milstein was required to make 
when his bid was selected by the trustees of the estate of the late 
Jack Kent Cooke on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as owners left the hotel, it quickly became clear money  
wasn't the only thing at issue. Tagliabue said some owners were 
concerned about Milstein's confrontational stewardship of the 
Islanders, who are involved in multiple lawsuits in a fight for a 
new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotion may have gotten invovled in it to some degree,'' said  
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who supported the bid. ``They did 
have past experience, and I think some of those issues were 
perceived negatively, fairly or unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finance committee chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New England  
Patriots and another supporter of the bid, said a number of owners 
found the concept of the $30 million deposit ``quite offensive'' 
because it almost boxed the league into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The method the trustees used to sell the team sort of picked  
our owner for us,'' Kraft said. ``The owners want to feel that 
we're picking who our new partner is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will now be a new round of bidding conducted by the  
trustees. Milstein's minority partner, Washington-area 
communications executive Daniel Snyder, intends to be first in line 
-- this time at the person leading the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Snyder intends to own the Washington Redskins,'' said a  
source involved with Snyder's planning. ``There are no shortage of 
partners willing to be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who would become the league's youngest owner at age 34,  
has more than $150 million cash available to mount a bid and left a 
positive impression with many NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's logical,'' Jones said of a Snyder bid, ``because he was a  
very positive and important part of this bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Snyder nor Milstein was available for comment after the  
withdrawal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Also re-entering the race will be Redskins president John Kent  
Cooke, son of the late owner. Cooke vowed to keep the team in his 
family, but was outbid by an estimated $120 million in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I have notified executors of my father's estate that my  
offer is still on the table,'' Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of bidding could be completed in about two months.  
Meanwhile, Cooke will continue to run the team, retaining coach 
Norv Turner and general manager Charley Casserly.

<HEADLINE> Sweden To Face Austria in Davis Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reigning Davis Cup champion Sweden, bounced out of  
this year's play in the first round by Slovakia, will have to win a 
series in Austria to keep its place in the elite World Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries were paired against each other Thursday in the  
draw for the World Group qualifying round to be played Sept. 24-26. 
Austria has home advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw matched the eight losers from last weekend's World  
Group first-round ties against the winners from the second-tier 
zonal group. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of September's matches will have berths in next  
year's World Group. Losers will go into the zonal divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, the 1998 champion, was beaten at home by Slovakia 3-2  
last weekend in a major upset. It was the first time since 1991 
that Sweden had been knocked out in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria, playing without its top player, Thomas Muster, advanced  
to the qualifying round by downing Portugal 4-1 in a Euro-African 
zonal group match. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, which lost to the United States 3-2 in a thrilling  
first-round competition was drawn against South Africa for the 
qualifying round. Britain will play at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Other World Group losers Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the  
Czech Republic all will play away matches matches for September.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was  
released from the hospital after an eight-day stay. His doctors 
said this week he is free of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan left Howard University Hospital on Wednesday. A  
university spokeswoman, Donna Brock, said she could not say where 
he was going. He lives in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, underwent surgery March 30 to correct an  
inflammation caused by cancer treatment to his prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, his doctors held a news conference to say Farrakhan,  
who was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991, was free of 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Alim Muhammad, health minister for the Nation of Islam,  
said then that Farrakhan had ``absolutely no evidence of cancer,'' 
and suggested he had been cured. 
</P>
<P>
	Nation of Islam officials said Farrakhan would continue his  
three-month sabbatical and would use his experience to spread the 
word that prostate cancer is more common and aggressive in black 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hospital stay, published reports said Farrakhan's  
condition was more serious than Nation of Islam officials were 
revealing. Muhammad said the news conference Tuesday was held to 
dispel the stories that Farrakhan was gravely ill.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Can't Reach Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China failed to strike a  
final deal Thursday for clearing China's entry to the World Trade 
Organization but found accord on opening China's markets to some 
U.S. farm products and more airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Both President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji voiced  
optimism that an agreement for China joining the WTO can be reached 
before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite marathon negotiations over the past four days and a  
flurry of last-minute trade concessions from China, the 
administration decided it needed more than Chinese negotiators were 
willing to offer to sell the trade package to a hostile Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to clinch a final agreement was a significant  
setback for Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit America in 15 
years. He had hoped to win U.S. backing for China's entry into WTO 
during his meetings with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made significant progress toward bringing China into the  
World Trade Organization on fair commercial terms, but we are not 
there yet,'' Clinton told reporters at a joint news conference with 
Zhu. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hailed separate deals for eliminating significant  
Chinese barriers to American agriculture products, including beef, 
pork, poultry, citrus and wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Other signed agreements included doubling the number of  
passenger and cargo flights between the two countries. And the 
administration got a commitment from China to crack down on piracy 
of computer programs by Chinese government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries also issued a joint statement listing trade  
concessions that China offered in hopes of winning America's 
support for WTO membership and pledged to continue working toward 
achieving that goal by November, when the WTO is scheduled to 
launch a new round of global trade talks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint statement, however, also listed areas still in  
dispute, most notably an American demand that China still be 
subject to unilateral U.S. trade sanctions for a period of years 
after it enters the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was unwilling to relent on this point,  
fearing charges from opponents that it had given its enforcement 
rights for forcing China to comply with its commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main benefits China would receive from WTO membership  
would be protection from new U.S. sanctions without first winning a 
trade case before an impartial WTO hearing panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas where China's market-opening offers were deemed  
insufficient were banking, especially the ability of U.S. firms to 
offer auto loans to Chinese consumers, sales of stocks and other 
securities and distribution rights for American-made movies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, briefing  
reporters on the talks, rejected a suggestion the administration 
may have given ammunition to Chinese critics of Zhu, who is viewed 
as a leading proponent of economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu ``is anxious for very substantial reform of the Chinese  
economy and to move it more toward the direction of market 
economies ... This will help to solidify China as a place where 
companies will want to do business,'' Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying for 13 years to win entry in the WTO and  
the organization that preceded it, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. It needs approval from the United States and other major 
trading powers for membership in the Geneva-based organization that 
sets the rules for global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has been unwilling to drop its  
objections until it is satisfied with China's commitment to lower 
its high tariffs and other trade barriers that the administration 
sees as a chief cause for America's soaring deficit with China. 
Last year that deficient reached $57 billion, the largest for any 
nation other than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	China's last-minute push for a deal in time for Zhu's visit also  
was coming at a time of rising U.S.-China tensions in other areas 
outside of economics, including allegations that China stole 
nuclear secrets from American laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agriculture agreement announced Thursday, China will  
lift a long-standing ban on shipments of wheat from the Pacific 
Northwest and citrus from Florida, Texas and California. It also 
agreed to eliminate burdensome inspection requirements on American 
beef, pork and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Lambert, chief economist for the National Cattlemen's  
Association, said the accord should produce big gains for American 
meat producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. industries also supported the concessions U.S.  
negotiators won, although many companies who have longed hoped to 
expand their operations in China urged the administration to push 
forward for a final deal without delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has shown its willingness to open the door to its  
enormous market wider than ever, presenting Americans with 
unprecedented opportunities to trade with the world's most populous 
country,'' said Philip Condit, chairman of Boeing Co. and head of a 
trade task force of the Business Roundtable.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: NATO Is Going To Prevail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen  
told U.S. pilots today that the bombing missions they are flying 
over Yugoslavia will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is going to prevail,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	Standing beside an F-16 fighter in a hanger, Cohen continued:  
``It's going to be difficult. It's going to be hard. But we will 
persevere. The reason is because of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen visited the air base, from which hundreds of missions have  
been launched over Yugoslavia, along with a bipartisan 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
told the pilots and support crews that they were engaged in ``a 
tremendously complex effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was particularly difficult ``with the entire world  
watching to see if you do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of sending  
``hooded thugs'' to Kosovo to engage in rape, murder and other 
atrocities ``on the scale of which we not seen since World War 
II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And now he holds up his bloody hand and says, `NATO made me do  
it,''' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary and his party were flying to Ramstein Air  
Base in Germany later today for similar meetings with U.S. air 
crews there, as well as with officials from other NATO countries 
involved in the air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	One 32-year-old Air Force pilot from Aviano, said those flying  
daytime missions had not encountered much anti-aircraft fire, but 
those flying at night had. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are doing our job destroying targets,'' he said. ``Asked  
about the issue of ground forces, the pilot said, ``As a pilot, I 
can't put myself into the mind of Slobodan Milosevic. We're going 
to continue to do what our leaders tell us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials asked reporters not to use the names of  
pilots for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the bipartisan congressional delegation praised the  
professionalism of the NATO military planners in Brussels and 
asserted that NATO nations seemed united behind continuing the 
effort -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But few minds seemed to be changed, and those who had advocated  
a ground troop option before, continued to call for one. ``The 
differences remain between me and the administration on whether we 
should exercise the ground option,'' said Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, a senior member of the Armed Service Committee and a GOP 
presidential aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot rule out any options and still be credible,'' said  
McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent years as prisoner of war in 
North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, he said, borrowing a phrase from that era, ``The  
light at the end of the tunnel may turn out to be a train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that when he and other lawmakers brought up the  
ground troop argument, they were greeted with politeness -- but 
little enthusiasm -- from NATO military officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., another who favors planning for  
a ground force, said such a strategy would show Milosevic ``he 
can't wait us out on this bombing campaign. We have to keep the 
option of ground forces on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a Senate Foreign Relations  
subcommittee chairman, told reporters that failing to at least plan 
for a ground war would be foolhardy. ``If NATO countries lose the 
stomach after two or three months, we will not only have lost the 
war, we will have lost Europe,'' he said. ``You can't win a war 
hoping for the best, you have to plan for the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat on the House Armed  
Service committee, said he was impressed with the level of support 
the air operations had among the various NATO nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for weak knees. I didn't see any,'' Skelton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., was supportive of the administration but  
said after the briefings, ``They have to start planning something 
else.'' Reed said it was important to build a consensus in the 
United States and that bringing congressional members along on the 
trip was a good gesture toward keeping channels of communication 
open with Congress. For one thing, Reed said, he was impressed with 
the commitment of European allies to the air campaign. ``They seem 
to be sincerely committed to this,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., senior Democrat on the House  
International Relations Committee, said he strongly supports the 
administration's current policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're better off with an air campaign you can sustain than  
with a ground campaign you can't initiate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was wide praise among the congressional delegation for  
gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander. ``He didn't overstate 
his case,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.

<HEADLINE> Food Lion CEO Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) -- Tom E. Smith, who led Food Lion's growth  
into one of the nation's largest supermarket chains and supervised 
damage control after a TV network's investigation of the company's 
sanitation and food-handling practices, is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who kept a relatively low profile as Food Lion's  
president and chief executive officer but frequently appeared in 
folksy television commercials, said Wednesday that he is leaving 
the company on a sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After almost 30 years of dedication and hard work, it is time  
to retire and give the company a new management team to lead it 
into the next millennium,'' Smith said in a prepared statement. ``I 
can think of no better time to make these changes than the present 
as Food Lion is in excellent shape, financially and 
operationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Smith's recommendation, the company's board of directors  
named Bill McCanless his successor. McCanless has served as senior 
vice president of administration, chief administrative officer and 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre-Olivier Beckers, chief executive officer of Delhaize ``Le  
Lion'' Group, the Belgium-based supermarket chain that is Food 
Lion's largest shareholder, was named chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	When Smith was appointed CEO nearly 30 years ago, the company  
had 317 stores with sales of $1.9 billion and profits of $47.6 
million. During his tenure, sales have quadrupled to $10.2 billion, 
store count has grown to 1,223, and profits have increased to 
$272.6 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	One dark spot in Smith's tenure was ABC's 1992 undercover report  
on the supermarket chain's food-handling practices, which resulted 
in Food Lion suing ABC over the way it gathered information for the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1996, a U.S. District Court jury in Greensboro ruled  
that ABC committed fraud and trespass and that its reporters, who 
used hidden cameras and lied to get jobs, breached the loyalty they 
owed their temporary employer. In January 1997, the jury awarded 
Food Lion punitive damages of $5.5 million, but a federal judge cut 
the award to $315,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith turned down ABC's offer to appear on the ``PrimeTime  
Live'' segment and did not testify during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1998 sales in excess of $10 billion, Food Lion is one of  
the nation's largest supermarket chains, serving more than 10 
million customers per week at supermarkets in 11 Southeast and 
Mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to open 80 new stores and remodel 140 others  
in 1999.

	Spring storms swept through the Plains and Midwest on Thursday,  
while late-season snow hit the mountains of the West Coast. Warm 
weather shined from the Great Lakes to the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms brought high winds and hail from Nebraska through  
Iowa and into Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas. The stormy 
weather stretched south into Kentucky and east to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman was reported killed when high winds ripped across a  
mobile home park in Ashland, Ill., about 20 miles west of 
Springfield. Broadcast reports said the cause of death wasn't 
immediately known.

	Tornadoes broke out in Iowa and eastern Nebraska, damaging homes  
and businesses in each state. A truckload of pigs overturned on a 
highway west of Lincoln. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, a 38-year-old woman suffered broken ribs and  
back injuries when her mobile home was badly damaged by high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	On the West Coast, rain and mountain snow in the higher  
elevations stretched from Washington state into central California. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snow closed roads in the Sierras of western California,  
the latest in a series of wet snowstorms that has dumped up to 7 
feet in the mountains. The snow stretched into western Nevada.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating Susan McDougal's  
fate asked on Thursday whether they can consider an ``innocent 
reason'' for her refusal to testify in the Whitewater investigation 
of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note to the judge, jurors asked a question that goes to the  
heart of Mrs. McDougal's defense: She feared prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr would charge her with perjury unless she falsely implicated 
the president and first lady in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. responded to the jurors'  
question by letting them sort out the issue for themselves, 
referring the panel back to the instructions he read them earlier 
in the day. Jurors adjourned for the day without reaching a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Before deliberations began Thursday, Howard instructed the jury  
that Mrs. McDougal would be guilty of criminal contempt if she 
``willfully'' violated a court order to testify and did not act 
``by accident, mistake or other innocent reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard also stated Mrs. McDougal's defense that Starr was  
trying to get her to lie could be applied only to an obstruction of 
justice charge against her, not to the two contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Wednesday, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark  
Geragos, emphasized to the jury that she did have an ``innocent 
reason'' for not testifying. Referring to her assertion that Starr 
wanted her to lie, Geragos said the prosecutors' tactics were 
``something you expect to see in the Third Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett said that ``innocent reason'' does not  
include the fact that a defendant does not like the prosecutor. 
Barrett said an example of an ``innocent reason'' for not 
testifying would be if the witness got laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers portrayed Mrs. McDougal as a chronic liar  
and publicity-seeker who refused to testify because she hated Starr 
and enjoyed the attention she was receiving as a grand jury 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with two counts of criminal contempt  
for her refusals to testify to the grand juries in 1996 and 1998. 
The obstruction charge alleges that she seriously impeded Starr's 
probe and would carry a maximum 10-year prison term. Prison terms 
for criminal contempt are left to the judge's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal entered the courtroom smiling and seemingly  
relaxed, propping her feet on a chair while waiting for jurors to 
arrive. Asked whether she was relieved the trial was ending, she 
answered, ``You can't imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, prosecutors said ``lingering questions''  
exist in the Whitewater investigation even though Mrs. McDougal 
testified at her trial, finally answering some of the questions she 
previously had refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she did not tell the president about a fraudulent  
$300,000 loan that was used in part to prop up the Whitewater real 
estate venture and that as far as she knows, Clinton testified 
truthfully at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted of four felonies regarding the fraudulent federally  
backed $300,000 loan, Mrs. McDougal testified that her ex-husband, 
James, told her that if she testified that she had sex with the 
president, she could write her own ticket with Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Mrs. McDougal denied any intimate  
relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured an unusual lineup of witnesses: three grand  
jurors, three Whitewater prosecutors and a defendant from another 
case Starr is bringing. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors testified that they did not think Starr was out  
to get the Clintons and that they felt Mrs. McDougal should have 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said they did their jobs in an evenhanded  
manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing also testified that he had drawn up a  
draft indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton and circulated it inside 
the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the truthfulness of Mrs. Clinton's July 1996 testimony  
in the Whitewater probe, Ewing said he told colleagues that he 
would have given her a grade of ``about an `F.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendant Julie Hiatt Steele said she had been victimized by  
Starr's office because she -- like Mrs. McDougal -- wouldn't tell the 
prosecutors a story that implicated Clinton in wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Mogul To Start Catholic Law School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former Domino's Pizza mogul Tom Monaghan will  
spend $50 million of his pizza profits to create a new law school 
meant to produce lawyers who will consider the moral consequences 
of the law from a Roman Catholic point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be the West Point for Catholic laity in the  
years to come,'' said Monaghan, who recently sold Domino's Pizza 
for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ave Maria School of Law is to open in fall 2000 in Ann Arbor  
with about 40 students. Robert Bork, one-time nominee for the U.S. 
Supreme Court, has signed on as the first professor of the new 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Dobranski, dean of Catholic University's law school in  
Washington and former dean at the University of Detroit's Mercy 
School of Law, will be Ave Maria's dean. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis will be on law and what the Catholic Church sees as  
moral truths. Ave Maria graduates will be taught to incorporate 
this philosophy in their legal decisions. The school will teach 
from the Catholic intellectual tradition, which includes criticism 
of abortion and the right-to-die movement, backers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law must be founded in a belief that there is an  
objective, moral order,'' Dobranski told the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something no law school does effectively,'' he said.  
There are 24 Catholic law schools in the country, including Detroit 
Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
	The school will be on the same Ann Arbor campus where the Ave  
Maria Institute is located. It is a two-year college that is in the 
process of becoming a private, four-year college.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Life for Texas Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- A 23-year-old man accused of masterminding  
the murder-for-hire of a man for his gun collection has been 
convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Don Wilson was convicted Thursday in last year's slaying  
of 46-year-old Mark Lund. The sentence was automatic because 
prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the victim's son, 16-year-old Brandon Lund, sought  
to have his father killed. Wilson's group of rough loners was 
willing to commit the murder for the military gun collection valued 
at more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Lund changed his mind and tried to call off the hit, but  
Wilson and his gang refused. Dressed in black, they cut the phone 
line and crept through a window. After ransacking the house, Wilson 
pushed Lund onto a bed, shoved a pillow in his face and shot him in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Wilson's gang scratched a cross on Brandon Lund's face  
with her fingernail and slashed him across the throat with a knife, 
according to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mike Fouts argued that co-defendant Daniel  
Mullins was just as likely a triggerman as Wilson. Prosecutors said 
the evidence pointed to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials are pending for four other members of the group. One  
suspect testified against Wilson and said in court that he expects 
to plead guilty to burglary later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Lund, now 17, was charged with solicitation of capital  
murder. He was convicted in October and sentenced to two years in a 
juvenile prison. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why Brandon wanted someone to kill his father. At  
his trial, prosecutor Dan Joiner argued that the teen-ager had no 
specific reason: ``He just didn't like the way his father was 
running the household.''

<HEADLINE> Revlon To Sell Some Divisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cosmetics company Revlon is in line for a  
makeover, though whether its potential new look is a success 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Ronald O. Perelman on Wednesday announced plans to  
sell one or more of Revlon's struggling businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The news wasn't a complete surprise to investors, who have sent  
shares of Revlon soaring 70 percent over the past two weeks amid 
rumors the company was a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation of potential bidders has included Unilever NV, the  
maker of Calvin Klein and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and fragrances, 
and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which owns the Max Factor and Cover Girl 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what kind of sale would be undertaken remains unclear.  
The company did not elaborate on its plans, and spokesman Walter 
Montgomery said, ``It's premature to speculate on any specific 
course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon makes Revlon and Almay makeup, Flex shampoo and Charlie  
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one analyst believes the whole company will be sold  
rather than splitting apart its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more likely they would sell the whole company,''  
said Tim Drake, a senior equity analyst at Banc One Investment 
Advisors, which owns about 350,000 shares of Revlon. ``The true 
value of the company is in the Revlon brand and the Revlon name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money from any deal would be used to pay down Revlon's $1.66  
billion in debt, much of it borrowed when Perelman bought the 
company in 1985 for $1.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1934 by Charles Revson and Joseph Lachman, the  
company made its name in the business by introducing nail polish 
and matching lipsticks in fashion colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon, which now uses model Cindy Crawford to hype its new  
shades, is a dominant player at cosmetic counters in drugstores 
like Eckerd and Rite Aid, and discount stores like Target and 
Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	But the competition is cutthroat.  
</P>
<P>
	Crowding the market with L'Oreal and Estee Lauder are aggressive  
rivals such as Procter &AMP; Gamble, which is launching a makeup line 
for its Oil of Olay brand, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which just 
introduced a Neutrogena-brand makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, companies like Gap and Victoria's Secret are  
launching their own makeup and body care lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole new market share war going on,'' said Allan  
Mottus, editor of The Informationist, an industry trade 
publication. Revlon's ``business has slowed down, and they have to 
invest more in new products and advertising to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's hard for debt-laden Revlon to do, having earned just $8.5  
million from continuing operations last year on flat sales of $2.25 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent run up in Revlon's stock, the shares remains  
58 percent below where it stood last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Perelman, chairman and chief executive of Revlon, owns 83  
percent of the company's stock through his firm MacAndrews &AMP; 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	For Perelman, who started as a small businessman in Philadelphia  
and became one of the richest men in America, Revlon is the latest 
in a string of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a costly and high-profile custody battle with his  
third wife, Perelman's investments in Marvel Comics, Sunbeam and 
Consolidated Cigar have all had their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, despite Perelman's efforts to restructure Revlon,  
the company seems to attract unflattering press. 
</P>
<P>
	The cosmetics company was in the news recently after George  
Fellows, Revlon president, paid for the New York Police 
Commissioner to fly to Hollywood for the Oscars during the 
investigation of the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed 
immigrant, by four policemen.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Users Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCATA, Calif. (AP) -- Arcata's police chief walked into the  
house and was escorted upstairs to a bedroom filled with marijuana 
plants and enough smokable pot to fill a grocery bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of reaching for his gun or a search warrant, Mel Brown  
offered a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to leave places like that with plants and prisoners,''  
Brown said on the way out of Jason Browne's marijuana garden. ``But 
here, law enforcement is holding out the olive branch to people who 
smoke medical marijuana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked between groves of towering redwoods and misty coastal  
beaches in far northern California, Arcata, population 16,000, is 
getting considerable attention for its response to Proposition 215, 
the 1996 voter initiative that allows people to grow and use 
marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown personally issues photo identification cards bearing his  
signature to people who register as medical marijuana patients, 
after confirming that they have a doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has issued about 100 of the ``stay out of jail''  
cards. Officers have been instructed not to arrest pot growers or 
smokers who carry the ID. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he is not concerned about trouble from Attorney  
General Janet Reno, who personally reminded state Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer last month that Proposition 215 runs counter to 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I don't see Janet Reno coming to Arcata and  
arresting somebody or having her people arrest somebody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, however, Brown keeps no record of who applies  
for an ID and doesn't keep track of those who currently use a card. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the card holders is Browne, who smokes pot to relieve his  
back pain and invited the chief to survey his crop. During the 
visit, the chief listened attentively while the grower spoke of the 
potency of his next harvest, and sighed sympathetically when Browne 
shook some stalks and unleashed a swarm of marijuana-munching bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason and I were both very cautious when the program first  
started,'' said Brown, 53. ``I didn't want to be associated with 
black market drug dealers and he didn't want to be associated with 
someone who was going to stab him in the back. But time passed and 
we got over the stereotypes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the U.S. Justice Department won a court order to shut  
down most of the state's cannabis clubs for violating federal laws 
against marijuana distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockyer, who is seeking a compromise that will avoid the wrath  
of federal officials, has formed a task force of law enforcement 
officers and medical marijuana advocates to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes Arcata's program work is the fact that law  
enforcement and the medical community are involved,'' said Nathan 
Barankin, Lockyer's spokesman. ``The task force has been asked to 
look at Arcata as a model and perhaps make some recommendations on 
whether what works for Arcata works for Los Angeles and other 
larger communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arcata works for officials in Mendocino County, where District  
Attorney Norman Vroman plans to announce a similar ID card system 
next month. ``We thought it was very successful and we intend to 
plagiarize as much of it as we can,'' Vroman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such praise from law enforcement is a dramatic change for the  
Emerald Triangle, the region in Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity 
counties where pot is the largest cash crop and drug-busting teams 
often raided clandestine marijuana patches hidden in the forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Pot is so common here that the pungent scent of marijuana smoke  
hovers outside bars, and locals practice the ``4:20'' toke time 
each afternoon, much as people take tea in England. (Smokers say 
4-20 also is police code for a marijuana offense.) 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who serves on Lockyer's task force, is proud of the  
official support, but says his program is simply a response to 
Arcata's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief concern was being able to afford the people in my  
community the rights they were given,'' he said. ``Secondly, the 
program doesn't waste the community's money on police work that 
would not lead to successful prosecutions.''

<HEADLINE> Navajos Claim Utah Wasted $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When auditors reviewed Utah's handling of  
an oil-and-gas royalty trust set up by Congress to benefit Navajo 
Indians, one state lawmaker likened the chronicle of abuses to a 
cheap novel. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $62 million had gone into the trust but only $12  
million remained by 1991. The rest, the auditors found, was lost to 
lax oversight, payoffs, bribes and ill-conceived business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a federal judge has ruled the Navajos can go ahead with  
their claim that Utah must make up for abuses dating to the trust's 
creation in 1933. Their estimate of the damage -- $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general should be calling any minute now to talk  
about a settlement,'' Brian Barnard, a lawyer for the Navajos, said 
Wednesday. ``I'm not holding my breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navajos are Utah's poorest residents. Many reservation areas  
have no running water or electricity and unemployment runs up to 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of setting aside the state's share of oil and gas  
royalties for the Indians surfaced when Congress decided to expand 
the Navajo Reservation from New Mexico and Arizona into 
southeastern Utah, where a number of Navajo clans had fled when Kit 
Carson marched the tribe into New Mexico in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress made the idea law in 1933. But it wasn't until oil and  
gas companies started drilling in the Aneth extension oil field 
about 30 years later that the battle was joined over how the 37.5 
percent royalty should be spent. The remaining 62.5 percent is 
divided between the tribe, headquartered at Window Rock, Ariz., and 
the Bureau of Indian of Affairs, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the year before the Navajos' class-action lawsuit was  
filed, the Utah Legislature's auditor general reported suspected 
self-dealing and mismanagement by trust fund officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal criminal indictments followed, alleging bribery,  
conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and misuse of tribal funds 
against seven Navajo Nation leaders in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Navajos' lawsuit, Utah breached its duties as  
the trust's fiduciary -- a role it never wanted and would like 
nothing more than to shed. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah had argued its liability, if any, should be governed by the  
state's own statute of limitations, or extending only as far back 
as 1988. But U.S. District Judge David Sam ruled on Friday that no 
statute of limitations applies to the case -- opening the 
possibility for a massive judgment if the Navajos can prove 
mismanagement at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Valden Livingston said federal law  
placed no special obligation on Utah to properly invest the Navajo 
royalties. Rather, Utah had only to see that the money was spent on 
reservation roads, health care and ``tuition of Indian children at 
white schools,'' he said, reading from a federal statute. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Utah has to provide a complete accounting of  
the $62 million received or earned by the Navajo Trust Fund between 
1955 and 1991, when professional managers took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnard said the case is ``shockingly similar'' to the federal  
government's century-old mishandling of billions of dollars in 
Indian trust accounts. That case in February landed Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt in contempt of court for failing to produce 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the federal case, Utah's 7,500 Navajos claim they've been  
cheated on their trust funds. Some funds were never invested while 
others were squandered on bad business deals and ``thievery,'' 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah itself took trust money to build a state office in Blanding  
under a ``sweetheart'' lease deal, Barnard contends, in one of many 
deals marred by conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnard believes that properly managed, the trust should have  
grown to $100 million by 1991, even with payments made for the 
welfare of Navajos. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Gov. Mike Leavitt said an out-of-court settlement of  
the case was best for Utah. But he waited to measure the state's 
potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commitment to work it out remains,'' Vicki Varela, the  
governor's spokeswoman, said Wednesday. ``We'll move it forward in 
the most productive way we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No trial date has been set.

	Envoy Seeks Release of U.S. Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO arranged for safe passage today of a  
flight by a former president of Cyprus to Yugoslavia that is 
intended to secure the release of three American soldiers held 
captive in Belgrade, U.S. officials said. Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon told reporters that no allied bombing missions will 
interfere with the plane carrying the Cypriot, Spyros Kyprianou.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid fears that refugees are  
becoming human shields now that Yugoslavia has sealed its borders, 
Serb media claimed today that ethnic Albanians are voluntarily 
returning to Kosovo. NATO warplanes and missiles, meanwhile, took 
aim at the heart of Belgrade in what it said is a systematic bid to 
break the Yugoslav military machine. ``We will prevail,'' Defense

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed Chinese Premier Zhu  
Rongji to the White House today and said the United States can best 
achieve its hopes for the next century through the creation of a 
``strategic partnership'' with China on such issues as 
nonproliferation, free trade and the mutual embrace of political 
freedom. In his comments, Zhu spoke effusively about 
Chinese-American relations, asserting that the friendship between 
the two countries ``cannot be undermined by anybody.''

to resolve differences on eliminating Chinese trade barriers, an 
administration official said today, making it unlikely that U.S. 
approval for China's membership in the World Trade Organization 
will come during Premier Zhu Rongji's visit. The official said the 
United States has achieved one of its major objectives -- a separate 
deal with China, effective immediately, to remove barriers to the

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire To Create New Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Working under a court order to find a fair  
way to fund schools, New Hampshire legislators agreed to raise all 
sorts of taxes as a solution, but refused to create a widely 
loathed income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative leaders would not consider either an income tax or  
general sales tax, all but ensuring the state with the license tag 
that reads ``Live Free or Die'' remains one of two states with 
neither. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska is the other.  
</P>
<P>
	The state is a week late to meet the state Supreme Court's  
deadline for a new, fairer system to pay for schools. The state now 
relies on widely varying local property taxes, which the court 
ruled unconstitutional in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A rash of new taxes would be created under a bipartisan plan  
introduced by House leaders Thursday as a counterproposal to a plan 
put forth by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, which also steered clear of an 
income or general sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The House plan would create a statewide property tax, and would,  
for the first time, also tax services; auto sales, rentals and 
leases; and entertainment, such as movie tickets and health club 
memberships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski lifts were exempt. Cigarette taxes would be increased, as  
would property transaction fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is considering a plan introduced by Shaheen, a  
Democrat, that also relies on a statewide property tax, but also 
would expand business taxes and a capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the new proposed taxes would be repealed if voters  
adopted a constitutional amendment permitting the use of varying 
local property taxes to fund education. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers have wrestled with the issue, two Wall Street bond  
rating firms have said the state's debt is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine states have no income taxes: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New  
Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Announces Viking Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a  
millennium museum exhibit Thursday on the Vikings, who may have 
been not only the first Europeans to see America, but also the 
first to create parliamentary government more than 1,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit called ``Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga,'' will  
open in Washington at the National Museum of Natural History on 
April 29, 2000, and make a two-year tour of the continent, 
including New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within Viking society, women had a good deal of freedom to  
engage in trade and to become active participants in the political 
lives of their communities,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iceland, the Viking explorers' homeland, set up a parliament  
called the Althing in the year 930. The Althing still makes 
Iceland's laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also spoke of the Vikings' wide-ranging voyages  
that brought them not only to North America -- ``a land where the 
frost never came, and the grass hardly withered,'' said an early 
saga -- but also to what are now Turkey and Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever visited Martha's Vineyard, you can see remnants  
of Viking exploration and settlement,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who has 
vacationed on that Massachusetts island with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the Vikings transmitted experiences and culture from  
one part of the world to the other, Mrs. Clinton said, ``In a way 
it (the Viking ship) was the Internet of the year 1000.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Regulators Block Coke Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australian regulators blocked  
Coca-Cola Co.'s initial proposal to acquire several brands of soft 
drinks marketed in Australia from British-based rival Cadbury 
Schweppes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said it was already discussing an  
amended proposal with the regulators and was hopeful that it would 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said Thursday  
the U.S. soft drink company's original plan would result in an 
unacceptable reduction of competition in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Allan Fels said Coca-Cola's share of the  
Australian soft drink market would rise to 75 percent from 65 
percent if the original plan went ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	This would threaten other existing or new soft drink companies  
and reduce retailers' sources of supply and was likely to breach 
Australia's competition laws, Fels said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement from Atlanta, Coca-Cola said an amended  
proposal has already been submitted to the Australian regulators 
that is ``substantially different and addresses the ACCC's core 
concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies had positive discussions with the ACCC earlier  
this year regarding the amended proposal and believe that real 
progress has been made towards a successful outcome,'' the company 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola announced in December it would pay $1.85 billion for  
Cadbury Schweppes brands including Dr Pepper and Crush in 120 
countries outside the United States.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating Susan McDougal's  
fate asked on Thursday whether they can consider an ``innocent 
reason'' for her refusal to testify in the Whitewater investigation 
of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note to the judge, jurors asked a question that goes to the  
heart of Mrs. McDougal's defense: She feared prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr would charge her with perjury unless she falsely implicated 
the president and first lady in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. responded to the jurors'  
question by letting them sort out the issue for themselves, 
referring the panel back to the instructions he read them earlier 
in the day. Jurors adjourned for the day without reaching a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Before deliberations began Thursday, Howard instructed the jury  
that Mrs. McDougal would be guilty of criminal contempt if she 
``willfully'' violated a court order to testify and did not act 
``by accident, mistake or other innocent reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard also stated Mrs. McDougal's defense that Starr was  
trying to get her to lie could be applied only to an obstruction of 
justice charge against her, not to the two contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Wednesday, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark  
Geragos, emphasized to the jury that she did have an ``innocent 
reason'' for not testifying. Referring to her assertion that Starr 
wanted her to lie, Geragos said the prosecutors' tactics were 
``something you expect to see in the Third Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett said that ``innocent reason'' does not  
include the fact that a defendant does not like the prosecutor. 
Barrett said an example of an ``innocent reason'' for not 
testifying would be if the witness got laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers portrayed Mrs. McDougal as a chronic liar  
and publicity-seeker who refused to testify because she hated Starr 
and enjoyed the attention she was receiving as a grand jury 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with two counts of criminal contempt  
for her refusals to testify to the grand juries in 1996 and 1998. 
The obstruction charge alleges that she seriously impeded Starr's 
probe and would carry a maximum 10-year prison term. Prison terms 
for criminal contempt are left to the judge's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal entered the courtroom smiling and seemingly  
relaxed, propping her feet on a chair while waiting for jurors to 
arrive. Asked whether she was relieved the trial was ending, she 
answered, ``You can't imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, prosecutors said ``lingering questions''  
exist in the Whitewater investigation even though Mrs. McDougal 
testified at her trial, finally answering some of the questions she 
previously had refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she did not tell the president about a fraudulent  
$300,000 loan that was used in part to prop up the Whitewater real 
estate venture and that as far as she knows, Clinton testified 
truthfully at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted of four felonies regarding the fraudulent federally  
backed $300,000 loan, Mrs. McDougal testified that her ex-husband, 
James, told her that if she testified that she had sex with the 
president, she could write her own ticket with Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Mrs. McDougal denied any intimate  
relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured an unusual lineup of witnesses: three grand  
jurors, three Whitewater prosecutors and a defendant from another 
case Starr is bringing. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors testified that they did not think Starr was out  
to get the Clintons and that they felt Mrs. McDougal should have 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said they did their jobs in an evenhanded  
manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing also testified that he had drawn up a  
draft indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton and circulated it inside 
the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the truthfulness of Mrs. Clinton's July 1996 testimony  
in the Whitewater probe, Ewing said he told colleagues that he 
would have given her a grade of ``about an `F.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Defendant Julie Hiatt Steele said she had been victimized by  
Starr's office because she -- like Mrs. McDougal -- wouldn't tell the 
prosecutors a story that implicated Clinton in wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Rich Taxpayers Reap More Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Would an all-expense-paid ski trip to the  
Canadian Rockies ease the pain of that income tax bill? How about a 
few free flights to Paris or Rome? 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of wealthy taxpayers are using their credit cards to  
charge hefty Internal Revenue Service bills -- several over $1 
million -- so they can rack up airline frequent flier miles and 
other rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest surprise we've had in the program is the people  
who want to pay more than $100,000,'' said Steve Johnson, senior 
vice president at U.S. Audiotex, a California company running the 
credit card program for IRS. ``They want the miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this year, people can call an Audiotex  
toll-free number -- 1-888-2PAYTAX -- to pay their income tax bills 
using either an American Express, MasterCard or Discover card. 
Visa, the largest credit card issuer, is taking a wait-and-see 
approach this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though taxpayers must pay a service fee averaging 2.5  
percent to use plastic, interest is running high among some of the 
well-heeled who determine the airline miles or other rewards are 
worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you run the numbers, some of these people who have a  
payment due figure there's a benefit to it,'' said Bob Barr, 
assistant IRS commissioner for electronic taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the big tax charges are coming from American Express  
cardholders because they have no preset credit limit, Johnson said. 
About 50 people have asked to pay $1 million or more, including one 
person who sought to pay a $9 million bill. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express spokeswoman Judy Tenzer said many cardholders  
are enrolled in the company's ``Membership Rewards'' program, which 
also has no limit and converts dollars charged into frequent flier 
miles and into points for free products ranging from music CDs to 
pearl necklaces to vacations in places like British Columbia, Costa 
Rica or Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are using checks, they're not getting anything in  
return,'' Tenzer said. ``While the size of these charges may be 
surprising, there are so many different things you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express is accepting such payments on a case-by-case  
basis after talking with the cardholder. One concern is that 
someone could escape paying the tax by putting the tax burden on a 
credit card, then declaring bankruptcy, knowing credit card bills 
rank lower than Uncle Sam when bankruptcy courts determine which 
debts get paid first. 
</P>
<P>
	Some large tax payments have also been made with MasterCard,  
which is issued through a bank or other financial institution and 
does have credit limits. Spokeswoman Lisa Brzezinski said approval 
of large charges above the limits is up to the issuer, but many 
cards are linked to particular airlines or other merchants and also 
offer rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frequent flier miles is definitely one of the reasons,'' she  
said. ``I think there is a convenience factor as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through April 2, IRS had received 5,400 credit card payments  
averaging $1,445. Besides the toll-free number, taxpayers using 
Intuit's TurboTax and MacIntax software can use Discover or other 
Novus cards to pay on-line through those programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new method of payment is direct debit from a bank  
account for people who file electronically. Through last Friday, 
33,000 taxpayers had chosen these direct payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said the IRS expects many more taxpayers planning to use  
credit cards will pay their taxes between now and next Thursday's 
midnight deadline. And one thing to keep in mind, he said, is that 
the toll-free number will be operating until midnight Hawaiian time 
-- giving East Coast taxpayers extra time to meet the IRS deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the IRS is likely to add other types of taxes that  
can be paid with credit cards, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are having a wildly successful season both in electronic  
filing and electronic payments,'' he said. ``Our folks are looking 
seriously at some other tax options.''

	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric Co.'s profit rose 14  
percent in the first quarter, boosted by strong growth in its

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar eked out gains against other major  
currencies Thursday as a larger-than-expected interest rate cut by 
the European Central Bank failed to bolster the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading focused on euro-dollar transactions, but the dollar  
captured a minuscule gain on the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0740, down  
from $1.0772 late Wednesday. The dollar was worth 121.37 Japanese 
yen, up from 121.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro spent much of the day strengthening against the dollar  
in anticipation of a modest interest rate cut by the European 
Central Bank as its monetary policy committee concluded a two-day 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, countries or regions cut interest rates to spur  
lending and spending in a sluggish or recessionary economy. The 
downside, however, is that the lower rates also reduce the payoff 
on investments in the local currency and assets, making them less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, traders saw a small rate cut as positive for the  
euro, the representative currency of 11 countries that has slid 
since its inception in January. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the ECB cut key interest rates by one-half percentage  
point to 2.5 percent, the first reduction since the euro's launch, 
the euro, the yen and other major currencies rose against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But within minutes, traders looked at the short-term impact of  
this surprisingly large cut and decided that the interest rate 
differential between the United States and Europe would hurt the 
euro, said Jay Bryson, an economist at First Union Capital Markets 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	With that new insight, traders started buying dollars back.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the dollar strengthened against the euro, the dollar  
strengthened against all those other currencies as well,'' Bryson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4878 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4813, and 1.4997 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4993. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6049, up from $1.5911. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8212 
German marks, up from 1.8155; 6.1087 French francs, up from 6.0901; 
and 1,801.80 Italian lire, up from 1,798.56.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Henderson Off to a Hot Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In March, Rickey Henderson looked old.  
</P>
<P>
	Spring training is a time of renewal, rebirth and rejuvenation,  
but Henderson muddled through the month. He had no pop in his bat, 
no spring in his step. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .130, and New York Mets fans feared the 40-year-old  
Henderson would be a bust as the team's new leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Henderson said, the bell rang to start the season. He  
snickers at the cliche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it: ding, ding, ding,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson came out swinging. After three games, he's again  
playing like a future Hall of Famer, and retirement seems far away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might be around when he's 50,'' Florida Marlins manager  
John Boles said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the season-opening series against Florida, Henderson went  
6-for-11 (.545) with two homers, three doubles, four RBIs, five 
runs scored, three walks and a stolen base. On Wednesday, he went 
4-for-4 with two homers and two doubles, lifting his slugging 
percentage to 1.364. 
</P>
<P>
	His new teammates were impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' John Olerud said. ``To be 40 years old and do  
what he does is incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope I'm still walking when I'm 40,'' Mike Piazza said.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's fast start was especially dazzling given his  
sluggish showing in spring training. He went 7-for-54, stirring 
speculation that his new one-year, $2.3 million contract was merely 
an advance on a retirement pension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spring training doesn't mean a whole lot,'' Henderson said.  
``People were skeptical about what was going on. They wanted me to 
go out and show what I was capable of doing, but I was just working 
on some things. Since the season started, I've been more patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson hit the ball hard four times Wednesday, particularly  
on a 417-foot homer over the center-field wall. The two-homer game 
was the 10th of his career and his first since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The home runs just come,'' he said. ``They feel good, but  
they're not something I look for. We have the big boys to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets want Henderson to get on base and wreak havoc, and he's  
done that, too. On Tuesday, he stole third with two out, an unusual 
move that paid off when catcher Jorge Fabregas threw the ball into 
left field, allowing Henderson to score. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Henderson advanced to third on a balk by Jesus  
Sanchez, then scored on a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to get off to a good start with a new team,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's career totals are remarkable: 2,684 hits, 2,019  
runs, 1,893 walks, 268 homers and a major-league record 1,298 
steals. Oddly, he has switched teams eight times, and he faced 
scrutiny joining the Mets after hitting a career-low .236 with 
Oakland in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Henderson became the oldest player to lead  
the American League in steals last year with 66. And despite his 
poor batting average this spring, the Mets were pleased with the 
effort he made to prepare for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in awe too often when I'm around world-class  
athletes,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``But it's refreshing to 
see how hard he works and how much he cares about this game. I 
appreciate his offensive skills. He knows what he's doing out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure glad he's with us.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Hoax Sends Stock Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street has always trafficked in rumors. But  
as an online hoax demonstrated this week, the lightning speed of 
the Internet can give a scam a big head start on the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	A bogus report on PairGain Technologies posted Wednesday on the  
World Wide Web boosted the company's stock price 31 percent before 
the story was debunked. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident caught the attention of regulators and reminded  
investors, especially impulsive day traders, that the speed and 
simplicity of the Internet can also wreak havoc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has become the world's largest conference call,''  
said Anthony Elgindy, an online trader who runs Pacific Equity 
Investigations, a research firm. ``And plenty of the people talking 
about stocks have hidden motives for what they're saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one yet knows the source or the motives behind the fraudulent  
report on PairGain, which appeared early Wednesday on 
Angelfire.com, a Web site that allows surfers to create personal 
Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said PairGain, a Tustin, Calif., maker of  
telecommunications equipment, would be acquired by an Israeli firm, 
ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its current market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders leapt on the hot tip, buying up shares and touting the  
stock in chat rooms run by Yahoo! The report appeared credible, 
with quotes from company officials, and the page was a near-perfect 
replica of the Web site run by financial news giant Bloomberg LP. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain shares, which closed at $8.50 Tuesday, rose as high as  
$11.12 1/2 on Wednesday before company officials confirmed the report 
was untrue and the page was yanked from the Internet. The stock 
settled back to close at $9.37 1/2, on volume of 13.7 million shares. 
On an average trading day, about 2 million shares of PairGain 
change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume Thursday was down to 1.2 million shares as PairGain  
slipped 25 cents to close at $9.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain and Bloomberg officials said Thursday that they had  
turned the matter over to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which wouldn't confirm details of any investigation. But legal 
experts said the perpetrator of the PairGain hoax could find 
himself charged with securities fraud and wire fraud, and could 
face five to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses to investors who took the bait are tough to tally.  
Dozens of stock traders lamented the hoax in postings on investment 
chat rooms, but none were forthcoming about their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	A few chastised themselves for responding so quickly to the  
PairGain rumor. ``Let's raise our requirements for allowing 
ourselves to be impressed,'' wrote one trader. ``Criminality 
deserves no admiration,'' wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet rumors spread over the Internet have been the lifeblood of  
the growing ranks of day traders, who try to make quick profits 
from the twists and turns of corporate America. News of the latest 
merger, a stunning shakeup, a strong profit report, is readily 
accessible at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
	And in chat rooms or message boards, thousands of anonymous  
traders encourage each other to buy, sell, or hold. Chief executive 
officers, waitresses and teen-agers alike can log on and offer 
investment advice without ever disclosing their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet makes people less accountable,'' said Elgindy.  
</P>
<P>
	It also makes it relatively easy to reproduce and transmit  
information, whether it's genuine or fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duplicating the look and feel of a Bloomberg news report would  
be pretty easy for any graphic designer,'' said John Delaney, 
co-chairman of the new media practice at Morrison &AMP; Foerster, a New 
York law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bloomberg spokeswoman said the company was not aware of any  
previous attempts to reproduce its site. A number of Internet 
service providers said they routinely remove pages that violate 
copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are becoming more sensitive to violations that affect  
their business and individuals are more likely to press government 
to crack down on such scams when it affects their own pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll see more cases of Internet fraud,'' Delaney  
said. ``The Web means that scoundrels are able to disseminate 
fraudulent information far more widely and much more quickly.''

<HEADLINE> LA Mayor: Our Schools Have Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city's vast school district is getting  
dumped on by an unlikely source -- the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the nation's second-largest school district a ``total  
failure,'' Mayor Richard Riordan pinned the blame on school board 
officials and urged residents to vote for candidates he supports in 
a key school board election next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two out of three kids cannot read at grade level by the end of  
third grade,'' Riordan said Wednesday during his annual 
state-of-the-city address. ``This makes my blood boil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Unified District has 700,000 students in 668  
elementary, middle and high schools. It is second in size only to 
New York City's school system. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan faulted members of the elected school board for  
stressing ``feel-good'' subjects over basic math and reading 
skills. Four of the seven board seats are up for election Tuesday, 
and Riordan asked for support for candidates he is backing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Sayles, a spokesman for district Superintendent Ruben  
Zacarias, defended the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a typical Riordan approach. He dwells on the negative,''  
Sayles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayles said third graders are behind in reading because of  
language issues, not bad teachers. Seventy-nine languages and 
dialects are spoken in Los Angeles public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the district as a whole is doing well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dropout rates are down, attendance is up and more graduates go  
on to college than the national average,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a report to be released today by the Southern  
California Association of Governments gave the region, which 
includes Los Angeles, a ``D'' in education. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was sharply critical of public schools, where 33  
percent of students fail to graduate from high school. The risk is 
that business and industry won't remain in a place where workers 
aren't prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that L.A. now has a widespread reputation for having  
a poor K-12 system must be harmful to our economic growth,'' said 
Bill Ouchi, a professor of management at the University of 
California, Los Angeles and former chief of staff to Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report blamed education problems in part on a lack of  
accountability and high teacher pay that drains funds away from the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's miraculous that we are as healthy as we are economically,  
but no one should think the quality of our schools doesn't 
matter,'' Ouchi said.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Doubtful for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eric Lindros hasn't ruled out returning  
to the Philadelphia Flyers for the NHL playoffs, though he said his 
status will be determined by what doctors say about his recovery 
from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is I don't come back until September.  
But I think because of the jump-start we had here and the good care 
here, I might be on my way back much sooner than that,'' Lindros 
said today at a news conference at Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, who was admitted last Friday, planned to check out this  
afternoon and fly back to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros appeared weak. He was pale and coughed intermittently  
during the news conference. Still, he said he is ``getting better 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His brother Brett, who has been with him since Saturday, said if  
there is any way Lindros can play and not risk further injury, he 
will. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know Eric. He always wants to play,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said Lindros will need at least 3-4 weeks to  
regenerate the blood he lost during the ordeal that began with an 
injury last Thursday in a 2-1 victory over the Nashville Predators. 
The playoffs begin April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to go with the assumption that he's not going  
to be back,'' Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said Wednesday. 
``We have to prepare that way and play that way. We can't sit and 
hope and hope and hope. With that serious an injury, who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Lindros would miss all of the playoffs or only the  
first round, Clarke said, ``When the doctors say he can play, he 
can play. That's the way it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, one of the toughest players and most dominant scorers  
in the NHL, has endured all kinds of injuries in his career. But 
this was much more serious than some of the most common maladies in 
the hard-hitting sport. His collapsed lung, which filled with about 
six pints of blood, was termed life-threatening if it hadn't been 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has said he didn't realize anything was wrong until  
several hours after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't recognize the seriousness of his injury. His pain  
threshold is so high,'' Dr. Richard Garman of the Predators said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' father and agent, Carl Lindros, said Wednesday he is  
concerned his son might feel pressure to return to the ice before 
he is physically ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to wait for the doctors to convince me that he is going  
to be playing in the near future,'' he said. ``Eric is going to 
make the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers physician Dr. Jeff Hartzell spoke with Lindros' father  
this week and reassured him nothing would be done to jeopardize his 
son's health.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Back in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros suffered a setback in his  
recovery from a collapsed lung Thursday, returning to Philadelphia 
only to learn he must go back to the hospital for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	A whirlwind day that began with Lindros being released from a  
hospital in Nashville, Tenn., turned somber when his doctor 
announced that the prolific scorer and team captain will have 
surgery Friday to drain fluid that has accumulated in his chest 
cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who is taking over Lindros'  
care, said during a news conference next to the Flyers' locker room 
that Lindros ran a fever in excess of 102 degrees Wednesday night 
and the fluid in his chest -- partly comprised of clotted blood -- 
may be infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure, known as video thoroscopy, is minor, and Lindros  
is expected to be hospitalized 4-5 days at the University of 
Pennsylvania. But the news reinforced Flyers plans to proceed into 
the playoffs as if Lindros will not be joining them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like things were going to come along quite nicely on  
their own,'' Kaiser said. ``But the film from this morning showed 
what appeared to be an increase in collection of fluid in that 
right chest. The fact that he had a fairly high fever last night -- 
well above 102, in fact -- indicated there might be something else 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, who was resting at home, shows no signs of additional  
bleeding, Kaiser said. He canceled plans to come to the arena and 
meet with teammates before the Flyers' game against Pittsburgh 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you could say he was very disappointed,'' Kaiser said.  
``He was under the impression that this was behind him and he was 
on his way home. I think he dislikes being in the hospital. He was 
clearly disappointed, but he understands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, who will perform the operation, said it involves  
inserting a tube and a microscopic camera through small incisions 
in his chest. The material and clotted blood is not the lung, but 
in the area between the lung and the diaphragm, Kaiser said. It is 
keeping the lung from expanding properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of full recovery, that remains to be determined,''  
Kaiser said. ``I expect him to be fully normal after this and be 
playing as great as he ever played. I can't give you any kind of 
time estimate. Right now, he needs to be taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors still don't know what caused about six pints of blood to  
seep into Lindros' chest after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators last Thursday. Tests showed no signs of a broken rib, so 
they believe a blood vessel ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was pale and coughing intermittently during a brief news  
conference before being released from Baptist Hospital Thursday and 
flying home to Philadelphia. He said he was ``getting better every 
day,'' but understands the seriousness of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't worry about the next game,'' the Philadelphia  
Flyers' captain and leading scorer said. ``You don't worry about 
the first round. You wonder what's going to happen in the next 
hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said Lindros needs 3-4 weeks to regenerate the  
blood he lost. He continues to insist on not having a transfusion, 
and Kaiser is following those instructions. The playoffs begin 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is I don't come back until  
September,'' Lindros said. ``But I think because of the jump-start 
we had here and the good care here, I might be on my way back much 
sooner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, one of the toughest players and most dominant scorers  
in the NHL, has endured numerous injuries during his career, though 
none as serious as this. 
</P>
<P>
	Roommate Keith Jones found him lying in the bathtub early last  
Friday and called the Flyers' training staff. Lindros was taken by 
ambulance to Baptist, where doctors found that the blood-heavy 
right lung was pushing against his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't recognize the seriousness of his injury,'' said Dr.  
Richard Garman, who works with the Predators. ``His pain threshold 
is so high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros thinks he bruised his ribs during the first period  
against the Predators. He iced the area and felt good after the 
game. The pain intensified that night, and he had trouble breathing 
when he returned to his hotel room. He tried to ease his discomfort 
by lying in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers went into Thursday night's game against Pittsburgh  
tied for fourth in the Eastern Conference. The team continues to 
assume that Lindros won't be back this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to prepare that way and play that way,'' Flyers  
general manager Bob Clarke said. ``We can't sit and hope and hope 
and hope. With that serious an injury, who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' brother, Brett, who was with him at the hospital since  
Saturday, said if there is any way Lindros can play and not risk 
further injury, he will. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always wants to play,'' Brett Lindros said.

<HEADLINE> Customs To Study Bias Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a growing chorus of racial bias  
complaints, the U.S. Customs Service created an independent panel 
Thursday to review the policies and procedures used by inspectors 
looking for airline passengers who might be smuggling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly pledged that the  
commission, composed of officials from other government agencies 
and headed by Smithsonian Institution Undersecretary Constance 
Newman, will have ``unfettered access'' to the agency's records and 
personnel during its three-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a bias exists, whether perceived or real, it is paramount  
that we find its cause and eliminate it,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who asked last month for a formal  
investigation into complaints of racial bias by inspectors at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, called the creation of 
the panel ``an important first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is happening, not just in Atlanta, but in New York  
and Chicago and other parts of the country,'' said Lewis, a veteran 
civil rights leader. ``We need to determine why so many of our 
citizens -- African Americans, Hispanics and others -- are 
complaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly insisted that racial profiling -- selecting passengers for  
search based on their race -- is not Customs policy, but, ``We want 
to see if in fact, maybe it's developed into a practice that we 
want to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, whose Justice Department is  
investigating allegations of racial profiling by three different 
state and local law enforcement agencies, told her weekly news 
conference Thursday: ``We can't duck this issue. I think it's 
important that we confront it and understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service is facing numerous lawsuits over body  
searches, including an effort by almost 100 black women to file a 
class-action suit in Chicago alleging they were singled out because 
of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officers use strip searches, body cavity searches and  
X-rays to catch smugglers who hide cocaine or heroin inside their 
clothes or swallow packets of the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 50,892 of the 71.5 million international air travelers who  
passed through Customs in 1998 were subjected to some level of body 
search, most of them simple pat-downs, Customs officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 43.3 percent of those subjected to body searches or  
X-rays last year were black or Hispanic, Customs statistics show. 
Drugs were found on 6.3 percent of the blacks searched, 2.8 percent 
of Hispanics and 6.7 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named to the commission were Robin Renee Sanders, the  
National Security Council's director for Africa; and Ana Marie 
Salazar, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug enforcement 
policy and support. Both Sanders, who is black, and Salazar, who is 
Hispanic, said they have had personal experiences with Customs 
officials during border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford Cloud Jr., president of the National Conference for  
Community and Justice, was named the commission's independent 
advisor.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Pork Board Too Close to Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government audit raises questions about the  
close ties between a quasi-governmental board created to promote 
pork and the industry's trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	But the audit by the Agriculture Department's inspector general  
found no evidence the National Pork Board misused dollars collected 
from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our evaluation showed that the board basically used checkoff  
funds to finance pork promotion, research and consumer education 
projects,'' inspector general Roger Viadero wrote in an audit 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers contribute 45 cents of every $100 of animal value  
for a federally mandated checkoff fund. The money goes to the 
board, which later contracts promotion services through the 
National Pork Producers Council, the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	While the audit did not find ``misuse or loss of checkoff  
funds,'' the report concluded the board ``has relinquished too much 
authority to its primary contractor,'' the council, and ``has 
placed the NPPC in a position to exert undue influence over board 
budgets and grant proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The board has awarded all program grants to the NPPC since  
1996,'' Viadero wrote, recommending the board take actions to 
``accomplish appropriate separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council officials said the inspector general's concerns were  
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really stands out about this report is that it shows we  
did nothing wrong,'' NPPC President John McNutt said during a 
teleconference with the board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Viadero ``wants to dramatically change a well  
established and well functioning organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``An arm's length relationship does exist between the National  
Pork Board and the NPPC,'' said Greg Boerboom, a producer from 
Marshall, Minn., who is chairman of the board's budget committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit comes amid a movement by some pork producers for a  
referendum on whether the checkoff should be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing separating the NPPC from the pork board except  
a couple of inches of Sheetrock. It says we're justified,'' Rhonda 
Perry, a Missouri organizer of the anti-checkoff effort, said about 
the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The board rents space in the council's Des Moines, Iowa,  
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said the group would announce next week it has enough  
signatures to force a vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, made up of 15 producers appointed by the agriculture  
secretary, was created by Congress 12 years ago to strengthen pork 
industry promotion. Last year, the program collected $47.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar programs are in place for other products such as beef,  
almonds and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems cited in the audit is that the board, with  
its staff of two, is understaffed and too reliant on the council to 
handle its duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board's dependence on the NPPC to administer subcontracts  
and carry out much of the board's work resulted in a weakened 
accountability over contributed funds,'' the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general recommended that USDA officials work with  
the board to develop a plan to ``accomplish appropriate 
separation'' from NPPC, including providing sufficient staff and 
accountability checks.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu, Parents Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu reached a  
financial agreement with her father and dissolved a protective 
order against him, ending a public family squabble. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed Thursday by Family Law Judge Patricia  
Lykos, was kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult time for my family, and I  
hope that we can now begin to move forward in support of one 
another,'' the 17-year-old gymnast said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that deep down my father loves me, and of course I love  
him, so I need to find a way in my heart to give him forgiveness. I 
hope there is a chance that some day things in my family can be 
normal again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family fight erupted publicly last October, when Dominique  
sued for her independence, saying her father, Dumitru Moceanu, had 
squandered the money she had earned in a 10-year professional 
career. She was declared a legal adult Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father has said all of his daughter's earnings went into  
building a 70,000-square-foot gym with Dominique's blessings. He 
has refused to say how much the gym cost, but his attorney 
Katherine Scardino said it was about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique sought and won a court order on Dec. 9 that kept her  
father at least 500 feet away after police said they were 
investigating Dumitru, 44, for allegedly trying to hire killers to 
murder two of his daughter's friends. He denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique's parents could not be reached by The Associated  
Press.

<HEADLINE> Terror Strikes East Timor Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIQUICA, Indonesia (AP) -- The church was no sanctuary. Neither  
was the priest's house, where for all their scrubbing, nuns had yet 
to wash away all the blood on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after pro-Indonesian militiamen invaded a church  
complex in East Timor, shooting and cutting down villagers, the 
massacre site was abandoned save for a few grazing goats and half a 
dozen nuns. 
</P>
<P>
	But witness accounts Thursday made vivid the scenes of slaughter  
at the compound in Liquica, where religious leaders say at least 25 
people died and dozens were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors' tales also implicated the hundreds of Indonesian  
police and soldiers who were there. Rather than trying to stop the 
carnage, the police allegedly participated in the hunt. Military 
commanders have denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	The military, which invaded East Timor in 1975, has long been  
accused of human rights abuses in its efforts to wipe out 
pro-independence rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia reversed its policy of sovereignty over the former  
Portuguese colony earlier this year, and has said it will let go of 
the territory if its people turn down an autonomy offer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, escalating violence between supporters and opponents of  
independence threatens to undermine a vote on the autonomy 
proposal, planned for July. Separatists suspect Indonesia is trying 
to sabotage the vote by arming civilian militias. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence started shortly before noon Tuesday, when hundreds  
of civilian fighters who want Indonesia to keep control of East 
Timor swarmed into Liquica, attacking villagers suspected of being 
pro-independence activists. 
</P>
<P>
	They quickly converged outside the church, where up to 2,000  
people, including children and the elderly, had sought shelter, 
according to parish priest Rafael dos Santos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get out of the church!'' shouted the members of Red and White  
Iron, a militia group that separatist activists say has received 
weapons and training from the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, terrified women were reluctant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to leave because we thought the men who were  
left behind would be killed,'' said 27-year-old Emilita Mendes, who 
has been hiding in a Liquica house since the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, tension exploded into mayhem. As security forces stood by,  
Mendes and other witnesses said, militiamen ran into the church 
grounds and slashed at victims who scrambled to get away. Gunshots 
boomed as the injured screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio dos Santos, a 22-year-old church worker, escaped  
unharmed. A militiaman who had often attended Mass recognized him 
and told his buddies: ``This is my friend. Don't do anything to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic priest, Rafael dos Santos, said God saved him. A  
fighter tried to shoot him, but the faulty gun only delivered a 
click. Frustrated, the assailant picked up a rock and hurled it at 
the priest, who is no relation to Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	By this time, many villagers had fled from the church to the  
priest's house. According to Rafael dos Santos, police fired shots 
and lobbed tear gas grenades at his home and militiamen with clubs 
pounded those who stumbled out teary-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Francisco de Jesus, a 25-year-old electrician  
whose head was covered with bloody gauze Thursday as he recovered 
in a clinic in Dili, East Timor's capital, 18 miles east of 
Liquica. He escaped because a policeman who knew him ushered him to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Many witnesses said security forces also shot and beat victims  
at the church, which sits just 100 yards from a military office. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's military chief, Col. Tono Suratman, promised to  
investigate the reports but insisted soldiers had been trying to 
separate the two sides. Earlier this week, he said, troops killed 
two separatists who shot at them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday that  
Indonesia had responded positively to a call for an inquiry into 
the alleged massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckhard, speaking at U.N. headquarters in New York, said he had  
no details on how Indonesia conveyed its position or when any such 
investigation may be carried. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, about 2,000 militiamen, some accused of taking part  
in Tuesday's massacre, rallied at Maliana, a town 70 miles west of 
Liquica. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandishing swords, iron bars and other homemade weapons, they  
vowed to step up their fight against separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be ready whenever the attack comes,'' militia  
commander Joao da Silva Tavares told the gathering. ``Prepare 
yourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though nuns have been scrubbing hard in dos Santos' house,  
dried blood still spatters the floors, walls and the side of a jeep 
outside. Broken glass is everywhere. Bullet holes pepper the 
ceiling where attackers fired at people hidden in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said men with swords gutted two people, including a  
chief from the nearby village of Dato, in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also blood and clumps of matted hair on a wall of the  
church and several long tracks of blood on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's spiritual leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bishop  
Carlos Belo, said the military had told him 25 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dili-based human rights group, Yayasan Hak, estimated from  
witness accounts that 52 people were killed, their bodies dumped at 
sea or in a nearby lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group, Solidamor, released a list of 42 dead. Among them  
were 23 children, including 11 girls aged between 1 and 14.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Jim Callan's childhood dream of becoming  
a priest nearly evaporated when he refused to wear a Roman collar. 
In his view, the neckbands serve only to place the clergy on a 
pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They almost didn't ordain me,'' he said, looking back to the  
issue that, 25 years later, hardly seems inflammatory. ``They felt 
that that was a sign of deeper things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was. ``I just didn't tell them,'' Callan said, loosing his  
infectious laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	To win over his superiors, he agreed to wear the black-and-white  
collar for hospital visits and funerals only. 
</P>
<P>
	Callan succeeded like few other young pastors in returning Roman  
Catholics to the fold. In 22 years at Corpus Christi Church in 
downtown Rochester, his congregation swelled from 200 to more than 
3,000 by last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	How could a priest like this lose his church? What could make a  
pastor who was so popular among his congregants lose favor with the 
Catholic hierarchy? Why was Father Jim Callan excommunicated? 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by the gospel of Matthew, Callan made ``uplifting the  
poor'' the cornerstone of his ministry. He opened a free health 
center, a homeless shelter, halfway houses for former convicts, a 
hospice and even a clinic in Haiti. He set aside 12 percent of the 
weekly collection for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reaching people who are not in the pews, who will never be in  
the pews: That's really at the heart of Catholicism, but it isn't 
always encouraged by Catholic practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callan also began bending rules to make each worshipper in the  
pews feel equally welcome, not least single parents, mixed-faith 
couples, homosexuals and others ``who have been really hurt by 
society and by the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a need in every organization for a group at the  
edge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For him, that meant testing the church's boundaries on  
sacraments and liturgy: allowing women priestlike roles on the 
altar, inviting non-Catholics to share Holy Communion and, starting 
in 1993, blessing gay unions off church grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of Vatican warnings, Callan was reassigned to a  
small-town parish in September and in December was suspended by his 
western New York diocese for persevering with practices contrary to 
church law. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwilling to fall back into line, Callan accepted an invitation  
from his former parishioners to join them in ``alternate worship'' 
at various Protestant churches while they searched out a permanent 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no small flock: 1,400 people thronged a Christmas Eve  
Mass, and the weekly audience easily outnumbers those who stayed 
loyal to Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
	Punishment came swiftly in February: Callan and any Catholic who  
joined the newly christened New Faith Community were declared to 
have excommunicated themselves for starting their own church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very sad time for me,'' reflected Callan, 51,  
sitting in his sparsely furnished apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catholic means universal, all-embracing, all-encompassing, and  
we just tried to make the church what its name means,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Matthew Clark of the Rochester-area diocese, a moderate  
in an increasingly conservative Catholic hierarchy, acknowledged 
sharing with Callan ``a lot of common values and sympathies.'' But 
change can only come by consensus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of leeway here within which to live the church's  
life but, like any other organization, there are some limits and 
those limits need to be observed,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need always, and very critically, to challenge ourselves  
about what we look like to people, especially people who may be 
fragile or vulnerable or hurting in any way. But if you stop there, 
something's missing. ... Part of our work as a parish church is to 
gradually and lovingly acquaint people with our tradition, which is 
never contradictory to hospitality and healing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Tom Reese, editor of America magazine, a Jesuit weekly,  
said the issues Callan supporters pushed for seemed more important 
to them than union with the larger church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to debate these things,'' he said. ``It's  
another thing to unilaterally change them on your own. Other people 
are more willing to compromise or live with some ambiguity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Peg Rubley, 49, a divorced Catholic who joined Callan's  
church 16 years ago, the bureaucracy cannot define who she is. 
``Any organized religion is only there to be a vehicle, to help you 
get to know God and yourself and love your neighbor,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Callan, a child of the '60s, civil disobedience was always a  
legitimate way to force social change. He was jailed for five days 
in 1972 for protesting the Vietnam War. Soon after being ordained 
in 1974, he was suspended for two months for refusing to live in a 
new rectory he considered too luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
	Callan has seen the church adopt some of the ideas he pushed --  
such as altar girls. Despite Pope John Paul II's resistance, he 
thinks inter-Communion among Christian denominations and the 
ordination of women are inevitable, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He even expects to be welcomed back into the church. But he  
acknowledges, ``It might take 10 to 20 years.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers in Shepard Case Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A judge slapped a gag order Thursday on  
lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they 
``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the  
media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more 
difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge 
Barton R. Voigt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers  
representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the  
death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured 
from a bar in October and beaten to death. He received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying  
him to a fence, but said he tried to intervene to prevent McKinney 
from inflicting a more severe beating. McKinney, who has yet to be 
tried, then struck Henderson in the face, said Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson  
fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies  
of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney, 
drawing another round of criticism from Custis. 
</P>
<P>
	To stop the banter, Voigt banned attorneys, their assistants,  
law enforcement and court personnel from making comments or 
disseminating information to the media.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal panel studying gambling seems  
largely united against ``convenience gambling'' -- via the Internet, 
or on slot machines in supermarkets -- and against slot machines at 
racetracks, bars and food stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of the nine-member National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission attending a meeting here Wednesday seemed to agree on an 
overriding goal of maintaining gambling as a destination activity -- 
a reason to travel to places like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are wide divisions among commission members on the  
overall tone of the report they are drafting for Congress, the 
president, state governments and tribal governments on the economic 
and social impacts of legalized gambling. After two years of work, 
they face a June 18 deadline to submit that report. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting that began Wednesday was billed as a session  
of the panel's three-member report subcommittee. But with the 
commission nearing its final report, six of the nine commissioners 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners reached some consensus regarding pari-mutuel  
betting -- betting on horse and dog racing and jai-alai -- that 
betting from home is a problem and that 21 should be the minimum 
age to wager at tracks, up from 18 in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	On state lotteries, commissioners generally agreed that states  
should spend more on addiction treatment and education programs, 
that lotteries should not branch into ``casino-type activities'' 
such as video poker, that advertising should be restrained and that 
lotteries should examine whether their marketing targets poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	As for casinos, commissioners voiced concern about the easy  
availability of credit and alcohol to gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's topics were to include Internet gambling, advertising,  
Indian gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling by minors, economic 
development and crime.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Shortstop Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Mariners All-Star shortstop Alex  
Rodriguez, who hurt himself during an agility exercise in spring 
training, underwent knee surgery Thursday and will miss 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went fine,'' Mariners medical director Dr. Larry  
Pedegana said in a statement released by the team. ``The surgery 
went as expected and Alex is already home resting and getting ready 
to start his rehabilitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pedegana repaired a torn medial meniscus in Rodriguez's left  
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez played the first two games of the season for the  
Mariners and went 0-for-6. He left Tuesday's game early and did not 
play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest obstacle in my career,'' Rodriguez told  
The Seattle Times. ``I'll overcome it. I'll work hard and overcome 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez hurt himself while doing an exercise that involves  
jumping over boxes that are about as high as a chair. He hurt 
himself March 30 in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners haven't put Rodriguez on the disabled list. They're  
expected to do it before Friday night's game with Oakland when they 
make a roster move to replace Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rodriguez sidelined, Carlos Guillen will move to shortstop  
and utility player David Bell will start at second. Guillen was 
supposed to be Seattle's second baseman this season.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China: No Deal on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China have been unable  
to resolve differences on eliminating Chinese trade barriers, an 
administration official said today. That makes it unlikely that 
U.S. approval for China's membership in the World Trade 
Organization will come during Premier Zhu Rongji's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
United States had achieved one of its major objectives -- a separate 
deal with China, effective immediately, to remove barriers to the 
sale of American beef, wheat and citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade negotiators from both countries were continuing their  
separate talks even as Clinton and Zhu met at the White House. But 
the White House official said it appeared unlikely that all the 
gaps could be closed in time for Clinton and Zhu to announce a deal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood, we will reaffirm we have made some  
significant progress towards a strong agreement, but we have some 
gaps on some important issues. We will commit to resolving those 
issues to conclude a strong agreement that will let China into the 
WTO,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to achieve a full agreement today would represent a  
major disappointment for China, which has been trying for 13 years 
to win membership in the WTO or its predecessor organization, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	China needs approval from the United States and other major  
trading powers for membership, but the administration has insisted 
it will not drop its objections until China agrees to a sweeping 
market-opening document. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sees these high trade barriers as a chief  
reason for America's soaring trade deficit with China, which last 
year hit a record $57 billion, the largest for any nation except 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations for a deal had grown in the past two weeks as China  
agreed to a number of U.S. demands after years of foot-dragging. 
However, there were areas where China's market-opening offers did 
not meet U.S. demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was fearful that without the strongest deal  
possible it would be hard to get congressional approval, especially 
in the current climate of tense U.S.-Chinese relations. Members of 
Congress are upset over allegations of Chinese thefts of American 
nuclear secrets as well as a recent crackdown on dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement scheduled to be announced today on agriculture  
products will not be contingent on China's gaining entry into the 
WTO, the administration said. 
</P>
<P>
	China agreed to lift its bans on shipments of wheat from the  
Pacific Northwest and citrus from Florida, Texas and California. 
</P>
<P>
	China had imposed long-standing bans on these products on the  
grounds of worries about plant diseases. U.S. producers, however, 
have long complained that the bans were not based on sound science 
but were hidden trade barriers. The Chinese also agreed to 
eliminate burdensome inspection requirements that had severely 
restricted the amount of U.S. beef that could be sold in China. 
</P>
<P>
	China also agreed to separate deals covering aviation and made  
moves earlier in the week to open up its vast telecommunications 
and insurance markets to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On aviation, China agreed to a deal that will double the  
frequency of flights between the United States and China. The 
agreement will add one new American airline and one Chinese airline 
to the three from each nation that currently have permission to fly 
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in McDougal Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Signaling that Susan McDougal's  
testimony made a deep impression, the jury deliberating her fate 
asked the presiding judge whether they may consider that she had 
good reason to refuse to answer questions in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	A note from the jury focused on a possible ``innocent reason''  
for Mrs. McDougal's refusal to testify, even though she may have 
acted ``willfully'' in violating a court order directing her to 
cooperate with grand juries in 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	During five days on the witness stand, Mrs. McDougal said she  
feared Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr would charge her with 
perjury unless she falsely implicated President Clinton and his 
wife in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos said that ``obviously'' the jurors,  
who began deliberations Thursday, ``are having trouble with the 
issues. That would lead me to believe they are split in some 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I have seen today has been negative for us,'' Geragos  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett said he wasn't surprised by the jurors'  
question. ``It's reassuring that they are focusing on the key 
issues,'' he said. The jury resumes deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Wednesday, Geragos told the panel that Mrs.  
McDougal had an ``innocent reason'' for not answering grand jury 
questions, saying Starr's tactics were ``something you expect to 
see in the Third Reich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. tossed the question back  
in the jury's lap, referring the panel to the instructions he read 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal would be guilty of criminal contempt if she  
``willfully'' violated a court order to testify and did not act 
``by accident, mistake or other innocent reason,'' the judge 
instructed. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard also stated that Mrs. McDougal's defense that Starr was  
trying to get her to lie could not be applied to criminal contempt 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Barrett said ``innocent reason'' does not  
include the fact that a defendant does not like the prosecutor. 
Prosecutor Julie Myers portrayed Mrs. McDougal as a chronic liar 
and publicity-seeker who refused to testify because she hated 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal sentencing guidelines, if convicted, Mrs. McDougal  
faces roughly 27 months in prison on each of three charges -- two 
counts of criminal contempt and one of obstruction.

<HEADLINE> Baker Wants To Play for Auburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Robert Baker, the former Auburn wide  
receiver who spent 10 months in jail for drug trafficking, is back 
in school and has asked about playing football again, The 
Huntsville Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	New football coach Tommy Tuberville said it was unlikely Baker  
would be allowed to return, but did not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, convicted last May of cocaine trafficking, was released  
on parole March 22 after serving less than a year of his 15-year 
sentence. He has since enrolled in school and asked Tuberville 
about playing football again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going there right now,'' Tuberville told the  
newspaper. ``I encouraged Robert to get back in school and get on 
with his life. I told him he should be visible in the community and 
show people he is a good citizen. I told him he should think about 
all of his options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 23, led the Tigers with 1,174 all-purpose yards in 1996,  
including 526 yards receiving and five touchdowns. That was the 
last season he played football. He was academically ineligible in 
1997 and in jail during the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was arrested last April for selling cocaine to undercover  
police officers three times. According to arrest reports, the third 
deal was for 111.26 grams of cocaine valued at $5,000 that Baker 
sold for $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested after that sale and offered assistance that  
resulted in the drug-trafficking arrests of Derrick Prince, 21, 
Rahshun Paige, 18, and Jordan Brumbaugh, 18.

<HEADLINE> Two Immigrants Die of Cold in Ariz. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The bodies of two more suspected illegal  
immigrants have been found in the rural Southwest, raising the toll 
from a weekend snow storm to at least 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Lopez, 30, of Santa Ana, Mexico, and Cesar Fernandez, 44,  
of Hermosillo, Mexico, died of exposure, the Pima County Medical 
Examiner's Office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight suspected illegal immigrants died of hypothermia being  
caught in the storm late last week. Officials from the U.S. Border 
Control and other agencies rescued more than 50 immigrants Thursday 
and Friday in and around the Cleveland National Forest, about 40 
miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men who died in Arizona were among at least three who  
crossed the border together over the weekend but split up as they 
grew sick from the cold, Sheriff's Sgt. Brad Foust said. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol agents caught one and returned him to Mexico.  
Border Patrol spokesman Rob Daniels said the man made no mention of 
his companions. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families called to inquire about their relatives,  
leading to discovery of their bodies.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Hunt for New Pesticide / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Along California's central coast, Carolee  
Bull dips the roots of strawberries in a gooey fondue of fungi and 
microbes, then plants them in soil blended with a grainy corn 
powder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plastic mulch, the patented biological recipe goes to  
work, trying to control weeds and attack pests and any diseases 
they may carry. 
</P>
<P>
	In fields, labs and greenhouses across the country, scientists  
are searching for an alternative to methyl bromide, the 
ozone-stripping pesticide that must be phased out in industrialized 
countries by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	With financial incentives high, many involved in the research  
are confident more than one substitute will split the market that 
will replace the multimillion-dollar methyl bromide industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is going to own that market. There'll be chemical  
alternatives. There'll be biological alternatives. There'll be a 
host of players,'' said Blaine Vice, president of San Diego-based 
Soil Technology Inc., one of the many companies hunting for an 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything they come up with is sure to be a tough sell. Even with  
the ban still nearly six years away, many stubborn farmers cling to 
the notion that nothing can replace the pesticide they have been 
relying on for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a position that Dave Riggs, president of the California  
Strawberry Commission, defends, saying most methods being pitched 
``just aren't workable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of stuff that looks good on paper,'' Riggs said.  
``In reality, for most operations, it's not very feasible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Methyl bromide, an odorless, colorless gas, is used worldwide,  
mostly in North America, as a soil and structural fumigant and a 
post-harvest storage treatment and to control a variety of pests. 
Growers in the United States use 43 million pounds each year, 
mainly for California strawberries and Florida tomatoes, at a cost 
of about $1 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Clean Air Act, the pesticide had initially been  
scheduled for a 2001 phaseout in the United States because its 
potential to deplete the ozone layer was far above national limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress later amended the schedule so the pesticide will be  
reduced 25 percent this year, 50 percent in 2001 and 70 percent in 
2003 and banned by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of public and private dollars are being spent on a  
hodgepodge of experiments to find an alternative. The U.S. 
Agriculture Department alone is putting aside more than $14 million 
this year for roughly 50 projects in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The main chemical alternatives being tested, either alone or in  
concert, include 1,3 dichloro-propene (better known by the brand 
name of Telone), chloropricrin, metam sodium and methyl iodide. 
Nonchemical methods include crop rotation, steam, solarization and 
use of organic matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Telone is among the most promising options, but it is already  
strictly regulated and could face even tougher scrutiny down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most likely alternatives we have right now are alternate  
chemical fumigants. They fit in best with current production 
schemes,'' said Roy Gingery, a national program leader overseeing 
the methyl bromide studies for USDA's research arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Solarization has worked well on strawberries in California's  
Central Valley, where summer temperatures that soar above 100 
degrees can cook the soil enough to kill pathogens and weeds 
without hurting yield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing results that are within 5 percent of methyl  
bromide,'' said Husein Ajwa, a USDA soil scientist leading various 
experiments over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the coast, where most of the nation's strawberries grow  
but where the sun isn't nearly as hot, scientists are focusing on 
other alternatives.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Athletes Can't Get Diplomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Minnesota basketball teams' scholarship athletes  
have the worst record of earning diplomas in the Big 10 Conference, 
an analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
	One in four freshmen recruited from 1983 to 1991 eventually  
graduated from the university, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press 
reported today. The average for Big Ten basketball programs over 
the same period was about one in two, the newspaper reported in an 
examination of NCAA data. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate analysis, the Pioneer Press found that only two of  
21 students linked to alleged academic fraud in the basketball 
program have received degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has hired two law firms to investigate claims by  
Jan Gangelhoff, a former office worker and tutor, that she did 
about 400 pieces of course work for players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff was scheduled to go over some of that work today with  
investigators. The Pioneer Press also reported that new computer 
files it received from her bore the name of Charles Thomas, a 
member of the 1997 Final Four team; his name had not been connected 
to the allegations previously. Thomas declined comment when reached 
by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff's allegations in March resulted in the suspension of  
four members of this season's basketball team, including two 
starters, right before the Golden Gophers' first-round NCAA game, a 
loss to Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported earlier that the  
grade-point average of Minnesota's men's basketball teams has 
trailed the average of other men's teams at the university over the 
past 15 years. The newspaper also reported the basketball team's 
average six-year graduation rate of about 25 percent was well below 
the Division I basketball average of about 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press' report today explored graduation rates in  
more detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Under coach Clem Haskins, who was hired in 1986, the Gophers'  
graduation rate declined slightly in comparison to three previous 
years. The grad rate for freshmen entering from 1986 to 1991 was 23 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State and Northwestern graduated 80 percent or more of  
their freshmen basketball players during the same period. The 
average at other Big Ten schools ranged from 31 percent to 74 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WCCO-TV examined graduation rates for freshmen basketball  
players who entered Minnesota from 1988 to 1991, and reported 
Wednesday night that they graduated at a rate of 27 percent 
compared with 41 percent of all Division I men's basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is disturbing,'' university President Mark Yudof told the  
Pioneer Press. ``We are going to have to look at this 
intensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said the university has raised admission standards that  
might affect the graduation rate in the future, but results 
wouldn't be expected to show up until after the year 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press examined nine years of data collected by the  
NCAA. Athletes who transferred to other schools were counted as not 
graduating from their original university.

	Dow Closes at Record 10,197.70  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher today, lifting the Dow  
Jones industrial average to another record high, as a drop in 
interest rates eased investor fears about U.S. earnings reports. At 
the close the Dow was up 112.39 at 10,197.70. It was the Dow's 
third record close this week. Broader stock indicators also closed 
higher. The Nasdaq composite index was up 28.96 at 2,573.39, a new 
high, despite a lackluster performance from stalwarts Dell and 
Intel. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also reached new high, rising 
17.11 to 1,344.00.

	Financial, Dow Stocks Do Well  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial stocks, which are sensitive to changes  
in interest rates, rose on the expectation that the cut by the 
British central bank would help keep U.S. rates low as well. 
Citigroup rose 1 5/16 to 73 and American Express advanced 2 1/2 at 128 
15/16. Both are Dow components. Stocks of Dow companies with a big 
international presence rose moderately, including Coca-Cola, up 1 
15/16 to 60 7/8, and drug giant Merck, up 1 7/16 to 81 5/8. Technology 
stocks fluctuated through the day as traders were encouraged by a 
strong Yahoo! earnings report late yesterday, but remained cautious 
about other company earnings. Yahoo! fell 1 3/4 to 206 11/16 after 
running up sharply earlier in the week. On the Nasdaq, Dell 
Computer fell 1 7/16 to 45 and Intel fell 1 1/16 to 131 1/16, as 
some high-tech stocks dropped in response to a disappointing 
earnings outlook from Advanced Micro Devices, which fell 5/8 to 15 
9/16.

	U.S., China: No Deal on Trade  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China failed to reach  
final agreement today on a market-opening deal that would have 
cleared the way for China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization. Both nations pledged to complete work by the end of 
the year. President Clinton, speaking after discussions with 
Premier Zhu Rongji, said both sides had made ``significant 
progress'' in clearing away the barriers to China's entry into the

trade talks in late November. Clinton, however, did announce a 
separate deal in which China agreed to remove barriers to the sale 
of American beef, wheat and citrus.

	Boeing Employment Down 5.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- New figures from Boeing Co. show a 5.4 percent  
drop in companywide employment so far this year, reducing the 
number of workers at the troubled aerospace giant from 231,260 down 
to 218,700 workers as of April 1. The biggest declines came from 
the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, which had 108,300 workers 
April 1, down 7.9 percent from 117,590 at the end of 1998. 
Washington state employment for Seattle-based Boeing stands at 
90,400 people -- down 8.2 percent from the year-end total of 98,440.

<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. said today it will  
supply the Japanese Navy with eight more missile launch systems 
under a $70 million contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. 
Lockheed Martin has been supplying the MK 41 launch systems for 
Japanese destroyers since 1989. The Japanese government decided 
last year to double the number of MK 41 launchers on its 
Muarasame-class ships from two to four. Each launcher can hold up 
to eight missiles. Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., is the 
largest defense contractor in the United States. Lockheed Martin 
stock was up 11/16 at 37.

	BMW To Make Cars at Russian Plant  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- BMW plans to make limousines and off-road vehicles  
at a Russian factory in the republic of Kaliningrad, the German 
automaker said today. The first cars are expected to roll off the 
assembly line this summer from the Avtotor plant, said Lueder 
Paysen, head of BWM's executive sales division. The announcement 
came the same day that the Russian government sought to assure 
Western businesses that Moscow's protests against NATO raids on 
Yugoslavia wouldn't hurt their operations in Russia. The Avtotor 
plant will have an annual production capacity of 10,000 units, but 
no date has been set for reaching this target.

	European Bank Cuts Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank cut key  
interest rates by one-half percentage point today to 2.5 percent in 
the first reduction since the euro currency was launched Jan. 1. 
The rate reduction, which affects the 11 nations that adopted the 
euro, exceeded analysts' expectations. Weak economic data released 
earlier today in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, had bolstered 
expectations that the central bank would cut interest rates. 
Analysts were expecting a cut of a quarter of a percentage point, 
matching the move earlier today by the Bank of England which 
trimmed its base lending rate to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent.

	Humana Expects Lower Earnings  
</P>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Shares of Humana Inc. plummeted today  
after the health maintenance organization warned that higher 
medical costs would mean lower-than-expected earnings for the first 
quarter. The company said operating earnings will be between 20 
cents and 24 cents per share for the first quarter. Wall Street 
analysts were expecting 34 cents, according to a survey by First 
Call. Humana said it will record $90 million in additional medical 
claims expenses during the first quarter, largely because the HMO 
will have to pay considerably higher rates to hospital chain 
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. as part of a new contract in Florida. 
Humana shares were down 4 at 12 3/16.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices rallied today, pushing the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index to its highest level in more than a year. The 
dollar drifted lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 292.19 points,  
or 1.77 percent, to close at 16,846.69 -- its fourth straight day of 
gains and the highest close since March 26, 1998, when it finished 
at 16,980.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.76 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.02 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New 
York level of 121.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese shares were buoyed ahead of the settlement of April  
stock option contracts on Friday, along with continued buying 
interest from foreign investors and some domestic institutions, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreigners are still coming in steadily and I think domestic  
institutions, on balance, are net buyers,'' said Chuck Lambert, 
market analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest gainers were shares of computer software  
wholesaler Softbank Corp. and its over-the-counter market 
affiliate, Yahoo Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank soared $16.60, or 12 percent, to close at $151.70.  
Yahoo Japan skyrocketed $83,333, or 32 percent, to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo Japan's gains came after parent company Yahoo! Inc.  
reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended March 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market fell in early trading on profit-taking, but  
quickly climbed back into positive territory with active buying of 
steel and information-technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading volume was heavy, with about 826 million shares changing  
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's turnover of 709 
million shares. Advancers outnumbered declines 882 to 351, with 95 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent, to 1,345.07 
points. The TOPIX had closed up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar stayed in a narrow range,  
jostled by profit-taking and position adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no big players today, although some Japanese life  
insurance companies started buying at the 121.20 yen level,'' said 
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.57 yen and 121.63 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.40 yen, up from  
130.20 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.600 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.685 
percent, pushing its price up to 101.74 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gun Owners Sue Over Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gun club patrons have gone to court for the right  
to shoot at images of Adolf Hitler and other people during target 
practice, which is banned at some clubs by a new state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first time in United States history that there has  
been an attempt to censor images printed on targets,'' said Stephen 
Halbrook, a lawyer for the Gun Owners Action League. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applies only to gun clubs that allow unlicensed gun  
enthusiasts to practice with semiautomatic and assault weapons 
without supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, GOAL asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr.  
to stop the implementation of the law approved in October. Halbrook 
argued that telling target shooters what they can and cannot aim at 
violates their right to free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Shooting at an image of Hitler ``is a political message  
protected by the First Amendment,'' Halbrook said, comparing it to 
burning draft cards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant Attorney General Edward DeAngelo defended the law.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about targets shaped like human bodies,'' he  
said. ``By shooting at them, they're practicing to shoot at 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelo also argued that the gun owners did not show that  
shooting at targets such as those depicting Hitler constitutes 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Toole did not immediately issue a ruling.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Return to Tokyo Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- While the economy remains in tatters and companies  
have announced extensive cutbacks, Japan's stock market has, 
somehow, become one of the world's strongest. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to a buying binge by foreign investors, Japan's  
Nikkei 225 stock average has surged almost 22 percent so far this 
year. Its finish Thursday at 16,846.69 marked a fourth straight day 
of gains and left the key indicator up more than 3,000 points this 
year and at its the highest close since March 26, 1998, when it 
finished at 16,980.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Although unemployment has climbed to a postwar high and  
consumers remain stubbornly tight-fisted, the bullish investors say 
there are reasons to believe the worst of Japan's struggle with 
recession may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent government efforts to mend banks, they say, could finally  
make the long-ailing institutions strong again, and a series of 
steps by firms to overhaul their operations could put them on the 
road to higher profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound to good to be true?  
</P>
<P>
	Some cautious investors think it might be.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Callender, a fund manager for Invesco Asset Management in  
Tokyo, argues that the gap between expectations and reality has 
grown too wide. And he's waiting for more proof that companies are 
serious about cost-cutting before committing more money to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being skeptical about the Japanese stock market and economy  
over the last five to eight years has proven to be the correct 
thing to do,'' he said. ``We just need further evidence 
restructuring is going to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caution, however, is not the byword in the market these days.  
</P>
<P>
	Although stocks have been rising for most of the year, the rally  
really picked up steam from March 5, a day after Japanese banks 
formally applied for government funds as part of program to clean 
up bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been hobbled by $596 billion in bad loans,  
and investors had been worried that the problem would hamper any 
attempts to pull the economy out of its tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move to use taxpayer money to address the problem  
convinced a lot of investors that banks could soon recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since March 5, market sentiment has changed dramatically,''  
said Kiyoshi Kimura, a stock strategist in Tokyo for Societe 
Generale Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the new optimism would fuel the first stage of ``a  
very long-term bull trend'' for the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stock funds gained an average of 15 percent in the  
first quarter of this year, far better than any of the other seven 
categories of international mutual funds tracked by the Morningstar 
research service. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust growth has been driven by buying from foreign  
investors who had mostly steered clear of Japanese stocks in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners bought more Japanese stocks than they sold for five  
straight months through February and reports for March are expected 
to show an additional $8 billion in purchases, according to the 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's biggest business daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Flush with profits from the long run-up on Wall Street, many  
U.S. investors have begun looking for other places to park some 
money, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are betting that the long economic slump has given  
companies the push they needed to implement sweeping reforms and 
restore profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics giant NEC Corp. recently announced it would cut  
15,000 jobs over the next three years to lower costs. Sony Corp. 
and Toshiba Corp. announced similar cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the conservative Mitsubishi Electric Corp. recently  
unveiled plans to trim jobs and unprofitable business lines, saying 
it aims to greatly boost its profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	But previous corporate-restructuring drives have left many  
investors disappointed and skeptics say its too early to tell if 
the latest round of announcements will be followed with real 
reforms and increased profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's crisis is so profound that most of the companies that  
are restructuring are doing so for survival,'' said Cristophe 
Aurand, Chief Investment Officer for Gamma Asset Management in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next stage will be to see whether they can continue to  
restructure in order to make more money for their shareholders, but 
there is no evidence of that yet.''

<HEADLINE> Gophers Coach Haskins Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The words sounded almost desperate when  
trouble came, a proud man clinging to his carefully built 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you know me, what I stand for as a man, as a person?''  
Clem Haskins said on the night he was confronted with accusations 
of academic fraud in his basketball program at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's claims by a former tutor, and accusations since  
then that Haskins gave hundreds of dollars to a former player, have 
tarnished the character and threatened the career of an old-school 
coach who only two years ago was held up as a model for winning the 
``right way'' in the murky world of big-time college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of Haskins' program is expected to take  
several months, but speculation is rampant that it could end with 
the university seeking a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins declined to return several telephone calls in  
preparation for this story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope somewhere in this whole thing the people of Minnesota  
remember he did a lot of positive things,'' said Butch Moening, who 
coached former Gophers star Sam Jacobson at Park High School and 
now is athletic director there. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins came to Minnesota after another NCAA probe in 1986.  
While the program he left behind at Western Kentucky became the 
subject of another investigation in 1988, Haskins rebuilt the 
crippled Golden Gophers on the strength of his no-nonsense 
personality and his ability to coax the most out of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month's accusations suggest plenty of gray area in the  
world of right and wrong that Haskins espoused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very surprised if this is true in its entirety,'' said  
Western Kentucky sports information director Paul Just, who has 
known Haskins since the coach starred as a player at the school. 
``But you never know what's in between. That's the catch on these 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There never seemed to be anything in between with Haskins  
throughout his 13 seasons with the Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	He inherited a program that had been hit with NCAA restrictions  
following an investigation of Jim Dutcher's tenure. The Gophers 
lost 21 consecutive Big Ten games early in Haskins' career, but the 
team regrouped. Haskins led Minnesota to the Final 16 in his third 
season and a regional final in his fourth year, where a 93-91 loss 
to Georgia Tech kept the Gophers from their first trip to the Final 
Four in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers sputtered for the next several years, but Haskins  
finally took them to the Final Four in 1997, where the best season 
in school history (31-4) ended two wins short of a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is that era, the time between Haskins' biggest successes  
on the national scene, that has come into question. 
</P>
<P>
	At Haskins' request, the university allowed the academic  
counseling unit for the men's basketball team to be separated from 
the counseling units for the school's other teams and put under 
control of the athletic department. It was in this insulated 
environment that former tutor Jan Gangelhoff says she did research 
papers, take-home exams and other course work for at least 20 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two years I was there, I never did a thing,'' former  
guard Russ Archambault, a little-used freshman on the Final Four 
team, told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press when it first reported the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has denied Gangelhoff's claims. He also denies later  
ones by Archambault, who said Haskins gave him cash -- $200 to $300 
at a time. Haskins kicked Archambault off the team during the 
second half of the 1997-98 season for violating unspecified team 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in his coaching career that Haskins has  
been accused of paying players. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, two years after Haskins moved to Minnesota, eight  
former Western Kentucky players told the Courier-Journal of 
Louisville that cash, clothes, and other improper benefits were 
given to members of the team through boosters and coaches between 
1981 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who coached at his alma mater from 1980-86, denied  
those accusations. In 1989, the NCAA determined there was no need 
for an investigation of Western Kentucky's program, citing 
insufficient reliable evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Thomas Meredith also pointed out that no  
one named in the claims -- including Haskins -- remained at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am firmly convinced that our current basketball program is  
operating within the guidelines set by the NCAA,'' Meredith said in 
his 1989 report to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	When it came to school work, Haskins admits he had a shaky  
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	He grew up as the son of a poor farmer in rural Kentucky and  
didn't start school until 8. He first attended a one-room school 
for blacks until the third grade, and he often missed large chunks 
of school to work on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of his enormous basketball ability and his hard work  
in the classroom, Haskins overcame that slow start. He has been a 
strong advocate for academics during his coaching career and 
believes in the importance of his players earning their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	At Western Kentucky, Haskins set up the same type of academic  
counseling structure he later brought to Minnesota. Former Western 
Kentucky athletic director John Oldham, who coached Haskins in 
college and gave him his first coaching job, lauds Haskins for that 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I did a good job by ... staying on top of (players)  
to go to class,'' Oldham said. ``But coach Haskins was the one to 
put the money where his mouth was. He was the first to hire an 
academic advisor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oldham said Haskins would do whatever it took to see his players  
succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would do anything he could to help a kid  
academically, because he wanted his kids to graduate,'' Oldham 
said. ``I don't think he would cheat, but I think he would do 
everything but cheat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not many Minnesota players have been graduating. NCAA  
records showed the school's male basketball players have the worst 
record of earning diplomas in the Big Ten -- about one of every four 
who entered as freshmen from 1983 to 1991 graduated, compared to a 
conference average of about one in two. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the university returned oversight of basketball player  
counseling to an academic services unit instead of the athletic 
department. McKinley Boston, the school's vice president of student 
development and athletics, cited poor communication as the major 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue, who often clashed with Haskins before she  
retired recently as director of academic counseling, gave another 
reason: She said the university was afraid the arrangement would 
jeopardize its NCAA accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' words from his 1997 autobiography ``Breaking Barriers''  
suggest the tug between his values and the pressure to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how many games or championships I've won, it's the  
lives that I've touched along the way,'' Haskins wrote. ``Along the 
way, of course, you need to win enough games in order to earn the 
respect of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Respect. If there's one thing that I've always strived for in  
my life it's that I want to earn people's respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the story broke last month, Haskins held fast to the moral  
high ground, even though the contrast between his words and the 
allegations against him leaves a cloudy picture of what matters 
most to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't put winning and losing ahead of what's right,''  
Haskins said. ``Some people sell their souls to win. I don't do 
that. Never have, never will.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Sues the Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland joined several cities that have sued  
the gun industry, accusing firearms makers Thursday of failing to 
incorporate safety features and making an unreasonably dangerous 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages from 17 gun manufacturers and  
three trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has failed in its duty to make a safer gun and as  
a direct result, the city of Cleveland has been forced to spend 
tremendous amounts of money dealing with the gun industry's 
failure,'' Mayor Michael R. White said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, Chicago, Miami/Dade County and Bridgeport, Conn.,  
are among the other cities that have filed similar lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of one trade association named in the lawsuit  
said safety devices such as gun safes and locking systems are 
available for consumers if they want them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to fathom why the industry is responsible if the  
consumer chooses not to use devices that are currently -- and have 
been -- available,'' said Jack Adkins, director of operations for

<HEADLINE> Church To Close Presidents' Graves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUINCY, Mass. (AP) -- Financial hard times forced a church to  
close off the graves of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams 
to daily visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The basement crypt at the Church of the Presidents, which also  
holds the remains of first ladies Abigail and Louisa Catherine 
Adams, is normally open to the public from April through November. 
Under the church's new plan, it would only be open for prearranged 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
	The pastor, the Rev. Sheldon Bennett, said the church needs  
$70,000 to wipe out its deficit, cover operational costs and pay 
for badly needed renovations to the church lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not wealthy people,'' Bennett said. ``We are a small  
congregation of ordinary citizens with modest means, so we can't 
sustain a continuing financial loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, United First Parish, as it is also known, entered a  
partnership with the city and federal governments to run the crypt. 
Workers on the church payroll operate the site, although National 
Park Service rangers have conducted tours. 
</P>
<P>
	Quincy Mayor James Sheets said he hoped to find a way the crypt  
could remain open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too valuable a resource, and belongs to all people of  
this country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Police Dep'ts Warned of Car Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is warning police that  
a wiring change on patrol cars can deactivate a safety device that 
ensures the cars will not surge forward when officers shift out of 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	After a spot check, the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration sent the national warning late last week to police 
departments across the country, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some police departments have inadvertently deactivated the shift  
lock by modifying the brake lights to flash on Ford Motor Co. 
police cars and vans when the overhead police lights are on, agency 
officials said. The shift lock prevents drivers from shifting out 
of park to move forward unless they are stepping on the brake. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of police departments use Ford Crown Victoria  
patrol cars and Econoline vans. More than 200,000 of the vehicles 
are driven by law enforcement officers, safety officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-page NHTSA advisory said vehicles that were rewired so  
their brake lights flash during emergencies ``could present a 
safety risk.'' It recommends undoing the rewiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials started investigating the problem after an  
accident last December in downtown Minneapolis. A police van 
lurched onto a sidewalk packed with spectators waiting for a 
parade, killing two people and injuring nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	An NHTSA report concluded the officer driving the van had  
mistakenly stepped on the gas pedal rather than the brake when he 
shifted the van out of park. But the report said the accident could 
have been avoided if the shift lock on the Econoline van had not 
been deactivated. 
</P>
<P>
	It was inadvertently disabled by city mechanics using  
aftermarket parts to wire the van's brake lights to flash when the 
overhead police lights were on, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 police vehicles in Minneapolis had rewired brake  
lights, and several other police departments in Minnesota have 
discovered they have the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal safety investigators are trying to determine how many  
other police departments nationwide have rewired vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA investigators found that all three police departments they  
contacted in the Washington area had flashing rear brake lights on 
their Ford patrol cars.

<HEADLINE> Salon.com Buys The Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Online magazine Salon.com has acquired The  
Well, one of the Internet's first virtual communities, providing a 
larger customer base and a place to hone its image as a marketplace 
for new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	No purchase price was disclosed for the deal announced  
Wednesday, as both The Well and Salon are privately held. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Salon Magazine has finally become Salon.com after buying  
the domain name www.salon.com from a Texas hairdresser for an 
unannounced price on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Well, short for The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, features  
more than 200 online conferences on topics ranging from politics 
and sex to the Grateful Dead. It will remain a separate business 
under its new owners, said Andrew Ross, vice president for business 
development at Salon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said he plans to market The Well's conferencing system,  
which costs $10 to $15 a month, to Salon.com readers to help 
increase The Well's membership of 7,000 people, built over 14 
years. Salon.com has 1.2 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will help The Well reach people who may not have known  
about it in its early days,'' Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of The Well, based in Sausalito, Calif., were ``dancing  
on the keyboards'' upon hearing news of the deal, said the site's 
director, Gail Ann Williams.

<HEADLINE> Editors Resign Over Libel Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The top editors of one of the  
Philippines' oldest newspapers resigned in protest when the owners 
decided to apologize Thursday to the country's president for a 
report that prompted his $2.6 million libel lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada responded to the apology by saying he  
would drop the lawsuit he filed against The Manila Times for 
calling him the ``unwitting godfather'' for an allegedly improper 
government contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the anxiety  
you felt,'' Robina Gokongwei-Pe, president of the paper's owner, 
Metromedia Times Corp., said in a letter to Estrada on the front 
page of Thursday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the story, which ran Feb. 16, ``was never intended to  
malign or impugn the sterling reputation you have built up over 
decades of dedicated public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The managing editor and the editor in chief and two or three  
other editors joined chief business writer Joel Gaborni, who wrote 
the story, in resigning late Wednesday when told of the decision to 
apologize. A company rule on resignations requires them to work 15 
more days but their names were removed Thursday from the staff list 
published daily in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing editor Chit Estella quoted the owners as saying there  
was ``nothing really wrong with the story'' but that they feared 
pressure from the government on their other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper is owned by the family of tycoon John Gokongwei,  
whose business empire includes food manufacturing, real estate, 
airline operations, banking and a chain of department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada denied there had been any pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no truth to that,'' he said. ``We cannot pressure the  
press. It's the press who are pressing us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada acted as a witness to the signing of the deal in  
question, a $435 million contract for the repair and enlargement of 
a hydroelectric plant south of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper had said the contract, between the state-run  
National Power Corp. and IMPSA Asia Ltd., an Argentine engineering 
company, was irregular because it was altered after government 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In his complaint, Estrada said he wanted the case to serve as an  
example to deter other journalists from degrading private citizens 
and officials ``under the guise of freedom of speech and of the 
press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada, a former movie star who took office last June, is the  
second Philippine president to file a libel lawsuit in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Corazon Aquino filed a lawsuit in 1990 against  
popular columnist Luis Beltran after he wrote that she ``hid under 
her bed'' during a 1987 coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Aquino, who said there was no space in which to hide under  
her bed, nevertheless lost the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Judge Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The boxing judge criticized for her scoring  
in the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight title fight told 
a federal grand jury no one attempted to sway her decision, her 
lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams also answered ``absolutely not'' when asked if  
anyone had ever offered her bribes or tried to influence her in any 
bout, said the lawyer, Louis B. Priluker. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was advised by the U.S. attorney's office in Newark  
before her appearance that she was not a target of its 
investigation, Priluker said. He said the probe into whether there 
was corruption in the sport started before the March 13 
Holyfield-Lewis fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old woman, who is a municipal employee in Atlantic  
City, testified for 60 to 90 minutes on Wednesday and was told she 
probably would not have to appear again, Priluker said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to speculate on the target of the federal probe. The  
U.S. attorney's office will neither confirm nor deny the existence 
of an investigation, spokesman Michael Drewniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper reports said the grand jury is investigating whether  
the International Boxing Federation, one of the world's three major 
sanctioning organizations, sold rankings and arranged fights in 
return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has subpoenaed all records of the New Jersey-  
based IBF since 1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as well 
as checks, invoices, expense forms and telephone records, IBF 
attorney Walter R. Stone has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF is also being examined by New York law enforcement  
agencies because of the controversial draw in the Holyfield-Lewis 
fight. Of the three judges, only the IBF-picked judge -- Williams -- 
had Holyfield winning the fight many believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	In public testimony last month before a New York state Senate  
panel, Williams said she called the fight as she saw it, but that 
photographers blocked her view at times.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Speaks Out on Telecom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission doesn't  
have the legal authority to impose conditions on SBC 
Communications' planned takeover of Ameritech, contends a key 
telecommunications lawmaker in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
telecommunications subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the 
agency, made the comment in a letter Thursday to FCC chairman Bill 
Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials have said the agency has authority to impose  
conditions on mergers to protect consumers. It has placed 
conditions on other mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am ... concerned that your desire to craft conditions on  
this merger go beyond the commission's legal authority and raise 
fundamental questions of fairness to these merging parties,'' 
Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin opposes the FCC placing conditions on any merger, said  
spokesman Ken Johnson. He wants to strip the agency of some 
authority to review mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech on Wednesday accepted Kennard's offer to  
discuss possible conditions with FCC staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Ohio regulators approved the deal, which would  
create the nation's largest telephone company. The deal, valued at 
$57 billion when it was announced in May, must still be approved by 
the FCC and Illinois regulators. The Justice Department approved 
the merger last month.

<HEADLINE> Americans Borrowing at Brisk Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers borrowed at a brisk pace  
during the first two months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Their credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a  
7.9 percent annual rate during February to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.32 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. That came on 
top of an increase at a 14.1 percent rate -- strongest since 
November 1995 -- in January. 
</P>
<P>
	That borrowing has been reflected in both the vigorous advance  
in retail spending so far this year -- 0.9 percent in February and 1 
percent in January -- and an extremely low rate of personal savings 
-- minus 0.2 percent of after-tax income in February and zero in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, auto loans showed the strongest increase -- 13.7  
percent at an annual rate. Revolving credit, primarily credit 
cards, rose at a 4.8 percent rate. A catchall category, which 
includes loans for education, vacations, mobile homes and boats, 
advanced at a 5.1 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have had the confidence to borrow because interest  
rates remain low, the stock market is hitting new highs -- including 
a 122-point gain in the Dow Jones average of industrial stock to a 
close of 10,085 Wednesday -- and they have jobs. Unemployment, 
according to the Labor Department, hit a 29-year low of 4.2 percent 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In a discordant note, however, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas  
Inc., a Chicago-based job-search firm, said Wednesday that publicly 
announced job cuts totaled 68,984 in March, up 11 percent from 
February and nearly triple the 23,028 announced in March 1998.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The disagreement might seem minor: whether to  
take a religious meal while seated at a table or on the floor. But 
for the world's 20 million Sikhs, the issue symbolizes a power 
struggle between moderates and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say it threatens to split the religion for the first time  
in its 500-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been open war between the moderate leadership in  
North America and those who control the Golden Temple,'' Ajit Jain, 
a Toronto-based correspondent for India Abroad, says of the Sikhs' 
holiest shrine in the western Indian city of Amritsar. 
</P>
<P>
	Sikhism was founded in India's Punjab region as a melding of  
Hindu and Muslim beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the religion celebrates the 300th anniversary of the  
forming of the Khalsa, a covenant whereby male followers adopted 
the surname Singh and were bestowed five symbols that would 
distinguish their faith, including a ceremonial dagger, the kirpan, 
and uncut hair. Many male Sikhs are still easily recognizable by 
the carefully wrapped turbans that contain their unshorn hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Major observances of the Khalsa anniversary are planned in  
Washington, D.C., on Saturday and in Toronto April 25. 
</P>
<P>
	But conflict over the issue of how to conduct the community  
meal, known as langar, has muted the festivities. Traditionally 
Sikhs have shared the meal sitting on the floor as a sign of 
equality; but in many temples in North America, tables and chairs 
have been allowed to accommodate the elderly and infirm. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers first flared in early 1997 when hard-liners at the Guru  
Nanak temple outside of Vancouver, British Columbia, removed 
furniture from the dining hall. When moderates tried to return 
tables and chairs to the temple, there was a near riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentalists basically forced the issue. They said 'If  
you don't remove the tables and chairs, we will.''' says John 
Spellman, a professor of Asian Studies at the University of 
Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was repeated at the Ross Street temple in Vancouver,  
North America's oldest and largest, and the dispute raged at 
temples in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were several incidents where kirpans were drawn,''  
Spellman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, a religious edict was handed down by the Sikhism's  
highest leader at the Golden Temple, Ranjit Singh, mandating that 
tables and chairs be removed from temple dining halls. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh subsequently ordered the excommunication of six prominent  
moderates at Ross Street for speaking out against his edict. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Singh had been a favorite of hard-liners, critics note  
he was convicted of murdering a rival in 1980, though he was 
pardoned in India. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed by moderates of the Ross Street congregation  
forced new leadership elections, and a moderate slate of candidates 
won, but not before more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of a community  
newspaper highly critical of the hard-liners and one of the group 
excommunicated from Ross Street, was shot and killed. Authorities 
believe the shooting, still under investigation, was related to the 
power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months before Hayer's death, a man in Broward County, Fla.,  
who had vigorously objected to allowing tables and chairs in 
temples opened fire in a local temple, killing one person. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict cuts to the core of Sikh identity and religious  
authority, says Ken Bryant, a Sikh expert at the University of 
British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sikhism comes out of a tradition that is anti-hierarchy and  
anti-caste. It was partially a reaction against the notion of 
expensive temples and paid priests,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Sikhs were galvanized by anger over the Indian army's  
storming of the Golden Temple to flush out militants. Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination at the hands of her Sikh 
bodyguards was followed by anti-Sikh pogroms. 
</P>
<P>
	An armed struggle to establish an independent Sikh nation, to be  
known as Khalistan, took an estimated 17,000 lives before it was 
brutally suppressed in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	With that unifying period ended, the power struggle within  
Sikhism has resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle is between ``Khalsa Sikhs'' -- those who have been  
baptized and make up the core of the hard-liners -- and the 
religion's rank-and-file, many of whom are so-called cut Sikhs, who 
do not grow their hair and ``don't want to be so conspicuous with 
the turban,'' Spellman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining the religion in the Western diaspora is proving a  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety percent already cut their hair. If you read the  
matrimonial ads in our Sikh newspapers now, the women say they 
prefer 'clean shaven,''' says Jarnail Singh Badal, current 
president of Ross Street temple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not so concerned about the hair,'' he says. ``My aim is  
to get the youth to follow the three basic principles: Pray to God, 
make an honest living and share your earnings with the needy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Richmond Hill temple in New York City's borough of  
Queens, Punjabi language classes and retreats are efforts to pass 
the religion on to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have our own schools here, all we have is our  
gurudwara,'' or temple, says Surinder Singh Joshan, Richmond Hill's 
leader. ``We are trying as hard as we can to instill Sikh values in 
our children.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Hit Three-Year Lows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled Thursday to 3-year lows amid fears  
Colombia will devalue its currency, creating a flood of cheap 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures continued their sharp retreat, while cocoa  
plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee fell for a second day on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York, losing nearly 5 percent in a single session, amid 
growing complaints from Colombian officials that exports are being 
hurt by an overvalued peso. 
</P>
<P>
	Since coffee is sold for dollars, producers with a weaker local  
currency often step up sales when the dollar is rising. Devaluing a 
currency would immediately cause the U.S. dollar to jump in value 
and provide greater profits to Colombian exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia is the single-largest producer of the gourmet-blend  
arabicas favored by American and European consumers and the 
second-largest producer of coffee in the world behind Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a decision to devalue the Colombian peso could  
produce a ripple effect in other Central American economies, 
prompting other devaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian talks come at a time when U.S. markets are being  
flooded with cheap coffee as a result of large harvests in Brazil 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies in U.S. exchange-approved warehouses jumped again  
Wednesday, rising by 3,750 bags weighing 132 pounds each to 254,177 
bags. Another 40,000 bags were waiting to be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Further pressuring prices Thursday were unconfirmed reports that  
Ethiopia had lowered prices on all grades of its coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for May delivery fell $4.90 to $97.70 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil and refined crude products fell for a second day in  
futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid increasing 
skepticism about whether world oil producers will honor commitments 
to reduce output. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude retreated below $16 a barrel, giving back more of the  
gains that came after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and other oil producers agreed to cut 2.1 million barrels 
daily from world production beginning a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it may take months to determine whether producers  
are complying, and many market participants are noting that the 
producers never fully met a round of cuts agreed to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, several key refineries on the West Coast were coming  
back to full service, easing fears about spot gasoline shortages 
across the country before the heavy summer driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for May delivery of light, sweet crude fell 20 cents  
to $15.83 a barrel; May unleaded gasoline fell 0.99 cent to 49.52 
cents a gallon; May heating oil fell 0.43 cent to 40.84 cents a 
gallon; May natural gas rose 3.6 cents to $2.060 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures plunged to their lowest in five years on the New  
York Board of Trade amid reports of active selling out of Ghana, as 
world producers rush to unload plentiful crops before prices fall 
even farther. 
</P>
<P>
	With months to come before chocolate makers begin gearing up for  
a new candy season, analysts say the outlook for higher prices 
</P>
<P>
	May cocoa fell $55, or 4.8 percent, to $1,079 a ton.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge has tossed out a lawsuit claiming  
O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark and two former detectives had 
no authority to publish crime-scene photos in their books about the 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Amazon Rain Forest Fading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Amazon rain forest is being destroyed twice as fast as  
previously believed, according to a study published today that 
relies on new techniques for measuring deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers concluded that satellite images -- the  
traditional tool for gauging deforestation -- were missing much of 
the damage from logging and fires set to clear land for farming or 
pasture. Selective logging is difficult to detect by satellite, and 
new growth quickly hides fire damage as viewed from above. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the researchers relied on interviews with 1,393 wood  
mill operators and 202 landholders, and checked the effect of fires 
from an airplane at 1,104 sample points in the 1.3 
million-square-mile rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
	They put the loss at 17,000 square miles last year, or three  
times the official Brazilian estimate of 5,700. But 1998 was an 
especially bad year because of an El Nino drought, and they 
estimated that in an average year, actual damage is at least twice 
the official, satellite-based estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's perhaps even more frightening,'' said Bill Mankin,  
director of the Global Forest Policy Project of two major 
environmental groups. ``It's going to creep up on us, and people 
may not even be crafting a solution because they don't realize 
there's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study by ecologist Daniel C. Nepstad of the Woods Hole  
Research Center in Massachusetts and colleagues at the Institute of 
Environmental Research in Belem, Brazil, was published in today's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Nepstad estimated that 217,000 square miles, or 16 percent, of  
the original rain forest has been spoiled over the years. The 
official Brazilian estimate is 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these estimates are quite conservative. The problem could  
be bigger,'' Nepstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Martins, head of Brazil's environmental protection  
agency, said he had not seen the study and declined to comment. 
Environment Minister Jose Sarney Filho was in Paris and unavailable 
for comment, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings trouble some scientists and environmentalists  
because perhaps a third of the world's plant and animal species 
live in the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we lose species, we don't know which one is the critical  
one, the keystone species that results in the whole system falling 
apart,'' said Robert L. Sanford Jr., a University of Denver 
ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also worry about huge quantities of carbon  
dioxide entering the atmosphere from the fires and rotting wood 
left by loggers. Carbon dioxide is thought to cause global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some scientists fear that damage to the rain forest, which  
gives off enormous amounts of water vapor and keeps the ground from 
drying out, could throw the Earth's climate out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers called for more judicious logging, greater fire  
prevention, and curbs on roads, power grids and water systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But some experts are doubtful about the prospects of controlling  
development in the rain forest, where the law of the jungle often 
prevails. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you control development in an area where there's no  
control? It is the Wild West,'' said Compton Tucker, a NASA 
biologist.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Power Plant Blast Kills 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A thunderous explosion rocked a power plant  
Thursday morning, killing two workers and injuring 49 people, three 
critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast tore a huge section from a building holding the six  
coal-fired generators at the Tampa Electric Co. plant on the edge 
of Tampa Bay, two miles from downtown. The explosion was heard at 
least 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to meet my maker or go to hell, and it  
made me want to get right with God,'' said Robert Worley, a worker 
who escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A leak of hydrogen gas was believed to have caused the blast,  
which happened as contractors tested a generator following routine 
maintenance, sheriff's deputies said. Hydrogen is used as a coolant 
for the generators. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jenkins, a spokesman for the electric company, said the  
blast damaged just one of the generators. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Johnny Bass, 52, who worked for a contractor hired  
to give the unit its spring tune-up, was pulled from rubble. 
Another worker who suffered burns, Edward Barker, 57, died at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine of the injured were taken to the hospital. Many of  
those hurt suffered cuts and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, with a work force of about 250, was shut down after  
the blast. Jenkins said TECO would have to assess the damage before 
deciding when to fire up the plant again. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical service to customers was not interrupted.  
</P>
<P>
	TECO supplies power for 500,000 customers. The plant accounts  
for about one-third of the utility's generating capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely heard a first explosion, small like a sonic boom,  
and then this horrendous explosion,'' Bill Simmons, who lives a few 
miles away, told TV station WTVT. ``With all this terrorism going 
on and everything, I didn't know what happened, whether somebody 
had set off a bomb here or what.''

<HEADLINE> Berra To Return for Yankees' Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yogi Berra returns to Yankee Stadium on Friday,  
ending his 14-year exile on a most appropriate day. 
</P>
<P>
	After managing the Yankees to a a 4-1 victory over Minnesota in  
1984, Berra uttered the final word on season debuts, coining the 
phrase: ``A home opener is always exciting, no matter whether it's 
at home or on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired the following year after a 6-10 start, and vowed  
never to return as long as George Steinbrenner owned the club. Last 
January, Berra ended the feud, saying simply: ``It's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Berra took over as the greatest living Yankee  
when Joe DiMaggio died on March 8. On Friday, he replaces the 
Yankee Clipper for the ceremonial first pitch after the World 
Series banner is raised in the Bronx for the second time in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always look forward to opening day at Yankee Stadium,''  
center fielder Bernie Williams said. ``We had a great year last 
year, and we're still enjoying the fruits of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone (20-7) makes his first start of the season, pitching  
against the Detroit Tigers' Beiker Graterol, who will be making his 
major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, still recovering from prostate cancer  
surgery, wasn't expected at the homer opener, but intends to be at 
the ballpark Sunday for the presentation of World Series rings. 
</P>
<P>
	With interim manager Don Zimmer heading the team, the Yankees  
began the season by winning two of three games at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``After losing the first game out here and winning two, I'm  
happy,'' Zimmer said before the Yankees returned home Wednesday 
night. ``We've got guys swinging the bat a little now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York won eight of 11 against Detroit last season, with Cone  
going 2-1, including two victories during a seven-day span in April 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off their 125-win season, which culminated with a World  
Series sweep of San Diego, the Yankees sold more than 2 million 
tickets before their home opener, a season record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel right winning the World Series last year and not  
having Yogi there,'' Steinbrenner said in January after Berra 
agreed to end their feud. ``I'm just happy he feels it's time to 
put this behind us. I'm glad he's said, `George, I forgive you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra has not been at Yankee Stadium for an official function  
since Steinbrenner hired Billy Martin to replace him in 1985, 
though he has occasionally showed up to visit friends. In a sign of 
the thawed relations with Steinbrenner, Berra attended a Yankees' 
spring training game last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years, I'd say, is long enough,'' Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Steinbrenner had told DiMaggio he could throw out the first  
pitch if he recovered in time. ... Andy Pettitte allowed four hits 
and stuck out five in four innings during an extended spring 
training simulated game. It originally was thought he would be 
sidelined 3-5 days after slightly spraining his right ankle 
Tuesday. ``It was a great day,'' he said. ``Both my ankle and elbow 
felt good. I felt better as it went along. I still feel a little 
naked out there facing hitters and that's normal.'' ... Pettitte 
and Darryl Strawberry, continuing his comeback from colon cancer 
surgery and lingering knee problems, will be at this weekend's 
series against the Tigers. ... The Yankees held an optional workout 
Thursday prior to their welcome-home dinner but closed it to 
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Zhu Share Evening of Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid differences over trade, human rights and  
other issues, President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji took 
a break Thursday to revel in an evening of music, one of their 
shared passions. 
</P>
<P>
	Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma was performing for the two leaders and  
more than 200 dinner guests at an official White House dinner, in 
an East Room decorated in red and gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma said the evening's selections celebrated transnational themes  
-- and the power that music has to overcome differences between 
cultures and nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think of China and the United States as being countries  
that are far apart,'' Ma said, as he warmed up for his evening 
performance. But in music, the countries ``are not that far away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by pianist Sara Wolfensohn and Wu Man, who plays an  
ancient four-stringed lute called the pipa, Ma highlighted the 
variety in the evening's repertoire -- from George Gershwin's Three 
Preludes to a finale of Le Grand Tango by Astor Piazzolla. 
</P>
<P>
	Composer Bright Sheng specially arranged three songs in honor of  
the event, and Ma said the pieces reflected folks tunes that Sheng 
himself heard while growing up in Shanghai, interlaced with Sheng's 
U.S. training under Leonard Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is fabulous are the results that can happen when you have  
influences from one place and another coming together,'' Ma said. 
``To get into any art form, you have just one requirement -- you 
have to start from the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Clinton and Zhu talked quite a lot about music during  
the premier's visit, said White House social secretary Capricia 
Marshall. Like Clinton, the Chinese leader enjoys listening to 
music and on occasion, takes up an instrument himself -- a Chinese 
version of the dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president presented Zhu with an American-style dulcimer,  
handcrafted from Mountain View, Ark., as his official gift. First 
lady Hillary Clinton, noting the fondness of Zhu's wife, Madame Lao 
An, for flowers, picked out a set of four stained glass panels 
designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright as her gift. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the premier and his wife brought for the first family  
a giant sketch of the president, first lady and daughter Chelsea at 
the Great Wall, set in a cherry wood frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Figure stating champion Michelle Kwan and novelist Amy Tan were  
among the guests planning to attend the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Room gave out a red glow as Ronald Reagan base plates,  
featuring a red border, lay on rose dante damask tablecloths. 
Vermeil flatware and gold candlesticks surrounded the table flower 
arrangements of Icelandic poppies, Raphaela roses and parrot 
tulips. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chef Walter Scheib prepared a dinner that both  
celebrated the arrival of spring and the premier's fondness for 
fresh vegetables. More than 20 vegetables, including such unusual 
finds as bayou asparagus, peppered the menu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time of year to be a chef,'' Scheib said.  
</P>
<P>
	A roasted salmon, dark enough to be accompanied by a red wine,  
and grilled chicken with vidalia onion glaze headlined the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The sumptuous feast also featured some specialties from abroad.  
The kitchen imported Chinese truffles, and dessert chef Roland 
Mesnier prepared an orange sherbet and tea parfait with tea brought 
by a friend from China. Glazed kumquat tartlettes, and miniature 
mango puddings -- a favorite in China -- rounded out the evening's 
sweets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner was given official status because Zhu is not China's  
head of state.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Trucker's Ticket Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Cuban-born trucker who was issued a  
traffic ticket for being ``unable to speak English'' has won his 
fight to have it dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogelio Campos, 62, was driving a dump truck filled with broken  
cement when he was stopped July 16 and cited for not displaying the 
company name on his truck, not producing a card proving he was fit 
to drive the vehicle, and being unable to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
	Yonkers City Court Judge Richard Liebowitz ruled Tuesday that  
because Campos wasn't engaged in interstate commerce, the federal 
language requirement for commercial haulers didn't apply. The other 
two citations are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires that drivers be able to converse with the  
public, understand English traffic signs, respond to official 
questions and fill out reports and records. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge didn't address Campos' claim that the law  
discriminated against non-English speakers. The trucker took his 
driving test in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great ending but still we have to get rid of that  
wording in the statute,'' said U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx 
Democrat, who had backed Campos.

<HEADLINE> Saints Want Ricky Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints want Ricky Williams  
and the Heisman Trophy winner would like to be a Saint. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans is willing to trade every draft pick this year -- 11  
of them (a second-rounder was dealt to the Rams to get wide 
receiver Eddie Kennison) -- and throw in some picks from next year. 
Maybe even a couple of roster players if need be. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams doesn't think that's enough to clinch the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to happen,'' Williams said Thursday.  
``I want it to. Ideally for me, the Saints trade to No. 1 and I'm 
the No. 1 pick. But I'm pessimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams spent the afternoon being wooed by coach Mike Ditka,  
owner Tom Benson and general manager Bill Kuharich. It was the 
second stop of a three-day tour of six teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ditka's a great coach and I'd love to play for him,'' said  
Williams, although he admitted he was afraid of Ditka before 
meeting him, worried about the furious man he'd seen stalking the 
sidelines at games. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's the nicest guy in the world,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Saints offense was 28th in the NFL last season and was dead  
last in the league in rushing. Williams said Ditka would like to 
change that with a running back who could do for him what Walter 
Payton did in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he likes to run the ball. He's not going to throw the  
ball around and turn it over. He's just going to run the ball,'' 
Williams said. ``They'll get mad at him and it'll be boring, but 
he'll win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints are scheduled to pick 12th in the first round. They  
have picks in every round except the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get a feel for who would be interested in dropping  
down to the 12th spot,'' Kuharich said. ``In dropping down to that 
spot, you get a very different group of players than you get in the 
top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns have the No. 1 pick, and while they are  
thought to be looking for a quarterback, Browns director of 
football operations Dwight Clark said Williams impressed him at a 
workout held Tuesday. Clark said Cleveland is the team New Orleans 
should talk to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Saints want to make sure they get him, that's the place  
to go,'' Clark said. ``To me, you've got a great player with little 
knowns vs. a quarterback with a larger amount of unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' agent agreed. Leland Hardy said he believed that,  
after seeing Williams on Tuesday, the Browns will need only about 
five seconds to make him the No. 1 pick on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about minimizing risk,'' Hardy said. ``Now you  
tell me, what's the greater risk, an unproven quarterback who might 
work out, or a proven running back who was the greatest college 
player in the history of the sport?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kuharich said if a deal can't be made with the Browns, that  
doesn't mean there won't be a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns are where we start, but that doesn't mean we have  
to go that high,'' Kuharich said. ``Speculation is that the first 
three teams will take quarterbacks. Of course, the closer you get 
to the sixth spot, the more problematic it becomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also went to St. Louis on Wednesday. He was going to  
Washington and Philadelphia today and heads to Cleveland and 
Indianapolis of Friday.

<HEADLINE> Top Female Jockey Krone Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months ago, while hanging on for her life in  
the starting gate at the Fair Grounds as a crazed horse tried to 
throw her, jockey Julie Krone came to this realization: ``I don't 
want to do this anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, thoroughbred racing's winningest female rider sat  
comfortably behind a small table in the press box at Aqueduct and 
said she's retiring April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a constellation of reasons for me to retire,'' said  
Krone, who won 3,541 races and more than $80 million in purses over 
an 18-year career. ``I'm on top, I'm 35 years old, I don't want to 
get hurt anymore, and I've got nothing left to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 4-foot-10 1/2, 100 pounds, Krone not only became the only female  
to win a Triple Crown race -- she won the 1993 Belmont Stakes aboard 
Colonial Affair -- but was an inspiration for other females to excel 
in sports previously dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been an inspiration for not only me, but for every girl  
that came along,'' jockey Diane Nelson said. ``I can remember a 
change happening, when you had big outfits, and the nice horses, 
and people would take a chance on a girl. It wasn't an oddity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, married since 1995 to Matt Muzikar, said there are no  
definite plans for the future, adding she has ``many options.'' 
Among those are working in television -- ``I'd love to be able to 
work in TV during Derby week'' -- dabbling in art and photography 
and continuing her education toward a psychology degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, who rides this weekend in Florida and Maryland, will end  
her career the following Sunday at Lone Star Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her career was plagued by injuries, she appeared to be  
in top form after finishing third in the Fair Grounds jockey 
standings with 84 winners. She also surpassed the 3,500-win mark 
and won five races in a day on two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were too many aches and pains.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like this Olympic runner I read about (who set three  
world records the summer she decided to quit),'' Krone said. ``I'd 
go to sleep at night, and my ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd 
think, `I just want to get this over with.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone began her impressive run of success in 1987, five years  
after winning her first riding title at Atlantic City. She became 
the first female to win riding titles at major tracks such as 
Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands in New Jersey. In 1989, she was 
the nation's third-leading rider with 368 winners. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1991, she was a regular on the New York circuit and a year  
later won a career-best $9.1 million in purses. In '92 and '93, 
Krone won riding titles at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 20, 1993, she became the third jockey to win five races  
in a day at Saratoga. Angel Cordero Jr. and Ron Turcotte were the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 days later, Krone went down in a spill and severely  
fractured her right ankle, which required two plates and 14 screws 
to reconstruct. Nine months later, she was riding again. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1995, she was thrown from her horse again, this time  
at Gulfstream. Krone broke both hands, but never regained her top 
form until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Krone broke her right knee at the Meadowlands.  
She won the race, then added two more winners before the fracture 
was diagnosed a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone was back racing three months later, and on Feb. 16 she  
posted her 3,500th victory, guiding May B A Walk to a win at the 
Fair Grounds. She celebrated with a backward handspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a student of the game and a student of horses,'' Hall  
of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens said. ``She was interested in the 
training part, too. She worked hard in the mornings and she worked 
hard in the afternoon. ... For her to win 3,500 is remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her accomplishments in 1993, Krone was selected one of  
Glamour Magazine's 10 Women of the Year and one of five ``Women of 
the Year,'' along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, by CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
	But what Krone takes with her are memories of inspiring young  
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``When some little girl comes up to me beaming and she goes, `I  
play soccer with the boys, and I'm the best scorer and you're my 
hero and I read about you,' those are the times I feel I made a 
difference,'' Krone said. ``If I made a little girl more brave than 
she might have been and perhaps put a spark under someone who was 
having a bad day, those can be the best moments.''

<HEADLINE> Gateway May Outsource Some Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Gateway, the largest private employer  
in South Dakota, might hire another company to run one of its 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer maker based in North Sioux City, S.D., advised  
employees Wednesday that the management of some 
information-technology duties might be turned over to another 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	All Gateway plants would be affected, but company officials  
would not say how many employees could feel the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	One employee estimated the move could affect hundred of  
employees nationwide. Gateway employs nearly 19,000 people around 
the world, including 5,400 in North Sioux City and about 1,500 in 
Sioux Falls, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Any company hired to take over duties would be encouraged to  
hire Gateway employees, said Jim Wharton, vice president of 
communications. Transfers to other Gateway departments also could 
be an option for laid off employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new management of the company's internal-communication  
network could be in place by July.

	``We'll know by the end of the month whether we continue down  
this road. It's got to make sense for the company, and it's got to 
make sense for our employees before we do it,'' Wharton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has grown rapidly since its inception 14 years ago  
and needs to make sure its communications infrastructure remains 
world class, Wharton said.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks: Molleken Stays As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks rewarded interim coach  
Lorne Molleken for a winning record with a new, three-year contract 
Thursday as the team's permanent coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty exciting day,'' Molleken said. ``Nothing will  
change. All I've tried to do is to try to treat the players the way 
I wanted to be treated when I played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players didn't have a say in the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``What the players say means nothing,'' general manager Bob  
Murray said. ``It's how they acted, how they reacted, their body 
language, their expressions. It was a very easy decision to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray wouldn't disclose terms of the contract, but Molleken was  
expected to earn about $400,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Thursday night's game against the New York Rangers,  
Chicago was 9-6-4 since Molleken replaced Dirk Graham Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The third Blackhawks' coach in the past year, Molleken began the  
season as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Molleken came to the Blackhawks from the Edmonton Oilers, where  
he had coached their minor-league affiliates at Hamilton and Cape 
Breton for the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hamilton coach, he posted a 64-61-35 regular season record  
and was 15-16 in the playoffs. He was a minor-league hockey player 
for eight seasons and signed major-league contracts with Los 
Angeles, the New York Islanders and Minnesota but never played in 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their late-season rally, the Blackhawks will fail to  
make the playoffs for the second consecutive season. They hadn't 
done that in 41 years.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wants Issue-Driven Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Steve Forbes,  
taking his case to establishment Republicans lining up behind 
George W. Bush, is promising an issue-driven campaign that will 
force early GOP favorites to tackle controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll smoke 'em out,'' Forbes said in an interview with The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the ornate lobby of a colonial village inn Thursday  
night, Forbes was explaining why he bothered to attend the 
three-day conference of state GOP chairmen. He is the only 
announced presidential candidate appearing before the local 
operatives, many of whom favor the Texas governor and son of former 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although most of them seem to be going in a particular  
direction, if I don't make the case, nothing can happen,'' Forbes 
said. ``I want them to see that I have a message and will go to 
every possible source to get support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire publisher has campaigned non-stop since his  
failed 1996 presidential bid, yet public opinion polls show him far 
behind Bush and Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent millions of dollars, much of it his own, to promote  
a relatively detailed agenda on abortion, tax reform, foreign 
policy and the economy. Bush and Mrs. Dole, meanwhile, dutifully 
avoid taking stands on national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately frustrated by that contrast, Forbes is telling state  
chairmen that it will take a candidate with ``principle and 
substance'' to win the White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Do Bush and Dole have those two qualities?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see,'' Forbes said with a devilish grin. ``We haven't  
seen whether they have yet. We'll smoke 'em out. We haven't yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the media and voters in early primary states will  
eventually test the mettle of the early front-runners. If Bush 
disappoints party regulars, Forbes wants to be their second choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be leaning toward Bush, but I'm telling them 'If  
you're taking a second look, I would appreciate you looking at this 
campaign,''' Forbes said. ``That's been my experience in business: 
You get a 'no' and you go back again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who was meeting one-on-one today with at least a dozen  
state chairmen, attended a private reception Thursday evening after 
the party leaders spent the day discussing how the GOP could better 
package its message. Forbes said such salesmanship is fine, but the 
party must offer Americans a good product. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want junk,'' he said. ``The key to us winning the  
White House is you have to use principle and substance. No other 
way will do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics accuse Forbes of shaping his agenda to suit the  
political climate. After angering social conservatives in 1996, 
Forbes has aggressively courted their support this cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Signaling plans to broaden his approach beyond traditional GOP  
issues, Forbes said he was telling state chairmen in private 
sessions that the party's nominee must neutralize Democrats by 
``taking their trump cards out of their hands'' -- forging policies 
for issues such as education, Social Security and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	While Forbes toils behind the scenes, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy  
Thompson is delivering the luncheon address today. Though not a 
declared presidential candidate, Thompson is giving serious thought 
to entering the race late if Bush shows signs of faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor looks strong so far. This week alone, Bush  
announced that he had raised an impressive $7 million in the first 
quarter of 1999 and picked up support of key congressmen in Iowa 
and New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> NFL Looking Into Cowboys Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL is investigating complaints from other  
teams that the Dallas Cowboys may have violated the league's salary 
cap rules by locking up players they have not yet signed. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokeswoman Leslie Hammond said Thursday that the league  
was looking into allegations involving center Mark Stepnoski, wide 
receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker Quentin Coryatt. She had no 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, it was reported that the Cowboys had come to terms  
on multiyear contracts with the three free agents, but did not 
actually sign them. The New York Times reported that several teams 
said they recently contacted agents for the three, but in each case 
was told the player no longer was available. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the teams said they conducted their own investigations  
and determined that an arrangement had been reached between the 
Cowboys and the players. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, according to The Times, at least several of the  
teams complained to the league. They told NFL officials that they 
believed the Cowboys had reached verbal or written agreements with 
the players, but had not signed them to a contract to circumvent 
cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The league then began to explore the situation, according to  
team executives, union officials and agents the newspaper did not 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Bob Ferguson, the player personnel  
director of the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in this league have been doing things a long time --  
not Dallas -- that have made it difficult for those of us that have 
had to operate by the rules. It's an uneven playing field, and it 
hurts them and it hurts us. 
</P>
<P>
	The league offers a $1 million reward for anyone who can produce  
proof that a team has violated the cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, the Cowboys could be fined millions of dollars  
and be barred, at least temporarily, from using the players 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the teams that complained believe the Cowboys  
may have hidden a deal with the three players because Dallas did 
not have room to sign them but wanted to keep other teams from 
getting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL urges teams to sign a player to a contract as soon as  
possible after an agreement has been reached. Once the signatures 
are on the contract, the agreement must be submitted to the league 
office within 24 hours and every other team is then made aware of 
the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Dalrymple, a Cowboys' spokesman, when asked about the  
published report, told The Associated Press: ``It's the first I've 
heard of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted an unidentified Cowboys' spokesman as saying  
the team had been contacted by the league regarding Coryatt and was 
satisfied with the explanation that he was at the training facility 
to visit a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the league had not inquired about the other  
two players mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper the players have not agreed to terms or  
signed any contracts and therefore could not have violated any 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	There currently is no proof the Cowboys have broken any rules,  
the Times said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Sides With NAACP in Fla. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge has thrown out Daytona  
Beach's plan to restrict traffic during this weekend's Black 
College Reunion, saying it is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett agreed with the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and three Daytona 
Beach residents that the city unfairly singled out the event. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 people are expected for the weekend  
gathering, where crowds transform the main beachside road into a 
street party. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge banned the city from enforcing the restriction, which  
would allow beach access only to residents, hotel guests and those 
conducting business. Others would have to park their cars and take 
a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP and the residents argued that the city had never taken  
such restrictive action against Bike Week or spring break, two 
largely white gatherings that draw larger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the city's plan violated the First Amendment's  
guarantees that the right of assembly not be tied to a person's 
economic or status or residence. She did not rule on allegations of 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defendants have not proffered a rational explanation for why  
BCR as an event should be singled out and subjected to greater 
restrictions than other events,'' Fawsett wrote Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bell Chiefs, FCC To Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications Corp. and Ameritech Corp.  
will talk to federal regulators about placing conditions on their 
planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard asked  
the chiefs of both local Bell telephone companies last week to do 
that after raising ``serious concerns'' about whether their merger 
would benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to meet with commission staff to explore the  
issues that you have identified,'' SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. 
and Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert said in a joint letter 
Wednesday to Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the chiefs said their companies have been providing  
detailed information about their merger to the FCC and continue to 
believe that the merger should be approved without conditions. 
Neither they nor Kennard said what conditions might be set. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard wants discussions to begin this month and to conclude by  
late June. The FCC could make a decision on the matter shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC approval is the last major regulatory hurdle for the deal,  
which has been cleared by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, valued at $57 billion when it was announced last  
year, would create the nation's largest local phone company. It 
would control 57 million, or one-third, of the nation's local phone 
lines spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, in letters to the companies' chiefs last week, wanted  
to know how the FCC can be assured that the public will receive the 
benefits the companies say will result from the union. He said 
Wednesday he was ``pleased'' the companies had decided to 
participate in the process he had outlined and looked forward ``to 
resolving this matter expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger won't interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability to open their local phone markets to other 
companies that want to provide competing local phone and other 
communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre and Notebaert, in their letter, said the merger ``can  
only increase our willingness to open our local markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A key component of the merged company's strategy, the chiefs  
said, would be providing long-distance services to local phone 
customers. To obtain FCC permission to do that, the company must 
open its local markets to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs also said the merged company's plan to provide local  
phone and other services in 30 markets outside its combined 
13-state local region also would boost competition. Such a move 
would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging, the new company will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside its region, the chiefs 
said. It will also be in a stronger position to provide new 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech and SBC representatives said they expect the FCC to  
approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Amateur Hoopla Abounds at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Matt Kuchar slumped against the giant oak  
tree that stands before the clubhouse at Augusta National. His face 
was flushed, his legs felt like jelly and he just wanted to find a 
shady place to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Garcia floated up to the 18th green like he was living a  
dream, hardly breaking a sweat in the sweltering Georgia heat. 
Observing the scene, Tiger Woods put his arm around Garcia's 
father-turned-caddy, pointed toward the 19-year-old Spaniard and 
gave a thumbs-up sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Those scenes signalled an amateur changing of the guard Thursday  
during the first round of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, who captivated the crowds a year ago with his gee-whiz  
grin and boyish enthusiasm, couldn't get his flu-ridden body to do 
what he wanted in his second trip to Augusta. Rarely smiling, he 
struggled to a 5-over-par 77 and had trouble keeping up with his 
playing partners, Tom Watson and Stuart Appleby, as the thermometer 
pushed toward 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a little more of a fairy tale,'' said Kuchar,  
the Georgia Tech junior who finished 21st in the 1998 Masters -- the 
highest finish by an amateur in 14 years. ``This year, I'm under 
the weather and it's taking away some of the fairy tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, the Spanish phenom dubbed ``El Nino,'' picked up where  
Kuchar left off, and he took another amateur, South African Trevor 
Immelman, along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shot even-par 72s on the first day, impressive scores when  
swirling wind and rock-hard greens made for brutally difficult 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous at the beginning,'' said Garcia, who  
earned a spot in the tournament by winning the British Amateur. 
``But after three or four holes, I got so relaxed. I couldn't 
believe how relaxed I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the amateur hoopla centered on Kuchar, Garcia and  
long-driving U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne, who shot a 2-over 
74. But Immelman quietly put together one of the most solid rounds 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Paired with a hero, countryman and three-time Masters champion  
Gary Player, the 19-year-old Immelman saved his best shot for the 
end, salvaging a par at 18 when he chipped to within two feet of 
the hole from some 30 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a future champion today,'' said Player, who hugged  
Immelman after the round. ``He's got to be the best player in the 
world for a 19-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Player didn't get a look at Garcia, who was in the  
threesome with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard bogeyed the first two holes after errant tee shots.  
He landed in a patch of trees along the left side of the first 
fairway, then hooked his shot at No. 2 into a ditch, forcing him to 
a take a one-shot penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia made the turn at 3-over, but he felt like things were  
about to turn for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just keep playing,'' he said under his breath, ``and the  
birdies will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did on the next two holes. At 10, he hit a 9-iron to within  
20 feet of the cup and made the putt. At 11, his 8-iron provided an 
easy -- by Augusta standards -- uphill putt from about seven feet. He 
missed a downhill seven-footer for birdie at 13, but made up for it 
four holes later by using his sand wedge from 127 yards to set up a 
10-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, who managed to strike cars on Washington Avenue with his  
booming, practice-range shots, admitted he was nervous going to the 
first tee. But he closed with two birdies on the final four holes 
to put himself in position to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne received some helpful advice from his playing partners,  
defending champion Mark O'Meara and Lee Westwood, as they walked 
down the first fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me the worst was over, it's all downhill from  
here,'' Kuehne recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom McKnight, 44, runner-up to Kuehne in the U.S. Amateur, shot  
a 1-over 73. The sixth amateur in the field, 48-year-old John 
``Spider'' Miller, struggled to an 81 in his second Masters 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar felt bursts of energy, like his birdie putt from off the  
green at No. 9 that prompted a high-fiving exchange with several 
members of gallery. Most of the day, though, he trudged around the 
course with a towel draped around his neck, looking downright 
wobbly as he struggled up the frequent hills. 
</P>
<P>
	At the eighth hole, he stopped along the ropes to grab a  
weathered, 1998 U.S. Open cap from his Uncle John -- unlike most 
golfers, Kuchar normally eschews headwear. He also got a brief, 
encouraging hug from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really not feeling very well,'' Meg Kuchar said. ``He's  
doing the best he can, but it's awful hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar has been suffering from flu-like symptoms for nearly a  
week. He wasn't able to make it through a full practice round and 
went to the hospital emergency room Tuesday night for treatment. 
The 20-year-old felt better Wednesday, actually making a 
hole-in-one during the par-3 tournament, and he hoped to awaken for 
the first round feeling like himself again. Instead, he took a turn 
of the worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to play through it,'' he said with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Immelman won the U.S. Public Links title, which hardly made him  
one of the high-profile players entering the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so nervous at the beginning,'' Immelman said. ``I was  
just hoping to get it airborne, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Player encouraged the youngster all the way around the course,  
and Immelman remembered Kuchar's performance in the previous 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Matt did so well last year,'' the South African said,  
``it gave everyone the confidence to know we could come out and 
play with the pros.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on European Rate Cut / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Thursday after the European  
Central Bank cut its main interest rate by one-half percentage 
point to 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/16  
point, or $8.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.44 percent from 5.50 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB's cut was larger than many analysts had expected and the  
first since the euro currency was launched in 11 European nations 
at the beginning of the year. The European cut helped revive hopes 
that U.S. rates might also be headed lower, which would help 
fixed-income investments like bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 point and 3/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities were up 9/32 point to 21/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.38 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.27 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.51 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.35 percent. One-year yields were 4.61 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.04 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 10/16 from 124 7/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.21 percent from 5.22 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Misses Start Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- After going 2,632 games without a day off, Cal  
Ripken is suddenly getting in the habit of watching from the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1982, the Baltimore Orioles third  
baseman missed a game because of injury Wednesday. Saddled with a 
stiff lower back, Ripken decided it would be better to take a seat 
than to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	So he never picked up a bat and watched the Orioles lose to  
Tampa Bay 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in the Orioles' last 10 games Ripken  
failed to play. Last Sept. 20, he voluntarily ended his record 
consecutive games streak by sitting out Baltimore's final home game 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who left the Orioles' season opener Monday in the third  
inning with painful back spasms, began Wednesday night's game in 
the dugout while Willis Otanez took over at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could beat my head against the wall and go do it today, but  
it doesn't make sense,'' Ripken said. ```We're going to just work 
toward being ready tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the game, Ripken told manager Ray Miller that he  
wasn't quite 100 percent. So Miller decided to give Ripken the day 
off, even though he had already written the third baseman into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd rather err on the side of caution and give him  
another 24 hours,'' Miller said. ``In my heart I know he never 
played a game just because of the streak. Fortunately for us it's 
not there anymore, so we can use a little better judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the streak were still alive, it probably would have come to a  
dramatic conclusion Wednesday night. Although Ripken's back felt a 
lot better than it did Monday, it was far from peak condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was 90 percent, playing would be a no-brainer,'' he  
said. ``Every situation is different, but I doubt I'd play tonight 
regardless if the streak was still alive. ... I want to be able to 
contribute this whole season, and it wouldn't make sense to push it 
just to play one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Ripken missed a game because of injury was on May  
3, 1982 after he got beaned by Seattle rookie Mike Moore. His 
record streak began later that month and survived two ankle 
injuries, a twisted knee and a herniated disc in his back in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those ailments affected him the way his injury did  
Monday, when he was rendered helpless by stiffness, tightness and 
spasms in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider myself superhuman. But I never reached a  
point where I couldn't play until the other day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez, meanwhile, was delighted to get his third major league  
start, but would have preferred it occurred under different 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice for me, I was happy to see I'm playing,'' he said.  
``But I don't want my teammate to get hurt like that. That's not 
good. I hope he gets well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez hit his first major league homer and doubled in a 2-for-5  
night.

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Misses Start Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- After going 2,632 games without a day off, Cal  
Ripken is suddenly getting in the habit of watching from the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1982, the Baltimore Orioles third  
baseman missed a game because of injury Wednesday. Saddled with a 
stiff lower back, Ripken decided it would be better to take a seat 
than to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	So he never picked up a bat and watched the Orioles lose to  
Tampa Bay 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in the Orioles' last 10 games Ripken  
failed to play. Last Sept. 20, he voluntarily ended his record 
consecutive games streak by sitting out Baltimore's final home game 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who left the Orioles' season opener Monday in the third  
inning with painful back spasms, began Wednesday night's game in 
the dugout while Willis Otanez took over at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could beat my head against the wall and go do it today, but  
it doesn't make sense,'' Ripken said. ```We're going to just work 
toward being ready tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the game, Ripken told manager Ray Miller that he  
wasn't quite 100 percent. So Miller decided to give Ripken the day 
off, even though he had already written the third baseman into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd rather err on the side of caution and give him  
another 24 hours,'' Miller said. ``In my heart I know he never 
played a game just because of the streak. Fortunately for us it's 
not there anymore, so we can use a little better judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the streak were still alive, it probably would have come to a  
dramatic conclusion Wednesday night. Although Ripken's back felt a 
lot better than it did Monday, it was far from peak condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was 90 percent, playing would be a no-brainer,'' he  
said. ``Every situation is different, but I doubt I'd play tonight 
regardless if the streak was still alive. ... I want to be able to 
contribute this whole season, and it wouldn't make sense to push it 
just to play one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Ripken missed a game because of injury was on May  
3, 1982 after he got beaned by Seattle rookie Mike Moore. His 
record streak began later that month and survived two ankle 
injuries, a twisted knee and a herniated disc in his back in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urged To Delay Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's prime minister urged Yasser Arafat today  
not to declare Palestinian statehood before restarting talks with 
Israel, a government official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been pushing Arafat not to jeopardize the Middle East  
peace process with such a declaration May 4, the end of the 
five-year interim period of self-rule for Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the Palestinians do have rights to their  
autonomy, and I strongly hope that an independent state will be 
established in the near future,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was 
quoted as telling Arafat by a Foreign Ministry official. ``But I 
strongly request that such a declaration of statehood not be made 
at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, who left Japan for Vietnam shortly after the 35-minute  
session with Obuchi, agreed that the decision was a delicate one, 
although he said the end of the interim period would leave the 
Palestinian autonomous region ``in a legal vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping that we'll come to a decision that can satisfy  
everyone,'' he was quoted as saying by the Foreign Ministry 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Japanese government considered the statements a softening of 
Arafat's position. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quoted as telling Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko  
Komura on Wednesday that the PLO Central Committee would convene in 
late April to decide on a statehood declaration -- leaving open the 
possibility that such a declaration could be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mideast peace talks long bogged down, Israeli Prime  
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to annex parts of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip if Arafat makes a unilateral statehood 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat arrived Wednesday in Tokyo as part of a weeklong tour of  
international capitals to discuss the possibility of a statehood 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has stopped in Turkey and Russia, and was also scheduled  
to visit China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan and African nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, who is on his third visit to Japan, last traveled to  
Tokyo in September 1997.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Stern John scored with 24 minutes to  
play and in the tie-breaking shootout as the Columbus Crew defeated

<HEADLINE> Tabloid Denies Ramsey Case Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A former free-lance writer for the Globe  
says his editors at the supermarket tabloid talked about trying to 
blackmail a Boulder detective into granting an interview about the 
JonBenet Ramsey case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Shapiro, who researched the Ramsey case for the Globe, said  
his editors considered using as leverage a rumor that Detective 
Steve Thomas' mother committed suicide when Thomas was a boy. The 
rumor later proved false. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Lewis, a Globe editor, acknowledged sending Thomas  
photographs of his long-dead mother days after the detective 
resigned from the Ramsey case in frustration. But Lewis denied it 
was an effort to pressure the detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``No employee of the Globe ever said anything like that,'' he  
said. ``The only person who ever said anything to Thomas about his 
mother was Jeff Shapiro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe Editor Tony Frost said: ``There was no threat to blackmail  
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who is writing a book about the case, declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro made the allegations in author Lawrence Schiller's book  
about the Ramsey case, ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' as well in 
other media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in  
her family's home. The child beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy 
Ramsey, have come under suspicion. They have denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a grand jury investigating the slaying was granted  
a six-month extension to complete its work. The panel has been 
meeting since mid-September and its term was supposed to be up on 
April 21. The extension runs until Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro was one of the first tabloid reporters who arrived in  
Boulder to cover the Ramsey case. Shapiro said in Thursday's 
Washington Post that he taped some conversations with his editors 
because he feared some of their strategies would jeopardize his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro took the recordings to the FBI, but the detective didn't  
press charges and the agency declined to investigate. Shapiro then 
took them to CBS's ``48 Hours,'' which planned to air the tapes 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing was kind of shocking to me,'' Shapiro told the  
Post. ``I was making tapes to protect myself in case there was a 
criminal investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One tape included an exchange between Shapiro and a Globe editor  
who said, ``I'm not sure that this is even a story for us,'' 
referring to Thomas' family history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was something that I thought I might use to get an  
interview with him, you know?'' the editor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro asked: ``How so?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm sure he wouldn't want it published, would he?'' the  
editor replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis told The Associated Press on Thursday that a distant  
relative of Thomas' sent the tabloid the photographs and told of 
the rumors about his mother's death. Lewis said he sent the photos 
to Thomas along with a request for an interview because he thought 
Thomas would find them interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the taped conversations were internal discussions  
about a story on Thomas' life in the wake of his resignation. He 
said Shapiro went to Thomas on his own to tell him about the 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he did it shows extremely poor judgment on his  
part,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas resigned Aug. 6, accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter  
of bungling the case and trying to protect JonBenet's parents.

<HEADLINE> Port Huron, Mich., Mayor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Gerald ``Ajax'' Ackerman resigned as  
mayor following his arraignment on 14 counts of sexual misconduct 
involving children -- which sent shock waves through this city an 
hour north of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This community just feels violated,'' City Council member  
Cliff Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Pro Tem Steven Miller confirmed this morning that the city  
received Ackerman's letter of resignation Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, honored five years ago by the National Association of  
Social Workers, became mayor -- a mostly ceremonial role, since the 
city has a city manager to run the government -- in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman never looked like a typical mayor, with his long  
flowing red beard, ponytail and leather duds. He didn't have the 
background of a typical mayor, either. He admitted he's a former 
drug and alcohol addict and liked to ride motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	And for this conservative city of 37,000, electing such a man to  
the mayor's seat took what Schrader described as ``a lot of 
trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That trust was shattered as the man who used his story of  
struggle to overcome drug and alcohol addiction to help young 
people himself stood charged with sexual misconduct involving 
children he counseled. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually flamboyant and outspoken Ackerman stood silent  
during his arraignment Wednesday in a crowded courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, 42, was charged with six counts of first-degree  
criminal sexual conduct, five counts of criminal sexual conduct, 
two counts of production of child abusive material and one count of 
indecent exposure. The charges involve four girls, ages 9 to 14, 
police Capt. Brian Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman was accused of taking pornographic photos of some of  
the girls and appearing with them in some, Moeller said. He said 
police spent four hours Tuesday night searching Clear Choices, a 
counseling facility that Ackerman runs, and took two computers from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, for whom the judged entered an innocent plea, was  
released Wednesday night on $25,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he moved here in the late 1980s, he has been considered a  
role model for kids and motivation for others trying to break free 
of their addictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really opened up to Ajax and his past,'' City Council  
member Anita Ashford said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wednesday, those who once welcomed him voiced outrage;  
others expressed disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel he kind of let his community down,'' said Donna  
Stranyak, a 36-year-old waitress at the downtown Cavis Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her patrons, Randy Arnott, a 47-year-old laborer and  
longtime resident, doesn't believe the charges. ``I just can't see 
him do that,'' he said. ``They don't know if he did it. ... It 
could be some kind of hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Ackerman could face life in prison, but would more  
likely get a 16-to-23-year prison sentence, St. Clair County 
Assistant Prosecutor Mona Sayed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ackerman was arrested following an investigation  
into complaints by the girls' parents. The alleged abuse occurred 
between August and March, Sayed said. 
</P>
<P>
	An alcoholic at 14, he was in and out of rehabilitation  
facilities for most of his 20s before sobering up. 
</P>
<P>
	Since moving to Port Huron, he has worked part-time at a mental  
health center and an HIV/AIDS clinic, opened Clear Choices and 
volunteered at a shelter for runaways.

<HEADLINE> 'Judge' Koch Being Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Next case up on courtroom TV: Sheindlin vs.  
Sheindlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Ed Koch is being replaced as the judge on ``The  
People's Court'' by Gerald Sheindlin -- who's married to the 
tough-talking star of that other courtroom TV show, ``Judge Judy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sheindlins are retired judges who were appointed to the  
bench by Koch himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sheindlin said the two shows ``are like life's dessert and  
I'm really excited about the fact that my husband gets to share 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she warned: ``I want him to become accustomed to the fact  
that No. 2 is very good. If he starts nipping at the heels of No. 
1, he better use some of those extra dollars to hire a 
food-taster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Koch and his failed TV outing, the former mayor said he  
once thought he could approach Ms. Sheindlin's success, but ``she's 
a real judge. That's TV.''

<HEADLINE> Waste Companies' Asset Swap OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Allied Waste Industries and Browning-Ferris  
Industries Inc. won approval Thursday for their $210 million asset 
swap from the Justice Department and the Illinois and Missouri 
attorneys general by agreeing to sell some waste collection routes 
in the St. Louis metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	The department and the two state attorneys general filed a  
lawsuit in U.S. District Court here to block the original asset 
swap. At the same time, they filed an agreement that would settle 
the lawsuit and eliminate the deal's potential to harm competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The asset swap is separate from the proposed purchase of  
Browning-Ferris by Allied, which continues to be reviewed by the 
department's antitrust division and several state attorneys 
general, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without this divestiture, St. Louis business consumers such as  
stores and restaurants would have paid higher prices and received 
lower quality services for waste collection,'' said Assistant 
Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argued that the original deal would have  
substantially reduced competition for commercial solid waste 
hauling in the St. Louis market. Allied and Browning-Ferris are two 
of only three companies that provide that service in the city of 
St. Louis and St. Louis County in Missouri and the Illinois 
counties of St. Clair, Madison and Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial waste hauling usually entails collecting trash and  
garbage from small metal containers or Dumpsters, by special 
front-end loading trucks, and hauling it to disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied and Browning-Ferris agreed to sell 12 commercial small  
container routes in the St. Louis market. Allied also agreed to 
limit its contracts with customers to no more than two years with a 
one-year renewal and to avoid excessive liquidated damage terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied and Browning-Ferris are two of the three largest waste  
hauling and disposal companies in the nation. In 1998, 
Browning-Ferris had domestic revenues of nearly $4.7 billion and 
Allied had domestic revenues of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning-Ferris is headquartered in Houston; Allied is based in  
Scottsdale, Ariz.

	SPOTSYLVANIA, Va. (AP) -- A former aide described by blind civil  
rights leader James Farmer as ``my eyes and my legs'' was sentenced 
to a year in jail for stealing from Farmer and was ordered to repay 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester William Day, 58, pleaded guilty in February. He was  
sentenced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My situation did not give Lester the right to take advantage  
of me,'' Farmer wrote in a letter read in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, 79, lost his sight and both legs to diabetes.  
</P>
<P>
	Day moved into Farmer's home in 1997 and ran errands, such as  
driving Farmer and picking up the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	He intercepted several checks sent to Farmer in the mail and  
drew money from Farmer's account at cash machines. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Spacey Makes 'Iceman' Sparkle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Spacey is at home at Harry Hope's Bar,  
playing the would-be savior of the dead-beat denizens in ``The 
Iceman Cometh.'' As Hickey, he carries off the star role with an 
intensity perfectly shaded for each of his on-stage friends and 
riveting for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, written by Eugene O'Neill in 1939 and first on  
Broadway in 1946, opened Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. 
The revival of the work is based on the production at London's 
Almeida Theater, where it opened to acclaim last year. 
</P>
<P>
	When Spacey, as the joke-telling Hickey, first enters the bar,  
he's off-putting with his fast-talk -- like a vintage radio 
personality. But soon Spacey's delivery and pacing become 
mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey's father was a Midwestern preacher, and he's a salesman;  
it's obvious he has adopted speech rhythms that pull in a listener. 
It's plausible that this Hickey would spur the barflies out of 
their stupor. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Hickey tells a joke about his wife and the iceman. But  
now what he wants to do, at Harry Hope's 60th birthday party, is 
make the 15 folks who drink at the bar and sleep upstairs face 
their pipe dreams -- two words that become the play's mantra. They 
all have hope for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey sends them out -- today -- to act on their oft-stated  
intentions. They all fail, as he expected, but he believes their 
encounters with reality will bring them peace. But peace never 
comes, so Hickey tells them his wife's pipe dream and his solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Spacey, known for dark, mysterious characters in numerous films  
and in TV's ``Wiseguy'' series, is joined in ``Iceman'' by Tony 
Danza. Best known for the TV series ``Taxi'' and ``Who's the 
Boss?'', Danza is excellent as Rocky, an Italian bartender pouring 
and withholding drinks at the whim of Harry Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of young streetwalkers, played by Catherine Kellner and  
Dina Spybey, work for Rocky. And all three are vehement about not 
using the words ``pimp'' and ``whore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Pigott-Smith, who was Ronald Merrick in TV's ``The Jewel in  
the Crown,'' plays the important role of Larry. He's a former 
anarchist who left ``the movement,'' who now sits in the 
grandstand, observing, caring about nothing. But, despite what he 
says, Larry is often moved to caring and pity. And, while he is 
physically removed from the others, he still manages a lot of 
walking and gestures and twitches not seen in the last revival on 
Broadway in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	It's interesting how both interpretations work. In contrast to  
Jason Robard's 1986 starring role, in which he delivered Hickey's 
last-act monologue with hurricane force, Spacey makes a soliloquy 
seem like a brief conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the audience enter the theater to people dozing  
onstage, at the bar. Director Howard Davies and the actors have 
done an amazing job of making each character distinctive and 
interesting. So the audience is not confused or bored. Where lines 
are meant to be funny, they are delivered so well that they provoke 
big laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hazeldine plays Harry Hope. One man, young Don Parritt,  
joins his regulars. He has betrayed his anarchist mother to the

<HEADLINE> Judge Silences Shepard Case Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers  
involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely 
injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the  
media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more 
difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge 
Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers  
representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the  
death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured 
from a bar in October and fatally beaten. He received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying  
him to a fence, but said he tried to intervene to prevent McKinney 
from inflicting a more severe beating. He said McKinney, who has 
yet to be tried, struck him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson  
fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies  
of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney, 
drawing another round of criticism from Custis.

<HEADLINE> Power Plant Blast Kills 1, Hurts 45 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A powerful blast rocked an electrical  
generating plant this morning, killing one worker and injuring 45 
people, four critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion, heard miles away, tore a huge section from a  
building at the Tampa Electric Co. power plant at Port Sutton, on 
the edge of Tampa Bay southeast of downtown Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to meet my maker or go to hell ... and  
it made me want to get right with God,'' said Robert Worley, a 
worker who escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris filled a yard at the plant outside of the hole.  
</P>
<P>
	The blast came as a generator was being tested following routine  
maintenance, and a hydrogen gas leak was suspected, authorities 
said. Hydrogen gas is used as a coolant at the coal-fired plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 45 injured, at least 35 were taken to hospitals for  
treatment while the others were treated at the scene, said 
fire-rescue squad Capt. Cliff Hitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7:15 a.m. blast killed Johnny Bass, 52, of Jacksonville,  
officials said. Bass worked for Power Plant Maintenance of 
Jacksonville, a contractor hired to give the unit its spring 
tune-up, TECO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies said Bass's body was pulled from beneath  
debris of the wall that was blown out in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	TECO said four of the injured, critically burned, were taken to  
the burn unit at Tampa General Hospital. Many of the other injured 
were being treated for lacerations and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is about two miles southeast of downtown Tampa, across  
an arm of Tampa Bay from Tampa's port. 
</P>
<P>
	It is TECO's second-largest power plant and employs about 250  
people. No power interruptions to electrical customers were 
reported. TECO supplies power for 500,000 customers in a 
three-county area of west-central Florida.

<HEADLINE> Gay Rights Advocates Attack Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The pastor of the world's largest gay church has  
accused Gov. George W. Bush of pandering to religious conservatives 
with his opposition to a proposed hate-crimes bill and adoptions by 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the world to believe that he is a compassionate  
conservative. We want the world to know that his compassion does 
not extend to all the citizens of Texas,'' the Rev. Michael Piazza, 
senior pastor of Cathedral of Hope, said Wednesday at a rally that 
drew about 400 people to his church. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is ostensibly saying it's OK with him when hate crimes are  
committed against lesbian and gay people,'' Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush declined to comment, but a spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said  
his views on both issues have remained consistent. Bush wants 
children adopted by married men and women, and he opposes special 
rights based upon sexual orientation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza said criticism by gay leaders could backfire by driving  
more conservatives to support Bush. But he said he is trying to 
educate moderates who could decide the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hughes said such political calculations do not influence the  
governor, whose initial fund-raising for an exploratory 
presidential campaign now exceeds $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Texas know that Governor Bush bases his  
decisions on principles, and they will remain the same whether he's 
in East Texas or West Texas ... or Iowa or New Hampshire,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, gay leaders lauded Bush after Texas GOP leaders  
excluded Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political group, from the 
state party convention in Fort Worth. Bush called for a stop to 
name-calling and infighting regarding the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush started his fund-raising campaign after forming an  
exploratory committee for a possible presidential run March 4. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he and Vice President Al Gore have been the leaders in  
the fund-raising race: Gore, who is seeking the Democratic 
nomination, has raised at least $7 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Families Separated in Exodus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STENKOVEC, Macedonia (AP) -- The 5-year-old girl with light brown  
hair walked into a Red Cross tent, clutching a battered plastic 
doll. For the moment, it was her only family. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of other ethnic Albanian refugees, little Jehona  
Aliu became separated from her relatives six days ago during their 
frantic, frightening exodus from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Jehona can remember being on the train from Kosovo with her  
mother, her two brothers and her sister. But she doesn't know where 
they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers who are ministering to the extraordinary crush of  
humanity -- nearly half a million Kosovars have poured into 
neighboring states in the past 2 1/2 weeks -- can only hope they will 
be able to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was crying a little in her sleep last night, but one of  
the interpreters was with her,'' said Cpl. Carl Newbrooke, one of 
the British troops running the tent camp at Brazde, outside the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje. ``Apart from that, she doesn't cry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So chaotic were conditions as refugees flooded across the border  
that aid workers say they don't even have an estimate yet of how 
many families were wrenched apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had about 50 people register missing children this  
morning,'' said Arlinda Rejepi, working a desk run by the 
humanitarian group Save the Children in the Stenkovec camp near 
Skopje, temporary home to about 20,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, about 300 people registered lost children.  
</P>
<P>
	``One was a man looking for his grandchildren -- a 2-month old  
baby and a 2-year-old,'' Rejepi said, continuing to jot down 
details as she spoke. Each evening, various aid agencies from 
different camps cross-check all the information they have compiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees are not in a position to do much of the searching  
themselves. Macedonian authorities do not let them leave the camps 
or receive visitors, and there is no way to make telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the refugees' desperation boils over. On Thursday at  
the Stenkovec camp, one man was carried into a field hospital, his 
nose broken and his head bloodied after an altercation with one of 
the Macedonian guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dazed resignation is more common. In the camp, with its rows of  
green or white tents, people milled in the walkways or washed their 
muddy clothes in a culvert. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Save the Children tracing desk, Adile Ferizi joined the  
line. In the crush at the Kosovo-Macedonian border, she lost all 
six of her children, ranging in ages from 2 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one week, I have not heard from them,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Magbule Miftari, 21, was trying to contact her younger brother,  
who is 18. He went to pick something up as they were being herded 
aboard buses at the border, and she lost sight of him. That was a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably in another camp,'' she said, hopefully.  
</P>
<P>
	Megid Maloku, 34, was more uncertain about the fate of her four  
children, the oldest of whom is 13. The truck her family was 
fleeing Kosovo in broke down before they reached the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a ride with one group; another took her children. She  
isn't even sure they made it across. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard from others that they may have gone through another  
border crossing,'' she adds. ``But we have not heard from them in 
seven days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Red Cross tent, Jehona Aliu, wearing a white T-shirt with  
pink dots, perched in the lap of Newbrooke, the British corporal. 
He said he was sure her family was in another camp, looking for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, she spends days with other children in the  
Brazde camp who are also separated from their parents and siblings. 
Jehona cheers them up by singing songs and doing little dances. 
</P>
<P>
	``She tells them she hasn't seen her mom for how many days, and  
she's been brave about it,'' Newbrooke said. ``So they shouldn't 
cry.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies in Bizarre Key Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An elderly woman fell while she was trying to  
open her door with a key that was around her neck, strangling 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice Thornton, 73, apparently stumbled after she put the key  
in the lock on Wednesday at her fifth-floor apartment, Detective 
Dennis Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key remained in the door lock, and her body weight held the  
strap tightly around her neck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death appears to be the first of its kind. The Consumer  
Product Safety Commission has no reference in its files to adult 
deaths from key straps. 
</P>
<P>
	Two to three children die each year by strangling themselves,  
usually in cases in which a pacifier is tied around their necks by 
a cord, according to the commission.

	March sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers.

<P>
	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the

<HEADLINE> European Bank Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Worried about flagging growth and  
double-digit unemployment rates across much of Europe, the European 
Central Bank cut its key interest rate by one-half percentage point 
Thursday to 2.5 percent in the first reduction since the euro 
currency was launched Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, bank president Wim Duisenberg chided political  
leaders in the 11 euro zone nations for not enacting the 
``convincing structural reforms'' that the bank -- and many 
economists -- believe are needed to solve Europe's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited notoriously inflexible labor policies in countries like  
Germany, Europe's biggest economy and one of its sickest at the 
moment -- that make businesses reluctant to invest or take on new 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope our goal to get governments to pursue a reform policy  
will get a new incentive from the measures taken today,'' he said. 
``If they don't do that, monetary policy is no alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England also cut its base borrowing rate by a  
quarter of a percentage point Thursday, to 5.25 percent, hoping to 
stimulate economic growth there at a time of low inflation. Britain 
is not part of Europe's single currency project. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the European bank to cut rates by at least  
a quarter of a percentage point, noting that inflation -- the bank's 
primary concern -- was steady at less than 1 percent and showed no 
signs of igniting. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg said the decision to cut even further was made to  
keep the market from speculating that it was only a first step. 
``Now you can be sure this is it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts also felt a rate cut could help reverse the slide  
of the euro, which turns 100 days old on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has lost about 9 percent of its value against the  
dollar since Jan. 1, a drop attributed to everything from the 
continued strength of the U.S. economy to investor jitters over the 
fighting in Kosovo. It was trading Thursday at around $1.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a rate cut traditionally weakens a currency because  
investors earn less, analysts said in this case, it could boost the 
fledgling currency if investors believe it will spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse-than-expected economic data released Thursday in Germany  
added to pressure for the European bank to act: New manufacturing 
orders fell an adjusted 1.7 percent in February, after a big drop 
in January, and seasonally adjusted unemployment in March was 
basically unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Europe's two other big economies, Italy is slumping and  
prospects for France are gloomy, said Klaus Kegler, chief economist 
at Delbrueck and Co. bank in Cologne.

	The three countries account for 75 percent of the euro zone's  
output. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller countries like Spain and Ireland are doing better, but  
Duisenberg said he did not believe lower rates would overheat the 
economies there. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction is the first since Dec. 3, when key rates were  
lowered to 3 percent among the euro nations to prepare for the new 
currency's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Duisenberg made a similar appeal for European  
governments to reform their labor policies and tightly regulated 
markets for goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet center-left governments in Europe have been moving in the  
opposite direction, with Rome and Paris seeking to legislate 
shorter work weeks and Bonn repealing the modest reforms on hiring 
and firing passed by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Some leftist politicians, led by former German Finance Minister  
Oskar Lafontaine, had campaigned for the bank to lower interest 
rates to help reduce joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Lafontaine's surprise resignation last month made it  
easier for the new bank to take such a step, since it wouldn't be 
interpreted by financial markets as caving in to political pressure 
or compromising its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg said he hoped the bank's latest move would  
``increasingly focus the attention of policymakers and the public 
on the real causes of the employment problem. Monetary policy is 
not the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 nations that launched the euro are Austria, Belgium,  
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Girl Brings Back Ice Cream Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUDBURY, Mass. (AP) -- The ice cream man returneth to this town,  
thanks to an eloquent 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Gentile persuaded nearly 300 grownups at Wednesday night's  
Town Meeting to allow ice cream trucks back into this small town 20 
miles outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth-grader did her homework for her presentation, having  
written to nearly a dozen town clerks and police chiefs in nearby 
communities that allow ice cream trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to inform you that none reported any incidents of  
drug dealing, child abuse or personal injury,'' Sara said. 
</P>
<P>
	She argued that statistics show ice cream trucks are safer than  
school buses, bicycles and skateboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of selectmen supported her proposal because, as  
Selectman Maryann Clark put it, ``The selectmen are children at 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, an attempt to lift the ban was rejected after a  
resident said the trucks would lead to noise pollution, traffic 
dangers and might leave children prey to pedophile drivers.

<HEADLINE> Clemson Basketball Players Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Two Clemson basketball players have been  
charged with receiving stolen goods, campus police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasha Bains, 18, of Canada, and Willie James Solomon, 20, of  
East Hartford, Conn., were charged Thursday with possessing a 
laptop computer valued at $3,000 that had been reported stolen from 
a campus apartment last month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon bought the computer for $300 and Bains agreed to split  
the cost, according to arrest warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	They were released on $2,500 personal recognizance bonds and a  
trial date was set for May 13 in circuit court in Pickens County. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither coach Larry Shyatt nor the university had taken  
disciplinary action as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is unrelated to any improper physical conduct  
or any use of alcohol or drugs,'' Shyatt said. ``At this time I 
have not suspended them from the team. I wish they had made a 
better decision ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university will review the case before determining  
disciplinary measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon played as a freshman this season. Bains, also a  
freshman, did not play after transferring from Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Witness Blames Talk Show for Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A psychiatrist testifying in a $50 million  
lawsuit has blamed ``The Jenny Jones Show'' for the death of a gay 
guest who revealed a secret crush on another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz was accused of shooting Scott Amedure three  
days after a 1995 show taping that never aired. Dr. Bernard 
Carroll, who testified for Amedure's family, said he thought the 
show deceived Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jonathan Schmitz would not have killed Scott Amedure but for  
them appearing on this show,'' Carroll said Wednesday. ``This was a 
psychological assault and battery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of Amedure's murder, but the verdict was  
overturned because of an error in jury selection. His retrial is 
scheduled for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family has sued the show and its producer, Warner  
Bros., claiming they ambushed a mentally ill Schmitz. The show 
contends it was not responsible for Amedure's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was to question Carroll today.  
</P>
<P>
	The psychiatrist said he reviewed Schmitz's medical records and  
had diagnosed him as suffering from depression and bipolar disorder 
with occasional psychotic episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said the show repeatedly told Schmitz his secret admirer  
could be a woman -- even though the title of the show was ``Same Sex 
Secret Crushes'' -- and that Schmitz did not want to believe 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	When the admirer was revealed as Amedure, and Amedure describes  
a sexual fantasy about Schmitz, Carroll said the show turned into a 
``sadomasochistic situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's being abused, but at the same time he's tolerates it  
because he's unable to marshal the resources to leave,'' he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz turned violent three days later when he couldn't  
suppress his pain any longer, Carroll said.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett Packard, EPA Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Hewlett Packard Co. and the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency have reached an agreement that may 
settle a complaint filed against the high-tech firm in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement would dramatically reduce the fines HP faces, in  
part because the company admitted problems with chemical records at 
its Corvallis plant before the investigation was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA initially sought $2.5 million in fines. A motion filed  
Friday seeks permission for the EPA to drop one charge and reduce 
the fines to $112,000 on the remaining three charges. The case is 
being heard by a federal administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
	HP officials at the Corvallis plant -- the corporation is based  
in Palo Alto, Calif. -- said Wednesday they were pleased that the 
case is moving toward resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA charged that HP didn't let federal officials know about  
a new chemical it began using in its ink in the 1980s. 
Hewlett-Packard officials have described the complaint as a 
paperwork mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the EPA first filed charges, officials said they didn't  
have enough information to tell whether HP ink was toxic. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials have insisted the chemicals in the ink are  
harmless. Friday's amendment didn't directly address the question, 
and company officials said the EPA could have acted more 
aggressively if there had been a problem with the ink. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes after more than six months of negotiations  
between the federal agency and HP. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint, EPA alleged the company didn't cooperate with  
its two-year investigation. Federal officials charged HP had failed 
numerous times to turn over documents, which stalled the 
investigation. HP has called those charges ``outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HP submitted the documents investigators wanted only after the  
EPA filed the complaint last fall, the amended complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did cooperate,'' Corvallis HP spokeswoman Marcy Eastham  
said. ``The original complaint took us by surprise because we felt 
we had cooperated with everything they had requested.''

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Accused of Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- An attorney for an aging Rwandan pastor  
charged with genocide argued before a federal appeals court today 
the man should not be surrendered to an international tribunal 
because no treaty exists that would allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 75, a retired Seventh-day Adventist  
Church pastor from Rwanda, awaits his fate in jail in Laredo, a 
city on the Texas-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	His alleged involvement in ethnic conflicts in Rwanda in April  
1994 are at the root of his federal court case being heard in San 
Antonio by a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired pastor was not in court but several of his relatives  
were, as defense attorney Ramsey Clark, former U.S. attorney 
general, argued Ntakirutimana should not be extradited by the 
United States to a United Nations tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear ... under our constitution, extradition requires a  
treaty,'' Clark said, pointing out there is no treaty between the 
United States and the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark also argued today there is not sufficient evidence to send  
Ntakirutimana off to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys, however, said several witnesses have  
identified Ntakirutimana as having been involved in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the treaty questions, government attorneys contend the  
United States has an obligation under a federal law -- same as it 
would under a treaty -- to honor the surrender request of the 
tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	State-sponsored massacres in Rwanda in 1994 organized by Hutu  
extremists killed more than 500,000 people, mostly members of the 
minority group the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ntakirutimana's arrest came after the U.N. International Crimes  
Tribunal on Rwanda refiled a request that Ntakirutimana be 
extradited to the central African nation for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Rainey has ruled Ntakirutimana should  
be handed over to U.N. officials in Arusha, Tanzania. The pastor 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ntakirutimana was pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in  
Mugonero in the Kibuye district of Rwanda. He is accused of urging 
a large, mostly Tutsi group of men, women and children to seek 
refuge in a church and hospital complex, then taking part in a 
daylong gun and machete attack that resulted in hundreds of deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Ntakirutimana also allegedly was part of a convoy that continued  
to carry out attacks in the weeks that followed against Tutsis who 
escaped the church massacre, the tribunal indictment claims. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known when the three-judge appeals court panel will  
rule. The decision can then be appealed to the full 5th U.S. 
Circuit Court in New Orleans and to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ntakirutimana is sent to Tanzania to stand trial, it will  
mark the first time the United States has surrendered a defendant 
from American soil to a U.N. tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he could face life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Through Clark, the retired pastor has denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's all political,'' Clark has said. ``All it does is it  
feeds into hatreds that caused the violence in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys contend the United States has a treaty  
obligation to honor the surrender request of the tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Small Bookstores Feeling Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Sandwiched between coffee bars and vintage  
clothing shops, the Fremont Place Book Co. has provided the city's 
hip, young Fremont neighborhood with everything from obscure titles 
to bestsellers for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sign in the window warns of an uncertain future: ``This  
bookstore is endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent  
bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned 
megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. 
The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes &AMP; Noble -- 
the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the 
world's largest book distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	For independent booksellers, the $600 million deal is the last  
straw. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all just aghast when we heard about the deal,'' says  
Carol Santoro, co-owner of Fremont Place. ``It's becoming more and 
more of a dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes &AMP; Noble  
to learn what others are buying. Santoro has responded by shifting 
orders to other suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	But independent booksellers are not the only ones worried about  
self-preservation in a changing industry. Even a giant in the 
business like Ingram says it cannot overlook the impact of chain 
stores and online retailers in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all  
transactions by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of several members of Congress, including  
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and independent booksellers, 
the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the deal between 
Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble. The state attorney general in California 
-- home to many independent booksellers -- also is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden took up the cause because of personal exposure to the  
tough circumstances facing small booksellers. His father was an 
author and ran his own publishing house for some years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was raised being skeptical about what is happening in the  
bookselling business,'' Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He supports conditions to the merger so all booksellers have  
equal access to published material. He also favors ``firewalls'' to 
prevent information sharing. Without such conditions, Wyden 
believes the deal could be the death of the small stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this really is a survival issue for them,'' Wyden  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent bookstores have been on the offensive since the dawn  
of the mega bookstore, when giants like Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble 
opened up triple decker shops stocked with thousands of book 
titles, CDs and even cappuccino bars. Because of their high volume, 
these stores were able to slash prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Amazon.com.  
</P>
<P>
	The online retail giant has revolutionized the market, enabling  
shoppers to buy, send and special-order books with a click of the 
mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the American Booksellers Association and other  
independent bookstores filed suit against the two retail book 
chains, saying they have used their clout to secure illegal deals 
and preferential treatment from publishing houses. Another suit 
filed by independent booksellers in August also names Amazon.com 
and BarnesandNoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes  
&AMP; Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and 
reduce the diversity of materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wind up with a smaller and smaller group of people  
deciding who to publish,'' said Len Vlahos of the ABA, based in 
Tarrytown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	While there will always be the John Grishams and other big  
moneymakers, bookstores also need to make room for lesser known 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	``You like to think artistic content matters,'' says Santoro.  
``Not just the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram says it is reaching out to its clients to assure them of  
confidentiality in their transactions. Predictions that the merger 
will reduce the variety of books available are just not true, says 
Mary Ellen Keating of Barnes &AMP; Noble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make every book available,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Wyden says independent bookstores do more than just sell  
books, and often function as community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small stores help make rural life more vibrant,'' Wyden  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a flavor that you're looking for,'' said Diane  
Kerner of Seattle, making her purchases at Fremont Place one rainy 
morning. ``People love their neighborhood bookstores.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Debates Casinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Possible restrictions on money-lending and  
cash-dispensing in casinos drew interest Thursday from a federal 
commission on gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members also criticized Indian tribes for failing to  
provide information on their gambling operations. Only three of the 
nation's 20 largest tribes that offer gambling completed a 
questionnaire from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-member commission will release a report in June on the  
economic and social effects of legalized gambling. Seven members 
participated in Thursday's meeting to discuss possible conclusions 
and recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the effort to restrict casino operations was  
commissioner James Dobson, president of Colorado-based Focus on the 
Family. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed removing cash machines from gambling floors to force  
``cooling-off periods'' for losing bettors, as well as limiting the 
ability of casinos of lending money and cash checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson also suggested casino display signs warning that gambling  
can be addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino industry's chief lobbyist in Washington, Frank J.  
Fahrenkopf, Jr., countered that many casinos already post signs 
with phone numbers for compulsive gambling hot lines. 
</P>
<P>
	As for abolishing automatic teller machines from casino floors,  
Fahrenkopf asked: ``Does that mean that every 7-Eleven in America 
that sells lottery tickets can't have an ATM in there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Indian gambling, commissioners said most tribes have  
refused to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of the 20 largest tribes with gambling operations  
complied, compared with all of the nation's 20 leading 
revenue-producing commercial casinos, said commissioner Leo 
McCarthy, a former lieutenant governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Coin, executive director of the National Indian Gaming  
Association, said most tribes believe the questionnaire violates 
their right to shield proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Moore, a Mississippi radiologist, said the  
chapter on Indian gambling would urge tighter federal restrictions 
on the type of gambling offered by Indian tribes, as well as more 
disclosure about money made from gambling and how it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission found common ground on the topic of gambling via  
the Internet, supporting legislation now before Congress that would 
outlaw the activity. 
</P>
<P>
	On the topic of advertising, commission deputy director John  
Shosky noted that the U.S. Supreme Court soon will rule on a 
challenge to a federal ban on television and radio ads by 
commercial casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission member John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, suggested the commission 
consider recommendations for responsible advertising practices, 
should the court strike down the ban.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Lowell Gets Rehab Detail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, working  
his way back after cancer surgery, was sent to Triple-A Calgary on 
Thursday for a rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans called for Lowell to start at third base in Calgary's  
season opener Thursday night at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, 25, who grew up in South Florida, was diagnosed with  
testicular cancer after a small mass was found during a routine 
physical exam Feb. 19. He underwent surgery two days later to 
remove one testicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins placed Lowell on the disabled list March 26.  
</P>
<P>
	Lowell came to Florida from the New York Yankees in a Feb. 1  
trade for three pitching prospects. The power-hitting rookie had 
been expected to challenge incumbent Kevin Orie for the third-base 
job before the cancer was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two minor league seasons, Lowell hit .309 with 56  
home runs and 191 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Study Engine Backfiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Pratt &AMP; Whitney has been working for  
years to fix a backfiring problem in engines used on hundreds of 
jets worldwide -- and now government inspectors are intensifying 
their scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the backfiring is mild, but there have been reports of  
flames shooting out of the engines, forcing pilots to shut down 
power. No crashes have been blamed on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it is stepping  
up evaluations of the PW4000 engines, which power almost 600 
aircraft operated by 60 airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency already has ordered that modified engines be  
installed by June 30. It is preparing a second order regarding 
methods to determine whether the engine should be used at all, said 
Robert Guyotte, manager of the FAA engine certification branch in 
Burlington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The East Hartford company has been working on the problem since  
1993. While the incidents of backfires have decreased, the problem 
is not fixed, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 170 backfires of PW4000s have been reported since  
1992. Less than 20 of those happened with engines that Pratt has 
modified since the problem was reported, Guyotte said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after series of violent backfires by a PW4000 engine that  
a United Airlines 747 lost power on takeoff from San Francisco and 
nearly struck San Bruno Mountain last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Although pilot error was blamed, the PW4000 has been implicated  
in several other near-disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three years, about 85 percent of the estimated 2,000  
engines in service have been modified, Pratt spokesman Mark 
Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Receiver Harper Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alvin Harper, a former wide receiver with the  
Washington Redskins, was charged Thursday with two counts of auto 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland State Police say the arrest of Harper, 31, resulted  
from an investigation of vehicles with false identification numbers 
from the District of Columbia. Stolen vehicles were recovered from 
several locations in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, said 
Pete Piringer, a state police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Among vehicles recovered were a 1997 Mercedes Benz S 600, valued  
at $130,000, and a 1995 Mercedes Benz convertible, valued at 
$70,000. Both vehicles were in Harper's possession and had 
fraudulent titles, Piringer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper may have purchased the vehicles from a distant  
acquaintance and under the premise the sales were legitimate, 
Piringer said. But the sales were at substantially reduced prices, 
which should have raised Harper's suspicions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also a former Dallas Cowboy, Harper played for the Redskins last  
season but was cut Dec. 1 after complaining about playing time. He 
attended camp last year with the New Orleans Saints but was cut 
before the start of the season.

<HEADLINE> March Retail Sales Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported today  
that their sales in March jumped to better-than-expected levels as 
healthy U.S. economic growth and a surging stock market encouraged 
Americans to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting sales was an early Easter, which meant that  
shoppers did most of their holiday buying in March this year 
instead of April as they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second month of surprisingly strong sales, giving  
many Wall Street analysts reason to believe that first-quarter 
earnings will top estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans feel secure, they feel confident and their spending  
patterns show it,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and 
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust U.S. economy has driven retail sales in recent  
months. Consumer confidence is at near-record highs, while 
unemployment and inflation levels remain at their lowest levels in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the stock market is again on a record-setting pace,  
with the Dow Jones industrial average crossing the 10,000 mark for 
the first time last month and other indexes reaching new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately today, the Labor Department reported that the number  
of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rose last week but 
remained at less than 300,000 for the 10th consecutive week, the 
longest such stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount chains fared the best in March, outpacing all other  
retail formats. Shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart and Target 
for their wide selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reporting big gains last month were specialty clothing  
chains, such as Gap and Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The only weakness was spotted at moderately priced department  
stores such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Co., which have 
lost business to the lower-priced discounters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 8.4 percent in March. It rose 4.5 percent in February and was up 
3.9 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 18.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.1 percent, total sales down 2.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.1 percent, total sales up 10.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.7  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 16.8 percent, 
total sales rose 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 12.9 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 9 percent, total sales up 8.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 0.3 percent, total  
sales up 4.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 18 percent, total sales rose 9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 21 percent, total sales up 43 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Fund-Raiser Must Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House committee  
investigating Democratic fund raising in the 1996 campaign is 
awaiting word from the Justice Department on his request for 
testimony from a party fund-raiser who reportedly funneled illegal 
contributions from China to help re-elect President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., asked Attorney General Janet Reno on  
Wednesday to help arrange the appearance of Johnny Chung for a 
public hearing before his Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative that we shine the light of day on the facts  
surrounding Chinese government involvement in funneling public 
money into our political system,'' Burton wrote to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno told reporters today that Burton's  
letter arrived Wednesday and ``we are reviewing it to see what we 
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chung has told federal investigators that China's chief military  
intelligence officer sent him $300,000 to give to the Democratic 
Party, The Los Angeles Times reported. The Chinese government has 
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Chung said he received $300,000 from a Chinese  
aerospace official, Liu Chao-ying, who also is a lieutenant colonel 
in the Chinese army. Chung told prosecutors that Ms. Liu, whose 
company is owned by the Chinese government, told him that the funds 
came from Chinese intelligence and were for political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic  
National Committee have said they did not know of any connection 
between Chung's contributions and the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a Taiwanese-born businessman who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated nearly $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 
1994 to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose 
about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a frequent visitor to the White House, once  
escorting Chinese businessmen to watch Clinton deliver a radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung admitted making nearly $30,000 in illegal contributions to  
Democrats, including $20,000 to Clinton's re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In December he was sentenced to five years probation and 3,000  
hours of community service as part of a plea bargain. He also has 
been cooperating with the Justice Department campaign finance task 
force.

<HEADLINE> Del. House Explosion Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- A blast possibly caused by a propane tank  
leveled a house early today, killing the occupant and injuring 
three neighbors who were hit by flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
	All that remained of the two-story house was the foundation,  
police said. The blast in the Royal Grant neighborhood near Dover 
was heard as far as three miles away, at Dover Air Force Base, and 
spread debris over an area 50 feet wide and 100 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry L. Midcap, 52, was killed in the 3 a.m. blast, state  
police Cpl. Alice Bailey said. Midcap's wife and teen-age daughter 
were not at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying glass hit three neighbors, who were taken to Kent General  
Hospital. They were expected to be treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The state fire marshal's office was investigating the blast with  
the help of state police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms. Investigators believe the blast may have been caused 
by a propane tank outside Midcap's home, Ms. Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police blocked off the area and remained on the scene several  
hours after the explosion, but neighbors were not immediately 
evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Stole Bomb Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. intelligence report suggests that China  
improved its neutron bomb technology with military secrets stolen 
in 1995 from the United States, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The information was provided by a spy working for the United  
States in China, the Times reported, citing unidentified U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls into question Clinton administration claims  
that there is no evidence of Chinese nuclear espionage after the 
1980s, when China is suspected of having stolen designs of 
America's most modern nuclear warhead, the W-88. 
</P>
<P>
	It also conflicts with statements from administration officials  
that they acted promptly in response to concerns about security 
breaches at the nation's nuclear research labs, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have said that China tried to build a neutron  
warhead in the 1980s using secrets stolen from the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory in California. But a 1988 test of the 
weapon proved unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The spy's 1996 report suggested that Chinese operatives returned  
to the United States in 1995 to gather more secrets and solve 
design problems with the neutron bomb, which kills people with 
enhanced radiation while leaving buildings intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The report prompted an investigation, but American officials say  
they have found no evidence that China has produced an improved 
neutron bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	China has denied stealing military secrets. President Clinton  
was to meet with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today to discuss a 
number of topics, including security issues. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said administration officials were told of the  
neutron espionage report in early 1996, the Times said, but Clinton 
did not issue a Presidential order on laboratory security until 
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wen Ho Lee, a suspect in the theft of W-88 information, was  
dismissed from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He has not been charged with any crime. The Times said the FBI  
has not been able to establish a connection between Lee and the 
neutron bomb investigation.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Doubtful for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eric Lindros wants to resume playing as  
soon as possible, but he won't do it unless doctors assure him he 
has recovered from a life-threatening collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was pale and coughing intermittently during a brief news  
conference before being released from Baptist Hospital Thursday and 
flying home to Philadelphia. He said he was ``getting better every 
day,'' but understands the seriousness of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't worry about the next game,'' the Philadelphia  
Flyers' captain and leading scorer said. ``You don't worry about 
the first round. You wonder what's going to happen in the next 
hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros and his doctors are waiting to see how quickly he  
regenerates the six pints of blood that filled his right lung in 
the hours following the Flyers' 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has not had a blood transfusion and is being treated  
with medication and vitamins to speed up the process, which doctors 
say may take 3-4 weeks. The playoffs begin April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst-case scenario is I don't come back until  
September,'' Lindros said. ``But I think because of the jump-start 
we had here and the good care here, I might be on my way back much 
sooner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, one of the toughest players and most dominant scorers  
in the NHL, has endured numerous injuries during his career, though 
none as serious as this. 
</P>
<P>
	Roommate Keith Jones found him lying in the bathtub early last  
Friday and called the Flyers' training staff. Lindros was taken by 
ambulance to Baptist, where doctors found that the blood-heavy 
right lung was pushing against his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't recognize the seriousness of his injury,'' said Dr.  
Richard Garman, who works with the Predators. ``His pain threshold 
is so high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors still aren't sure what happened. Tests showed no signs  
of a broken rib, so they believe a blood vessel ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros thinks he bruised his ribs during the first period  
against the Predators. He iced the area and felt good after the 
game. The pain intensified that night, and he had trouble breathing 
when he returned to his hotel room. He tried to ease his discomfort 
by lying in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers went into Thursday night's game against Pittsburgh  
tied for fourth in the Eastern Conference. The team is assuming 
that Lindros won't be back this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to prepare that way and play that way,'' Flyers  
general manager Bob Clarke said. ``We can't sit and hope and hope 
and hope. With that serious an injury, who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garman said Lindros has made a remarkable recovery in the past  
week, largely because of his great physical condition. Once he 
regenerates the lost blood, it shouldn't take long to regain his 
fitness, Garman said, without offering a time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' brother, Brett, who was with him at the hospital since  
Saturday, said if there is any way Lindros can play and not risk 
further injury, he will. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always wants to play,'' Brett Lindros said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index rose Thursday to its  
highest closing level so far this year on continued buying by 
foreign investors. The dollar advanced against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 292.19  
points, or 1.77 percent, closing at 16,846.69. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 74.79 points, or 0.45 percent, to 16,554.50, its 
previous highest close this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.18 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.40 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 121.35 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices started lower on profit-taking following  
recent gains, but the market later turned into positive territory 
with active buying of steel and information-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were boosted further in the afternoon as individual  
Japanese investors joined in a buying spree by foreigners, who have 
been the main players pushing Japanese stocks up in recent 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, the Nikkei index had gained a total of 264.31  
points in the three previous trading days, mostly on buying from 
foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the market was also buoyed by an overnight surge  
in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.82 
points to close at 10,085.31. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the Dow's third close above 10,000 points and eclipsed  
the previous high of 10,007.33 hit Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent, to 1,345.07 
points. The TOPIX closed up 2.03 points, or 0.15 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar moved in a narrow range, jostled  
by profit-taking and position adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no big players today, although some Japanese life  
insurance companies started buying at the 121.20 yen level,'' said 
Hajime Sato, assistant general manager of the treasury department 
at Daiwa International Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.58 yen, up from  
130.20 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond dropped to 1.595 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.685 
percent, pushing its price up to 101.79 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> GE's Profit Rises 14 Percent in 1Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric Co.'s profit rose 14  
percent in the first quarter, boosted by strong growth in its 
financial services, aircraft engines and power systems businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	GE earned $2.16 billion, or 65 cents a share, in the quarter  
ended March 31, compared to $1.89 billion, or 57 cents a share, in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Thursday were in line with analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp., who had predicted earnings of 65 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But GE shares fell 62 1/2 cents in a rising market to close at  
$113.87 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7 percent in the quarter to $24.17 billion, up  
from $22.63 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GE Chairman John F. Welch attributed the strong results to  
global growth, rapid introduction of new products and expansion of 
the company's product services activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings rose 17 percent at GE Capital Services, the company's  
financial services arm, which had an 11 percent revenue rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft engines unit's earnings rose 15 percent on a 5  
percent revenue increase. The division won more than 50 percent of 
the orders of large commercial engines during the quarter, winning 
new business valued at more than $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The power systems unit's earnings rose 27 percent as revenue  
rose 6 percent and the division won more than $1.1 billion of 
turbine orders. 
</P>
<P>
	But earnings and revenue fell 2 percent at GE Appliances.  
</P>
<P>
	At NBC, earnings increased 12 percent despite a 6 percent  
decline in revenue.

	DENNISTON, Ky. (AP) -- Residents of rural, predominantly  
Christian Menifee County are not looking forward to a pagan 
festival planned for a ridge-top tobacco farm April 30-May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a horrible disgrace,'' says Denniston grocer Clayton  
Wells, 72, who lives three miles from the festival grounds east of 
Frenchburg. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 200 dancing, drum-beating revelers plan to  
``celebrate the blossoming of spring and the powers of fertility,'' 
organizers say, and some of the self-described witches, magicians 
and pagans will be naked as they chant and worship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been a shocker to everyone I've talked to,'' said  
Bethel Baptist Church pastor Joseph ``Buddy'' Rhodes of Frenchburg, 
who calls nude worship an abomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But William Lawson, a Menifee County native and ex-Pentecostal  
who is helping organize the event, said: ``I want people to know 
that they have nothing to fear from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating May Day is one of the major pagan festivals of the  
year. According to ``The Truth About Witchcraft'' by Scott 
Cunningham, pagans in general believe in reincarnation and reject 
orthodox Christian concepts of heaven and hell, sin, salvation and 
the Trinity. Also, they revere Mother Earth, believe God is 
feminine and masculine, and often are uninhibited about their 
bodies, the book said.

 *Woman dies on Easter pilgrimage    	
</P>
<P>
	SHIPROCK, N.M. (AP) -- A woman who was to have been baptized  
Easter Weekend was killed on an annual 15-mile Good Friday walk 
when a car swerved into a group of pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, Janine Franklin, a 31-year-old mother of three, was  
part of a group walking along U.S. 64 from Sacred Heart Parish in 
Waterflow to Christ the King Parish in Shiprock. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Amos Joe, 50, of Hogback, was arrested by Navajo  
Nation police on suspicion of driving while under the influence and 
driving without a license. Investigators said Joe had a blood 
alcohol level of .28. The legal limit in New Mexico is .08. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is just a very, very tragic and sad thing because  
she was going to be baptized tomorrow night,'' the Rev. John Paul 
Sauter of Christ the King Catholic Church said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was just getting into the religion, and so she wanted to  
do everything ... I conditionally baptized her and anointed her, 
but she was dead.''

 *Religion is part of relief effort    	
</P>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Franklin Graham, son of the Rev.  
Billy Graham, makes no apology for focusing on Jesus during relief 
missions worldwide despite those who criticize efforts to 
evangelize to needy people. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is leader of Samaritan's Purse, an international relief  
organization. He spoke recently at Wake Forest University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who said life's fair?'' he asked. ``I'll take every  
opportunity I get to tell people about Jesus Christ. While we're 
freely giving out the medicine and food, we're running our 
mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham encouraged students to follow God in whatever they do.

 *A tale of a Muslim and a guide dog    	
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A Muslim cab driver refused to pick up a blind  
woman and her guide dog on religious grounds, and now the city must 
issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state laws guarantee guide dogs access to all public  
places and vehicles, but the First Amendment protects religious 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The city must deal with a complaint filed in February by Annie  
McEachrin against Hassan Taher. McEachrin, blind since birth, has a 
constant companion, a black Lab named Jessica. Taher, who adheres 
strictly to Islamic law, says his religion considers dogs impure. 
</P>
<P>
	Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American  
Islamic Relations in Washington, said, ``The driver ... acted in 
good faith. He's acted in accordance with his religious beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McEachrin, 43, is a talking-book coordinator and public  
relations representative for the Cincinnati Association for the 
Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want it to seem like I'm bitter about this,'' she  
said. ``I'm more concerned about people with disabilities being 
treated fairly.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-LSU Running Back Avoids Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- NFL prospect Cecil Collins avoided  
prison by pleading guilty Thursday to charges he fondled two women 
in their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back who dazzled football fans during a brief career  
at LSU will be on probation for four years -- but will probably also 
play in the NFL during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea bargain, Collins pleaded guilty to two  
misdemeanor counts of simple battery and two felony counts of 
unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. He had faced more than 
10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has learned from this,'' Collins' lawyer Rodney Baum said.  
``Cecil doesn't take anything for granted now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added assistant district attorney Sue Bernie: ``This is  
appropriate since he's a first-time offender and the victims and 
their families are satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a possible first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft  
on April 10, must also be tested for drugs every week, give $2,500 
to a women's shelter, perform 300 hours of community service and 
stay away from LSU for the length of his probation. He is allowed 
to leave Louisiana only for employment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Collins said he would meet the conditions but  
refused to comment further. The two women, ages 17 and 18, are LSU 
students and lived in the same apartment complex as Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Diesel'' for his powerful running style, Collins  
played in only four games at LSU before breaking his leg. He gained 
at least 172 yards in each of his three starts for the Tigers. He 
was kicked off the football team in June 1998 following his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins transferred to McNeese State after leaving LSU, but was  
kicked off that school's team two games into the season when he 
failed a drug test.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Williams Visits Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- One of the byproducts of the latest delay in  
finding an owner for the Washington Redskins is that general 
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner are finally assured 
they'll conduct next weekend's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	One player they'd love to have, Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams, visited Redskin Park on Thursday. Given that the top 
three picks could all be quarterbacks, the Texas running back could 
fall to the Redskins, who pick No. 5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in a position to trade up, and we will not trade  
up,'' Casserly said. ``However, there is a scenario that he could 
be there at No. 5, and it would very hard to pass up a player of 
Ricky Williams' potential at the fifth pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Casserly and Williams talked football, communications  
executive Daniel Snyder was across town working the phones to put 
together a group to buy the Redskins. His partners will include 
publishing executives Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, and he hopes 
to have a proposal ready as soon as the bidding is reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a junior partner in an $800 million bid that was  
withdrawn at a meeting of league owners in Atlanta on Thursday 
after it became obvious it would not get the votes necessary for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	New York real estate developer and New York Islanders part-owner  
Howard Milstein was unable to put together a financial plan that 
satisfied many owners, and others were concerned about Milstein's 
business style and whether he would become a maverick. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, who had become disenchanted with Milstein because of the  
approval problems, plans to be the top man in his new group. First, 
however, the trustees of the estate of late owner Jack Kent Cooke, 
working with the NFL, must establish the rules for the next round 
of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees have the option of throwing open the bidding to  
anyone, limiting it to those who bid last time or taking the first 
bid that matches the $800 million Milstein-Snyder offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of the trustees did not return calls from The  
Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Milstein-Snyder group prevailed, Casserly and Turner  
might not have survived the change in ownership, negating the 
hundreds of hours of planning they've put into the April 17-18 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they at least have the comfort of knowing their plan will be  
put into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn to live with things in life,'' Casserly said of the  
uncertainty. ``You just have to adjust to what happens. You can't 
complain about it. I think it's important for everyone to stay 
focused on the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins probable first-round choice is Georgia cornerback  
Champ Bailey, but Williams becomes the automatic selection if he's 
still around. If he is, Bailey might be gone anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be a disappointment to Williams, who feels he should  
be the No. 1 overall pick. He recently dropped 20 pounds to satisfy 
concerns that he had put on too much weight, and says his 
appearance -- he showed up Friday sporting nose jewelry and 
dreadlocks -- gives his detractors more ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be being foolish,'' Williams said. ``But it seems like  
because I'm the way I am and I do things the way I want to do them 
and I'm not really a conformist, that people don't want to see me 
succeed sometimes.''

<HEADLINE> Cards' Abbott 0-for-2 in Majors Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Abbott said merely making contact in his  
first major league at-bat wasn't a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who was born with only one hand, wondered what all the  
fuss was about Thursday after he received a standing ovation for 
grounding out to third in the Milwaukee Brewers' 9-4 loss to the 
St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice acknowledgment from the fans,'' said Abbott, who  
went 0-for-2. ``But I can't say I take a lot of pride getting 
fisted off the hands and getting applause for it. I'd rather do 
something and feel a little more deserving of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, Abbott played exclusively in the American  
League, where a designated hitter bats instead of the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He grounded out against Kent Mercker in the third inning and  
took a called third strike in the fourth. It took a perfect play by 
third baseman Fernando Tatis to catch him by a half-step on a 
chopper that started the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been a trivia question,'' Mercker said. ``The  
guy's a great athlete and I don't take anybody for granted. I had 
to treat him like every other hitter in that lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott didn't exactly treat Mercker like every other pitcher.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen too many lefties, so he looked like Randy  
Johnson out there,'' he said. ``Kent wasn't throwing real hard, but 
to me he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker found the Johnson reference amusing.  
</P>
<P>
	``He might have to get (the bat) started a little earlier on  
Randy,'' Mercker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott hopes his hitting -- like his pitching -- becomes less of a  
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything I'll look back on and cherish, that's for  
sure,'' he said. ``Hopefully I can improve and make a little better 
contact next time out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Abbott, Brewers manager Phil Garner didn't think it was a  
big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't surprise me with him,'' Garner said. ``He swung  
the bat OK in spring training and got a hit. He'll handle the bat 
OK. He'll do fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was 1-for-4 at the plate during spring training with two  
groundouts, a flyout, a sacrifice bunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Balancing the bat with his right arm, he singled off Seattle's  
Butch Henry in spring training March 10 -- his third career hit in 
spring training. On March 28, 1992, he singled for the Yankees off 
Florida's Mike Myers, now a Brewers teammate. On March 18, 1991, he 
tripled for the Angels against San Francisco's Rick Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who signed with the Brewers in January, had been looking  
forward to being a complete player for the first time since high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun,'' he said. ``I enjoyed getting out there between  
innings and thinking about something else rather than pitching. It 
feels a little bit more like when you're a kid playing. You get to 
play all the aspects.''

<HEADLINE> Starr To Testify at Senate Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the  
three-judge panel that appointed him are set to testify April 14 on 
whether Congress should renew or let die the law that provided for 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr on Wednesday said he looked forward to testifying.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. Fred  
Thompson, R-Tenn., will hear from Starr and federal judges Richard 
D. Cudahy, Peter T. Fay and David B. Sentelle, the panel announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has pledged to keep the hearings from focusing on  
Starr's controversial, five-year investigation of President 
Clinton, which led to the second presidential impeachment in 
history. The Senate acquitted Clinton on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Thompson has called former independent counsels and  
scholars to three hearings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Starr's efforts that brought Democrats into line with  
Republicans long infuriated with loopholes in the 1978 statute. The 
rare bipartisan agreement has built momentum for letting the law 
expire June 30 or renewing it only with a major overhaul. But with 
no consensus emerging for how to fix the statute, the law seems 
headed for expiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the statute's weaknesses, critics say, is that it doesn't  
hold independent counsels accountable for the money they spend or 
the tactics they use. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, critics contend the three-judge Special Division of  
the Court of Appeals, which hires independent counsels, is 
ill-equipped to make such appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel whose Iran-Contra probe  
of President Reagan soured Republicans on the law, told Thompson's 
panel last month that a special agency within the Justice 
Department should appoint independent counsels. The panel members 
should be subject to Senate confirmation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the Independent Counsel law, such probes would revert to  
the Justice Department -- which is how they were handled when the 
``Saturday Night Massacre'' occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	That night in October 1973, Justice's top two officials lost  
their jobs for refusing to carry out President Nixon's order to 
fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the 
Watergate break-in. Attorney General Elliot Richardson quit and 
Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was fired. Solicitor 
General Robert Bork fired Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leon Jaworski was appointed Nov. 1 to replace Cox as special  
prosecutor, and four months later, an indictment was returned 
against seven former presidential aides in connection with the 
Watergate cover-up. Nixon was named as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. Justice Department officials say that experience 
shows the country does not need the Independent Counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several committee members predict that no Justice  
Department probe, headed by a politically appointed attorney 
general, would carry credibility with the public.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Can't Reach Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators came close,  
but in the end they weren't able to overcome all the obstacles to 
achieving a comprehensive agreement that would throw open China's 
vast market to American exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji were able to  
strike smaller deals benefiting U.S. citrus farmers, wheat growers 
in the Pacific Northwest and beef, pork and poultry producers. 
</P>
<P>
	But four days of marathon talks did not produce the overall deal  
that Zhu had hoped would be the centerpiece of his American visit, 
a market-opening package that would win U.S. support for China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. and Chinese officials tried to put the best face on  
the failure, pledging to keep working to close the remaining gaps 
so that China will be able to gain WTO membership by November when 
the Geneva-based trade organization is scheduled to launch a new 
round of global trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made significant progress toward bringing China into the  
World Trade Organization on fair commercial terms, but we are not 
there yet,'' Clinton told reporters at a joint news conference with 
Zhu on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the agriculture agreements, the United States won  
agreements from China to double the number of airline flights 
between the two countries as well as promises from China to crack 
down on piracy of computer programs and to expand sales 
opportunities for American insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more tantalizing for American companies, both countries  
released a lengthy list of market-opening commitments Chinese 
negotiators made in hopes of winning the comprehensive WTO deal. 
Those commitments won't become binding until the United States 
drops its objections and allows China to enter the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	But by publishing the commitments China is willing to make, the  
administration is hoping to win the backing of U.S. businesses for 
what will be a tough battle in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	China must win annual approval for its goods to be imported into  
the United States under normal tariffs applied to other countries. 
But if China gained WTO membership, Congress would have to pass 
legislation to eliminate this annual tariff approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	The record $57 billion U.S. trade deficit with China and new  
allegations about Chinese thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets have given 
added ammunition to opponents of Clinton's policy of engagement 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the political  
hurdles in the United States made it all the more important that 
U.S. negotiators win the very best WTO deal possible. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major sticking points that prevented agreement this  
week was China's refusal to accept a demand that the United States 
have the right to impose unilateral trade sanctions on China for a 
period of years after it enters the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was unwilling to relent on this point,  
fearing opponents would charge that the United States had given up 
its right to enforce China's trade commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas where China's market-opening offers were deemed  
insufficient were banking, especially the ability of U.S. firms to 
offer auto loans to Chinese consumers, sales of stocks and other 
securities and distribution rights for American-made movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the United States was demanding extra protection for U.S.  
textile and apparel manufacturers by requiring China to submit to 
quotas for five years longer than any other WTO members. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying for 13 years to win entry in the WTO and  
the organization that preceded it, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Various industry groups that have been hoping for agreement as a  
way to increase sales in China's vast market urged the 
administration to push ahead to a final agreement in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great strides have been made in the right direction. What's  
important now is that we maintain our negotiating momentum,'' said 
Dianne Sullivan, director of trade policy for the National 
Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But AFL-CIO President John Sweeney warned, ``China's history of  
not living up to agreements is strong cause for skepticism. 
Effective compliance mechanisms are essential to any agreement that 
may be reached.''

<HEADLINE> Hatteras Lighthouse May Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- The last obstacle to moving the Cape  
Hatteras Lighthouse, the nation's tallest, fell this week when a 
county dropped its lawsuit seeking to block its relocation in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Dare County Attorney Al Cole said Wednesday that county  
commissioners voted 6-0 against appealing the decision of a federal 
judge who declined to halt the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle ruled that Dare  
County officials and motel owner John Hooper failed to show that 
moving the lighthouse would increase beach erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much need to keep spending good money after  
bad,'' Cole said of Monday's vote. ``We'll be dropping our suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A citizens' group, Save Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Committee, has  
given up as well, said chairman Hugh Morton of Linville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess this is the end of it. I think it's a tragedy for the  
state,'' Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service is preparing to move the 208-foot-high  
beacon a half-mile inland. Continuing beach erosion threatens to 
undermine and topple the structure at its current location. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Boyle also said if he temporarily halted the  
move, the black-and-white candy-striped lighthouse could be left 
unmoored and exposed to hurricanes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the lighthouse's base has been cut away and the  
rest should be removed by the end of April, said Skellie Hunt, a 
spokesman for International Chimney of Buffalo, N.Y., the moving 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	International Chimney plans to start moving the lighthouse to  
its new home in late May or early June. The lighthouse will 
gradually be raised by more than 100 hydraulic jacks and then moved 
on steel rollers atop a bed of steel tracks. The move is expected 
to take four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	All the outbuildings at the historic light station -- two  
keepers' quarters, three cisterns and an oil house -- have been 
moved to the new location 1,600 feet from the Atlantic Ocean. The 
lighthouse now stands just 120 feet from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacon, completed in 1870, once helped sailors navigate the  
often treacherous waters off Cape Hatteras, known as the 
``Graveyard of the Atlantic.'' But the light was seldom relied upon 
as a navigation tool in recent years because of the availability of 
high-tech aids.

<HEADLINE> Top Space Station Officials Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA says the resignations of the  
two top administrators for the space station have nothing to do 
with lengthy delays in the project or problems with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for the  
international space station, is leaving NASA later this month to 
return to private industry, the agency announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, NASA said space station program manager  
Randy Brinkley will leave by month's end for a job in the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said both departures are for  
personal reasons and have nothing to do with any space station 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley has managed the space station program at Johnson Space  
Center in Houston since 1994. McClain has headed up the project at 
NASA headquarters in Washington since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its economic turmoil, Russia is 1 1/2 years late in  
launching a crucial power module to the international space station 
that will double as the crew quarters. Until that module flies, no 
components can be added to the two pieces that were hoisted into 
orbit late last year.

<HEADLINE> March Retail Sales Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales at the nation's biggest retailers surged  
well above expectations in March, with a healthy U.S. economy and 
record-breaking pace on Wall Street encouraging Americans to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants, who reported their sales figures on Thursday, also  
said that they benefited from an early Easter, which shifted much 
of the holiday buying -- from candy eggs to floral sundresses -- into 
March from April a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong results, which were the best since last April and  
followed surprisingly robust gains in February, raised speculation 
that first-quarter earnings will top analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans feel secure, they feel confident and their spending  
patterns show it,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant and 
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 8.4 percent in March. It rose 4.5 percent in February and was up 
3.9 percent in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales have been rising steadily in recent months thanks  
to the resilient U.S. economy, now in the ninth year of an 
expansion. Consumer confidence is at near-record highs, while 
unemployment and inflation levels remain at their lowest levels in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the stock market has resumed its march into record  
territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average crossing the 
10,000 mark for the first time last month and other indexes 
reaching new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow rose 112.39 to 10,197.70, its third record  
close this week. The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 also climbed to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling of wealth out there right now due to the  
stock market being as high as it is,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs 
the retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. ``That's helped make 
the last few months fabulous for retailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the  
number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose by 
11,000 last week but remained below 300,000 for the 10th 
consecutive week. That's the longest such stretch since 1973 and a 
reflection of the nation's 4.2 percent unemployment rate, a 29-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount chains fared the best in March, outpacing all other  
retail formats. Shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Kmart and 
Target for their wide selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reporting big gains last month were specialty clothing  
chains, such as Gap and Limited. Sales at consumer electronics 
chains rose sharply, as did revenues at stores offering home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specialty retailers and discounters definitely found the  
golden eggs in March,'' said Tara Schuchmann, who runs the 
Dallas-based hedge fund Tara Capital Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The only weakness was spotted at moderately priced department  
stores such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Co., which have 
lost business to the lower-priced discounters. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts were impressed with the March figures, some won't  
judge the performance until April's results are in hand because 
Easter came a week earlier this year and helped March sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also warned that global financial turmoil could begin to  
threaten American prosperity at any time in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have a good quarter and probably a good six  
months ahead,'' Barnard said. ``But what's to come will largely 
depend on what happens overseas over the next six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 18.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.1 percent, total sales down 2.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.1 percent, total sales up 10.1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.7  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 16.8 percent, 
total sales rose 9.7 percent.

<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 12.9 percent, total sales up  
17.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Test Y2K Computer Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Saturday night, the Federal Aviation  
Administration will try the first live test of its Year 2000 
air-traffic-control computer fixes. Officials hope for a better 
debut than the Denver airport's bag-shredding computerized luggage 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday and early Sunday, the agency plans to split the  
computers controlling air traffic around the airport and spin the 
clock ahead to Jan. 1, 2000, in half of the systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar systems will track both commercial flights and an FAA  
Lear Jet flying over Grand Junction, in western Colorado; Denver, 
on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains; and Colorado Springs, 
located to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	During the four-hour test, technicians will check computer  
software changes designed to solve the Y2K problem. Early computer 
programs used a two-digit format to read dates, and there has been 
widespread concern about problems when the year changes from ``99'' 
to ``00,'' which unrepaired computers may construe as 1900 instead 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For safety's sake, the FAA plane and the small amount of  
commercial traffic expected during the midnight hours will be 
tracked by air traffic control systems not participating in the 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the computers will be rejoined and tapes from both  
sides will be sent to the agency's technical center in Atlantic 
City, N.J., for comparison. The results will be released next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver International Airport was chosen for the test because its  
computers can be split and track flights on parallel systems. The 
airport gained some infamy when it opened in 1995 for its $5 
billion pricetag and an automated baggage system that had a 
propensity to chew up luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extremely important test to the national airspace  
system,'' said Ray Long, head of the FAA's Y2K program. Long said 
he doesn't anticipate problems, but if they are encountered, 
``That's why you do testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, more than 600 million people -- and billions worth of  
goods and mail -- travel through U.S. skies. All do so with the aid 
of the FAA's computerized air traffic control system. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, many people have sworn off flying over the New  
Year's holiday, including the chief executive officer and other top 
officials at Australia's Qantas Airlines. The carrier has never had 
a fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be at our headquarters stone cold sober watching what  
happens and ready to take quick actions,'' Qantas CEO James Strong 
said Thursday in Adelaide, Australia, in a speech to a national 
meeting of accountants. ``The last place I'd want a key executive 
to be is in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there may be some glitches, the FAA is confident planes  
will not fall out of the sky as 1999 turns to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The more likely result is that air traffic controllers will  
spread planes apart to enlarge existing safety buffers, reducing 
the system's efficiency and creating flight delays. The timing is 
especially troublesome, since the century will change as Friday 
turns to Saturday on a busy holiday travel weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The live test is an important benchmark and public relations  
challenge for the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the agency in particular and the Transportation Department  
in general have received failing grades from Congress, the General 
Accounting Office and the department's own inspector general over 
Year 2000 preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA missed a March 31 deadline, by which time the Clinton  
administration had wanted all ``mission critical'' government 
computer systems to be repaired, tested and operational. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March 31, only 108 of the 151 FAA mission critical systems  
had received the necessary repairs and tests, for a 72 percent 
completion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who will join Long for this  
weekend's test, has declared the agency will complete its work by 
June 30. To demonstrate their confidence in the repairs, Garvey and 
Long plan to fly coast-to-coast on New Year's Eve, hitting the Year 
2000 crossover repeatedly as travel through the continent's four 
time zones.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Unemployment Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- Germany's jobs crisis eased slightly  
in March, with unemployment dropping to 11.1 percent from 11.6 
percent the month before, the Federal Labor Office reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4.29 million people were unemployed, 176,400 fewer than in  
February, although joblessness remained more severe in Germany's 
east, which is still recovering from the switch from communism to a 
market economy begun in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment in the five eastern states was 18.4 percent, or  
1.39 million people, compared with 19.1 percent last month. 
Unemployment in the more prosperous and populous west was 9.3 
percent, or 2.9 million people, a drop from 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor office president Bernhard Jagoda attributed the  
improvement in part to the onset of spring weather, a boon to 
outdoor industries such as construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the seasonal factors, however, the labor office said  
the jobs situation in Germany was unchanged from last month. But 
March's figures were still an improvement over the same time last 
year, when unemployment was 12.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has made job creation a the key  
mission of his first year in office, after winning election last 
September on promises to end unemployment that had risen to 
post-war record highs.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Hold Below 7 Percent / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages declined slightly this week, holding under 7 
percent for the third consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was 6.92 percent, down from 6.98 percent the two  
previous weeks, the mortgage company Freddie Mac said Thursday. So 
far this year, rates have fluctated between 6.74 percent at the end 
of January and 7.11 percent in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.53 percent this week, a six-week low and down from 6.58 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.59 percent, an eight-week low and down 
from 5.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged around 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Seeks Albanian Speakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Viola Soter's cousin phoned to ask her to  
give up the creature comforts in Florida to help Kosovar refugees 
in Cuba, the retiree didn't give it a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goodness, with so much of that suffering going on, and the  
need is so great, that anything I can do to help, I'm perfectly 
willing to help,'' Ms. Soter said from her home in Belle Air Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she and her husband, Michael, are both in their 60s,  
they're ready to bring their much-needed Albanian language skills 
to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Clinton administration announced that as many as  
20,000 refugees will be taken to Cuba in the coming days. Although 
the U.S. government hasn't yet asked the Red Cross for help, a 
spokeswoman said the agency is expecting the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross chapters in other cities with large Albanian-American  
populations, including New York, Detroit and Philadelphia, may 
follow Boston's lead and request volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Soters, along with a dozen college students, will go through  
a day or two of Red Cross training and then spend a month providing 
meals, clothing, first aid and a sympathetic ear to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult when you're handing someone a package of dried  
soup and the instructions are in a language they don't 
understand,'' said Paul Healy, spokesman for the American Red Cross 
in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. authorities are busy setting up wood frame  
canvas tents in Cuba and preparing to help Eastern European 
refugees adjust to life in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	A Naval psychological intervention team staffed with  
psychologists and mental health workers, as well as the military's 
sole Muslim chaplain in the region, have been reassigned to 
Guantanamo.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Stay Under 300,000 / Jobless Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans claiming unemployment  
benefits rose last week but remained at less than 300,000 for the 
10th consecutive week, the longest such stretch in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 299,000 Americans filed applications for  
unemployment checks, up 11,000 from the week before the Labor 
Department said today. A four-week moving average of jobless claims 
rose by 1,750 to 295,250. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 weeks of initial claims of less than 300,000 marked the  
longest such stretch since 1973, reflecting the fact that the 
nation's unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in March, was at a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	However, separately, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., a  
Chicago-based job-search firm, said Wednesday that publicly 
announced job cuts totaled 68,984 in March, up 11 percent from 
February and nearly triple the 23,028 announced in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have companies today that show very little reluctance to  
jettison people,'' said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief 
executive. ``They also show no hesitation to hire and create 
jobs.''

<HEADLINE> NATO-Bombed Bridges Clutter Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- NATO's bombing of bridges along the Danube in  
Yugoslavia have left huge chunks of concrete in the river, jamming 
up freighter and barge traffic along the 1,750-mile artery that 
stretches from Germany through the Balkans to the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the Danube valley, shippers were scrambling to find  
alternative routes for cargo stuck on ships now unable to reach 
their destinations now that the river has been severed at Novi Sad, 
Yugoslavia's second largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overnight, half of my business is at a standstill,'' said Hans  
Frank, manager of a holding company in the southern town of 
Regensburg in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank, whose firm Gerhard Meyer handles transport for companies  
in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, said Thursday that 60 of 
his 155 ships are stuck on either side of Novi Sad, where two 
bridges were completely destroyed by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the allies targeted an old iron bridge below Novi Sad's  
18th-century castle; a large piece now lies in a section of river 
yards wide. Completely blocking the Danube is the modern, white 
concrete bridge that was hit next. Bombs split it in two, with both 
sides falling into the water. A third bridge hit did not collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockage separates downstream countries such as Romania and  
Bulgaria from upstream Western nations like Germany and Austria. It 
was also stalling ships coming and going from the Black Sea, many 
of them carrying iron ore from Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a terrible situation for us, because we can only use the  
Danube,'' said Frank, whose stranded vessels are carrying iron ore, 
steel, wood and fertilizer. ``And all the countries along the 
Danube are affected by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those countries are Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary,  
Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine. In Romania, 
Mircea Toader, vice-president of the Association of Ship Owners and 
Port Operators, estimated that Romanian and foreign shipping 
companies had a total 60,000 tons of merchandise stuck on the 
Danube west of Novi Sad. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying part of that merchandise are 126 Romanian barges and 18  
other transport vessels, Toader was quoted as saying Thursday by 
the private Mediafax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipping agencies are seeking alternate land routes using trains  
and trucks, Frank said, but that is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Railways in Romania and Hungary are expected to sign an  
agreement granting each other preferential fares to get the trapped 
goods moving to western destinations. But transportation prices 
will still likely increase to $4 per ton from $2. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at the Austrian Transport Ministry, who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, said the NATO strikes have hurt Danube 
shipping just as it was recovering after a long slump caused by 
embargoes against Yugoslavia during the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary, Romania and Ukraine are probably the worst hit by the  
crisis, as all have a large volume of trade on the river, said 
Laszlo Koszonits, the chief of a Hungarian state shipping company, 
Mahart. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the U.N. embargo against Yugoslavia it was very bad.  
But then it slowly cleared up,'' said Koszonits, who estimated his 
company is losing $12,000 a day from stalled traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem now is that we can't see the end of this  
one,'' he said. ``We don't know how long it will last.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Sits Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken missed a second straight game  
Thursday, but he said his sore back feels much better and he has no 
intention of going on the disabled list for the first time in his 
19-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' Ripken said before the Baltimore Orioles  
lost to Tampa Bay 6-3. ``Today I'm bouncing around real well and 
eager to put the uniform on and start swinging. But it just makes 
sense to go one more day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, left Monday's opener against Tampa Bay in the third  
inning with stiffness in his back. He watched Wednesday's game from 
the dugout, the first time he missed a game due to injury since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 20, Ripken voluntarily ended his record consecutive  
games streak of 2,632 by sitting out the Orioles' final home game 
against the New York Yankees. He then played the final seven games 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's back loosened up considerably by Thursday, but he was  
omitted from the starting lineup after discussing his options with 
manager Ray Miller and trainer Richie Bancells. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm popping around and I'm sure I can do a lot of things,''  
Ripken said. ``But when you think about it from an intelligent 
viewpoint, I probably shouldn't do anything dumb and (should) give 
myself one more day. That was the advice given to me and that's 
what I'm going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken did not take batting practice, and Miller avoided the  
temptation to use him as a pinch-hitter Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to rest and continue to get treatment. Using him  
tonight would defeat the purpose of giving him another day,'' 
Miller said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken had not missed two straight games since shortly after he  
joined the Orioles for the first time in August 1981. He sat out 
the last 12 games of the season, and the following May began his 
record-breaking streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken didn't like watching from the dugout then, and he doesn't  
like doing it now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very agonizing and tough thing to sit and watch the  
game,'' he said. ``Every minute you want to be in there, though it 
will probably feel even worse tonight because I know I'm better 
today than yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Frank Wren said the Orioles will wait and see  
before determining whether Ripken would be better served by 
spending time on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second five days, if it doesn't make any progress then  
that's when you DL him,'' Wren said. ``That's when you start 
getting serious about saying, `We have to think about replacing 
him.'''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Vikings' Goodwin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins signed Minnesota tight end  
Hunter Goodwin to an offer sheet Thursday, the team's second 
pursuit of a restricted free agent in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Miami lost a bid for center Casey Wiegmann when  
Chicago matched the Dolphins' offer of $1.4 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings have seven days to match Goodwin's three-year deal.  
Financial terms were not disclosed, though reports said the deal 
was worth $2.5 million, including a $750,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Vikings do not match the offer, they will receive Miami's  
fourth-round draft pick as compensation. Goodwin was Minnesota's 
fourth-round selection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 26, played 15 games for the Vikings last season as a  
backup to Andrew Glover. He caught three passes for 16 yards and is 
better known for his blocking. In three seasons, he has 11 catches 
for 101 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins also re-signed linebacker Anthony Harris to a  
two-year contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 26, played only five games last season after spraining  
his left knee in training camp and losing his starting spot to 
Robert Jones. He recorded no tackles.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodding Congress to pass a ``patients bill of  
rights,'' President Clinton will use a Philadelphia pep rally 
Friday to extend new health care protections to federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will also announce a new ``Internet petition,''  
where computer users can register their support for new regulations 
that would mandate that HMOs and other managed care plans provide 
the same benefits to all covered patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures that Clinton intends to release show that a package of  
several new benefits for 9 million federal employees will cost less 
than $10 per person each year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new provisions requires health plans to release a  
host of information about how they pay doctors, customer 
satisfaction and the quality of doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The other requires plans to let patients stay with their doctors  
for 90 days, even if the doctor is dropped from the network, if 
they are in the middle of a treatment or pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already extended the same provisions to patients in  
Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House hopes that the real-life experience with federal  
workers will blunt GOP arguments that new requirements drive up 
costs. The 285 health plans that serve federal workers also serve 
private citizens, officials note, and they are providing these 
guarantees for just a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world has not stopped turning,'' said Chris Jennings,  
Clinton's top health policy aide. ``The same things can be applied 
for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will be joined in Philadelphia by about 18 congressional  
Democrats pushing his ``patients bill of rights'' legislation. 
Another 90 Democrats plan similar events in 32 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are going to take this fight on the road,'' said  
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``We're going to use the latest 
technology, this information superhighway, to give voice to the 
people in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial -- and most expensive -- provision that  
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health 
plans and collect damages when they withhold treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	An equally contentious provision that would require health plans  
to pay for ``medically necessary'' care, as determined by doctors. 
Clinton doesn't have the power to unilaterally extend either of 
those provisions to the federal workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration already has required that health plans  
covering government workers pay for reasonable emergency room trips 
and allow patients to see specialists outside the network if needed 
and obstetricians-gynecologists without a referral. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee approved a more limited HMO bill last month,  
but there's been no action in the House yet. Democrats complain 
that bill would cover only about 48 million Americans who are in 
health plans regulated solely by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of new federal legislation complained that any  
increase in costs is significant for many Americans and said the 
Democratic bill would simply ``open the door to more lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps trial lawyers who pocket most of the money, but  
does nothing to help patients get proper care when needed,'' said 
Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, which has 
run television ads in 19 states over the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new petition Clinton is announcing is housed on the Web site  
of the consumer group Families USA. Up for about a week, it had 
more than 4,000 signatures Thursday afternoon. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- Frederick W. Carr, a World War II pilot  
and former prisoner of war, died Monday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr enlisted in the Army Air Corps when he turned 21 and then  
joined the 8th Army Air Force, 489th Bomber Group and the 846th 
Squadron, flying out of England. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 25, 1944, while flying his 18th mission, Carr was shot  
down near Gisors, France. He survived, and the French Underground 
hid him in Etrepagney, providing him with false identity papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr worked for a time with E.J. Hugel, mayor of Etrepagney and  
a leader in the underground. But during an attempt to escape 
occupied territory and rejoin the Allied Forces, he was captured by 
the Gestapo. 
</P>
<P>
	He was incarcerated in Fresnes Prison in Paris, then sent to the  
Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. After four months, he was 
transferred to a prisoner of war camp in Poland, Stalag Luft III. 
</P>
<P>
	With other prisoners, he walked 500 miles to Munich to be  
liberated by U.S. Gen. George Patton on April 27, 1945. He later 
testified at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Ala. Tornado Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCK CREEK, Ala. (AP) -- The girls' softball team practices on a  
dusty, red field in a park that was littered with debris from a 
deadly tornado last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach and her daughter lost their home to the storm. The  
catcher, right fielder and first baseman lost their school. And the 
second baseman attended church with six people who were killed, 
including a 7-year-old boy who played baseball at the same park. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a year of pain and heartache caused by the tornado, the  
girls nodded in agreement this spring when somebody suggested an 
odd name for their team: the Rock Creek Twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all just decided on the Twisters, since we all went through  
it,'' said pitcher Cheree Melton, 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marks the one-year anniversary of the tornado that killed  
32 people and injured about 260 when it raged through the county 
that surrounds Birmingham with winds of nearly 300 mph. Two more 
people died in a smaller tornado in St. Clair County, to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twisters plan to spend the anniversary at Hoover  
Metropolitan Stadium, where they will get to run on the field 
tonight with Birmingham's minor-league baseball team, the Barons. 
</P>
<P>
	Others will mark the occasion somberly. Carol Blankenship helped  
organize a memorial service and candlelight procession through her 
neighborhood, where seven people died. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that our event will make a little better memory for  
people on future April eighths,'' said Mrs. Blankenship, whose home 
was destroyed by the twister. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health workers have encouraged survivors to do something  
to mark the anniversary of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been doing a lot of work in the school system ...  
talking to (children) about the things they may be feeling,'' said 
Lisa Turley of the county mental health authority. ``Parents, 
seeing their children working to recover, are trying to recover on 
their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recovering from the tornado is one thing. Forgetting is another:  
There are too many reminders. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees are budding with new life, but the 31-mile-long path of  
the tornado is still clearly visible. A half-mile-wide swath of 
bare ground and splintered trees is strewn with little pieces of 
housing shingles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Chapman is still amazed by the storm's power as she drives  
past damaged trees and homes while taking her daughter, shortstop 
Curry Chapman, to softball practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado missed the Chapman family, but just being around so  
much death and destruction is an emotional drain. Mrs. Chapman was 
happy when the girls decided to poke fun at their shared experience 
by choosing ``Twisters'' for a name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sign of healing,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Hooters' Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Hooters' process for resolving worker  
disputes is so biased in the restaurant chain's favor that it makes 
fair arbitration of employee complaints impossible, a federal 
appeals court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals clears the way for a sexual harassment 
lawsuit by Annette R. Phillips, a former Myrtle Beach, S.C., 
waitress and bartender. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses can ask employees to resolve disputes through  
arbitration to avoid costly lawsuits. But U.S. District Judge 
Cameron Currie of Florence, S.C., ruled last March that Hooters' 
system ``fails miserably to satisfy even the most basic 
requirements of a commercially reasonable arbitration scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hooters appealed to the 4th Circuit, which also found the  
Georgia-based company's arbitration procedure flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``By promulgating this system of warped rules, Hooters so skewed  
the process in its favor that Phillips has been denied arbitration 
in any meaningful sense of the word,'' Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 
III wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Hooters' arbitration rules require the  
complaining employee, but not the company, to provide a list of 
witnesses. They also give the company control of the selection of 
the three-person arbitration panel and allow Hooters, but not the 
employee, to expand the scope of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hooters rules when taken as a whole ... are so one-sided  
that their only possible purpose is to undermine the neutrality of 
the proceeding,'' Wilkinson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Phillips alleges a former manager exposed himself, flashed  
his underwear and made waitresses play ``degrading games'' to 
determine which tables they would serve. 
</P>
<P>
	She quit after a relative of a Hooters executive slapped and  
grabbed her buttocks, then threatened her in front of customers, 
the January 1997 suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooters went to federal court to force her into arbitration,  
which she had agreed to in writing, but the court ruled that the 
objectionable rules negated the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Phillips' lawsuit seeks unspecified back pay, benefits,  
reinstatement and compensatory and punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Mogul Creates Catholic School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Domino's Pizza mogul Tom Monaghan, who  
sold the business to devote himself to Roman Catholic causes, is 
spending $50 million to establish a new law school stressing 
traditional Catholic values. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork has signed on as its  
first professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be the West Point for Catholic laity in the  
years to come,'' said Monaghan, who recently sold Domino's for $1 
billion. ``I'm really disappointed in Catholic education in this 
country. It's been secularized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ave Maria School of Law is to open in fall 2000 with about  
40 students but hopes to have more than 400 within six years. Ann 
Arbor, the home of the University of Michigan's main campus, is 35 
miles west of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's emphasis will be on what the Catholic Church sees  
as moral truths, Monaghan said Wednesday. Ave Maria students will 
be taught to incorporate that philosophy in their legal analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law must be founded in a belief that there is an  
objective, moral order. This is something no law school does 
effectively,'' said Bernard Dobranski, who will be Ave Maria's 
dean. He has the same position now at Catholic University's law 
school in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 24 Catholic institutions among the nation's 181 law  
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Ave Maria's board of governors includes former Interior  
Secretary William P. Clark and Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan's strong support for anti-abortion causes led to a  
nationwide boycott of Domino's by the National Organization for 
Women. More recently, he has supervised the construction of a 
cathedral in Nicaragua, built a mission in Honduras and created 
Catholic schools in the Ann Arbor area.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Illegal Viagra Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Workers at two Manhattan businesses were  
arrested Thursday on federal charges they sold Viagra without a 
prescription, part of an effort to curb illegal sales of the male 
impotence drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Yao Shen, Victor Yin and Wei Zhang were brought to U.S. District  
Court in Manhattan, where lawyers arranged their release on $20,000 
bail after a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin 
Nathaniel Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart Magee, special agent in charge of the FDA office in  
Jersey City, N.J., said the investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing more and more cases that involve Viagra,'' Magee  
said, describing it as one of many drugs that are diverted to 
illegal markets. ``It's become a very popular drug for diversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the arrests were necessary to protect the public. ``It's  
a public health issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the defendants, all residents of New York City,  
declined to speak to reporters prior to the initial appearances of 
their clients in court. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 30, Yin sold 40 tablets of Viagra at the Gift and Health  
Products Center to an undercover FDA agent for $440 after telling 
the agent that he was a doctor, the FDA alleged in a criminal 
complaint. It said he did not ask for a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 27 at the International Travel Agency, Shen sold two  
bottles of Viagra to an undercover FDA agent for $620 without 
asking for a prescription, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	In another instance at the Gift and Health Products Center, on  
March 10 an undercover agent with the New York State Office of 
Professional Discipline bought a bottle of Viagra from Zhang for 
$320, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the drug sold at the businesses was not much higher  
than the wholesale price of $5 to $6 per pill paid by pharmacies, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the men could face a maximum of three years in  
prison and fines of up to $10,000.

<P>
	BAUCHI, Nigeria (AP) -- Japan beat the United States 3-1 Thursday  
at the FIFA World Youth Championship, putting the Americans in 
danger of first-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans (1-1) are third in Group E with three points,  
trailing Cameroon (2-0) and behind Japan (1-1) on goal difference, 
with the Japanese plus-1 and the Americans minus-1. The top two 
teams in each of the six groups advance to the second round along 
with the four best third-place teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, the Japanese were a very good team and deserved  
the win today,'' U.S. coach Sigi Schmid said. ``We gave them too 
much space to work, and in this type of competition you cannot 
afford to give space. They did very well with their offensive 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which opened with a 1-0 win over England,  
plays Cameroon on Sunday at Bauchi in its final first-round game. 
Cameroon beat England 1-0 earlier Thursday in the under-20 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	With a win, the Americans would advance, and a tie would give  
them a chance depending on Sunday's other games. They also could 
advance with a loss, depending on other results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still very confident that we will advance,'' Schmid said.  
``Cameroon will be a very difficult opponent, but we know that our 
goals in this tournament ride on playing well on Sunday. We will be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, which lost to Cameroon 1-0 in its opener, went ahead of  
the Americans in the 12th minute when Nick Downing accidentally 
redirected a 25-yard drive into the penalty area past goalkeeper 
Nick Rimando into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
	Naohiro Takahara made it 2-0 seven minutes into the second half,  
but Ryan Futagaki, a fourth generation Japanese American, scored 
from 16 yards out off Shaun Tsakaris' corner kick in the 73rd 
minute, pulling the Americans within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsuo Ogasawara got Japan's final goal with five minutes  
remaining.

<HEADLINE> BMW To Make Cars at Russian Plant </HEADLINE>

	MOSCOW (AP) -- BMW plans to make limousines and off-road vehicles  
at a Russian factory in the republic of Kaliningrad, the German 
automaker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first cars are expected to roll off the assembly line this  
summer from the Avtotor plant, said Lueder Paysen, head of BWM's 
executive sales division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Russia will sooner or later become a big  
market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement came the same day that the Russian  
government sought to assure Western businesses that Moscow's 
protests against NATO raids on Yugoslavia wouldn't hurt their 
operations in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avtotor plant will have an annual production capacity of  
10,000 units, but no date has been set for reaching this target. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaliningrad is a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea between  
Lithuania and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to limousines, the plant will make Land Rover  
Defenders, an off-road vehicle in production since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW plans to adapt its Russian-made models to rough local road  
conditions. ``The cars' chassis will be higher and suspension will 
be sturdier than in the models made in Germany,'' Paysen said.
