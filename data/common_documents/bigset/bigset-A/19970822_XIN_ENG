<HEADLINE> Mugabe, Former Fighters Hold Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today began meeting the national leadership of former
freedom fighters who for the past weeks have been pressing
government for liberation war compensation payments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Mugabe's official residence, Zimbabwe House,
comes after hundreds of ex-combatants resorted to picketing
ruling ZANU (PF) party and government offices, including the
presidential residence, demanding disbursement of disability
pensions.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, patron of the Zimbabwe Liberation War Veterans
Association, agreed to meet and hear grievances of ex-combatants
following weeks of unrest among the ranks of former freedom
fighters, which recently saw the looting of the ruling ZANU (PF)
headquarters in Harare and the disruption of commemorations
marking Heroes Day on August 11.
</P>
<P>
Former combatants have been demonstrating since April
following the suspension of war victims compensation payments
after many undeserving people, including ministers and senior
government officials, were found to have been beneficiaries of
the war victims compensation fund, with about 450 million
Zimbabwe Dollars (about 45 million u.s. dollars) parcelled out in
just eight months.
</P>
<P>
In his introductory remarks, Mugabe said he had noted that the
war veterans disapproved of the presence of some high ranking
members of ZANU (PF) and government, but assured ex-combatants
that they did not have enemies either within the ruling party or
in his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
''We may differ in expression of ideas but no one can lift his
hand and say I am opposed to ex-combatants, otherwise he would
not be in my government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he had gone through the eight-point document from
the War Veterans Association and in principle agreed with its
contents.
</P>
<P>
''I have seen your list of grievances and recommendations and
they are in agreement in principle with what is coming from the
government and party. Maybe they might differ in substance,''
said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
After the introductory remarks, the meeting was closed to the
press.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in July Drops in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation dropped 2.3 percentage points to just more than 19
percent in July, surprising most market analysts who expected the
figure to be much higher following a spate of administered price
increases in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The inflation figure declined to 19.1 percent, down from 21.4
percent in June, as analysts warned of severe inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend was again mainly due to falling food prices
which saw prices for fruits and vegetables declining by 17.8
percent between June and July.
</P>
<P>
The overall food basket, which has the largest weighting in
the computation of the consumer price index (cpi), dropped 4.2
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts today warned that inflation could rise
slightly in August as a result of the knock-on effect of recent
wage and salary settlement which averaged 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> High Street Boom in Britain Renews Rate Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- High street sales in Britain are
growing faster than at any time since the economic boom of the
late 1980s, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in July were 6.5 percent up on a year earlier and
higher than expectations in the City of around 5.9 percent. One
City economist said this was the fastest growth rate anywhere in
the world except Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
In the three months from May to July retail sales rose 2.1
percent on the previous quarter, the highest rise since October
1987's 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government economists regard the quarterly figures as a more
reliable indicator of consumer trends. Geoffrey Robinson,
paymaster general, thought the growth rate was "entirely expected"
as consumers spent windfalls from building society flotations.
</P>
<P>
"If there were to be a sustained boom over a long period...
then of course we would review the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that it wanted to wait until the August figures
before deciding whether the growth inspired by spending of
windfall gains from building society and insurance mutual
flotations had begun to slow down.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England, meanwhile, published figures showing that
the broad money supply measure M4 -- cash plus bank and building
society accounts -- rose by 11.8 percent in the year to July, the
highest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Bank warned in its Inflation Report last week that the
current rate of M4 growth "may not be compatible with the
inflation target in the medium term".

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta, Militia Renew Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out today
between the government army and local militiamen known as
Kamajors in southern Sierra Leone, killing one woman and a
soldier.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said the fighting erupted early this
morning at a town 22 miles from bo, the second largest city of
the country, as the kamajors tried to capture the military
garrison in the area.
</P>
<P>
During the five-hour battle, with heavy artillery used by both
sides, the Kamajors were repelled while the military reportedly
captured a number of weapons, including bombs and ak47 automatic
rifles, from the fleeing Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
A source was quoted as saying that the Kamajors, who are well
armed, are backed by the former militia fighters of the defunct
ULIMO-K from neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that military garrisons have been
attacked since the country's coup on May 25 that toppled the
civilian government led by ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Consultation Paper on New Transport Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott Thursday unveiled the government's first thoughts on
an integrated and more environmentally friendly transport
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a discussion document in advance of a White Paper
next Spring, the document poses 27 questions to be answered during
the public consultation period.
</P>
<P>
One of the questions is whether there is "a role for making
greater use of economic instruments to influence how people choose
to travel", which include increasing the price of public parking,
taxing company car parks and charging for the use of roads.
</P>
<P>
Although the document accepts that the car remains an "integral
part of modern society", it believes that a "better balance" is
needed between cars and public transport.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told a news conference that by improving public
transport and giving it priority over the private car, people
could be drawn into using buses and trains.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that he wanted to reverse the trend towards
UK families having two cars, saying "two cars is a symptom of the
failure of the public transport system rather than prosperity".
</P>
<P>
Several concrete suggestions for improving public transport
were made by the consultation paper, which include a new
regulatory framework for Britain's privatized railway system.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that there will be a rise of between 36 and 57
percent in road traffic levels in Britain over the next 20 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- About 12,000 people
marched to the offices of business South Africa here today to
present a memorandum, urging the capitalist side to revise its
positions on clauses of the basic conditions of employment bill.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, all members of Congress of South Africa
Trade Union (COSATU), demanded six months' maternity leave, 16 as
the minimum age for employment, and a 40-hour week, phased in
over five years.
</P>
<P>
It was against children to work under the age of 16 because
they should be at school, COSATU sources said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, thousands of COSATU members held demonstrations in
Pretoria, the administrative capital of the country, to hand over
a memorandum to the labor department, outlining their grievances.
</P>
<P>
Similar actions were organized in other provinces earlier in
the week, informed sources said, noting a 24-hour national strike
would take place soon.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was severely disrupted by the demonstrations. Some
motorists were stuck in traffic for up to an hour, while
municipal buses were also delayed and diverted along alternative
routes, traffic department officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of policemen, some in riot gear, kept watch and
dozens of traffic officials were deployed to cope with
disruptions, they said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Implements Boycott of Israeli Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today began enforcing a boycott of Israeli goods
in protest against Israel's economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Nablus prevented
several trucks from bringing Israeli-made goods into the
city. And in another West Bank city of Tulkarm, shoppers were
ordered by the PNA not to purchase Israeli goods that were
black-listed.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member PNA Cabinet approved last Saturday a gradual
boycott of Israeli goods as a major step to counter the continued
Israeli closure and freeze of most of the tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the July 30 twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market which killed 16 people, Israel
immediately imposed a total closure on Palestinian territories,
barred tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from working in
Israel, and suspended the transferring of tax revenues to the PNA
as part of pressure put on the PNA to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have inflicted severe hardships on the
Palestinian people and were condemned by the PNA as "declaration
of war." In a gesture to reward the PNA's partially resumed
security cooperation, the Israeli government transferred on
Tuesday 4.2 million U.S. dollars of the total withheld 14 million
dollars tax money to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PNA embargo list complied by the cabinet ranged from
cigarettes to TV sets, items that can be replaced with
Palestinian goods or imported from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that the Palestinian boycott was more
a political statement than an actual threat to Israel, since
Israel can prevent the PNA from importing goods from other
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The French capital Paris today
pulled its degree two alarm of heavy air pollution on the second
consecutive day, with all its districts and suburbs registering
level two pollution, or more than 180 micrograms of ozone per
cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse said that Paris is living under its worst
pollution since the alarming episode of pollution began in the
first week of this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the concentration of another polluting chemical
element, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which can partly turn into ozone
in summertime, has also reached level two in Paris, with 300
micrograms of NO2 per cubic meter registered at the barometer of
the official air supervising instrument Airparif.
</P>
<P>
Paris has been living under heavy sunshine weather for weeks.
The dry and hot weather, which has contributed to the rise of
ozone and NO2 pollutions, is expected to continue for days.

<HEADLINE> 800 Hostages Freed from Chechen Captivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Almost 800 hostages and prisoners
of war, including 11 Russian reporters, were released from Chechen
captivity over the past 12 months, Secretary of the Russian
Security Council Ivan Rybkin said today.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass quoted Rybkin as reporting that Chechen bandits
captured over 70 people since May 1 alone. Out of the total, 40
captives were released.
</P>
<P>
Calling the capture of hostages in Chechnya "a dirty business",
Rybkin said two deputy secretaries at the Security Council staff
constantly work on this problem.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Rybkin told journalists Wednesday
that about 1400 people are missing or being held hostage in
Chechnya, including many foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russian leadership is concerned about the problem
of hostages and "Chechnya should understand this."
</P>
<P>
Rybkin believes that "both presidents (Boris Yeltsin of Russia
and Aslan Maskhadov of Chechnya) are interested in finding out
the substance of this process. And the result should be the truth,
not a new lie."

<HEADLINE> Russia's Beloved Actor Yuri Nikulin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's best-loved film actor,
75-year-old Yuri Nikulin, also known as a clown, a circus director
and a TV personality, died in a Moscow clinic Thursday, according
to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Nikulin had to undergo heart surgery earlier this month, when
clinical death occurred. His heart had first stopped beating for 30
minutes during an operation performed to remove blocks from three
major heart vessels.
</P>
<P>
The doctors brought him back to life then but Nikulin's
condition remained extremely grave. They did "the impossible" in
the following 16 days to keep him alive, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nikulin was a man of great talent, uncommon fate and
life-asserting force, and one of the most beloved personalities
for millions and millions Russian people.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Nikulin had a priceless gift of dispelling other people's
gloomy moods. He was "the soul" of any group of people with whom
he closely associated -- be it his family, friends, or television
shows.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Russia has been orphaned by the loss of its
beloved and inimitable actor Yuri Nikulin.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers Emergency Aid to Montserrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it would provide emergency cash aid for those
Montserrat residents who want to leave the volcano-stricken
Caribbean island to nearby countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Department for International Development said today
that those adults moving to other countries in the Caribbean
region would get 2,400 pounds (about 3,840 U.S. dollars) over the
next six months, provided they did not have savings and assets of
more than 10,000 pounds (about 16,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Those people under 18 in the British colony would get 600
pounds (about 960 dollars) and the British government would also
pledge to pay air fares to nearby countries.
</P>
<P>
But the aid package was well short of the amount demanded by
the Montserrat government officials after new evidence showed that
the Soufriere Hills volcano could have a massive eruption in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
British International Development Secretary Clare Short was
quoted by the BBC television as saying today: "I understand that
people are disgruntled but we have acted very quickly and
reasonably.
</P>
<P>
"We provided funds for people who want to travel to Britain,
we're now announcing a package for people who want to relocate in
the Caribbean," she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Troops Block Major Road in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian troops based in Jul,
13 miles east of the Sierra Leone capital here, have blocked the
main highway leading to the interior of the country, Sierra Leone
military officials charged today.
</P>
<P>
"They are turning back vehicles and people saying they should
not go through and if they argue they would be shot," a military
spokesman told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have been "a series of skirmishes between
the Sierra Leone army and Nigerian soldiers in the area during
the past two days."
</P>
<P>
"It seemed as if they are up to some war games but we are also
on the alert," he said.
</P>
<P>
A people's army spokesman, commenting on the developments,
said, "Nigerian troops have been pushing their luck, They have no
business here. This is our land and they should stop molesting
our people and erecting checkpoints on our soil."
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian military officer reached by telephone by Xinhua at
the Jul base confirmed the act, saying, "We have now taken the
decision to close the road temporarily to safeguard our security.
We have come under snipers shots too frequently."
</P>
<P>
Over 200 commuters, mostly traders, are mow allegedly stranded
on both sides of the barrier.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops have been sent there as among the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) which frowns on the May 25 coup that
toppled the civilian government in Sierra Leone. For this, the
Nigerians have accused soldier of the military junta of attacking
their positions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the third high-ranking member of the rebel
movement, Lt. Colonel Eddie Collins is to be sworn in as Minister
of Trade and State Enterprises tomorrow, official sources Said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Security Council Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
welcomed U.N. Security Council's position that the Turkish Cypriot
side is blamed for the stalemate in efforts for a settlement to
the Cyprus problem, a government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was concerned and disappointed over the
fact that the Turkish Cypriot side tried to block any substantive
progress and introduce terms which are contrary to the council's
resolutions and also rejected by the European Union (EU),
spokesman Manolis Christofides told his daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
After a Security Council briefing Wednesday by the
Secretary-General's Special Advisor for Cyprus Diego Cordovez who
chaired the two rounds of direct talks between the Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot sides, its President John Weston told the
press that "there was a sense of disappointment" that progress was
not reached during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"There was a sense that commendation was due to (Cypriot)
President (Glafcos) Clerides for the flexibility and cooperation
that he had shown at this round of talks," Weston said.
</P>
<P>
He added there was also "some concern and disappointment that
further substantive progress at this time was impeded by
the attempt to bring preconditions to the table by the other
party, and here of course I mean the Turkish Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman welcomed the reference made to Clerides' stance
during the talks held last week in Glion, Switzerland and said the
Cypriot government remains committed to the procedure for a
solution to the Cyprus problem through the U.N. peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate fully in this direction," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, Christofides said that "it is up to the U.N. to find
ways to handle this temporary impasse the Turkish side's
intransigence has created" and decide on the procedure it will
follow to solve the Cyprus problem and implement its resolutions
on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Glion talks ended in deadlock last Friday because the
Turkish Cypriot side insisted the EU postpone or reverse its
decision to begin accession talks with Cyprus next year.
</P>
<P>
The first round of U.N.-sponsored talks between Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash was held in Troutbeck, near
New York, in July.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the international community to exert
pressure on Ankara which he described as "the key" to the solution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third of it in the wake of a failed coup seeking with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Renews in Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Fighting has again renewed
between the forces of Hussein Aidid and the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) fighters in Dhiil village, 32 km north of the Bakol
regional capital, Huddor.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the area, fighting occurred
Wednesday afternoon when the loyalists of Hussein Aidid launched
an attack on Dhiil in an attempt to regain control of the
village.
</P>
<P>
Both factions claimed to have gained the upper hand in the
fighting and the control of the village.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hussein Aidid's side said their men have
over-run those of the RRA and regained five technical battle
vehicles they lost last Friday to the RRA.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's men also admitted to have lost five of their
fighters after inflicting heavy losses on the Rahanwein gunmen.
</P>
<P>
On the RRA side, Mr. Mohamud Ali Aden Qalinle also claimed to
have won in the fighting over Hussein Aidid's men, saying they
fought back after being provoked by Aidid's supporters.
</P>
<P>
As RRA spokesman, Qalinle further claimed they had killed 17
of Hussein Aidid's fighters and lost only four of his men and
suffered other six wounded.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle also said they destroyed four of 26 technical vehicles
used by Hussein Aidid in the clashes before they fled the area.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is no independent confirmation regarding
the rival claims, but sources from Huddor town said two burned
technical vehicles and another non-functioning battle wagon were
seen being dragged along by Aidis's vehicles toward the capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Somali businessmen against using the roads in
Bay and Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after a land mine blew up a civilian truck
mounted with a towing machine, with the driver and another man
killed near Awdinle village last week.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, PLO Call for Joint Arab Action for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Top Jordanian and Palestinian
officials today called for joint Arab efforts to put back on track
the Middle East peace process that has been stalled since March.
</P>
<P>
It was important to continue the Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian
coordination and (the Arab countries') contact with the Israeli
side on the way of resuming peace to the region, Radio Jordan
quoted Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with visiting Chairman of
Political Department of Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
Farouk Kadoumy who arrived here today for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
It was urgent to intensify such joint efforts in support of
peace, as the tension in the region was accelerated by the July 30
suicide bombings in West Jerusalem which killed 16 people, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy said joint Arab action was the basic element in facing
challenges presently blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added his visit came just in the framework of consultations
and coordination with Jordan with regards to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled till now since Israel began
to build Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
During the period of deadlock, efforts by the U.S. and Egypt to
reactivate the peace talks have failed due to Israeli government's
hardline policy.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Keen on Joining SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A number of African
countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Madagascar, have signaled their intention to join the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), informed sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The honorary consul's office of Madagascar and the Congo (K)
embassy had confirmed their interest Wednesday, with the former
saying that moves were under way to make a formal application,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A Madagascar official was quoted as saying that her
government's membership of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern African (COMESA) treaty would hang in the balance.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) is also a member of COMESA and has been involved in
the SADC's sectoral cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Regional sources said Seychelles had also expressed interest
in SADC.
</P>
<P>
A draft agenda of the forthcoming SADC summit shows the
meeting will discuss membership applications from unnamed states.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which has been seeking to create a free trade area
since it was set up in August 1992, admitted Mauritius as its
12th member one year ago.
</P>
<P>
For now, the SADC consists of Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Zambia, South Africa and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the SADC's attractiveness comes from
its new program of action, including a free trade zone of about
140 million people.
</P>
<P>
Others say that the inclusion of South Africa has improved the
region's standing among potential foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Cameroun's Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved in Washington last night Cameroun's letter of
intent which outlines Cameroun's economic and financial program
for the next three years, according to Radio Cameroun here today.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent, approved by the board of directors of
the IMF, was signed on July 24, 1997 by Cameroun's Prime Minister
Peter Mafany Musonge.
</P>
<P>
It is based on a policy to promote economic growth, reduce
poverty in the country and restructure the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the plan will give Cameroun access to
reinforce structural adjustment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's economic recovery is going on smoothly, with the
growth rate standing at 5 percent up from 3 percent a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital will be attracted to the country with the
approval of the letter of intent. Privatization will be further
encouraged, thus paving way for further boosting the economy.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Oil Companies Criticized for Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
criticized three local oil companies for price increases
following the depreciation of the Kenyan Shilling against the
U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Crispus Mutitu, Permanent
Secretary of the Energy Ministry, termed the price increases by
Mobil, Kenya Shell and BP as "unrealistic and inflammatory".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that oil companies had increased pump prices in
the past week with Mobil raising oil price by 3.02 Shillings per
liter, Kenya Shell 2.04 Shillings and BP 2.04 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that the price increase should not
exceed about 1.45 Shillings per liter in accordance with the
assessment by his ministry on the basis of the latest Murban spot
prices and the current average Shilling exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that oil companies were always expected to
increase prices to aggravate the suffering of the average Kenyans
when the country's economy was undergoing some difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The seven multi-national oil companies operating in the east
African country have formed cartels with monopolistic tendencies
including charging unreasonable prices and driving smaller firms
out of the market.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has threatened to fix maximum prices for
petroleum products in line with the international market as a
measure to protect consumers from exploitation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 13 private oil firms had been licensed to
operate in the country in a bid to encourage competition against
multi-national oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is also considering to take legal
measures for better management of the deregulated petroleum
market which should have benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-owned National Oil Corporation of Kenya
and the Kenya Pipeline Company are scheduled to invest in service
stations, liquified petroleum gas import terminals and other
facilities to provide alternative and more flexible supply points
for petroleum products.

JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo today met his Swazi counterpart Arther Khoza
soon after his arrival in Mbabane, informed sources reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference shortly after his arrival, Nzo said it
was his first official visit to Swaziland. He said the visit was
long overdue, especially in light of important developments that
had occurred between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Among these matters is the need to strengthen the historic
and close relations that exist between South Africa and
Swaziland," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said his talks with Khoza would be on "bilateral,
sub-regional, regional and international issues which neighboring
countries should naturally discuss together and exchange views."
</P>
<P>
The talks would allow South Africa and Swaziland to work
closely and effectively in the best interests of the two
countries and the Southern African Development Community, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo added that he would propose a bilateral agreement between
the two countries aimed at consultations at regular intervals.

<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State
Cephas Msipa today said his department is considering setting up
a national investment bank which will lend money to the
marginalized black businesses at lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He told farmers attending the 58th annual congress of the
Zimbabwe Farmers Union that although the recommendation was still
to be approved by the government, such a bank would fill the gap
not being filled by established commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for a special bank which will offer lower
interest rates to the majority," he said, adding that the country
had to be prepared to pay the price if the indigenization process
was to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state in the President's Office responsible
for parastatals also stressed, "you must learn that things have
changed. You must understand that this is now a commercial world,
so you have to do something to save money to invest in privatized
parastatals."

<HEADLINE> Texas Train Collision Kill Two Crew Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A runaway Union Pacific train
with no one aboard collided head-on with another train in Forth
Worth in Texas of The United States, killing two crew members and
setting off a large fire. It was the railroad's second fatal
collision in two months.
</P>
<P>
The crash shortly before midnight Wednesday also injured
another crew member, while another escaped unharmed, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
A large fire erupted after the accident as more than 8,000
gallons of diesel fuel leaked from the engines and ignited. About
60 firefighters brought the blaze under control by early morning.
</P>
<P>
A Union Pacific spokesman said Thursday that an unmanned train,
somehow rolled from a siding onto the track being used by a
westbound freight which had five locomotives and 114 cars.
</P>
<P>
The unmanned train had rolled nearly 10 miles when it collided
with the freight train in west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as engineers.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, four people were killed and one was severely burned
when two Union Pacific freight trains collided head-on on a single
stretch of track in Devine, about 30 miles southwest of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Union Pacific announced that it was
spending millions of dollars over the next three years to upgrade
its computer-aided dispatching system to make tracks safer.

<HEADLINE> France Expects Good Economic Growth, Budget Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Finance and
Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that France's gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate should attain 2.8-2.9 percent
in 1998, while its inflation could be controlled under 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he based the figure only on the expected
performances by public enterprises, whose production growth rates
are usually lower than private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the government will strictly control
its spending rise in 1998 to about 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted authorized sources as saying that
the public deficit will be "very close to" 3 percent of the GDP
in the 1998 budget law, in conformity with the European Union's
budgetary criteria for joining the euro, the European single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the new budget law will require the
government to reduce its 1998 spending by an equivalent of 0.5
percent of the GDP through belt-tightening measures, as is
compared with its spending in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year's public deficit of France is expected to stand at
3.5 percent of the GDP, according to an earlier estimation made in
April.
</P>
<P>
The figures are very close to the project made by the former
government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, which predicted a 2.8
percent growth of GDP in 1998, after a 2.3 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the French franc dropped by 20 percent in its exchange
rate with the U.S. dollar so far this year, inflation rate stayed
at an average of 1 percent in France over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank, la Banque de France, today decided to
maintain its key interests rates unchanged at its first session of
board of monetary policy, after the German Bundesbank decided to
maintain its interest rates earlier this week.

the opposition UNITA movement to immediately cease all military
operations in the war-torn country.

WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- FBI agents have read through
Terry Nichols' prison mail, seeking clues or information about
other possible suspects in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, an
FBI agent testified in Denver, Colorado, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What I was looking for was information that possibly could
indicate another person that may be involved in this incident,"
agent Mark White was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

Nichols is scheduled to stand trial on September 29 on murder,

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Ban Trading Near New Lusaka City Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government announced
here today that it will prosecute any vendors trading within a
radius of 200 metres away from the newly opened Lusaka city
market with effect from September first.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and Housing Bennie Mwiinga said
that Cairo Road and Lumumba Road, business centers of the capital
city, are also out of bounds for the vendors.
</P>
<P>
He said the move has been taken to persuade people to trade in
the city market which has all the facilities to ensure food is
hygienically stored.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the vendors who leave the city market to trade
outside and those who have been given stalls in the market but do
not take them up by next Tuesday risk having their stalls
forfeited and re-allocated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga said the government has spent huge sums of money to
build the market and it will be unfortunate to see the market
turn into a white elephant by allowing street vendors to trade in
the corridors of the market with 3,000 stalls.
</P>
<P>
The vendors are accused of blocking customers from entering
the biggest market in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Some marketeers have abandoned their new stands inside the
market to come and trade outside, where there is more business.
</P>
<P>
Numerous street vendors do the business in Lusaka's downtown
centers because of inadequate market places. The city market was
opened earlier this month as part of the government's efforts to
solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Crisis Avoidable: IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis that
shook Thailand is avoidable and could have been eased had the
government imposed strict financial controls sooner, the
International Monetary Fund chief stated here today.
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Camdessus, the IMF's Managing Director told a
press conference that Thai authorities belatedly moved "very
boldly" to restore economic stability, including imposing higher
taxes and closing 58 financial institutions, which is two thirds
of the country's total that made bad loans to property developers.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held following the IMF approved the
first part of a 16.7 billion dollar rescue package for Thailand on
Wednesday, which is some 3.9 billion dollars equivalent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said 1.6 billion dollars will go to Thailand right away
and an additional 810 million dollars after November 30, provided
Thailand meets IMF conditions. Subsequent disbursements will be
made quarterly.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the rapid approval should reassure global
financial markets that the safety net set up after the Mexican
peso crisis in 1995 works. The Thai bailout was the world's second
largest after the IMF and the United States came up with 50
billion dollars for Mexico two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the comprehensive policy measures adopted
by the Thai authorities, supported by the additional financing
package that has been put together by countries of the region and
other multilateral institutions-- the total amount available is
over 16 billion U.S. dollars -- will restore stability and set the
stage for an effective recovery of the Thai economy," Camdessus
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that starting in early 1996 everything was done
to give the Thai authorities advice and warning of the looming
problems but only short of an "undiplomatic public outburst" to
make Thais aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the worst of the Thai crisis will be over if
Bangkok follows through with its austerity measures, including
cutting its defense budget.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Thailand's problems "could have been corrected at
much less cost to the economy and the economy of neighboring
countries if they had been addressed in a more timely manner."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin issued a statement
expressing his welcome to the IMF package as a "significant step"
toward establishing economic stability in Thailand, "which is
important to the United States and the rest of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
The United States is prepared to participate in a short-term,
multilateral bridging facility, if needed and under appropriate
conditions, to provide liquidity in support of Thailand's program,
Rubin expressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia said today that
foreigners buying council houses from Zambians who have not
completed transactions with the Council risk loosing them.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local and Housing Bennie Mwiinga said sitting
tenants who sell the houses before buying them from the Council
will have the offers withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
He said councils are on the look out for such tenants and will
act upon receiving information on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Some sitting tenants are reportedly selling their council
houses to foreigners before completing the transactions with the
Council.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwiinga said that he will not mind if the houses are
sold after they have been bought from the Council because the
owners have the right then to decide on what to do with their
property but not before.
</P>
<P>
Late last year the government started sale of its houses to
sitting tenants as part of its new housing policy to support home
ownership.

budget.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine recalled the position of the European Union that the
United States should pay to the U.N. its 1 billion dollar
contribution arrears, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Europe also agree that the Security
Council should be enlarges, but they differ over the number of new
members.

The French foreign minister also suggested an reinforcement of
cooperation with the United States within the U.N. in helping end

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Refused to Attend ECOWAS Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone received another snub from the international community
today when it was refused to attend a forthcoming sub-regional
summit.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcast Company today, the Foreign
Ministry of the junta, which seized power in the May 25 coup, has
asked for participation in the summit of heads of state and
government of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) scheduled for next week in Abuja, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
To reply the request, the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat today
informed the junta that relevant documentation needed for the
meeting had been given to the toppled civilian government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that this decision to invite Kabbah's
legitimate government to the summit was made in accordance with a
recent meeting of the ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone in
Conakry, Guinea, in June which specified that no country should
recognize the junta in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretariat further said it would continue to
call on the implementation of this and other decisions that might
be passed at the ECOWAS authority.

<HEADLINE> UN Not to Participate in Conference on Panama Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations would
not participate in the conference on the Panama Canal to be held
in September, a UN spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question on the UN's stand on the coming
conference known as "Universal Congress on the Panama Canal" at
the noon press briefing today, Brandt Juan Carlos, associate
spokesman for the UN secretary general, said that the UN had made
the decision because Panama had invited Taiwan authorities to be
present at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reason of the new decision since the General
Assembly had adopted a resolution on the conference, Carlos said,
"The UN has decided not to participate in the conference due to
the fact that if we do, we will be in a certain way violating
another General Assembly resolution that recognizes the People's
Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the
United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that Panama has invited Taiwan to be present at
the conference. They will be there as special guests of the
government of Panama," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not prudent for the United Nations and the United
Nations system to be part of this conference in those
circumstances," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether China had asked the UN to withdraw from the
conference, Carlos said that it was not a question of China asking
the United Nations to withdraw from the conference. It was a
question of the UN being consistent with the mandate of the General
Assembly on this question, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is true the General Assembly originally had welcomed this
event in Panama. It is also true that the United Nations has to be
consistent with regard to something as delicate as the question of
membership of a member state," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Prepares to Impose Duty Fines on Japanese Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States is posed to
impose stiff duties on supercomputers made by two Japanese
companies for violating an international anti-dumping agreement,
the U.S. Department of Commerce announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the tariffs amount to 454 percent on
supercomputers made by NEC Corp. and 173 percent on those
manufactured by Fujitsu Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The case is forwarded to the International Trade Commission for
an August 27 hearing to determine whether the companies' actions
hurt U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary decision in March, the Commerce Department
said NEC violated anti-dumping regulations by trying to sell the
U.S. government four supercomputers for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
Cray Research Inc., a U.S. company, filed a complaint with the
government in July 1996 after NEC won a contract for government
weather forecasting computers with the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., an affiliate of the
federally funded National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Cray said the 35 million U.S. dollar price tag on NEC's
computers was less than one-fourth of their fair value.
</P>
<P>
But NEC responded that the price was not only greater than cost
of manufacturing the machines but that it included a profit
margin.

<HEADLINE> Japan Helps Cameroun Build 30 Primary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan will grant Cameroun 5
billion CFA Francs (Approximately 10 million U.S. dollars) to
build primary shools under an agreement signed here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which was signed by Jean Gaukou,
minister-delegate of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the
Japanese ambassador to Cameroun, the money will be used to build
30 primary shools and 200 classrooms in Yaounde and the country's
economic capital Douala.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Gaukou highlighted the excellent
relations existing between the governments of Cameroun and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the new contribution from Japan to
finance projects in Cameroun's education sector falls in line
with the Camerounian government's policy to fight against
illiteracy in the country, which is seen as a serious obstacle to
achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 5 billion Francs offered today, Gaukou
said, the Japanese government had in the past two years given
some 6 billion cfa Francs to his country to finance portable
water supply projects in 10 rural areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Japanese ambassador to Cameroun Takeru Sasaguchi
said his country's choice to finance projects in the education
sector in sub-Sahara Africa in general and Cameroun in particular
is to contribute in a significant way to ameliorate basic
education which is seen as an essential factor to achieve social
economic development in all countries.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador reviewed that since 1988, his country
has financed projects in the domain of education, health and
rural development worth 92 billion CFA Francs in Cameroun.

<HEADLINE> People's Insurance Reports Marginal Growth In Premiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC), the country's largest insurer, saw a 50 percent
rise in premiums in the first half of the year to 42.8 billion
yuan (five billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, president and general manager, said that PICC's
total assets exceed 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) and
it now has nearly 74 percent of China's insurance market and he
noted that "it is because of China's continuous reforms and
opening-up and its steady economic growth that PICC has expanded
so quickly."
</P>
<P>
The company now has about 400 types of insurance services, and
about 600,000 Chinese enterprises and 100 million families have
bought property and life insurence policies.
</P>
<P>
Ma said PICC was successfully reshaped into a corporation last
year and it set up three subsidiaries for life and property
insurance. Each of them plays a major role in their respective
fields, insurance experts said.
</P>
<P>
They held that the move was intended to face the increasing
challenge from competitors and to consolidate its leading position
in China's insurance market.
</P>
<P>
PICC has paid a total of 150 billion yuan in claims by Chinese
policy-holders in the past five years, Ma said, and "PICC now
functions well as China's largest state-owned insurer in
safeguarding the country's economic growth and social stability."
</P>
<P>
PICC is also seeking to extend its business share in the
booming insurance market in the coming years to maintain its
leading status, Ma added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects OECD Investigation of Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has rebuffed an
anti-money laundering investigation request from the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Financial Ministry officials who declined to be
named told the newspaper that Turkey has taken effective
measures to crack down on money laundering in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has been implementing the needed reregulations related
to the money laundering. Under these circumstances, there is no
need for the OECD to make research in Turkey," the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the OECD complains that money laundering conducted by
illegal organizations has been rampant in Turkey in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in June, the OECD's Financial Activity
Mission Group urged the Turkish government to clean up the money
laundering activities with tough steps, saying it would launch
an investigation in Turkey if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Turkish financial experts have been reportedly asked by the
government to start an investigation into such activities, and
an expert team will submit their report to the authorities by
October 1.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Research on Control of El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino,
a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean,
through a sophisticated computer simulation.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report released by the Weizmann
Institute of Science, the study was conducted by professor Eli
Tziperman of the Weizmann Institute's Environmental Sciences and
Energy Research Department, together with colleague Harvey Scher
and with Stephen Zebiak and Mark Cane of Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
</P>
<P>
El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six
years. It disrupts weather worldwide, causing storms, floods and
droughts. Its exact arrival, however, is extremely difficult to
predict with precision because of its chaotic nature.
</P>
<P>
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to
predict El Nino events. When they altered the values for the
magnitude of deep ocean waves at a single point in the western
Pacific, the model produced El Nino at regular intervals of about
four years, with perfectly predictable cycles of temperature,
winds and ocean currents.
</P>
<P>
While the scientists do not propose to control the actual El
Nino, they do believe that the successful control in a complex
prediction model may help them better understand the crucial
factors governing El Nino behavior. This, in turn, may improve
the researchers' ability to predict El Nino events and lead to
measures that could reduce their global damage.
</P>
<P>
A particularly significant El Nino (Spanish for "The Child,"
referring to the infant Jesus) appears to be brewing in the
equatorial Pacific right now, threatening to strike some time
later this year.

BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A forum to mark the publication

modern China opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The ten-volume collection contains nearly two million
characters.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, wrote an inscription
for the books and called for further study of the late leader's
ideology and research into the characteristics and laws for army
building under new situations.
</P>
<P>
Other inscriptions were written by vice chairmen of the Central
Military Commission Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wannian and Chi
Haotian.
</P>
<P>
China's opening-up and modernization should be guided by Deng's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as
to ensure the promising future of the country's socialist
construction, Zhang Wannian said in a speech.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) must be unquestionably under

<HEADLINE> CBI Fears Strong Pound to Stall UK's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) predicted a sharp slowdown in the economy next year
after its latest report showed the outlook for exports is the
worst for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' export orders have slumped to their lowest ebb
for almost five years, according to the latest monthly survey by
the CBI.
</P>
<P>
Concerns that the strong pound could damage growth prospects
for the British economy overshadowed official figures revealing
consumers are spending money faster than at any time since the
third quarter of 1988.
</P>
<P>
City economists argue that the UK's biggest concern is the
rapid growth in consumer spending. During the second quarter,
consumer expenditure rose by 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
As consumer spending powers the economy ahead in the short
term, the CBI has cut its forecast next year from 2.7 to 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's decision to cut its growth forecast from 3.1 percent
this year to 2.5 percent in 1998 puts it just below the average of
independent forecasts.
</P>
<P>
However, just three months ago the CBI was more optimistic
about the outlook for next year, raising its growth forecast by
0.1 percent to 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed here that if sterling was 10 percent
higher, the UK's economy might grow by only 2 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> HK Inflation Hits 6.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A surge in the prices of
vegetables pushed Hong Kong's inflation rate higher in July,
official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department today released the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for the first month after the
handover.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (A), was 6.5
percent in July, higher than that of 5.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
CPI (A) covers 50 percent of households in Hong Kong whose
monthly expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (503
to 2,065 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (B) and Hang Seng
CPI were also higher than in June -- 6.2 percent against 5.6
percent for the CPI (B) and 6.6 percent against 5.9 percent for
the Hang Seng CPI.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI, which is compiled based on the combined
expenditure pattern of households covered by the three
sub-indices, showed an 6.4 percent increase in July, higher than
that of 5.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the higher inflation rate to a surge
in the prices of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged rainy weather, the prices of vegetables
soared by over 60 percent in July, the highest rate of increase
recorded within a single month over the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Scholars Opposes Westerners' Attempt to Split Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Three Taiwanese scholars
attending the ongoing 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies held
that some Western people who advocate separatism for Tibet have
inherited an imperialist mindset and are only acting in their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
Lin Kuan Chun, a history professor with National Chengchi
University in Taiwan, said Tibet has had a close relationship
with the central government since the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Tibetan culture has closer ties with the Central Plains
areas of China than with the neighboring countries of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan Buddhism used to be influenced by the religion from
India, but Tibetan people did not accept too much Indian culture.
Religion is only a small part of culture," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"Some Westerners are using dual standards toward Tibet," the
professor said, noting that Britain consists of several islands
with different cultures, and the United States includes Alaska,
which is inhabited by Eskimos, in its territory.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that a country can be composed of many ethnic
groups, so why do some people in the west only want to separate
Tibet?" he queried.
</P>
<P>
Gene J. Y Chang, professor with the Institute of Nationality
Studies of National Chengchi University of Taiwan, holds a similar
view, noting that cultural and geographical differences should not
be used as an excuse to split a country.
</P>
<P>
Politically, some government officials in the West have
attempted to split China because they are afraid of China's
growing strength. In recent years, there has been some noise about
the "China Threat" theory in the world, some western powers fear
that their interests will be harmed if China remains a united and
strong country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, some people in Western countries do not want to
see the economic prosperity and other achievements in China's
interior areas over the recent years," the professor said.

<P>
On the other hand, some non-governmental organizations in the
West are fed up with modern life, for they have seen the demise of
rare wild animals, dwindling forest populations, pollution, the
lack of civility between people, and the change of traditional way
of life and customs among people of minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Gene J. Y Chang labels this "post-modernism," saying that these
people want to return to a simpler way of life, such as the type
they had before the modernization of society.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot find such a life at home, so they find the East
and find old Tibet, discovering a piece of pure land over
there. The more the central government helps Tibet and Tibet
becomes more modernized, the more the Westerners oppose and
curse," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They do not keep in mind that Tibetan people also have the
right to lead a modern and civilized life," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Tibetan studies scholar Thomas C. W. Lu, a 72-year-old
professor with the Chinese Culture University of Taiwan, shares
the view that the Western nations, including the United States,
in their attempt to split Tibet do not want to see a strong China.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in the West say there are no human rights in
Tibet, but according to my findings there, Tibetan people have
more human rights than they did before the liberation of Tibet,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu graduated from Fudan University of Shanghai in 1948 and then
taught in Taiwan. He enrolled in a Tibetan studies program in 1965
and obtained a Ph.D. in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary Tibetans had little knowledge about human rights under
the rigid religious system in old Tibet, he noted. The serfs were
oppressed but they regarded this as their fate and did not think
of rebelling.
</P>
<P>
Now, human rights conditions in Tibet have improved greatly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The professor has made inspection tours in Lhasa, Xigaze and
some other places in Tibet. "I think the Tibetan people are free
to have their own religious belief," he said.

<P>
MADRID, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's triple Olympic champion
Michelle de Bruin has withdrawn from Saturday's 200-meter
individual medley at the European swimming championships.
</P>
<P>
Irish team sources said it was her tireness to force her pull
out of the event after winning two golds and a silver in the first
three days of the championships.
</P>
<P>
But the 27-year-old Irishwomen still plans to defend her
200-meter butterfly title on Sunday, the sources said. So she
needed the extra days to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
de Bruin, like other swimmers competing in the San Pablo pool
beneath the boiling sun, complained about the heat after winning
her second gold in the 200-meter freestyle on Wednesday and said
she was tired when she was beaten into second place in the
400-meter freestyle on Thursday.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met 11 journalists in the Kremlin today who were rescued recently
after being held hostage in Chechnya for months, the Itar-Tass
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Russian Federal Security Service played
a key role in rescuing the journalists.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Security Service was in the forefront," although
"quite a few state structures were also involved" in the rescue,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised the journalists, who were from Public
Russian Television, Independent Television and other news media,
for having displayed courage and endurance while being held.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and other officials of the Russian government
closely followed developments concerning the abducted reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reports say there were 76 registered hostage-taking cases in
Chechnya during the first six months of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Export-Led Growth Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of Zimbabwe's
manufacturing sector will have to be export-led to enable local
companies to compete in the lucrative eastern and southern Africa
regional markets, a cabinet minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told the latest issue of
Commerce Magazine that the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), presently valued at about 150 billion U.S. Dollars,
were indispensable stepping stones for exports.
</P>
<P>
''Regional companies in general and local enterprises in
particular need to make a special effort to identify market
segments in the region and develop products and services tailored
to the needs of these markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local business community to take advantage of the
enabling environment that governments are striving to create
through SADC and COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Local companies, he noted, should be able to compete because
of cultural familiarity, shorter distances and less restrictions,
coupled with efforts being made by member states to facilitate
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
A major development, he said, was the Democratic Republic of
Congo's (DRC) statement underlining its commitment to economic
reconstruction and institution building.
</P>
<P>
He urged companies to actively prospect for and initiate
projects aligned to the reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
''More recently, the DRC has unveiled many investment and
trade opportunities which our companies should pursue,'' Murerwa
said.

CHANGSHA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Railway
Intermediate Court opened today in Changsha, capital of
central-south China's Hunan Province, and sentenced two men
convicted of causing a serious railway tragedy last April.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Diverges on New Defense Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) and its two allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
and the New Party Sakigake, failed to hammer out a common view
today on the new Japan-U.S. defense guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Differences between the SDP and the LDP, led by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, remain over the definition of "areas
surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of policy-makers from the tripartite ruling camp,
the SDP reiterated its position that the Taiwan Straits be
excluded from areas subject to the proposed new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
But Taku Yamazaki, chairman of the LDP's Political Affairs
Investigation Committee, argued that "emergencies in surrounding
areas" referred to those which would threaten Japan's peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
They are defined in accordance with the nature of the
occurrences, not geographical concepts, Yamazaki said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the new guidelines were designed under the
framework of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, Yamazaki said the
definition of the Far East was important when talking about Japan
providing logistical and noncombatant support to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The LDP still claims that the Far East, as defined under the
security treaty, refers to areas from the Philippines to the
north, including Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The issue of how to define the areas surrounding Japan has been
in the spotlight since Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama
said on a Sunday TV talk show that the new defense guidelines
would cover emergencies in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama's remarks triggered strong criticism from China. His
words appeared to signal an attempt to interfere in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that today's remark by Yamazaki showed
the Japanese government's resolution to reach an agreement that
the new guidelines should include the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines are intended to replace the 1978 Japan-U.S.
defense cooperation guidelines, and to pave the way for Japan to
provide a broad range of logistic and noncombatant support to the
U.S. military in case of emergencies "in areas surrounding Japan."

SHANGHAI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- At a stage performance last
night Shanghai artists recited a 3,000-line-poem, "Song for Deng
Xiaoping", to celebrate late Deng's 93rd birthday, which falls on
today.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the Shanghai Opera House orchestra, 15
well-known Shanghai artists, representing three generations, read
the poem's six-parts: "Prelude," "Chief Architect," "The Road of
Exploration," "Economic Reform," "Great Changes of China," and
"Hong Kong, Oh, Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Sun Daolin, a famous artist, commented, "I am 76 years old. I
have witnessed China's rise and fall in history, China could never
have been so strong if it weren't for Deng's theory." This was the
fourth time for Sun to read the poem in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Orient Television, one of the sponsors of the party,
broadcast a tape of the party tonight. There is also a web site on
the Internet so that surfers worldwide can appreciate the poem on
their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
It was written last year by the Shanghai poet Gui Xinghua, who
is famous for his poetry with political themes. It describes the
glorious life of the great man. It has been published and recorded
on audio cassette and MTV and has been well received by people.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away in February of this year.

<P>
This enabled them to have an extensive understanding of the
circumstances of Chinese women and children, and China's efforts
to protect the rights of women and children were widely
appreciated, the premier stated.
</P>
<P>
It is a fundamental policy of China to ensure the men and women
on an equal footing, Li said, adding the country has worked out
respective guidelines to guarantee the development of the women
and children.
</P>
<P>
In China, women cherish equal rights with men and their
political status is growing continuously, and their political
participation is obviously improving, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 3,000 deputies to the National People's Congress, Li
went on, women constitute over 20 percent of the total and women
cadres make up 33 percent of the total cadres working in
governmental institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And women account for 38.6 percent of the workers in township
enterprises, he said, adding the women's economic status is also
growing, with their income increasing and education improving.
</P>
<P>
Some 98.63 percent of the school-aged girls can go to school,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that the children's rights are also
guaranteed, with a nine-year compulsory education system and a
pre-school education for them.
</P>
<P>
In the country, over 80 percent of the country's territory,
including the rural areas, practice disease immunity and
prevention medical services for children, the premier added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that some common children diseases, such as
varicella and infantile paralysis, have been eliminated on the
whole.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not mean to say that there has been no
incidents of child abuse, Li said, adding this violates the
Chinese law and will be punished according to the criminal law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nationals have developed a very dear feeling toward
the family life and thus their families are on a rather solid
basis, which do good to the children's growth and education, Li
added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about some analysts' arguments that China has become
the world's second largest economic power, Li said this comment is
an exaggerated prediction on China's economy.
</P>
<P>
As China has a huge population, its per capita GNP is listed at
the back row of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the per capita GNP of Malaysians is registered at 3,000
U.S. dollars, and China has not yet reached this level.
</P>
<P>
If China hopes to become a middle-level developed nation, it
needs some 30 years of arduous efforts, the premier added.

<HEADLINE> Plant Closed, Millions of Pounds of Meat Recalled in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Nebraska meat-processing
plant has been closed and expanded its recall of ground beef to 25
million pounds after Federal investigators found evidence that far
more meat might be contaminated by hazardous bacteria than
originally suspected last week.
</P>
<P>
E. coli bacteria contamination originated outside the plant at
the slaughterhouse, but the massive recall is needed because of
problems with meat handling, record keeping and safety testing,
Agriculture Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Columbus, Nebraska, plant will not open until the company
has adopted "far more stringent safety standards that we have
specifically laid out for them based on what we have found in our
investigation," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
Recalls were announced last week by Hudson Foods of Rogers
after health officials in Colorado traced the illnesses of more
than a dozen people to hamburger patties they ate in early June.
</P>
<P>
It first recalled 20,000 pounds of meat, then another 20,000,
and expanded to 1.2 million pounds last Friday.
</P>
<P>
E. coli is a potentially deadly bacteria that often gets into
food through contact with fecal matter. It causes severe diarrhea,
cramps and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Every year in the United States, bacteria in meat, poultry,
seafood, eggs, fruit and vegetables kill as many as 9,000 people
and sicken millions, the New York Times said today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A German consortium led by the
Thyssen group and Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA) today said it
had "very good chances" to win a multi-billion-U.S.-dollar arms
deal with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under the German bid, the companies are planning to build
corvettes, submarines, training aircraft and light transport
helicopters for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Given South Africa's strained finances, the purchases, which
would cost over two billion dollars, are expected to last well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
To win the deal, the German consortium has to defeat rival

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Hike Decision to Be Approved Soon in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A minimum of 10 to 15 percent
hike in the prices of petroleum products is likely to be approved
by the Indian cabinet which is scheduled to meet here tomorrow,
Press Trust of India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was entrusted with the responsibility of taking a
final decision on the long pending issue of hike in prices of
petroleum products when the United Front Steering Committee gave
the green signal to Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour meeting on Thursday night, the steering
committee said it had left the decision on the issue to Gujral and
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hike, hanging fire in the last six months because
of sharp differences between the left parties and other parties in
the United Front Coalition, has become imperative with the deficit
caused by subsidies to petroleum products burgeoning day by day.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, which has touched a staggering 220 billion rupees
(about 6.29 billion U.S. dollars), is projected to go well beyond
the originally projected 245 billion rupees (about 7.00 billion
dollars) by the end of the current fiscal year (from April 1997 to
march 1998) as it is mounting by 320 million rupees (about 9.14
million dollars) a day.

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Reinforcement of Arms in Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned the
resurgence of weapons and armaments in the Congo Republic by both
sides in the conflict, and once again called on them to stop
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"The reinforcement of armaments ... is in total contradiction
with the spirit of Libreville. We urge the Congolese parties to
respect their ceasefire and conclude without delay a political
solution," French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two warring sides of the Congo Republic,
President Pascal Lissouba and former president General Denis
Sassou N'Guesso, signed a ceasefire agreement in the Gabonese
capital of Libreville on July 13.
</P>
<P>
But soon afterwards they broke the truce by intensifying
fighting in Brazzaville, the capital city, and in other provinces,
killing at least 4,000 people so far.
</P>
<P>
"It is inadmissible that the Congolese parties should attempt
to look for a military solution to the crisis, despising the
suffering of the people," the French spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support for Gabonese President Omar Bongo's peace
proposal for the Congo Republic, which sets precise roles for the
country's president and prime minister in preparing for the future
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The newest proposal by Bongo calls for the deployment of a
United Nations peace-keeping force in the war-stricken country.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerating State-Owned Enterprise Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The 14th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the third plenary meeting
of the 14th CPC Congress, which outlined China's market economy
development and set the goals for the state-owned sector were two
milestones in China's decade-long enterprise reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China has increased reforms in the state-owned
enterprises across the country, and adjusted the industrial
structure to keep the state-owned sector the driving force in the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission Chen Qingtai has made these remarks, saying that the
purpose of the reform was to streamline the structure of the
state-owned sector and to establish a "modern enterprise system"
in some selected companies.
</P>
<P>
China is now experimenting with a new enterprise system in
2,598 enterprises, in a hope to spread their experiences in other
companies, he noted. The number of the pilot cities in an endeavor
of "optimizing capital structure" that is intended to adjust both
the industrial and product structures in enterprises, has
increased from 18 at the beginning to the present 58 and will be
111 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,099 enterprises in the 58 pilot cities that were
permitted to declare bankruptcy, and 1,192 that were merged with
other company groups. In the process, 1.23 million surplus
employees were diverted to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged that the overall strength of the state-owned
sector was strengthened in spite of the amount it shrank in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of state-owned assets was 4.5 trillion yuan in
1995, 1.7 times the 1990 amount, he noted. State-owned enterprises
now hold 53.7 percent of the nation's total assets of industrial
enterprises, have 33.8 percent of sales income, 34.1 percent of
added value production, and 55.2 percent of pre-taxed profits.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Sales Drop Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A small decline in June sales
ended a strong quarter for Canadian retailers, Statistics Canada
said today.
</P>
<P>
In June, retail sales slipped 0.2 percent to 13.9 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales by motor and recreational vehicle dealers fell sharply in
June, dampening an otherwise strong month, the federal statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, retail sales rose to 41.6 billion
dollars, up 1.6 percent over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly increase compares with 2.1 percent in the
first quarter and 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the second quarter were 7.6 percent higher than the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that retail sales strength in the fourth
quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year occurred
as savings rates fell to record lows and consumer credit continued
to rise.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, however, the growth may have been
spurred by increases in employment as well as in wages and
salaries, according to the agency.

<P>
State-owned enterprises are still taking a "leading position"
in energy, transportation, post and telecommunications,
metallurgy, chemical and automotive industries, and in
machinery and electronics, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of efficient state-owned enterprises have gained
force through intense market competitions. And although they are a
mere 0.44 percent of the state-owned industrial sector in terms of
numbers, the 512 enterprises that are given priority in central
government financial aid have 43.7 percent of the total sales
income and 65.85 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-owned sector still faces problems like a
lack of balance in the industrial structure, welfare problems for
employees, and slow technical progress, Chen explained, so the
country will speed up structural reforms in the coming years,
while establishing the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the next phase of reforms, the central government will shift
focus onto a "modern enterprise system" and adjusting the
industrial structure, and will use bankruptcies and mergers.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment scheme, which is regarded as an effective
way to ease unemployment pressures from the enterprise reforms,
will be given even greater importance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will urge enterprises to step up their
reorganization, and to effectively improve their management
methods and increase technological improvements, Vice-Minister
Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Historical Records Prove Tibet Is Inseparable Part of China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Scholars attending the ongoing
1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies said there is concrete
evidence that Tibet has been part of China's territory since
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Based on historical records and latest archeological findings,
the scholars pointed out: "Any words or activities to advocate the
independence of Tibet are groundless."
</P>
<P>
Tubo (the ancient word for Tibet) was an area under the
jurisdiction of Xuanzhengyuan, the Commission for Buddhist and
Tibetan Affairs, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), said Wang
Gui, a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"It was on the same level as other provinces, so it was
called 'Tubo Province'," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the term "the Province of Tibet" can be seen on page
172 of The Travels of Marco Polo, published by the Macmillan
Company of the United States in 1927. It also appears on page 100
of The Travels of Marco Polo, published by John Company of New
York in 1948.
</P>
<P>
On another page of the English book, Marco Polo wrote: "The
Province of Tibet is also under the jurisdiction of the Great
Khan."
</P>
<P>
Wang Gui said that the Sakya Lineage, written in the 17th
century, has been one of the fundamental sources for the study of
Tibetan history by scholars at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth section of Part Three of the book, one passage
reads: "There are a total of eleven provinces under the
jurisdiction of Mongol Emperor Kublai. Although the number of
households in the three Tubo regions could not meet the demand of
a province, it was regarded as a province because here was the
place where the ruling lama (Phagpa) took his residence and
preached Buddhism."

<P>
Although the authors of the two books were from different
countries, used different languages and wrote about different
topics, they were "identical in the statement that Tibet was a
provincial administrative region during the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Gui
said.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Wen Lu, a professor with the Chinese Culture University in
Taiwan, said the relationship of subordination between Tibet and
the central government was formed naturally a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that the formation of the relationship
resulted from various religious sects and local forces in Tibet,
which vied with each other and willingly relied on the central
government for the sake of keeping their own existence and
development, safeguarding their vested interests, and balancing
the power of different sects," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Chang Fengxuan, a research fellow with the Institute of
Nationality Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
said that originally the Dalai Lama was one of the many incarnate
lamas of the Gelugpa sect, rather than a hierarch of all sects of
Tibetan Buddhism or a leader of the regime which merged religious
and secular rule.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1653 that the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
government conferred the title of Dalai Lama on Lozang Gyatso, the
fifth successor of the Gelugpa sect, and thus established Dalai
Lama's political position in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The local regime which merged clerical and secular rule in the
history of Tibet was not simply under the command of a certain
religious sect, it had to take orders from central authorities, he
said.

The successive governments of the Republic of China were always
in contact with Tibet; the Republic of China set up an office in
Lhasa; the international community recognized that Tibet was a
political entity under the sovereignty of China; and it has never
been an independent state.
</P>
<P>
According to the Code of Great Qing, the Resident Minister was
the highest executive in charge of Tibetan administrative,
military, financial and foreign affairs, and also acted as an
imperial envoy in charge of the administration of Tibetan
religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
That indicates the Qing Court directly ruled Tibet at that
time, said Zhang Yuxin, deputy director of the China Institute of
Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
The Qing Court put the system of reincarnation under control
of law by devising the method of drawing lots from a gold urn,
according to Huang Hao, a research fellow with the Institute of
Nationality Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
This showed that the Qing government had the final say about
the reincarnation selection process, Huang said. Formally, it was
an important institution installed by the Qing government to
administrate Tibetan Buddhism, but its profound contents reflected
the political authority of the central government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The scholars pointed out that there is no historical support
for advocating Tibet Independence. History has proved time and
again that only while in the embrace of the motherland can Tibet
achieve sound and rapid development, an improved living standard,
and more freedom.

<HEADLINE> France Deplores Lack of Western Coordination on Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the lack of
coordination and cooperation among Western countries in their
reaction to the tension in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of 13 Western nations signed an appeal in Nairobi
Thursday calling for political reform in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
France did not sign the appeal because it was initiated outside
the European Union, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux said.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the taking of a position by countries of the
European Union, we aren't in the habit of rallying ourselves
without concertation to texts elaborated outside the European
Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, jointly issued by the ambassadors of the United
States, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and a number of EU countries,
condemned the violence in Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city and
key Indian Ocean port, and urged the Kenyan government and the
opposition to start a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Kenyan government to carry out "necessary
reforms to ensure free and just elections."
</P>
<P>
France condemned the violence in Mombasa and the Coast
Province. It lasted for nine days and has so far claimed 40
lives. France also appealed to both sides of the conflict to
refrain from resorting to force, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Paris also echoed the appeal by the 13 countries by urging the
Kenyan government to initiate talks with the opposition on
political reforms that would allow "free and transparent"
elections.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Praises Anti-Drought Success In Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun has given high marks to the anti-drought drive waged by
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and says the lessons
learned from the experience need to be spread.
</P>
<P>
During a inspection tour of this leading grain base from August
19 and 22, Jiang, who is in charge of agricultural issues, said
that although Heilongjiang suffered a severe drought this year,
its grain output may be the same as last year's owing to the
redoubled efforts of the province in preventing drought.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he appreciated Heilongjiang's great success in grain
production in recent years; the province has had bumper crops for
the past seven years straight and a record grain output of 30
billion kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
Vast areas in Heilongjiang were plagued by severe drought this
year, but the provincial officials said that they have worked hard
to reduce the disaster and a bumper crop is attainable if there is
no early frost.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also stressed that the province should speed
up the industrialization process of agriculture, in a bid to make
farming a more profitable business.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China cannot accept the
recent open remarks by Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama of expanding the scope of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty
to the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in response to a participant's question
after delivering a speech on good-neighborly ties at a welcoming
meeting hosted by Malaysia's Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the remarks pose severe interference into China's
internal affairs, as Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
This is the internationally acknowledged fact and has been
explicitly recognized in the joint communiques on the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Japan, and
between China and the United States, the premier stressed.

"The Chief Cabinet Secretary's remarks have arose

</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to comment another country in this host country,
and the speech venue is a Japanese hotel Nikko," he said, adding
"As you raise this question, I would certainly make clear our
principled stand."

<P>
In general, the Sino-Japanese ties are good, Li said, adding
"We are willing to develop normal friendly relations of
cooperation with Japan, as this is conducive to regional peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"However, we should guard against acts by the few Japanese
militarists and right wing forces to undermine the China-Japan

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his belief today that the good-neighborly and
cooperative relations between China and the Republic of Korea
(ROK) will surely move forward with the joint efforts of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here this afternoon with a ROK delegation led
by Kang Kyong-Shik, deputy prime minister and finance and economy
board minister, Jiang said China highly values the Sino-ROK
friendly ties, which are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative relations between China and the ROK in the
fields of economy, trade, science, technology and culture have
witnessed rapid progress since the two countries forged diplomatic
ties in 1992, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of good-neighborly and friendly Sino-ROK ties and
the expansion of mutually-beneficial bilateral cooperation would
serve not only the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but
also the peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific
regions, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Kang Kyong-shik said that ROK-China exchange in personnel,
trade, investment and service industry has been "very active" in
the five years since the two countries forged their diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
ROK-China trade volume last year totaled nearly 20 billion US
dollars and China has become the ROK's the third largest trade
partner, Kang said, adding that the two countries are
complementary in their economies and bilateral cooperation would
enjoy a broad prospect.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rebuffs Accusation Against N. Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today categorically
rejected U.N. Security Council president's accusations that
the second round of the Cyprus talks collapsed due to Turkish
Cypriots' preconditions.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry written statement announced that Turkey
could not agree with the remarks made by British Permanent
Representative to the U.N., Sir Jone Weston, which accuses
Turkish Cypriots of impeding the peace tallks.
</P>
<P>
Weston had reportedly said in a speech that the Turkish
Cypriot side blocked the substantive process "by bringing
preconditions to the table."
</P>
<P>
"The British representative's statement failed to reflect the
truth of the second round of Cyprus peace talks in the Swiss
town of Montreux," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas and Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides held peace talks in Switzerland last week under
the auspices of the U.N., as a continuation of their first
round negotiations at Troutbeck, near New York last month.
</P>
<P>
However, the second round of talks did not produce concrete
fruits since neither side was ready to make concessions on a
number of sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry statement stressed that the
Cypriot government's plan to apply for full EU membership on
behalf of the whole divided island is the real barrier to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's recommendation, which included Cyprus
into the ranks of prospective candidates for EU membership,
has also produced a negative impact on the slightly fruitful
Troutbeck talks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Denktas just did what the Turkish
Cypriot authorities instructed him to do.
</P>
<P>
Denktas himself also denied Weston's remarks at a reception
in Nicosia, accusing the British representative of openly
shielding the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has long remained divided since 1974 when the
Turkey sent troops and took over the northern third of the
island nation following a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community has been making efforts
for years in a bid to solve the protracted problem, but no
tangible results has been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Both Greece and Turkey station troops on the eastern
Mediterranean island which is divided into northern Turkish
community and southern Greek community.

GUANGZHOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephone
subscribers in south China's Guangdong Province has topped 10
million, up 1.13 million on 1990.
</P>
<P>
The province's 1:7 person ratio for telephones is
twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of local telephone exchanges has grown
dramatically from 1.8 million lines in 1990 to well over 12 million
lines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the handling capacity for mobile phone switching
systems stands at 2.8 million lines, or near 20 percent of the
national total. The number of mobile phone users in the province
also accounts for one-fifth of the national total to surpass 2.1
million.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the province has exerted great effort to develop
the local telecommunications industry, and opened the nation's
first opening analog mobile communications network in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The province poured some 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars) into the sector over the past five years alone in order
to expand local wide-band, optical fiber, digital microwave and
satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sector has also introduced a variety of

that peace process in Angola will succeed, despite the problems
faced by the rival sides, a visiting U.S. official said today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Hare, special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
arrived here for a week-long visit, said meetings between Angolan
President Eduardo Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the
rebel UNITA movement, will help get over the current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Hare is in the limelight of the media since his visit is aimed
at conveying Washington's stand on the situation in Angola to
leaders of both sides so as to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hare refused to comment on the resolutions of sanctions that
the U. N. security council is going to impose next week on the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for
its refusal to implement the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka accord stipulates that UNITA should be totally
disarmed and turn into a political party, its radio becomes a
media organ on a non-party basis and state power should be
restored in its occupied zones in cooperation with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The current dilemma results from the fact that UNITA has been
slow in taking actions to implement the articles outlined by the
Lusaka Peace Pact.

<P>
 Action As A Crime
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today rapped the United States for refusing to
regard the currency manipulations of billionaire financier George
Soros, who is responsible for the dwindling of ASEAN currencies,
as a crime because it is not a victim of Soros' actions.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said Malaysia and the affected countries
would take the necessary steps to consider Soros' actions as a
crime because "if we keep quiet, the United States will continue
to legalese his currency manipulations."
</P>
<P>
Soros' actions are considered as a crime as it had affected
many poor people who have become victims unlike the rich who
remained untouched," Mahathir said at a dialogue session with the
participants of an international conference on regional Muslims
and the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On his return from a two-month leave abroad last month,
Mahathir named Soros as the man responsible for the dwindling
value of the Malaysian Ringgit, Thailand Baht, Philippine Peso
and Indonesian Rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia, in collaboration with other countries,
would try to solve the problem and to regard Soros' currency
manipulations as an international crime.
</P>
<P>
"If we regard Soros' actions as a crime, we can take action.
We, who have become his victims, must cooperate to overcome it and
make it a crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Soros' manipulations had affected 10 per cent of
Malaysia's and 20 per cent of Indonesia's economy.

<HEADLINE> HK Inflation Hits 6.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A surge in the prices of
vegetables pushed Hong Kong's inflation rate higher in July,
official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department today released the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for the first month after the
handover.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (A), was 6.5
percent in July, higher than that of 5.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
CPI (A) covers 50 percent of households in Hong Kong whose
monthly expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (503
to 2,065 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (B) and Hang Seng
CPI were also higher than in June -- 6.2 percent against 5.6
percent for the CPI (B) and 6.6 percent against 5.9 percent for
the Hang Seng CPI.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI, which is compiled based on the combined
expenditure pattern of households covered by the three
sub-indices, showed an 6.4 percent increase in July, higher than
that of 5.6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the higher inflation rate to a surge
in the prices of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged rainy weather, the prices of vegetables
soared by over 60 percent in July, the highest rate of increase
recorded within a single month over the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on South China Sea Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua)-- The proper settlement of the
South China Sea issue is conducive to regional peace and
stability, visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China's policy on this issue is to shelve
disputes for joint development and properly settle the problem
through peaceful and friendly consultations in line with the
international law and the maritime law.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in response to a participant's question
after delivering a speech on good-neighborly ties at a welcoming
meeting hosted by Malaysia's Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that due to historic reasons, there exist territory
disputes between China and some countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which are left over by history.
</P>
<P>
"We are not willing to see this issue hinder the normal
progress of our relations with these countries. We wish to explore
ways of how to solve this problem through friendly consultations
and dialogues," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Even some of the issues cannot be resolved at the present
time, they can be shelved and left to our next generations," the
premier added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soccer Team Faces Tough Match at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Host Italian team will have
a tough match against Britain on Friday evening and needs at least a
draw to ensure a berth in the quarter-finals of the 19th World
University Games.
</P>
<P>
The group competitions of the football tournament at the
Universiade will conclude on Friday with top two finishers of each
group qualify for the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
China is the first team to advance after two rounds. They trounced
Czech Republic 4-0 and beat Nigeria 2-1 to collect 6 points to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
The other seven qualifiers will be decided by the last round group
matches and the possiblities are left wide open.
</P>
<P>
In group A, Brazil and Italy placed one-two with four points each
from one win and one draw. Brazil ranks first because it scored more
goals than the Italian eleven.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will take on Iran while Italy plays Britain. All the four
teams in the group have the chance of advancing.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine lead group B with four points, followed by Marocco and
Japan with three points each. Ireland is at the bottom of the group
but still has the chance of qualifying if it can beat Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In group c, the Netherland and South Korea both have four points to
their credit. A draw of the match between the two teams will be
enough to send them in the last eight and at the same time sends South
Africa and Uruguay, each has one points from a draw against a defeat,
packing for home.
</P>
<P>
The other qualifier of group D will most likely be the United
States as it has already collected four points from one victory and
one draw. If the American team can draw or even beat the Chinese team
on Friday, it will enter the quarter-finals together with China.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Insurance Conference Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia Pacific Life
Insurance Congress (APLIC) was opened here today, providing a
forum for more than 8,000 life insurance practitioners from the
region to share their experience in the thriving insurance
business.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the region's largest
insurance conference, Donald Tsang, Financial Secretary of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said: "We aim to
make Hong Kong a regional insurance center that meets the
insurance needs of the modern world of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong being chosen to host the congress
signified a vote of confidence in the city as an international
business center.
</P>
<P>
Insurance is gaining importance in all the economies in the
Pacific Rim, Tsang said. In Hong Kong, the insurance industry has
advanced at double-digit rates for nearly one decade, making
increasingly significant contribution to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Currently, insurance accounts for four percent of the Gross
Domestic Product in Hong Kong and employs 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the penetration rate of insurance still fell
behind that in Japan, North America and Europe. Statistics from
the host of the congress, the Life Underwriters Association of
Hong Kong, show that only 40 to 50 percent of Hong Kong population
are life insurance policy holders.
</P>
<P>
"The growth potential of Hong Kong insurance market is great,"
Tsang said. The SAR government is set to launch the Mandatory
Provident Fund Schemes next year, the latest initiative to
strengthen the development of the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day congress, about 70 keynote speeches, workshops
and exhibitions will be organized, all focusing on the theme "The
New Horizon".
</P>
<P>
Some 50 renowned insurance professionals from around the world
will deliver speeches at the congress to share their experience
and skills among the participants.
</P>
<P>
The APLIC is held every two years in different cities in the
Asia-Pacific Region, with Singapore, Malaysia and Australia
playing host to the first three congresses. The next APLIC is
scheduled for 1999 in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Velayati Designated as Adviser to Iranian Supreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ali Akbar Velayati, who served as
Iran's foreign minister for the past 16 consecutive years, has
been designated as international affair adviser to Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today that the
designation was made by Ali Khamenei himself on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, Kamal Kharrazi, who served as permanent
representative and ambassador to the United Nations, became Iran's
fourth foreign minister in Mohammad Khatami's administration since
the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Velayati sided with the losing side, Khatami's arch rival in the
presidential race Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, during the general
election in May.
</P>
<P>
He has said that he would like to take up teaching in a
university.
</P>
<P>
But today's report said that Khamenei wants Velayati's
valuable experience gained during four different terms of the
presidency as foreign minister to be used constructively.

<HEADLINE> Less New Companies Established in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of new companies
established during the first half of the year dropped one percent
from the same period last year, and their total registered capital
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that only 378 new companies were set up between
January and June this year, down one percent.
</P>
<P>
Their registered capital added up to 60.7 million patacas
(about 7.68 million U.S. dollars), down 60.4 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the new companies deal with such
business as wholesale and retailing, restaurants and hotels. The
others involve construction and public engineering, services,
manufacturing and finance.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new companies are small, with over 85 percent of
them each having less than 100,000 patacas (about 12,660 dollars)
of capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than a dozen companies were disbanded during
the period.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the declining number of new companies is the
result of a sluggish economy that has lasted for more than two
years. Macao's economic growth was recorded at less than one
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Flu Experts Come to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Four more influenza experts
from the United States and Japan arrived in Hong Kong overnight to
join a task force investigating how a three-year-old boy died from
a strain previously unseen in humans, a source in the Department
of Health confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The four experts and a gene investigator from the influenza
branch of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the United
States, who arrived one day earlier, compose a special team of the
World Health Organization (WHO), the source said, without giving
their names or titles.
</P>
<P>
They will collaborate with members of a special committee set
up by the Department of Health to investigate the new flu strain,
H5N1, which killed the local boy on May 21 at Queen Elizabeth
Hospital after an 11-day illness.
</P>
<P>
It is the first case in the world in which H5N1, a virus
previously known to infect only birds, has infected a human-being, the
source said, noting that the H5N1 strain was similar to one which
killed 4,500 chickens in three farms this spring.

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Delegation to Attend APEC Meeting in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- An official delegation of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), headed by
Director-General of Trade Alan Lai, will depart for Canada on
Sunday to attend a senior officials meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC), a press release said today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first senior officials meeting of APEC
attended by the Hong Kong SAR government after July 1 handover. As
provided for under the Basic Law and agreed with APEC, the Hong
Kong SAR participates in APEC as a separate and independent member
economy, using the name "Hong Kong, China."
</P>
<P>
Major issues to be discussed from August 28 to 30 by senior
officials of APEC include trade and economic as well as technical
cooperation, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Lai will hold a number of bilateral
meetings with other member economies to exchange views on major
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR delegation comprises officials from the Trade
and Industry Bureau, the Financial Services Bureau, the
Immigration Department, the Industry Department, the Hong Kong
Economic and Trade Office in Toronto, and the Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third Senior Officials Meeting under the
Canadian APEC Chairmanship. Senior officials will meet again in
November before reporting this year's work to ministers and
leaders of APEC member economies. The APEC ministerial and
Economic Leaders' Meetings will be held in Vancouver, Canada, in
November.

<HEADLINE> Developing Distribution System For Chinese Goods (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China now has some 100,000 commodity markets, more than 2,000
of which are produce and farm by-products wholesale markets. Fairs
in urban and rural areas have been growing fast too, with about
85,000 of them by the end of last year, doing 1.5 trillion yuan in
business.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods have seen large demand but sufficient supplies.
In 1996, sales topped 2.46 trillion yuan, more than a quadruple of
the 1991 figure, an average annual increase of nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in urban and rural residents' incomes contributed
greatly to the increasing demand. City dwellers' per-capita cost
of living rose from 1,544 yuan in 1991 to 4,377 yuan in 1996, up
nearly six percent in real terms annually.
</P>
<P>
The balance in supply and demand is mainly attributed to good
industrial and agricultural production. Consecutive good harvests
and increases in produce and farm by-product market prices have
greatly encouraged farmers to grow more to expand the urban
"shopping basket".
</P>
<P>
Rapid increases in the number of overseas businesses and
imports of consumer goods have also helped stabilize the market,
the SSB report says, and about 90 percent of goods are in greater
supply in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants Currency Convertible in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony
Ani Thursday canvassed the convertibility of the national
currency, the Naira, in the west African sub-region to oil the
wheel of cross-border investments.
</P>
<P>
This will eliminate most of the trade barriers in the form of
smuggling and other malpractices, and make Nigeria the center of
west Africa, said the minister quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Naira as the "most formidable means of
exchanging in the sub-region," Ani said the currency is virtually
being used in most west African countries including Benin, Niger,
Chad, Cameroun, Ghana, Liberia, Gambia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the eco-Naira in these countries can be equated to
Euro-Dollar in Europe," he told members of the Vision 2010
Committee, the country's long-term development planning body, in
the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the ultimate convertibility of the Naira
will play a significant role and will form the best incentive
for Nigerian investors in the sub-region, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the committee should examine the prospects of
realizing the convertibility of the Naira, he added, urging
Nigerians to work towards the goal.
</P>
<P>
The minister also proposed the drawing up of specific
investment protection agreements among members of the Economic
Community of West African States as a way of ensuring the safety
of investments in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also boost intra-west African trade and
enable Nigerian businessmen to repatriate their capital interest
and dividends "at any time without let or hindrance", he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister warned that such investment should not
result in capital flight, thereby affecting the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
On the exchange rate of the national currency, he said, the
present administration is striving to make the Naira stronger
through the accumulation of foreign reserves, currently projected
at 7.4 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current dual exchange rate of the Naira will eventually
give way to one rate, he added.

<HEADLINE> France Discovers Previously Unknown Nazi Atrocity Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A previously unknown atrocity
committeed by German Nazis against Jews was lately discovered in
France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Dauphine Libere, which is published in Grenoble,
southeast France, said today that 16 Jewish children and
adolescents and two adults were arrested by Gestapos in the late
night of March 23, 1944, in Voiron, the department of Isere in
southeast France.
</P>
<P>
They were deported to Nazi death camps in Auschwitz in Poland,
and Estonia and Lithuania in April and May 1944, and none of them
survived, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The event was recorded in a document which was discovered at
random recently in the archives of a Jewish organization in Paris,
the Israelite Alliance of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that the mayor's office of
Voiron had confirmed this report and indicated that the round-up
resulted from a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the document was also confirmed by experts,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The 16 Jewish children and adolescents, aged from seven to 12,
guided by two adults, including the mother of two of the children,
belonged to a French Jewish religious group named "The Association
of Practicing Israelites."
</P>
<P>
This group once sheltered 70 Jewish children, most of them from
Germany and Poland and whose parents were arrested by Gestapos.
</P>
<P>
The members of the group, gathering around a rabbi, took refuge
in the unoccupied zone of southeast France, including Grenoble and
Marseille, as well as Saint-Etienne-de-Crossey which was under
administration of Italy at that time.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office of Voiron said that the Jews could have
drawn attention from local militiamen who reported to the Germans.
</P>
<P>
A reporter of Dauphine Libere also found two witnesses of the
round-up who kept silent over the atrocity for 53 years until
now.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt Continues Food Supplies to Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
sent 2,692 metric tons of essential food items to the Northern
province by vessel since July in spite of the attempt by Tamil
rebels to disrupt the food supplies to Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Ministry of Defense this
afternoon said another 2,700 MT of foods are being on the way on
board the vessel Lanka Muditha and further 2,200 MT of food items
are being loaded at the Colombo port now.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had attempted to
sabotage passenger services and food supplies to Tamil civilians
in Jaffna peninsula by attacking a few passenger ships and
hijacking another vessel Morang Bong in the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were made by the international Committee of the Red
Cross at the request of the government to resume these civilian
and commercial shipping activity, but the LTTE seems determined to
continue with their threats to attack the civilian and commercial
shipping denying the basic needs of nearly half a million people
who live in Jaffna city now, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna was once the stronghold of the LTTE, who has waged a
guerrilla war for a separate state in the north and east of the
island country since 1983. Government troops recaptured Jaffna
peninsula in May last year.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Project Aims to Make Breakthrough in Petroleum Technology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-US technology development
project launched recently promises to benefit the oil industries
of both countries, according to the president of an American
company serving as coordinator of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to develop a device that can map and image the
underground structure of oilfields by way of Cross-Well Electric
Magnetic Imaging (EMI), according to Li Fang, president of
California-based Laurel Industrial Company, Inc.
</P>
<P>
"Doctors use the CT scanner to see the inside of the human
body, and the EMI device, if and when successfully developed, is
the CT scanner of what lies under the ground," says Li Fang, a
Chinese American, in an interview in his Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by Fang. In 1992, he decided to
bring Chinese and U.S. scientists together for developing the
technology when he got wind that some U.S. scientists in several
prestigious institutions -- University of California at Berkeley,
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and the Sandia National Laboratory -- were doing
research aimed at developing such a device.
</P>
<P>
Owing to limited research funds, work of the U.S. scientists
had been largely limited to academic research and laboratory
experiments. "With less pressure that what China faces, the
U.S. government and oil industry were investing less than
desirable," Fang said.
</P>
<P>
"China is different. It needs the technology badly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fang approached China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC),
suggesting that it finance further research on the U.S. side as
well as field tests of the technology in China, work that is
needed to make the technology a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
A deal was clinched last August when a cooperative agreement
was signed between CNPC's Bureau of Exploration and Fang's Laurel
Industrial Co. representing U.S. researchers. The agreement went
into effect in February, 1997.

<P>
According to the agreement with a term of three years, the
Chinese side will contribute 1.2 million US dollars to further
research and development of the EMI technology and the two sides
will work together on geophysical modeling, system software, field
tests and data interpretation in China's Shengli Oilfield in
eastern Shandong Province with a view to commercializing the
technology. The Chinese and U.S. sides will share research results.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of the project's success," Fang says.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, for the oil industry, the biggest issue in the
21st century is not "exploratory" geophysical prospecting aimed at
locating new oil deposits but "development" geophysical
prospecting aimed at pumping more oil from existing fields.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide at present, of all oil deposits that have been
discovered, less than 30 percent are recoverable with present
techniques, and about half of this 30 percent have been pumped
out. How to increase the recovery rate and find "by-passed" oil at
existing fields have been the biggest challenge for the industry.
</P>
<P>
With the device, Fang said, scattered oil pools that have
been "by-passed" during the primary recovery process in existing
oilfields can be detected and geological structure details between
oil wells can be mapped, thereby boosting the rate of recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The outer space is now open to mankind, not so our mother
earth. We hope the device will help geologists and petroleum
engineers see what lies underground," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the international oil industry, that in
China in particular, badly needs such a device.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Leader Calls for Reanimation of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ehud Barak, the leader of Israel's
opposition Labor Party, said today that an "emergency reanimation"
is needed to relaunch the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians, while reaffirming his respect for the right of
self-determination by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with daily Liberation published today, Barak
criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu for failing
to take initiatives with the Palestinians to resume peace talks
after the double bombing attack in Jerusalem late last month.
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that we are strong, militarily and economically,
and we have the support of the only superpower. We can thus take
initiatives to resolve the conflict," said Barak.
</P>
<P>
He said that what was destroyed since the coming to power of
the conservative government in Israel is the "reciprocal
confidence carefully built by the (former) Labor government."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether this crisis of confidence can be
overcome. I hope so, in the interests of the two peoples... But I
don't see either what we could win from a conflict (with
Palestinians)," said Barak.
</P>
<P>
On whether Israel should agree to the establishment of a
Palestinian state, Barak said that it is up to the Palestinians to
determine their final status, as long as they take into
consideration the security of Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the conflict between Israel and Lebanon in southern Lebanon,
Barak said that Israel could withdraw from southern Lebanon stage
by stage if tranquility can be maintained by the Lebanese in that
area.
</P>
<P>
"After a relatively short period of tranquility and
negotiations, we could withdraw from a portion of Lebanese
territory... in four or five phases. After each phase, we will
see if the Lebanese are capable of guarding the situation under
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Israel's dispute with Syria over Golan Heights, he said
that if the Labor Party was in power, it would not stop holding
talks with Damascus to seek an agreement which covers Lebanon,
terrorism, access to water resource, security for the two sides,
normalization of relations and even economic cooperations.

<TEXT>
<P>
With its economy surging ahead at an annual growth rate of ten
percent or so, China has become a net petroleum importer. It is
vital for the country to maintain and increase oil production,
which stood at 158 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To do this, China needs to increase the rate of recovery in its
existing oilfields in east China which have hitherto supplied the
bulk of its crude.
</P>
<P>
The key to this, Fang said, lies in finding "by-passed" oil
pools between drying wells and seeing the details of geological
structure so that petroleum engineers will know what to do to get
oil out in a more efficient and economical way.
</P>
<P>
"And that is where the underground imaging technology is
needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laurel has largely played the role of project organizer so far
but will have a cutting-edge instrument available and become a
market leader in China once the device hits the market.
</P>
<P>
The five-year-old company acts as the sole sales representative
in China for 26 Western manufacturers of geophysical prospecting
and marine survey instruments as well as oil-related lab
equipment, of which 17 are based in the United States. The company
sold ten million US dollars worth of instruments in China in 1996,
from three million US dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Our company is not limited to serving as an equipment
distributor; it seeks to shorten the time and path for turning
technology into a commodity," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the U.S. and China are a good match in a venture
like this, Fang said "the United States has the most sophisticated
technology, while China is the most fertile land for this
particular technology to become a commodity for three reasons: it
needs the technology badly; it has a big contingent of competent
scientists; and the cost of doing field tests is relatively low
here."

<HEADLINE> CBI Fears Strong Pound to Stall UK's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) predicted a sharp slowdown in the economy next year
after its latest report showed the outlook for exports is the
worst for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' export orders have slumped to their lowest ebb
for almost five years, according to the latest monthly survey by
the CBI.
</P>
<P>
Concerns that the strong pound could damage growth prospects
for the British economy overshadowed official figures revealing
consumers are spending money faster than at any time since the
third quarter of 1988.
</P>
<P>
City economists argue that the UK's biggest concern is the
rapid growth in consumer spending. During the second quarter,
consumer expenditure rose by 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
As consumer spending powers the economy ahead in the short
term, the CBI has cut its forecast next year from 2.7 to 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed here that if sterling was 10 percent
higher, the UK's economy might grow by only 2 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Young Generation's Devotion to Space Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- As the fate of the Russia's Mir
space station grabbed the world's attention, President Boris
Yeltsin today called on young Russians to devoted themselves to
the space undertaking.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Yeltsin highly praised the
country's achievements in the space and aviation sector and
promised to increase budget allocations for the financially
squeezed industry in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"One should not forget that the status of Russia as a great
power depends to a large extent on the state of our aerospace
industry," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to call on young people to go to work in aircraft
construction firms, in design bureaus. There are new openings,
great prospects," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's remarks came at a time when Russian cosmonauts were
preparing to make vital repairs to the Mir space station damaged
in an accident last month.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet Union had made great achievements in space
technology with the credit of sending the first man into space in
1961, and enjoyed a genuine enthusiasm from the public to its
space research plans.
</P>
<P>
But since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, under the
backdrop of a sluggish economy, many Russians have lost interest
and demanded that the expensive space program be dramatically cut.
</P>
<P>
In an upbeat tone, Yeltsin urged Russians to overcome an
indifference to space research, and said he foresaw the time when
space and aviation would once again become the pride of the
nation.

<HEADLINE> Angolan FM Calls for UN Action to Promote Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Venancio De
Moura, now on a working visit in Sao Tome and Principe, expressed
his hope Thursday that the U.N. Security Council take up relevant
measures to promote peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Angolan News Agency today, Moura
said, the Security Council should impose timely sanctions on the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
which has unilaterally ceased implementation of the Lusaka Peace
Accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
If the council does not show its firm stand on this issue, the
peace process in Angola will be delayed further, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan foreign minister believed that there is full
reason now for the Security Council to impose sanctions on UNITA
so as to avoid further trampling on its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and people all hope that the Security
Council carry out necessary actions to push forward the precess
of peace and national reconciliation, Moura stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process is currently facing a stalemate. The
UN Security Council will open a special session next Tuesday to
discuss the Angolan peace process. The meeting will pass a
resolution to impose sanctions on UNITA, including limiting UNITA
leaders' visits abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said sanctions measures will not come into
effect immediately to await positive actions from UNITA leaders.

<HEADLINE> WHO Confirms New Influenza Virus Strain in Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has confirmed that an influenza virus, known previously to
infect birds only, has been isolated in a three-year-old boy who
died in Hong Kong in May of Reye Syndrome during an acute
respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Thursday, WHO confirmed that this is the
only case detected so far.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication at present that this strain is
spreading from person to person," said Dr. Daniel Lavanchy of
WHO's Division of Emerging and other Communicable Diseases
Surveillance and Control (EMC).
</P>
<P>
"There is consequently no need for special measures to be taken
as of today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been no other instances of type A(H5N1)
virus being found among humans, efforts are being made to
determine whether other persons in Hong Kong or other parts of
southern China may have been infected with this strain.
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists from a WHO Collaborating Center, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia,
arrived in Hong Kong Wednesday to conduct an extensive
investigation in conjunction with the WHO Collaborating Center at
the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
They will assist the Influenza Center and Department of Health
in Hong Kong in assessing the significance of this discovery and
its impact on public health.
</P>
<P>
The Reye Syndrome, which involves the central nervous system
and the liver, is a rare complication in children who may have
ingested salicylates (i.e. aspirin).
</P>
<P>
It occurs mainly in children with influenza type B, and less
frequently in children with influenza type A or chickenpox.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Egyptian Trade Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The annual volume of
Israeli-Egyptian trade is expected to rise by 21 percent this year
to reach 100 million U.S. dollars, reported bi-weekly Israel
Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Albert Paposhadu, Chairman of the Israeli-Egyptian Chamber of
Industry and Trade, was quoted as saying the bulk of the increase
will be in agriculture, food products and plants, paper, plastics,
rubber and metal goods.
</P>
<P>
According to Paposhadu, the volume of Israeli exports to Egypt
is set to rise 12 percent to 65 million dollars, while imports
from Egypt will increase 40 percent to 35 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Egyptian entrepreneurs have also stepped up their
cooperation by establishing more joint ventures which covered a
range of areas including agriculture, textiles, medical equipment,
air conditioning and refrigeration and plastics.
</P>
<P>
To cope with these developments, the two countries need to
establish joint financial and banking organizations, and insurance
and transportation companies, and the introduction of tax and
custom duties relief, said Paposhadu.
</P>
<P>
He also made a call on Egypt, one of the two Arab countries
that have reached peace with Israel, to support Israel's full
membership of the proposed Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
"Regional economic cooperation which does not include Israel --
which is an integral part of the region -- significantly reduces
its chances of success," said Paposhadu.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Visitors to Australia Up 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Overseas visitors to Australia
in the first seven months of this year numbered 2,456,800, up five
percent compared with the corresponding period in 1996, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Minister in charge of Industry, Science and Tourism
John Moore said the ABS international arrivals data indicated
Australia's 11.8 billion U.S. dollars tourism industry was on
track to meet on official forecast of 7.3 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Tourism Council Australia Managing Director Bruce Baird
said growth from Australia's five key source markets has slowed
with the exception of the United Kingdom and some have slowed
considerably like Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Australian tourism industry must continue to address issues
affecting the market such as the price competitiveness and the
packaging of Australia as a destination, Baird said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
In the seven months to July, Japan accounted for 19 percent of
all visitor arrivals (468,600). New Zealand followed closely with
15 percent and the United Kingdom with nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese tourists, however, was down two percent
on the same period the previous year. Moore attributed the slight
decline in arrivals to uncertainty in the Japanese economy and
strong competition.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed increases for all other top ten countries or
regions, except for Taiwan, which decreased four percent.
</P>
<P>
The largest rise in visitor numbers was recorded from the
Republic of Korea, up 19 percent to 147,300.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia recorded a rise of 17 percent to 108,200, and the
United Kingdom arrivals rose 13 percent to 217,700.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures show a 13.5 percent decline in permanent
arrivals, compared with June last year. It attributed that to
lower intakes under the migration and humanitarian programs.
</P>
<P>
Permanent arrivals from the Asian region numbered 32,100 in
1996-1997, the past fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, a decline of
10 percent on 1995-1996. Of those about a quarter were born in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Overall in 1996-1997 there were 102,200 permanent and
long-term arrivals from the Asian region and 50,200 permanent and
long-term departures," the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted 1996-1997 increase in permanent arrivals from
New Zealand (up seven percent to 13,100), South Africa (up one
percent to 3,200) and Taiwan (up 33 percent to 2,200).
</P>
<P>
But in 1996-1997 there were declines in permanent arrivals from
the United Kingdom (down 14 percent to 9,700), China (down 31
percent to 7,800), Bosnia (down 40 percent to 2,100) and Hong Kong
(down eight percent to 3,900).

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) gazetted six regulations
today to give effect to the directives given by the Central
People's Government to the Chief Executive for implementing United
Nations (UN) sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Of the six regulations, two are relating to restrictions on
imports from and exports to Iraq of certain goods and related
financial procedures.
</P>
<P>
Two other regulations are on restrictions on import from and
export to Libya of certain goods as well as on aviation links and
related activities.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two regulations impose arms embargoes against

</P>
<P>
The Secretary for Trade and Industry of the SAR government,

enabling provisions of the UN Sanctions Ordinance enacted last
month.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of UN sanctions is necessary in order to
enable the Central People's Government to meet its international
obligations," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also necessary to safeguard Hong Kong's reputation as a
responsible trading and financial center and to prevent Hong Kong
from becoming a conduit for those seeking to supply goods,
services and finance to prohibited destinations and persons
connected with them, identified in UN Security Council decisions,"
she added.

</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 108.54 million units, valued

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Down On Back Of Volatile US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed down today on the back of a volatile New York market which
was expected to fall further overnight, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index was down 29.4 points to 2,620.3.
</P>
<P>
When asked what was the reason for the drop, one broker said
"purely New York".
</P>
<P>
"It was expected to be down 20 to 30 points from the opening
bell and realistically that's where it ended up," broker Julian
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 125 points on
Thursday, its fifth straight triple-digit swing, as rising
interest rates derailed the New York stock market's bid at a rapid
recovery from its month's downturn.
</P>
<P>
The four major banks were all down, with ANZ losing 21 cents,
Westpac shedding 14.9 cents, Commonwealth dropping 17 and NAB
slipping 15.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was up 5.3 points at 1342.2.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was down 16.8 points to 1,373.7, while
the all industrials index was down 45.8 points to 4,218.8.

National turnover totaled 353.64 million shares with a value of

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Up As Confidence On Rates Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
today stronger against the US currency, driven by growing
confidence that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) won't cut
rates in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished at 74.90 US cents, up from 74.44 late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, it hit a high in New York of 75.10 US cents, the
first time it has traded through 75 US cents since late June.
</P>
<P>
The push higher in the Australian dollar began on Wednesday,
the day after the RBA released its August bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's report, interpreted as ruling out further
interest rate cuts in the near term, has set a bulletin tone for
the market which has seen the local unit stronger over the past
three days.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar is looking strong, and it is continuing
the stronger trend," said NatWest strategist Stephen Halmarick.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the local unit was at 87.72 from 87.79
against the Japanese yen and was at 1.3724 from 1.3815 against the
German mark.

<HEADLINE> Market Distribution Going Strong in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China has had some improvements
in its commodity distribution system in the past five years, with
more than 90 percent of its goods sold on the open market and less
than five percent remaining under State control.
</P>
<P>
The central government has loosened price controls for all
consumer goods and gradually freed major farm produce and
by-products like grain and cooking oil from controls, according to
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized state commercial enterprises were given
more autonomy in pricing, hiring and income distribution, while
small businesses adopted a state-owned but privately-run
practice. As a result, the state sector has brought about a shift
from central planning to market-oriented operations.
</P>
<P>
A system of different forms of ownership has been taking shape
in the distribution sector over the past five
years. Non-governmental businesses have maintained the fastest
growth, and increased sales from 47 percent in 1992 to more than
70 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on overseas-backed enterprises in China's market
has been lifted and six of the world's largest chain-store groups
have opened their outlets in major Chineses cities like Shanghai
and Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China, Malaysia Sign Accord on Joint Venture Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China and Malaysia today
signed an agreement on a Sino-Malaysian plantation and pulp paper
mill.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng and his Malaysian counterpart
Mahathir Mohammad attended today's signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture project, at an estimated cost of 4.3 billion
ringgit (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars), represents the single
largest foreign investment by China abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, China and Malaysia will set up two
companies, one for supply of raw materials and the other for a
pulp paper mill. China will have 40 percent of the first company's
share and Malaysia 60 percent, while China shares 60 percent and
Malaysia 40 percent of the second company.
</P>
<P>
The project will have a production capacity of 750,000 metric
tons of pulp and 225,000 metric tons of paper per annum, according
to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
As a substantial portion of the production will be exported to
China, the project will generate foreign exchange earnings and
savings in excess of 1 billion ringgit (about 370 million U.S.
dollars) per annum for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a continuous supply of raw materials for the mill,
the project will have its own sustainable forest management
program, which includes converting and rehabilitating waste and
idle land into productive forest plantation.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 220,000 hectares of forest plantation will be
established with an annual production of 3.8 million cubic meters
of pulpwood to feed the pulp mill.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to create about 6,500 jobs
including 200 managerial and technical positions, will bring about
economic, social and environmental benefits to Malaysia
particularly to the state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Chinese Vice Minister in charge of
the State Planning Commission Chen Tonghai, the Lion Group
Chairman Cheng Heng Jem and Sabah State Chief Minister Yong Teck
Lee.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Not to Expel Nigeria : Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Nations has
no plan to expel Nigeria from the 52-nation organization,
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said Thursday in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, Anyaoku said
though the Commonthwealth summit in October in Edinburgh,
Scotland will deliberate on the Nigerian situation, it will not
wield the big stick ultimately, even if it still finds the
situation unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku was in South Africa to consult with President Nelson
Mandela over the coming Commonwealth summit.
</P>
<P>
His comment came amid wild speculations that Nigeria will quit
the Commonthwealth in the fear of being expelled at the summit.
</P>
<P>
When the Commonthwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in 1995
for executing author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority
activists, it give a two-year ultimatum for Nigeria to improve in
human rights and democracy, before it will be expelled for good.
</P>
<P>
As the ultimatum is drawing near, the fear is that the
Commonwealth might be forced to honour its threat, as dialogue
between the two sides has so far produced no positive results.
</P>
<P>
Another reason behind the speculations is that Nigeria has
been emphasizing its right to find new friends and did new
friendship in non-west countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same day of Anyaoku's comment, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi announced that Nigeria will open nine new
overseas information centers in Africa, South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
This move, Ikimi said, is to counter the negative reports of
Nigeria by some sector of the international community and let his
country better known by the outside world.

21st century is not only in the fundamental interest of the two
peoples but also benefits peace, stability and development of Asia
and the world as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that abiding by the principles and spirit of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship and having a correct attitude towards problems of the

and see its latest economic developments.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Holds Talks With Namibian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, holding
talks this morning with Namibian Deputy Prime Minister Hendrik
Witbooi, said that China treasures its traditional friendship with
Namibia and attaches importance to the development of friendship
and co-operation with the African country.
</P>
<P>
The two officials discussed bilateral relations and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that since China and Namibia established diplomatic
ties, political relations have been stable and firm and there have
been constant exchanges of high-level visits and more friendly
contacts between the two sides. China is willing to work with
Namibia to consolidate bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have maintained friendly consultations and
close co-operation and joined hands in safeguarding the legitimate
rights and interests of the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Namibian President Sam Nujoma
exchanged visits last year, pushing the bilateral political
relations and friendly co-operation to a new level, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the results of bilateral economic and trade
co-operation, Zhu said that there is still great potential for
co-operation and he believes that through joint efforts, the two
sides can increase co-operation.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his appreciation for Namibia's "one China" stance and
congratulated it on the success of the second national congress of
the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) not long ago,
and the election of Witbooi as SWAPO's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Discussing China-South Africa relations, Zhu said he
appreciates South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo's
reiteration recently that South Africa will sever its "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan and establish diplomatic ties with the
People's Republic of China by the end of this year, and that it
will treat its relations with Taiwan as the United Nations and
other countries do.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that to forge normal relations between China
and South Africa is not only in the fundamental interests of the
two peoples but are also conducive to strengthening unity and
co-operation between China and the South African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his pleasure at visiting China and his appreciation
for the Chinese government's warm reception, Witbooi conveyed
Nujoma's greetings to President Jiang Zemin and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will stick to a "one China" position and
support China's reunification cause, and expressed his
satisfaction with the development of bilateral friendship and
co-operation and his appreciation for China's firm support and
assistance to Namibia. He said he hopes that bilateral friendship
and co-operation will continue to be strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Surrendered Rebel Commander Discovers Armory in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A former rebel commander, who
lost his confidence in fighting against the government, has
discovered an armory for the government, "The Monitor" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Oyet Pen Mogi Lakweka, a former commander of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA), told a press conference Wednesday in
northern Gulu district that he saw no reason to fight the
government any more.
</P>
<P>
He helped the government troops find 53 sub-machine guns, five
light machine guns, a motor, three grenades, 210 loose
ammunitions and four anti-personnel mines in Kilak hill in the
district, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
There are more underground arms and ammunitions in the north
to be found, Lakweka said.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Bantariza, Public Relation Officer of the fourth
division, said the acquisition of the weapons helped a lot in
destroying the LRA leadership.
</P>
<P>
What Lakweka did seems to be one of the greatest loss the
LRA ever suffered in its history, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops will receive the former rebels if they
wished to join them, said the paper quoting Shaban Bantariza.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group operating in the north and has bases in
southern Sudan. It had thousands of members in the past and now
has some three hundred fighters, an early report said.

<HEADLINE> Modernization In Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Taxicabs carry passengers to
luxury hotels that line Lhasa's streets, and MD-82 passenger jets
land and take off at the "roof of the world", all part of Tibet's
global modernization enthusiasm, which has shocked the rest of
China since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Some 62 big projects are under construction in the Tibet
Autonomous Region to open iron mines, thermal-energy plants,
highways, and satellite ground stations.
</P>
<P>
Scholars at the ongoing Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies now
maintain that the modernization of Tibet is not a mere change of
the appearance of cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetans' incomes have increased, and so has their life
expectancy. And they have more dynamic thoughts on their minds,"
says Li Tao, a researcher whose recent study shows that more
Tibetan farmers are interested in doing business and traveling to
big cities and other provinces because they have more money and
want to make more money.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's economy has been growing at 10 percent annually for
past three consecutive years. In the first half of 1997, more than
100,000 tourists visited Tibet, bringing cash to the region, and
perhaps more important, information. Tibetans now have web sites
of their own and communicate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Scholars agree that Tibet is casting off its image as a
conservative and isolated land, becoming more open, and they say
that change is important for the region, which was still a society
of serfs half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, Tibetan farmers would throw chemical fertilizers
into rivers, because gods and nature were the only things they
worshipped. Now, what they care about most is how to get enough
chemical fertilizer to increase their crop output," Li Tao says.
</P>
<P>
At least 80,000 words about modern science and technology,
including the now fashionable word 'clone', have found their way
into the Tibetan language. "We believe that even the oldest and
the most exquisite language must continue to evolve in keeping
with the times," said Hu Tan, of the Tibetan Studies Center.

<HEADLINE> Modernization In Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Nancy Levine, a professor studying Tibetan
households at the University of California, Tibetans used to
worked 30 days a month, but now have more free time.
</P>
<P>
Last year, half of the Tibetans took part in grass-roots
elections to chose deputies to the local People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Religion, which is vital to Tibetans, is changing gradually. In
the old days, if a Tibetan was sick, the only thing to do was to
burn incense and pray in front of gods, but now he or she will
go to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
More local people have got used to the existence of
hydro-electric power plants built on lakes which are the homes of
gods according to Tibetan mythology.
</P>
<P>
However, their pious adherence to Buddhism is almost
unchanged. The difference is that they enjoy more religious
freedoms than before and can go to monasteries if they wish,
according to Elaine Robson, a British scholar who has visited
Tibet four times.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Epstein, a professor at University of Washington, says
that the process of commercializing ethnic culture has largely
reshaped local ways of life. However, it has also enhanced local
self-awareness of Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some Chinese scholars are not entirely satisfied
with the degree of modernization. Yu Changjiang of Beijing
University found that the use of machines in rural areas has
helped peasants save time. But, the problem is that many of them
find they have nothing to do in the free time provided by the
machine.
</P>
<P>
Ma Rong, a social-anthropology researcher, explains that this
can be attributed to a higher rate of illiteracy in Tibet, a
comparative lack of modern scientific knowledge, and a shortage of
sources of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the modernization drive in Tibet should be
increased, Li Tao said. "Some people wish to preserve a primitive
and isolated Tibet as a sample world where they can visit for
novelty. This is a very irresponsible attitude," she added.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Pledges to Consider War Veterans' Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has promised to come up demands of the war veterans at the
cabinet meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the promise after a nine-hour meeting
Thursday with leadership of the war veterans during the country's
liberation struggle. At the end of the meeting, war veterans
leader Chenjerai Hunzvi said that they were happy with the
outcome of the marathon meeting which did not even break for
lunch or refreshments, reported the Zimbabwe News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe had undertaken that next Wednesday he will give
feedback to the War Veterans Association on the decision due to
be made by cabinet, Hunzvi said.
</P>
<P>
"We could not be happy and we could not be smiling," said
Hunzvi, chairman of the association when asked if Mugabe had
accepted their demands.
</P>
<P>
Among the demands are that each war veteran should receive a
gratuity of 500,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (43,000 U.S. Dollars) and a
monthly pension of 2,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (174 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The war veterans also demand that 50 percent of all
ex-combatants needing settlement should be given land by December
this year and the rest by July next year.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants want to go into the war of economic
emancipation of the black majority and hence their desire to
participate in agricultural production and other industrial and
commercial activities, Hunzvi added.
</P>
<P>
He said they were happy the meeting had agreed to the
principle of affirmative action for ex-combatants in the
allocation of high ranking positions in the diplomatic service
and other organs of the government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Mugabe's official residence came after hundreds
of ex-combatants resorted to picketing ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and government offices,
demanding disbursement of disability pensions.

<HEADLINE> Grave Development Harmful to Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A commentary entitled "A Grave
Development Harmful to Sino-Japanese Relations," carried in
today's People's Daily, rebutted some Japanese officials for their
remarks that violate China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said, on August 17, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama remarked that new Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines would cover the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
This violated China's sovereignty and met opposition from the
ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the New Party Sakigake
(NPS). At a tripartite meeting reviewing the guidelines two days
later, the SDP accused Kajiyama of creating chaos and restated
that the Taiwan Straits are outside the areas covered by the
guidelines. Agreeing with SDP, the NPS pointed out that when
defining the "defense areas," the Taiwan Straits should not be
included.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai,
"confirmed" Kajiyama's remarks on August 18, saying that, from the
united view of the Japanese government since 1960, Taiwan is
within the "Far East" region defined by the Japan-U.S. security
treaty.
</P>
<P>
One day later, on August 19, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda
again openly claimed that Kajiyama's remarks were made in line
with the consistent position of the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kaoru
Yosano came forward and said Kajiyama's remarks did not contradict
the government's stance, and even hoped to get "understanding"
from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Such remarks by senior Japanese officials involve a major
question of principle in Sino-Japanese relations, that is, how to
look at the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the 1978
Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friendship, which laid the
foundation of Sino-Japanese bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that at the time when the Japan-U.S.
security treaty was revised in 1960, it was Nobusuke Kishi's
government, which had always been hostile to China and maintained
the so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan, that was ruling
Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Japan "severed its relations" with Taiwan and
recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the
sole legal government of China. Only under such circumstances, did
China and Japan normalize their relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan noted in the 1972 joint statement that the
government of the People's Republic of China reaffirms that Taiwan
is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic
of China. The government of Japan fully understands and respects
this stand of the government of China and adheres to its stand of
complying with Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Remains Largest Oil Supplier to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran is still the largest
supplier of crude oil to South Africa at 9.3 million tons a year,
according to a figure released by the South African Petroleum
Industry Association (SAPIA) this week.
</P>
<P>
The SAPIA annual report shows that Iran remained by far the
top oil supplier of South Africa although its sales dipped to 9.3
million tons from 11 million tons the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for CALTEX, a well-known oil company in South
Africa, said much of the fall could be attributed to a U.S. trade
embargo on Iran, which prevented CALTEX from importing Iranian
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
CALTEX, which had previously run its Cape Town Refinery on
about 80 percent Iranian crude, had replaced much of the tonnage
with Angolan crude, pushing imports from that country up to
910,000 tons from 120,000 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But, the spokesman said, imports from Angola had declined this
year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's oil imports from the North Sea dropped off
sharply, down to 540,000 tons from 1.39 million tons, as did
imports from Saudi Arabia, which fell to 380,000 tons from 1.1
milion the previous year. Both falls were attributed to less
competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that competitive pricing had pushed Kuwaiti
oil exports to South Africa up five times to 2.86 million tons
last year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was adjusting its pricing formula and was likely
to take greater market share over the next year, the CALTEX
spokesman said.

<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Ministry of Information Thursday lauded
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's decision on the immediate
transfer of 10 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinian National
Authority to help alleviate the sufferings of its people under the
Israeli siege.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria said on Thursday that it has decided to extend an
urgent grant to the Palestinian National Authority to help ease
the sufferings of the Palestinian people due to Israeli sanctions.
The amount of money was not given.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt tops world countries in terms of the number of land
mines, numbering 23 million, but is yet reckoned the least of
countries affected by problems emanating from the existence of
such explosive materials.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- In a statement marking the 28th anniversary of setting a
fire in Aqsa Mosque in 1969 by a Jewish militant, the Arab League
held Israel "fully responsible for the flare up of violence acts
in the region."

<HEADLINE> Grave Development Harmful to Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1978, the two countries signed the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, confirming that the joint statement constitutes the
basis of the relations of peace and friendship between the two
countries and that the principles enunciated in the joint
statement should be strictly observed. Both article 1 and article
3 in the treaty reiterate the principle of non-interference in
each other's internal affairs. These are solemn promises the
Japanese government has made to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
But, Kajiyama and his like, stubbornly sticking to the
anti-China stand of the Kishi government, wanted to include the
Taiwan Straits in the joint U.S.-Japanese defense areas. This
constitutes nothing but an open interference in China's internal
affairs and gross violation of the two basic documents on the
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
People cannot help but ask how after all these Japanese
government officials evaluate the current Sino-Japanese
relations? And where do they intend to lead the relations to?
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, following the normalization of relations
between China and Japan, chief Japanese cabinet members clearly
stated Japan's stand on the issue of "defense areas."
</P>
<P>
For instance, on November 11, 1972, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Masayoshi Ohira, one of the signers of the join statement, pointed
out in parliamentary debates that clauses on Taiwan contained in
the 1969 Japan-U.S. joint statement reflected only views of the
Japanese and American leaders on the situation in Taiwan at that
time.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Taiwan issue is "China's internal affair" and
Japan should take a cautious attitude toward it for the sake of
the friendly relations between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
On December 12, 1978, Japanese Foreign Minister Sunao Sonoda,
plenipotentiary to the signing of the Sino-Japanese treaty, told
the parliamentary hearing that with the normalization of
Sino-Japan relations, Article 6 concerning the Far East of the
Japan-U.S. security treaty concerning the Far East had become
invalid.
</P>
<P>
However, today, some Japanese officials claimed that Japan has
never changed its stand of 1960. This kind of quibble regardless
of historical facts is evidently intended to seek excuses for the
political pursuit of some politicians, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance and development of friendly relations between
China and Japan conform to the fundamental interests of the two
nations, the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
What deserves vigilance is that there are always people in
Japan who want to drag the Sino-Japanese relations backward.
</P>
<P>
Today, they do not balk at fostering the grave development in
the Sino-Japanese relations by expressing light opinions about
such a sensitive issue as the inclusion of the Taiwan Straits in
Japan's "defense areas." They are trying to back the car of
history and their act goes against the common wishes of the
Chinese and Japanese people, concluded the commentary.

MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Three fishermen were killed and
seven others seriously wounded Wednesday afternoon in a southern
Philippine bay when armed men ambushed them while at sea, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.

The report said the victims were doing their usual routine of
fishing at Panguil Bay, Lanao del Norte province in northern
Mindanao, when they were suddenly approached by the ambushers
aboard another vessel.
</P>
<P>
Several fishermen in the area, who heard the automatic gunfire,
rushed ashore and reported the incident to the police.
</P>
<P>
The police said their findings indicated that the ambush might
have been staged by competitor fishermen who want to monopolize
the richness of the Panguil Bay area.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Down by 2 Percent on Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A weaker than expected market
had seen wool auction prices fall by 2 percent on average at sales
in Sydney and Melbourne this week, the Australian Council of Wool
Exporters (ACWE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The Wool Index eastern market indicator dropped by 14
Australian cents (10.3 U.S. cents) to finish at 689 Australian
cents (509 U.S. cents) a kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) northern and southern
regional price indicators closed at 765 and 716 Australian cents
(about 566 and 529 U.S. cents) a kilogram clean, down 13
Australian cents (9.6 U.S. cents) and nine cents (6.6 U.S. cents)
respectively for the week.
</P>
<P>
The AWEX national index fell by nine points to finish at 987
with the northern and southern indices falling by 17 and 12 points
to end the week at 1,003 and 966 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76,029 bales were offered with a pass in rate of
15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With it being a traditionally quiet period for European
interests, it is thought that Chinese customers might by testing
out the underlying strength in the market at the present time,"
ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
It said most downstream processors were expected to be
comfortable with a Wool Index eastern indicator of around 700
Australian cents (518 U.S. cents) a kilogram clean, but ACWE
warned the relatively high price of wool against other fiber was a
continuing cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
More than 64,000 bales have been registered for sale in
Newcastle near Sydney and Fremantle near Perth next week.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hosts World's Largest Number of Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt tops world countries in
terms of land mines on its territories, totaling 23 million,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Egypt is yet reckoned the least of
countries prone to problems emanating from the mines, said the
report quoting the spokesman of the Economic Commission of Africa,
an affiliate to the UN, as saying in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, whose name was not given, said there are nine
countries worldwide most suffering the existence of land mines,
with Egypt coming on top thereof.
</P>
<P>
"Mines in Egypt do not pose any noticeable menace to the
development process neither do they inflict any human damage as is
the case in some other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN official attributed it to the fact that such mines were
planted at a profound depth in unpopulated areas in the desert,
which entirely lessens the possibility of their explosion.
</P>
<P>
The millions of mines in Egypt mostly spread across the Western
Desert and Sinai, important battle fields during the Second World
War and the scenes for several Arab-Israeli wars.
</P>
<P>
But there are sporadic reports about casualties from stepping
on land mines in Egypt.

PANAMA CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Catholic Church of
Panama has demanded 20 Japanese of a religious group be deported
for their illegal preaching.
</P>
<P>
The top hierarchy of the Catholic Church got together with
Panamanian Interior and Justice Minister Raul Montenegro on
Wednesday to examine the activities of the group, the "Moon," in

Panama archbishop Jose Dimas Cedeno said the group is a
religious sect that divides and confounds the Panamanian people.

Montenegro said the expulsion will depend on the law, since the
authorities do not know whether the group members visited Panama
as tourists or businessmen.

<P>
Cedeno said the Church watches closely the activities of the
group and could present a document to the minister.

<HEADLINE> China's Achievements Great, But Difficulty Remains, Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said today that China has made great strides in economic
development since it began to carry out the policy of reforms and
opening-up to the rest of the world at the end of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
But there are still many difficulties which need to be solved
as the country presses ahead in its economic drive, Li said in a
speech at a welcoming meeting here hosted by the Institute of
Diplomatic and Foreign Relations of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In the speech entitled "Toward a Relationship of Friendship and
Good-Neighborliness Geared to the 21st Century," the Chinese
premier briefed his audience on China's economic development and
made a few observations on the further development of amicable
cooperation between China and ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning in the late 1970s, China entered a new historical
period of reform, opening-up and modernization. Over the past 19
years, China has all along kept a good momentum of economic growth
and the quality of people's life has improved noticeably, " Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that breakthroughs have been made in China's economic
restructuring aimed at establishing a socialist market economy and
the pattern of opening-up has basically taken shape.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, as a result of strengthened macro economic
control by the government, we have brought under control inflation
which was once quite serious and ushered in a favorable situation
characterized by high growth rate, low price hikes and smooth and
coordinated growth of the national economy, " the Chinese premier
said.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated development plans for the last five years
of this century and on longer-range objectives to the year 2010,
he said, adding that implementation of these plans in the past two
years has been quite good.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is, through the two switches in economic system
and mode of economic growth, to carry out the strategies of
revitalization through science and technology and of sustainable
development and to unswervingly implement the policy of opening-up
with a view to realizing economic development and all-round social
progress, " Li said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that China will keep its economic growth rate at
over 8 percent in the last five years of this century and over 7
percent in the first ten years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Yet we are quite clear that as we press ahead, there are still
many difficulties, especially given the fact that China has a
large population and weak economic foundation, " the Chinese
premier said.
</P>
<P>
"China is still at a rather low level in per capita terms even
compared with certain developing countries in Asia. We need to
work very hard for several more decades in order to realize
modernization and attain the level of averagely developed
countries," Li said, "We are confident that guided by the theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by
Deng Xiaoping, we are bound to attain the goal of modernization in
China."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees 23.4 Billion Dollars in Outstanding Obligations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand, the central
bank, Thursday announced that Thailand has commitments totaling
23.4 billion U.S. dollars in outstanding currency forward
obligations over the next 12 months, triggering a surprise on the
financial markets, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of these obligations, 14.8 billion dollars was for off-shore
contracts and the remaining was for on-shore activities to boost
the baht, The Nation said.
</P>
<P>
The figures were revealed for the first time Thursday as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a bail-out deal to
support Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed out that the announcement suggests that
Thailand's move in defending the baht in mid-May this year has
significantly run down its foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank said that Thailand's foreign exchange
reserves stood at 32.4 billion dollars at the end of June, but
analysts warned against any attempt to deduct the 23.4 billion
dollars in forward obligations from the June reserves of 32.4
billion dollars, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some of the forward contracts may have already matured as
delivery obligations of those foreign exchange swaps made earlier
by the Thai central bank to defend the baht set at a certain date
in the future, they added.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi said that the
outstanding forward obligations had been taken into account during
consultations with the IMF in preparation of the bail-out package
for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Since the forward obligations will be effective over the next
12 months, it may run down over Thailand's foreign reserves, but
not immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some forward obligations may be rolled over, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat also noted that the 8.6 billion dollars for on-shore
transactions is an instrument of domestic liquidity management and
a part of monetary policy operation.
</P>
<P>
This is normally rolled over and will not seriously affect
Thailand's foreign reserves position, he said.

the decline in the rate of growth of money supply and the
improvement in the growth of domestic supply of food commodities.
</P>
<P>
Major changes were made in the monetary policy during the first
half of this year. A new foreign currency loan scheme through
domestic units of the banks was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments also reflected the improved performance
of the economy. Total exports in Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
terms increased 18 percent in the first six months and total
imports grew 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Stock Exchange activities made gains considerably
this year, reflecting improved investor confidence in the economy
and economic policies of the country.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Outlines Principles on Sino-ASEAN Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng today outlined five principles on strengthening future
cooperation between China and the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign
Relations, Li said, "We are ready to join ASEAN countries to work
unremittingly for good-neighborly and friendly relations geared to
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
To this end, Li proposed the following five principles:
</P>
<P>
-- Respecting each other and treating each other as equals.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has always maintained that each and every country
in the world has the right to choose its own political structure
or development path in light of its national conditions and that
Other countries are not allowed to interfere in whatever way.
</P>
<P>
He said, "In our view, all countries, big or small, strong or
weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international
community and are entitled to participate in regional and
international affairs on an equal footing. Such rights should be
fully respected."
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening dialogue and intensifying consultation.
</P>
<P>
The full dialogue partership established between China and
ASEAN represents an important channel for us to have closer
dialogue and consultation, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
"We should further increase exchanges between leaders as well
as between people of various circles for broad exchanges of views
on issues of common concern with a view to increasing mutual
understanding and broadening consensus, " Li said.
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking common development based on mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "As the economic factor rises in importance in
international relations, economic cooperation has become a major
underpin for the development of state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN countries have their respective strong
points. These advantages in such fields as natural resources,
technological know-how, capital and market can be brought to
complement one another, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for our economic cooperation is indeed enormous,
areas broad and prospects highly promising. We can very well draw
on each other's rich experience in economic development to make up
for our own deficiencies in the interest of achieving common
development, " he added.
</P>
<P>
-- Supporting each other and expanding cooperation. "We should
step up our mutual assistance and coordination at the UN, APEC,
ASEM and ARF in order to safeguard the shared rights and interests
of the developing countries, " Li said.
</P>
<P>
-- Bearing in mind the larger picture, seeking common ground
while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
"While we share broad common interests in the development of
state-to-state relations, it is hardly avoidable that certain
disputes or differences will come up, " Li said, " Efforts should
be made to seek a gradual solution to the problems with a
forward-looking approach through friendly consultations on an
equal footing."
</P>
<P>
"As for differences and disputes that can not be resolved for
the time being, they can be approached in the spirit of seeking
common ground while shelving differences instead of being allowed
to hinder the development of normal relations, " he said.
</P>
<P>
China has noted with pleasure that ASEAN, as an important
regional organization, is playing an increasingly important role
in maintaining regional peace and promoting economic development,
the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
"China stands ready to continue its productive cooperation with
ASEAN countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Gives Speech in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng today delivered a speech at a welcoming meeting hosted by the
Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign Relations of Malaysia,
elaborating on China's stand on the good-neighborly relations
oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the speech entitled "Toward a
Relationship of Friendship and Good-Neighborliness Geared to the
21st Century."
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir, I
have come to this country for an official good-will visit. It
gives me great pleasure today to have the opportunity to meet with
all of you here and deliver a speech at the welcoming meeting
hosted by the famous Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign
Relations. I would also like to take this opportunity to express
my heartfelt thanks and cordial greetings to the host, the
Hon. Dato's Abdullah bin Ahmad Badawi, Minister of Foreign Affairs
and all the guests present.
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to brief you on China's economic development
and also make a few observations on the further development of
amicable cooperation between China and ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the late 1970s, China entered a new historical
period of reform, opening-up and modernization. Over the past 19
years, China has all along kept a good momentum of economic growth
and the quality of people's life has improved
noticeably. Breakthroughs have been made in our economic
restructuring aimed at establishing a socialist market economy and
the pattern of opening-up has basically taken shape. In recent
years, as a result of strengthened macro economic control by the
government, we have brought under control inflation which was once
quite serious and ushered in a favorable situation characterized
by high growth rate, low price hikes and smooth and coordinated
growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
We in China have formulated development plans for the last five
years of this century and on longer-range objectives to the year
2010. Implementation of these plans in the past two years has been
quite good. Our objective is, through the two switches in economic
system and mode of economic growth, to carry out the strategies of
revitalization through science and technology and of sustainable
development and to unswervingly implement the policy of opening-up
with a view to realizing economic development and all-round social
progress. China will keep its economic growth rate at over 8
percent in the last five years of this century and over 7 percent
in the first ten years of the next century. The aggregate national
strength will be further enhanced and people's living standards
improved more substantially. Compared with the past, our progress
has been tremendous. Yet we are quite clear that as we press
ahead, there are still many difficulties, especially given the
fact that China has a large population and weak economic
foundation. China is still at a rather low level in per capita
terms even compared with certain developing countries in Asia. We
need to work very hard for several more decades in order to
realize modernization and attain the level of averagely developed
countries. We are confident that guided by the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping,
we are bound to attain the goal of modernization in China.
</P>
<P>
China and Southeast Asian nations had similar past of prolonged
foreign aggression, and they are now both faced with a common task
of developing the national economy. Moreover, they share the need
for securing regional and international peace. We are ready to
join ASEAN countries to work unremittingly for good-neighborly and
friendly relations geared to the 21st century. To this end, we
would like to propose the following:
</P>
<P>

21st Century."
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir, I
have come to this country for an official good-will visit. It
gives me great pleasure today to have the opportunity to meet with
all of you here and deliver a speech at the welcoming meeting
hosted by the famous Institute of Diplomatic and Foreign
Relations. I would also like to take this opportunity to express
my heartfelt thanks and cordial greetings to the host, the
Hon. Dato's Abdullah bin Ahmad Badawi, Minister of Foreign Affairs
and all the guests present.
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to brief you on China's economic development
and also make a few observations on the further development of
amicable cooperation between China and ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the late 1970s, China entered a new historical
period of reform, opening-up and modernization. Over the past 19
years, China has all along kept a good momentum of economic growth
and the quality of people's life has improved
noticeably. Breakthroughs have been made in our economic
restructuring aimed at establishing a socialist market economy and
the pattern of opening-up has basically taken shape. In recent
years, as a result of strengthened macro economic control by the
government, we have brought under control inflation which was once
quite serious and ushered in a favorable situation characterized
by high growth rate, low price hikes and smooth and coordinated
growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
We in China have formulated development plans for the last five
years of this century and on longer-range objectives to the year
2010. Implementation of these plans in the past two years has been
quite good. Our objective is, through the two switches in economic
system and mode of economic growth, to carry out the strategies of
revitalization through science and technology and of sustainable
development and to unswervingly implement the policy of opening-up
with a view to realizing economic development and all-round social
progress. China will keep its economic growth rate at over 8
percent in the last five years of this century and over 7 percent
in the first ten years of the next century. The aggregate national
strength will be further enhanced and people's living standards
improved more substantially. Compared with the past, our progress
has been tremendous. Yet we are quite clear that as we press
ahead, there are still many difficulties, especially given the
fact that China has a large population and weak economic
foundation. China is still at a rather low level in per capita
terms even compared with certain developing countries in Asia. We
need to work very hard for several more decades in order to
realize modernization and attain the level of averagely developed
countries. We are confident that guided by the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping,
we are bound to attain the goal of modernization in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Gives Speech in Malaysia (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China and Southeast Asian nations had similar past of prolonged
foreign aggression, and they are now both faced with a common task
of developing the national economy. Moreover, they share the need
for securing regional and international peace. We are ready to
join ASEAN countries to work unremittingly for good-neighborly and
friendly relations geared to the 21st century. To this end, we
would like to propose the following:
</P>
<P>
-- Respecting each other and treating each other as equals. We
have always maintained that each and every country in the world
has the right to choose its own political structure or development
path in light of its national conditions. Other countries are not
allowed to interfere in whatever way. In our view, all countries,
big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of
the international community and are entitled to participate in
regional and international affairs on an equal footing. Such
rights should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening dialogue and intensifying consultation. The
full dialogue partership established between China and ASEAN
represents an important channel for us to have closer dialogue and
consultation. We should further increase exchanges between leaders
as well as between people of various circles for broad exchanges
of views on issues of common concern with a view to increasing
mutual understanding and broadening consensus.
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking common development based on mutual benefit. As the
economic factor rises in importance in international relations,
economic cooperation has become a major underpin for the
development of state-to-state relations. China and ASEAN countries
have their respective strong points. These advantages in such
fields as natural resources, technological know-how, capital and
market can be brought to complement one another. The potential for
our economic cooperation is indeed enormous, areas broad and
prospects highly promising. We can very well draw on each other's
rich experience in economic development to make up for our own
deficiencies in the interest of achieving common development.
</P>
<P>
-- Supporting each other and expanding cooperation. We should
step up our mutual assistance and coordination at the UN, APEC,
ASEM and ARF in order to safeguard the shared rights and interests
of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Bearing in mind the larger picture, seeking common ground
while putting aside differences. While we share broad common
interests in the development of state-to-state relations, it is
hardly avoidable that certain disputes or differences will come
up. Efforts should be made to seek a gradual solution to the
problems with a forward-looking approach through friendly
consultations on an equal footing. As for differences and disputes
that can not be resolved for the time being, they can be
approached in the spirit of seeking common ground while shelving
differences instead of being allowed to hinder the development of
normal relations.
</P>
<P>
In the 50s and 60s, the historical trend towards national
independence and liberation was irreversible. Today, the trend
towards multi-polarization is accelerating and it has again become
an irreversible historical trend to strive for world peace,
national development and social progress. We have noted with
pleasure that ASEAN, as an important regional organization, is
playing an increasingly important role in maintaining regional
peace and promoting economic development. China stands ready to
continue its productive cooperation with ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this year, the leaders of East Asian countries
will have an informal summit in Kuala Lumpur. President Jiang
Zemin of China will, upon invitation, participate in this
distinguished gathering, which will be a major event in the
history of China-ASEAN relations. Let us join hands in a concerted
effort to promote the establishment of a fair and just new
international political and economic order characterized by peace
and stability.

<HEADLINE> AL Holds Israel Responsible for Violence Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) General
Secretariat today lashed out at the Israeli decisions and coercive
measures regarding the Mideast peace process, saying they violate
the international laws.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Cairo-based AL blamed the escalation of tensions
and outbreak of violence in the Mideast on Israel, whose policies
have breached "the Geneva Human Rights Convention and the
principles and accords which constitute the ground of the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"These measures are aimed to starve them (the Palestinians) out
and undermine their power of resistance," said a communique issued
by the AL Secretariat here today, referring to Israel's three-week
economic sanctions and overall closure in the Palestinian areas
since the July 30 Jerusalem bombings.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 28th anniversary of the arson at Al Aqsa Mosque,
the communique said that the memory coincides with the Israeli
indiscriminate collective punishment and siege on the Palestinians
and their national authority.
</P>
<P>
On August 21, 1969, a group of Jewish extremists set fire to
the Islamic holy shrine Al Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, arousing
Palestinian areas since the July 30 Jerusalem bombings.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate end of the Arab nations is to establish just and
comprehensive peace that is based on restoring their legitimate
rights," the Arab League added.

<HEADLINE> Death for Viet Drug Trafficker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hanoi People's Court today
handed down a death sentence to a drug trafficker after a two-day
trial.
</P>
<P>
Le Van Minh, 28, was arrested by the police for trafficking
1.24 kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Under Vietnam's present penal code, anyone convicted of selling
or trafficking more than 100 grams of heroin or cocaine can
receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The court also gave a life imprisonment sentence to a 20
year-old woman, who confessed that she and her husband, who has
fled, were involved in drug trafficking. According to the court,
the couple had smuggled 1.05 kilogram of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Hoang Van Hien, 28, another member of the ring, was convicted
of trafficking 190 grams of heroin and received a 14-year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi People's Court in May this year handed down death
sentences to eight people involved in Vietnam's biggest yet drug
trafficking ring, which was said to have brought several hundred
kilograms of heroin in Vietnam since 1992.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Rules out All-out Lebanese-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon
said here today that all-out fighting between Lebanon and Israel
will not take place, and what happens now is just tit-for-tat
attacks between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri,
Ambassador Richard Jones told reporters that he does not believe
the both sides are seeking to escalate the tension, Lebanese
Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. could guarantee that Israel will not strike
Lebanese vital installations, Jones said he is not in the position
to make any promises.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the efforts made by the U.S. before are
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the role of the five-nation cease-fire monitoring
committee, brokered by the U.S. after Israel's 16-day blitz of
Lebanon in April last year, Jones said that the establishment of
the committee is for reducing the escalation of fighting, not
controlling the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee has made contributions on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee made up of Lebanese, Israeli, Syrian,
US and French officials is holding a meeting in the Lebanese
southern town of Naquar, near the Israeli border, to discuss
complaints by Lebanon and Israel of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes Wednesday raided at least three areas in
Lebanon in a bid to warn the Lebanese government to curb
Hezbollah's military activity against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raid was apparently a reaction to the Katyusha
rockets fired by Hezbollah Tuesday at northern Israeli panhandle
of Galilee, causing two injuries and some damage.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah's attack was a response to the shelling Monday by
the South Lebanese Army, Israeli militia ally, on Lebanese port
city of Saida which killed nine people and wounded 43
people.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denounces PNA Dialogue with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel today strongly
denounced the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for conducting
dialogue with militant opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, PNA President Yasser Arafat
hosted the second session of the "national unity conference" with
senior leaders from Palestinian opposition groups led by the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held by the PNA in an attempt to mobilize
all forces to fight Israeli siege and sanctions against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This was a follow-up to the first meeting held in Gaza
Wednesday, during which Arafat not only hugged and embraced
Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders, but also called on all
Palestinians to close their ranks to fight the "humiliating
policy" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Danny Naveh, Israel's Cabinet secretary, warned that it was a
big mistake for Arafat to appease the militant groups. "It makes
a very, very big question mark about the future of the peace
process, and about whether the PNA is a partner for peace or
not," he said in an interview with the state television.
</P>
<P>
"And we expected the PNA not to have such dialogue with those
organizations, but to do whatever it can in order to fight these
organizations in order to prevent further violence and
terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials expressed the worry that the PNA's
dialogue with Hamas and other opposition groups could be Arafat's
tactic approval for more terror attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, David Bar-Illan, media adviser to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Arafat
should launch an all-out war against terrorism instead of
appeasing the militant groups.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 suicide bombings in Jerusalem that
killed 16 people, Israel imposed a total closure on the
Palestinian territories, barring Palestinian workers from working
in Israel and halted transferring millions of dollars in tax
revenues to the PNA. The sanctions have inflicted economic
hardships on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Blasting Israel for humiliating the Palestinian people through
these sanctions, Arafat warned that "all options are open... We
can erase everything and start anew."
</P>
<P>
Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi interpreted the meeting as a
call for "resistance of every kind" to confront Israeli
occupation. "We must leave the Oslo plan, which Israel uses as a
weapon to fight us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi thanked Arafat for not bowing to the Unite States and
Israel to crack down toughly on Hamas activities. He also
reiterated the demand for the PNA to relase jailed Hamas
activists, for the return of all Palestinians and confrontation
with Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the U.S. government also lashed out at the PNA
for having dialogue with the militant groups. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said that Arafat had promised to fight
terrorism, and the U.S. would judge him by his deeds.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguans in Costa Rica Send Money Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguans in Costa Rica send
home about 200 million U.S. dollars a year, the National Bank of
Costa Rica said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure exceeds the annual trade between the two countries
by 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such a large amount of remittances may affect the country's
economy, according to the Costa Rican Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
There are 300,000 to 600,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica,
accounting for 10 to 20 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Most of those people come to Costa Rica illegally to seek jobs,
as 75 percent of the Nicaraguan population live in poverty and 20
percent of the workforce are out of job.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today categorically rejected U.N. Security Council term
president's accusation that Turkish Cypriots impede the Cyprus
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the remarks following Wednesday's statement by
the council President Jone Weston from Britain criticizing Turkish
Cypriots for the failure of the talks held last Friday in
Switzerland, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception in Nicosia, the Turkish Cypriot leader
said that he did not think that Diego Cordovez,
U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative to Cyprus, will
agree with such a statement.
</P>
<P>
Weston had reportedly said in his speech that Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides showed flexibility during the negotiations but
the Turkish Cypriot side impeded the substantive process "by
bringing preconditions to the table."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government and the U.N. blamed the Turkish Cypriot
side for blocking the talks by insisting on European Union's drop
of its planned accession talks with Cyprus as a precondition to
the Cyprus negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also accused the British representative to the U.N. of
openly shielding Clerides, saying that Weston seemed to be the
mouthpiece of the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Turkish Cypriots will not allow anyone to
control the peace process on the divided island, Denktash said,"
we will not be submissive towards injustice."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will submit his views concerning this issue to
Cordovez, adding that it is better not to go to any negotiating
tables if the Turkish Cypriots are always unjustly accused of
undermining the protracted peace process.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources also expressed their dissatisfaction
with the British representative's remarks against the Turkish
Cypriots, saying that they did not understand why Weston made such
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The talks in the Swiss town of Glion-sur-Montreux was a
continuation of the first round of peace talks between Denktash
and Clerides held from July 9 to 12, at Troutbeck, near New York
under the auspices of the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
small Mediterranean island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island state which was divided into Greek
and Turkish communities, but so far no concrete results have
been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Complete Tax Reforms by End of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will complete its tax
reforms by the end of 1997, Ukrainian Minister of Economy Viktor
Suslov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Suslov told a press conference that Feder Yaroshenko, acting
chairman of the State Tax Administration, has presented a package
of 19 draft tax reform laws, which aim to boost the country's
budget revenues by broadening the base for taxation.
</P>
<P>
"All these laws will be approved by the parliament by the end
of 1997, although some of the laws will be introduced next year,"
Suslov said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Sergi Tigipko said that the cabinet has
selected some of the 19 draft laws to form the basis of the 1998
draft budget plan.
</P>
<P>
Among them are the draft amendment to the Law on Taxation of
Enterprise Profits, the draft amendments to the Law on Value-Added
Tax, and the draft amendments to the Ukrainian Law on Excise
Duties.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's present tax laws impose heavy burden on legal
businessman while leaving considerable loopholes for illegal ones
to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko also urged the
government to exercise strict control over tax collection.
</P>
<P>
"The high tax burden shouldered by manufacturers remains a
difficult problem," said the prime minister at a cabinet meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
According to Pustovoitenko, this year's tax revenues had
increased to about 14 billion hryvnas (7.7 billion U.S. dollars)
by August 14, 14 million hryvnas (7.7 million U.S. dollars) more
than the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped the new package of tax reforms will recover 2.4
billion hryvnas (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) more from the country's
shadow economy.

<HEADLINE> Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant Well under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Ling'ao
Nuclear Power Plant in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province,
is proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Wenxing, general manager of the Ling'ao Nuclear Power
Co. Ltd., reported that earthwork is progressing on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said the successful experiences and sophisticated
management expertise gained from the neighboring Daya Bay Nuclear
Power Station have ensured smooth and fast construction at
Ling'ao.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, overall preparations for construction of the
nuclear plant is scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ling'ao is located 1.2 km from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Station which is now in full-scale operation. Construction of the
Ling'ao plant, a major project scheduled for completion during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000), began at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Power Industry, Guangdong Province and the
China National Nuclear Power Industrial Corp. are jointly funding
the project.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the installation of four nuclear power
generating units with a generating capacity of one million kw
each. Two units will be installed during the first phase of

<P>
FUZHOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two regularly scheduled air
flights from Guangdong Province to scenic Wuyi Mountains will be
added later this month to cope with the increasing air passenger
volume.
</P>
<P>
Existing flights from major cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing,
Shanghai, Xiamen and Shantou fall short of demand as increasing
numbers of tourists flock to Wuyi Mountains. For example, no
ticket are available through the end of August for Guangzhou-Wuyi
flights.
</P>
<P>
Monday and Thursday flights will be added to the Guangzhou-Wuyi
route to supplement the current Wednesday and Sunday flights.
</P>
<P>
Wuyi Mountains are located in the northern section of coastal
Fujian Province in east China. Wuyi, well-known as the "first
mountain in Fujian", is the mainstay of the province's tourism
industry. Well over one million tourists visit Wuyi's each year to
enjoy its beautiful peaks, pools, and health resorts.

<HEADLINE> Western Scholars Point to Flourishing Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Western scholars attending
the ongoing '97 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies refuted various
Western arguments that the Chinese government has destroyed
Tibet's traditional culture by presenting evidence clearly showing
that Tibetan traditional culture is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
Professor Colin Mackerras, a Tibetologist who serves as the
president of Griffith University and director of the Modern Asian
Studies School in Australia, commented that "Tibetan culture is
stronger than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely believe that the Chinese government is extending
every possible effort to preserve Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet's traditions are unlikely to die out in the foreseeable
future."
</P>
<P>
Mackerras added that Tibetan traditions are stronger in the
1990s and are, in fact, stronger than virtually any other
traditional culture in China.
</P>
<P>
The professor has visited the Tibet Autonomous Region and
Tibetan communities in neighboring provinces twice.
</P>
<P>
He voiced total disagreement with those who advocate the need
to split Tibet from China to maintain the region's distinctive
traditions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be economically unsound and dangerous to split Tibet
from China," said Mackerras.
</P>
<P>
Richard Strassberg, a professor of Eastern cultures, said
that Tibetan culture, especially the theatrical arts, has many
links with Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"Certain widespread forms of storytelling like Tibetan
`Lama-mani' and Tang Dynasty 'Bianwen' share particular
similarities," according to Strassberg, a professor in the Chinese
Department of East Asian Languages at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, various drama performances with Buddhist themes
spread from Tibet to other parts of China along with the spread of
Tibetan Buddhism, said Strassberg.
</P>
<P>
The two professors, both of whom have studied the Eastern
Cultures for many years, are special guests at the seminar
attended by more than 130 Tibetologists from around the world.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Businessmen Optimistic Over Congolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- There is massive business
potential in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which the
Tanzanian business community can make use of.
</P>
<P>
David Mwaibula, President of the Tanzanian Chamber of
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA, made the remarks in
an interview with the local daily Guardian which is published
today.
</P>
<P>
Mwaibula said that restoration of peace in the new Congo has
unveiled enormous business opportunities for Tanzanian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The TCCIA president had accompanied Tanzania's former
President J. Nyerere during the latter's recent visit to the
Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Mwaibula met Congolese President L. Kabila
and discussed economic cooperation between the two countries and
the involvement of Tanzanian business communities in rebuilding
the economy of the former Zaire through trade, commerce and
investments.
</P>
<P>
Kabila reiterated the need for Tanzanian business community to
trade with his country and instructed Congolese business leaders
to visit their counterparts in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The TCCIA president believed it is high time Tanzanians take
advantage of Democratic Congo which has no proper financial
infrastructure and now is in the verge of rebuilding its ruined
economy.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanians can make a massive trade with the Congolese in
agricultural, livestock and industrial products and even by
investment in agriculture, communications and transport, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have already taken a leading role in
conducting business with the Congo, Mwaibula said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Stress National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
underscored national unity at a critical juncture of the
Israeli-Palestinian relations, JMCC, an East Jerusalem-based
Palestinian press service reported.
</P>
<P>
"National unity is what characterizes the current stage" of
the Israeli-Palestinian relations," Speaker of the Palestinian
National Council Salim Zanoun said at the second-day session
of the national unity dialogue held between the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and opposition groups, including Hamas
and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian national unity dialogue, which was initiated
by PNA President Yasser Arafat a few years ago, was resumed in
Gaza Wednesday and continued in the West Bank city of Ramallah
today.
</P>
<P>
Critic of the Israeli and U.S. negative reactions to the
meeting, Zanoun stated that the Palestinians refuse to obey
instructions from the outside and totally reject Israeli
dictations.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue has angered the Israeli government that has
turned the screws at the PNA since the suicide bombing attack on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rdeineh, advisor to Arafat, said that it was most
important for all to take a unified stand under one command to
deal with Israeli pressure.
</P>
<P>
Hani Hassan, a senior Fatah official, called on all Islamic
and national forces and the PNA to forge a national unity. He
asked for a regular monthly meeting to be chaired by Arafat to
enhance constant coordination to face challenges.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker of the Palestinian Council Mitri Abu Eitan
said that the Israeli-imposed total closure "is now confronted
by the Palestinian national unity, a guarantee for dwarfing
occupation schemes."
</P>
<P>
Bashir Al-Barghouti, a senior official of the Palestinian
People's Party, called for a confrontation against the Netanyahu
government's attempts to destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Rahim Malouh, a representative of the Popular Front for
Liberation of Palestine, accused Israel of pursuing a policy
designed to starve the Palestinian people and of forcing the PNA
to accept facts it created on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to confront Israel's policy of land
confiscation and Judizing the occupied East Jerusalem, and to
back up the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Today's session was interrupted for 10 minutes when
participants led by Arafat left the meeting hall to meet with
Palestinian medical workers, who gathered in front of the
headquarters of the PLO to express their support for Arafat's
call for national unity.

<HEADLINE> Molecular "Radar" Invented in Israel to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A molecular "radar" has been
created by Israeli scientists at the Weizman Institute of Science
to track signaling enzymes inside a cell, according to the latest
issue of Science to be published here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was obtained by a research team led by
Professor Ben-Zion Shilo, head of the institute's Molecular
Genetics Department.
</P>
<P>
Using this "radar," Shilo and his colleagues mapped the exact
progress of an intercellular messenger that plays a key role in
embryonic development.
</P>
<P>
The invention is expected to prove valuable in gaining a
better understanding of how signals are transferred inside a cell
and how the signaling process goes awry in diseases, such as
cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Our new method gives us the ability equivalent to that of an
traffic controller who looks at the dots on the radar screen and
can thus follow the movements of each plane step by step," he said.
</P>
<P>
The starting point for the study was the knowledge that many
messages inside cells are passed on by means of phosphate
atoms. When a molecular messenger, such as a hormone, attaches
itself to a receptor on the cell membrane, it sets off a chain
reaction inside the cell. In its course, one molecular activates
the next, and so on, through the addition of phosphate atoms, a
process known as phosphorylation.
</P>
<P>
To track the activated, phosphate-containing molecules, the
team developed antibodies that react only with molecules
phosphorylated in a particular fashion. Since these antibodies can
easily be traced, the system allowed the scientists to actually
observe phosphorylation - hence, the pathway of signal
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Shilon and his team worked with Drosophila fruit flies. These
insects are commonly used in scientific research because they
share many genetic and molecular characteristics with higher
animals. The flies develop rapidly and are easy to study.
</P>
<P>
Their study focused on a hormone-like messenger called
epidermal growth factor (EGF), which becomes active during
embryonic development and ensures the formation of a proper body
pattern.
</P>
<P>
Using the new method, they followed the signal transmitted by
EGF from the point at which EGF attaches to its receptor on the
cell membrane up to the time it delivers the message to the genes
in the cell nucleus. They were able to see precisely when and
where the signal is passed on within individual cells, and also to
observe which cells within the embryo are affected by EGF at
different stages of embryonic development.
</P>
<P>
The new molecular "radar" is also a valuable tool for studying
phosphorylation patterns set off by other receptors, and for
investigating phosphorylation in other organisms, including
humans. It can shed light on both normal development and abnormal
tissue growth, such as in cancer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Rules out All-out Lebanese-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon
said here today that all-out fighting between Lebanon and Israel
will not take place, and what happens now is just tit-for-tat
attacks between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri,
Ambassador Richard Jones told reporters that he does not believe
the both sides are seeking to escalate the tension, Lebanese
Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. could guarantee that Israel will not strike
Lebanese vital installations, Jones said he is not in the position
to make any promises.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the efforts made by the U.S. before are
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the role of the five-nation cease-fire monitoring
committee, brokered by the U.S. after Israel's 16-day blitz of
Lebanon in April last year, Jones said that the establishment of
the committee is for reducing the escalation of fighting, not
controlling the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee has made contributions on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee made up of Lebanese, Israeli, Syrian,
US and French officials is holding a meeting in the Lebanese
southern town of Naquar, near the Israeli border, to discuss
complaints by Lebanon and Israel of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes Wednesday raided at least three areas in
Lebanon in a bid to warn the Lebanese government to curb
Hezbollah's military activity against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raid was apparently a reaction to the Katyusha
rockets fired by Hezbollah Tuesday at northern Israeli panhandle
of Galilee, causing two injuries and some damage.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah's attack was a response to the shelling Monday by
the South Lebanese Army, Israeli militia ally, on Lebanese port
city of Saida which killed nine people and wounded 43
people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Generate, Distribute Power for Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian electric power
company has reached agreement with a Myanmar state-run counterpart
to form a joint venture for generating and distributing electric
power in southern Myanmar, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is Myanmar's first joint venture agreement with foreign
firms in power generation and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Thursday between Genting Power
Holding Ltd. of Malaysia and Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Before the joint venture was initiated, Myanmar had been
cooperating with foreign firms in getting technical know-how and
equipment for building power stations and power distribution in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In May, three South Korean firms -- Daewoo, LG International
and Hyundai -- agreed to render assistance in the development of
Myanmar's electric power distribution under the Economic
Development Corporation Fund.
</P>
<P>
At present, Japan's Kajima Corporation is undertaking a
280-megawatt Paunglaung hydropower project under a contract
reached in May last year.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign firms which have signed memorandums of
understanding with Myanmar are also undertaking feasibility
studies on building hydropower stations in the country. They
include Daewoo (South Korea), Hunan (China), oil group UNOCAL (the
United States), TOTAL (France), Mitsui (Japan), and developer
groups Marubeni (Japan), MDX (Thailand) and Italian-Thai
Development Public Co.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has built three hydropower stations and three
natural-gas power stations since 1988, which generated 4.256
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in fiscal 1996-97, 200
million kilowatt-hours more than the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The country also extended power transmission and distribution
lines to 21,054 kilometers in the fiscal year, bringing
electricity to 320 towns and 1,087 villages, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Malaysian investment in Myanmar
ranks fifth after Britain, Singapore, Thailand and the United
States. By the end of July this year, Malaysia had invested a
total of 524.17 million U.S. dollars in 23 permitted projects in
real estate, hotel and tourism, wood-based industry, manufacturing
and oil and gas.

nationhood and sovereignty," Kuchma noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ukraine has become a fully-fledged and influential
member of the international community and its independence is
recognized by the world.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine gained the Council of Europe membership in 1995 and
established strategic partnerships with countries including the
United States, Canada and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has signed broad-based agreements with its neighbors
including Russia, Belarus, Poland and Romania, enabling it to
resolve old feuds and pave the way for bilateral cooperation,
Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ukrainian president, in particular, accused the
European Union and the United States of conducting discriminatory
trade and economic policies against Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He complained that access of Ukrainian goods to the European
and world markets was hindered by various restrictions,
antidumping policies and other protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
High-quality and competitive Ukrainian metallurgical products
were squeezed out of the American market by excessive antidumping
duties, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Ukrainian diaspora in the West to assist in
resolving this problem.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Current Account Deficit Up 15 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's trade in the
1996/1997 fiscal year suffered a higher current account deficit
but analysts say it is still at a safe level.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Indonesian Observer reported today that the
higher current account deficit for the period ending April this
year was mainly attributable to decelerating exports of
non-oil/gas commodities.
</P>
<P>
The deficit went up 15 percent from 7 billion U.S. dollars in
1995/96 or 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 8.1
billion dollars in 1996/97 or 3.5 percent of GDP, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996/97 fiscal year, exports rose 4.9 percent to 52
billion dollars from 47.8 billion in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate was lower compared with the last fiscal year
when it reached 13.3 percent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of non-oil/gas exports declined from 17.1
percent to 5.7 percent, while oil/gas exports rose to 15 percent
from 3.4 percent, it said, adding that non-oil/gas exports made up
a 75.5 percent share of total exports in the 1996/97 fiscal year,
compared with 77.8 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the growth of imports declined from 21.6 percent to
10.4 percent due to slower growth of non-oil imports. Indonesia's
non-oil/gas imports grew 9.4 percent in the last fiscal year,
compared with 23.4 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has become more aggressive in
boosting exports and discouraging imports to reign in the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the government announced deregulatory
measures covering the reduction of tariffs for goods imported for
"export-oriented" investments and the simplification of investment
procedures by reducing the number of taxes to a minimal level.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans to Resurrect 58 Finance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will accelerate plans
to resurrect 58 finance companies that were suspended from trading
because of their spiraling debts, today's press reports quoted the
Bank of Thailand as saying.
</P>
<P>
The financial authorities have suspended from business 58 of
the 91 firms in the finance and securities sector after lending
450 billion baht (about 13.5 billion U.S. dollars) to firms buried
under bad debt, mostly failed property developers.
</P>
<P>
These firms have been ordered to come up with rehabilitation
plans or be stripped of their viable assets.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
that government credit and deposit guarantees for finance
companies would cost another 1.5 billion U.S. dollars this year,
local press reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Bosnian Muslim refugees
were injured Wednesday after touching off a mine in Jajce, which
created panic among other refugees who were returning to their
homes, the Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia reported.
</P>
<P>
Kris Janovski, spokesman for the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that the two
Muslims were wounded in the blast in the outskirts of Jajce.
</P>
<P>
Many refugees fled to refugee camps in panic.
</P>
<P>
Janovski rejected what Croat leaders in Jajce claimed the mines
were buried in the area in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mines were laid after Muslim and Croat leaders
reached an agreement on repatriating Muslim refugees in Jajce last
week.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Economic Progress in China Is Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- He tells stories of China's
past and present, shedding lights on historical changes in the
world's most populous country; and he works hard to make
Americans understand better the economic progress, the uphill
fight for more prosperity and business opportunities in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Kapp, a specialist on modern China, used to teach in
universities before he came to lead the Washington Council on
International Trade in the Washington State.
</P>
<P>
He became president of the U.S.-China Business Council in April
1994, and that has made him more popular and consulted with on
China.
</P>
<P>
"I think all Americans understand that since 1978, particularly
under the policy initiated by (the late Chinese leader) Deng
Xiaoping, China has made extraordinarily great economic progress,"
Robert said in his downtown office.
</P>
<P>
"We look with great admiration at the nation of more than one
billion people enjoy year after year 10 percent economic growth,"
he noted after citing the corruptive empires and the devastating
impact of foreign invasions in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
He even spoke in Chinese of China's current policy of "economic
reform and opening to the outside world." He told us he had
studied a recent speech by Chinese President Jiang Zemin six times
to try to understand it better.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the economy itself, we recognize the great achievements
China has managed to accomplish in raising a hundred or more
million people from absolute poverty...rapid modernization of
urban life," said Robert, who is now representing some 300
American companies trading with China.
</P>
<P>
He believed that China is of great interest to a lot of
Americans, while many other countries are not. "Whether it is good
or bad, history will tell," he said, referring to the ongoing
debate on China in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The business leader has shown up in four congressional hearings
to defend China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status. When
accused of "lobbying for China" by some, he rebutted the charges,
saying it is also in the interest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
As an advocate of better overall ties with China, Robert calls
for solutions to the difficulties China faces.
</P>
<P>
The problems, which he said might be caused by rapid economic
growth, include the widening gap in people's incomes, the
disparity between the coastal and the interior areas, the
unsatisfactory performance of the state-owned enterprises and some
social problems.
</P>
<P>
China has done a good job in international monetary
institutions, but in the field of trade, the pace is relatively
slow, he remarked to us.
</P>
<P>
He said China will undoubtedly carry on its economic reform and
enjoy sustained development in the next century. And it is
extremely important for China to further integrate itself with the
outside world, he added.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Tax Revenue Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China scored a 42.5 percent
increase in personal income tax revenues in the first half of this
year, according to a national tax conference.
</P>
<P>
The personal income tax revenue in the January-June period came
to 12.34 billion yuan (about 1.48 billion US dollars), Li Yonggui,
chief economist of the State Administration of Taxation, told a
national tax conference held recently in Huangshan City, Anhui

</P>
<P>
China's personal income tax revenue has been growing markedly
each year since a revised personal income tax law was implemented
in 1994. The growth rate for the 1994-1996 period was 60.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year China expects to collect 24 billion yuan in personal
income tax, up 24 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taxation agencies at all levels should beef up their efforts to
collect personal income taxes, Li said, adding that cases of tax
evasion must be investigated and tax evaders punished.

<HEADLINE> High-tech Gains Fruitful Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A little more than two years
after China began six key State projects in the hi-tech industry,
the results are remarkable, officials and experts said.
</P>
<P>
The six projects were launched in late 1994 by the State
Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), the Ministry of Radio,
Film and Television, the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry
of the Machine-building Industry, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
They include the application of high performance computers;
development of a digital audio broadcasting (DAB) system;
high-definition television (HDTV); electronic motor vehicle
development; comfortable housing construction in urban and rural
areas for the year 2000; and a pilot project to make
industrialized agriculture highly efficient.
</P>
<P>
The above ministries have implemented 77 programs for these
projects. And 47 (61 percent) of the 77 programs have been in full
swing with regional governmental departments, Li Maoming, deputy
secretary-general of the SSTC, said at a press conference
yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The six projects are expected to become new pillar industries
by 2000 and help develop new hi-tech products, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction approved 69 pilot zones in cities
and towns nationwide in early 1995, focusing on building better
housing as well as improved tele-communications, environmental
protection, drinking water and garbage treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 12 of the 69 pilot zones have completed such housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television has set up a trial
DAB station in Guangdong covering the Pearl River Delta area and
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
An official from the SSTC revealed that the State will test the
operation of HDTV digital prototype in July next year.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Release 17 Political Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The National
Liberation Army (ELN) of Colombia released 17 political leaders
today in San Pablo town in the department of Bolivar, the military
sources announced.
</P>
<P>
The released politicians, who were seized by the guerrillas
last Friday, including four candidates for the mayorship and four
council members, were handed over to an humanitarian commission
made up of members of the Red Cross International Committee and
the People's Defenders.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the military forces, General Manuel Jose
Bonett, said that today's case, the same as the 30 others who had
been prisoners of the ELN, was not a kidnapping, but rather an
appointment with the guerrillas they were forced to comply with.
</P>
<P>
The ELN and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
announced in April that they would sabotage the October
election. They have called about 50 mayors, councilmen and
candidates in the departments of Antioquia and Bolivar "to settle
accounts" since June.
</P>
<P>
The 17 political leaders were "invited" by the insurgents to
accompany them to the mountain or to the jungle. The politicians
said the "appointments" were mandatory, though they made no death
threats if they were not obeyed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah, Stock Market Continue to Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah surged
Thursday by another 100 points against the U.S. dollar and stock
prices rose 1.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,780/2,810, strengthened and
broke the resistance level of 2,700 to reach 2,650 in morning
trading and closed at 2,670/2,690, according to dealers here
today.
</P>
<P>
They said the current tight monetary policy had forced local
players to sell their dollar to meet their rupiah obligations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange ended
higher Thursday as the strengthening of the rupiah boosted
sentiment, stock brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Composite Index again broke the 600 level, jumping
9.89 points or 1.67 percent to close at 603.06.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy and Fiancee Saleh Afiff said
Thursday the government had achieved its first target to bring the
rupiah below the upper level of Bank Indonesia's now defunct
intervention band (2,378-2,682 rupiah against the U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to an historical low of 3,045 against the
greenback after Bank Indonesia, the central bank, floated the
rupiah last week in the wake of sustained speculative attacks on
regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah started recovering following the central bank's
increase of interest rates Tuesday. The bank raised its one-week
Bank Indonesia certificates (SBI) from 10.5 percent to 20 percent,
two-week rates from 11 percent to 22 percent, one-month rates from
11.625 percent to 30 percent and three-month rates from 11.5
percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Afiff said that the government would continue to tighten rupiah
for some time until market jitters calmed down and the rupiah
stabilized.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The value of state assets in
Guangzhou, capital city of South China's Guangdong Province, has
been growing steadily, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,710 enterprises in Guangzhou were involved in an
annual campaign to register property rights of the state-owned
assets. Final results show that by the end of 1996, the
enterprises had assets valued at 259.4 billion yuan (about 31.2
billion US dollars), of which state assets accounted for 28
percent. In another analysis, state assets made up 87 percent of
the net asset value.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total assets of the enterprises in Guangzhou
that possess or operate state-owned assets shot up 29 percent from
the 1995 figure, whereas the net asset value surged 44 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector still plays a vital role in the economy
of Guangzhou, though its ratio has gone down somewhat since China
initiated the policy of the reform and opening-up in 1979, experts
here say.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is a showcase of China's market economy reform.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, American Students Get Together at Nixon Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Seventy Chinese high school
students met and exchanged views with their American counterparts
today at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda,
California.
</P>
<P>
This was a closing event of a month-long "Youth Summit" to mark
the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-U.S. Shanghai
Communique. The event was sponsored by the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and
People to People International.
</P>
<P>
At the library, the Chinese students, together with southern
Californian high school students, watched two documentaries,
toured the library and listened to lectures.
</P>
<P>
They also broke into small groups to discuss the far-reaching
significance of the Shanghai Communique on Sino-U.S. relations in
the 21st century. The signing of the communique in Shanghai in
1972 marked the beginning of the normalization of relations
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As part of the "Young Summit," 75 American students from 22
states visited Shanghai between July and August, where they
listened to lectures on Sino-U.S. relations and exchanged views
with Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
"As these young people...get to know each other and exchange
views about the things that divide them and the things that bring
them together, they help continue the peace-making work that began
in 1972," said John Taylor, executive director of the Richard
Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with him, Li Xiaolin, CPAFFC deputy president and head
of the Chinese delegation, said the exchange program enhanced
mutual understanding and friendship between students of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students had previously spent six days in Hawaii,
and will leave for home at the end of this week.

<HEADLINE> Poor Families Receive International Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Poor rural families in China are
receiving aid from different countries through the partnership
between the Chinese Association for International Understanding
(CAFIU) and Plan International, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The poverty relief programs, which have already started in
Beijing and Shaanxi Province, will expand to the provinces of
Gansu and Qinghai and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region within two
years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A secondary school has been set up in Binxian County, Shaanxi
Province, just in time for the new school year. The building,
which is said to be the best in the area, cost 670,000 yuan
(80,700 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project in Shaanxi is still developing and will at least
double the size of the pilot scheme in Yanqing, a mountainous
county in northern Beijing, said Don Mcphee, Plan International's
representative in China.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 500,000 US dollars spent since 1995 has been used
in Yanqing's projects, such as improving the water supply,
providing school library books and training teachers.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the fund went to help 3,000 poor families with
children between the ages of six and 12. It was used to help the
local people build greenhouses, raise domestic animals and grow
medicinal plants and fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
The families pay part of the cost for the projects.
</P>
<P>
"Local people will handle the business with care when they have
a share in the investment," said Liu Yanfu, an official with
CAFIU. Staff from CAFIU/PLAN make weekly visits to the rural area
to make sure the programs are operating smoothly. Professional
auditors are invited each year to examine projects accounting
records. enditem

<HEADLINE> Popov Retains Fourth Consecutive Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Popov of Russia showed
his Olympic champion style to win the title in the men's 100
meters freestyle at the European Swimming Championships in
Seville, Spain on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victory not only accomplished his fourth consecutive
European 100 title, but showed his comeback from the shadow of
last year's accident in a Moscow street.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Popov clocked in 49.09 seconds, the fastest
time in the world this year and also set a European championship
record.
</P>
<P>
The Russian swept both 50 meters and 100 meters freestyle
titles at the 1996 Atlanta and 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and
snapped almost all of the two events in the international
competitions since 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, triple Olympic champion Michelle de Bruin's dream of
getting five individual titles faded when Germany's Dagmar Hase
stole the gold away in the women's 400 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, who won the 400 individual medley on Tuesday and
the 200 freestyle on Wednesday, had to settle with the silver at
4:10.50 while 27-year-old Hase finished 0.92 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Selkov of Russia made the first successful individual
title defence when he took the men's 200m backstroke crown for the
third time in succession at 1:59.21, edging Italy's Emanuele
Merisi by 0.42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Antje Buschschulte of Germany won the women's 100m backstroke at
1:01.74, and followed by Bucharest-born Roxana Maracineanu of
France at 1:01.84 and German Sandra Voelker 1:02.23, winner of
Tuesday's 100m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Germany won the women's 4x100m freestyle relay in 3:41.91 with
silver for Sweden and bronze for Russia.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Reports 32.6 Percent Tax Revenue Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The industrial and commercial
tax revenue of South China's Guangdong Province, an economic
powerhouse bordering Hong Kong, has been growing by an average
annual rate of more than 30 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Guangdong collected nearly 48.3
billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes, up 32.6 percent
from the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
A provincial taxation official contributed the surge in the tax
revenue to a rapid expansion of tax resources in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics indicate that Guangdong's industrial and
commercial tax base had included 10.2 million enterprises by the
end of last year, 230,000 more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the number of overseas-funded
enterprises, a major source of industrial and commercial taxes,
had reached 49,726 by the end of 1996. Industrial and commercial
taxes collected from such enterprises were valued at 18.5 billion
yuan last year, about 22.3 percent of Guangdong's yearly tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
A higher rate of collection is another factor behind the rapid
growth in Guangdong's industrial and commercial tax revenue, the
official said. He added that more than 21,000 cases of tax
violation were investigated last year.

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai People Marry Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,100 Chinese people
in Shanghai married foreigners last year, 67 percent more than in
1991, according to a survey by the city's civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
These inter-racial marriages accounted for 3.5 percent of the
city's total number of marriages last year, compared with 1.9
percent in 1991, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Some 168,000 people registered for marriage last year in this
economically-vibrant city at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Far more Chinese women than men marry foreigners, and more and
more of the couples are setting up homes in Shanghai rather than
moving overseas.
</P>
<P>
The age gap between the spouses is also narrowing.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey finds, marriages between Shanghai people
and foreigners have also been breaking up at a faster
rate in the past few years. The divorce rate from such marriages
last year more than doubled the figure from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Over 24,600 couples divorced in Shanghai last year, a rise of
43.9 percent over 1991.
</P>
<P>
A sociologist said that Shanghai is not unique in the country
in witnessing a boom in inter-racial marriages and accelerating
divorce rates, adding that Chinese marriages were more stable
before 1978, the year the country opened to the outside world and
initiated economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today categorically rejected U.N. Security Council term
president's accusation that Turkish Cypriots impede the Cyprus
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the remarks following Wednesday's statement by
the council President Jone Weston from Britain criticizing Turkish
Cypriots for the failure of the talks held last Friday in
Switzerland, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception in Nicosia, the Turkish Cypriot leader
said that he did not think that Diego Cordovez,
U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative to Cyprus, will
agree with such a statement.
</P>
<P>
Weston had reportedly said in his speech that Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides showed flexibility during the negotiations but
the Turkish Cypriot side impeded the substantive process "by
bringing preconditions to the table."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government and the U.N. blamed the Turkish Cypriot
side for blocking the talks by insisting on European Union's drop
of its planned accession talks with Cyprus as a precondition to
the Cyprus negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also accused the British representative to the U.N. of
openly shielding Clerides, saying that Weston seemed to be the
mouthpiece of the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Turkish Cypriots will not allow anyone to
control the peace process on the divided island, Denktash said,"
we will not be submissive towards injustice."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will submit his views concerning this issue to
Cordovez, adding that it is better not to go to any negotiating

<P>
KHARTOUM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
agreed to participate in the proposed peace meeting with rebels in
South African capital Pretoria at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, the Sudanese Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ali Osman Mohamed Taha said Khartoum has received an
invitation to participate in the meeting with the Southern
Sudanese rebel leader John Garang, which was called for by South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has also agreed to attend another
meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Musevini.
</P>
<P>
Taha further stated that a number of African Heads of State
would likely take part in these meetings, such as Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the agenda of the meeting with
Musevini includes relations between the Sudan and Uganda, and the
alleged role of Uganda in supporting the war in Southern Sudan. On
the other hand, the agenda of the talks with Garang covers all
issues related to peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the meetings aim at rapprochement
between the various parties.
</P>
<P>
Information available to the Sudanese government, he said,
reveals that all invited parties have agreed to attend, including
Garang.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has recently announced the arrangement of the meeting
between Sudanese President Omar Bashir and Garang in the presence
of Musevini to push forward the peace process in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president visited South Africa earlier this month
and had talks with Mandela. On his part, Mandela had appealed for
cease-fire in Southern Sudan and for peace negotiations to end the
14-year-old war between the Sudanese government troops and the
Garang-led rebel forces.

prediction method, said that it had identified 25 areas posing a
high risk from the point of view of seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
Up to 27 earthquakes of over six on the Richter scale could
rock Greece by the year 2010, said George Karakaisis, professor of
seismology of Thessaloniki University.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government had been reportedly urged by scientists to
increase its anti-seismic protection measures.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that Greece's geology and its location at the
junction of several tectonic plates make it especially prone to
shifts that cause tremors and quakes.
</P>
<P>
The south is believed to be Greece's most quake-prone region,
with all but seven of the 30 deadliest quakes since 1800 having
occurred there.
</P>
<P>
The most recent occurred on June 15, 1995 in the northern
Peloponnese town of Aegio, where dozens of buildings were razed and
26 people killed by the 6.4 magnitude tremor.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day conference has drawn over 1,000 seismology experts
from around the world to discuss the quake-prediction methods.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Leaves Key Interest Rates Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank, the
Bundesbank, today left the country's two benchmark interest rates
unchanged as expected by money markets.
</P>
<P>
The discount rate and Lombard rate have been left unchanged at
historical lows of 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent respectively since
April 1996. The country's another key rate, the securities
repurchase rate, also remains at 3.0 percent since a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank, however, decided two weeks ago to review the
repurchase rate week by week instead of the conventional interval
of two weeks. This tactic has proved to be effective to check the
German mark's steep decline against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that a rate hike in Germany carries the
risk that it could choke economic growth and undermine the
government's effort to combat record high unemployment.

<HEADLINE> School Enrollment in US Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- School enrollment in the
United States this fall will reach to a record 52.2 million and
the trend is expected to continue through 2007 as a result of
delayed marriage and child-bearing of baby boomers and some other
factors, a U.S. government report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to an Education Department report, the 52.2 million
children attending school this fall will be an increase of 800,000
over last year, mostly teenagers because enrollment among
elementary students increased from fall 1985 to fall 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said the enrollment in public and private schools is
expected to reach its peak at 54.3 million in 2007.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, from this fall until 2007, public
schools can expect a 13 percent increase in grades 9-12, a 5
percent increase in grades 6-8 and a 1 percent decrease in grades
1-5.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise to several reasons, including
immigration, the delay in marriage and child-bearing among baby
boomers, high birth rates among minorities and longer students
stay in school.

LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with London and Frankfurt closing with moderate
gains and Paris down 0.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain's leading share index finished slightly higher, but off
session highs due to profit-taking and Wall Street's opening
decline today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a sharp rally in shares in British
Telecommunications provided a boost to the FTSE 100 index, which
was 19.6 points higher at 4,978.0 by the close.
</P>
<P>
Among the three major markets in Europe, only Frankfurt kept
its gains throughout the day as the market closes before New York
opens and expectations were fulfilled that the Bundesbank would
not raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index ended at 4,253.67, up 30.24 points.
</P>
<P>
However, the Paris bourse closed lower, and tradings were thin
due to profit-taking and Wall Street's early losses today, with
the CAC-40 index slipping 22.04 points and was at 2,957.23 by the
close of the session.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Foiler Wins Men's Individual Title at Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Cuban foiler Rolando Samuel
Tucker edged world champion Sergly Golubytsky of Ukraine to win the
title of the men's individual foil at the 19th World University Games
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The competition schedule of the fencing tournament has been changed
time and again just on Thursday. It began to rain shortly before
the semi-finals and the organizers rushed to move the competitions
from outdoor venue back into an exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
Tucker, the 1994 and 1996 world champion, sailed into the final
after beating China's Wang Haibin 15-11 in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won the bronze medal at the 1997 World Fencing
Championships held in Cape Town last month, could not resist Tucker's
attacks in the semi-finals and had to be settled with the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
"Wang Haibin put up a good performance today though he lost the
match," said Guo Ying, coach of Wang, "Tucker is a very good foiler
and he deserved the victory."
</P>
<P>
Golubytsky, the newly crowned world champion and silver medalist at
the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, met a stiff resistence from his former
teammate Vadirm Ajoupov of Russia but managed to sail into the final
with a 15-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
The final between Tucker and Ajoupov was the highlight of the day
as neither one could enlarge the gap to more than two points.
</P>
<P>
The score deadlocked at 13-13 for quite a long time when the more
aggressive Tucker suddenly quickened his pace and scored two straight
points to wrap up the final 15-13.
</P>
<P>
It was the second gold medal of the day. China won the first gold
of the games, the men's team title of the gymnastics tournament after
a thrilling competition earlier on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Waigel Plunges Bonn Into Political Puzzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The confirmed intention of German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel that he will not hold his unpopular
post after the 1998 general elections has dropped a bombshell in
Bonn and triggered renewed speculations about a possible cabinet
reshuffle by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, who has served as finance minister in Kohl's government
since April 1989, surprised political observers Tuesday by saying
that he would quit his current post should Kohl's center-right
ruling coalition be re-elected in the next general elections due
in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
That intention was confirmed today by Kohl who said in a
statement released in Bonn that he was aware of Waigel's plan and
understood his decision.
</P>
<P>
However, both Kohl and Waigel rejected speculations that Waigel
was tired of serving in office, with Waigel indicating that he
would be willing to take over any other top post in the cabinet if
the coalition won the elections.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, 58, has come under heavy pressure for his hard-line
policy to push through fundamental structural reforms and to cut
the huge budget deficit at a time when Germany is plagued by
record high unemployment and the financial plight of making the
grade to join the planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
He also triggered controversies recently for his suggestion of
a cabinet reshuffle which, he said, would boost Kohl's chances to
win the elections.
</P>
<P>
Waigel made the proposal against the background that his party,
the Christian Social Union (CSU), is set to lose one seat in the
cabinet at the end of this year when the Postal Ministry becomes
defunct due to privatization.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, rejected a cabinet reshuffle in the near future,
though he also admitted that the dismantlement of the Postal
Ministry would tilt the balance of his government whose 17
ministerial portfolios were shared by his Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), the CSU and the junior partner Free Democratic Party
(FDP).
</P>
<P>
Waigel's latest plan to quit the Finance Ministry after the
elections reinforced the rumors that he might force the FDP to
give up one of its cabinet posts to the CSU.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Die Welt quoted unnamed senior officials
as saying today that Kohl might allow Waigel to replace Klaus
Kinkel (FDP) as foreign minister after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked to commend on the report by the German media, Waigel
denied that Kohl had made such a promise. But he also said,
"Actually, I believe I'm qualified for any responsible position in
Germany."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has traditionally been in the hands of the
FDP. Any takeover is sure to meet its strong resistance. But
Waigel said today that parties could not claim to be heirs to
certain ministries.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens to Kohl's government, the debates over the
past few days have apparently reinforced German opposition
parties' confidence that they will be able to win the next general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Both the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the
Greens today repeated their call for an early election. "In such a
hopeless situation, it is better to give up than just to hang on,"
said Werner Schulz, parliamentary general-secretary of the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Analysts meanwhile believe that Kohl will be eventually forced
to reshuffle his cabinet before next September in order to improve
his coalition's popularity for reelection.

<HEADLINE> US Federal Deficit Declines Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government deficit
shrank by about two-thirds in the first 10 months of fiscal 1997
comparing with the same period a year ago, the U.S. Treasury
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the deficit so far in the fiscal year
ending September 30 totaled 36.7 billion dollars, 64 percent below
the 100.9 billion registered in the same period of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Treasury received 1.3 trillion dollars in
revenues, compared to 1.2 trillion a year ago. Spending has
totaled 1.34 trillion dollars, up from 1.3 trillion during the
first 10 months of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in July alone totaled 25.6 billion dollars, down
from 26.9 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With tax receipts running 12 percent higher than the previous
year, the shortfall for the fiscal year appeared on track to
become the smallest in nearly a quarter-century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton predicted earlier this month the fiscal
1997 deficit would be 37 billion dollars, the smallest since a 6.1
billion dollar shortfall in fiscal 1974. The U.S. Congressional
Budget Office is forecasting a smaller 34 billion deficit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit hit a record 290.4 billion dollars in
fiscal 1992, then slipped to 255 billion the following year, 203.1
billion in fiscal 1994 and 163.9 billion in fiscal 1995. It
dropped to 107.3 billion dollars last year, the smallest since 79
billion in fiscal 1981.

WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it regretted Yasser Arafat's combative language against
Israel, but still believed the Palestinian leader remains a U.S.
partner in pursuing Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat attended a "national unity meeting" in Gaza Wednesday
and kissed and applauded leaders of the Hamas and Islamic Holy War
movements. He told the representatives of all factions that
Palestinians were prepared to resume the seven-year uprising
against Israeli occupation. He was referring to the 1987-1994
Palestinian "intifada" or uprising against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"What he did say wasn't particularly constructive in trying to
bring and restore confidence and trust," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin also said Arafat "made clear that he does support the
peace process and called on the supporters of the peace process to
work with him for a just and comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat is a partner in our quest for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have received assurances from Chairman
Arafat that he is going to work with the Israelis to combat
terror and prevent terror," he said.

global climate works and possibly how to predict the movement of
contaminants.
