<HEADLINE> California Executes Manuel Babbitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- A Vietnam veteran who supporters say  
was having a flashback when he beat a 78-year-old woman to death 
was executed by injection early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Babbitt, who received a Purple Heart on death row, died  
just after midnight, a day after his 50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Marine was sentenced to die for killing Leah Schendel  
in 1980. He was convicted of breaking into her Sacramento apartment 
and hammering her with punches that broke her dentures and split 
the skin on her forehead to the bone. Her heart gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schendel was found nude from the waist down. A mattress had  
been pulled over the top half of her body, a tea kettle placed on 
her pelvis and a leather strap tied around her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said that Babbitt's use of the strap was like  
a soldier tagging battlefield dead, and that his efforts to cover 
the body evoke the combat practice of covering the dead with 
whatever materials are at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said he didn't remember what happened that night.  
</P>
<P>
	Family members said he was out of mind when he committed the  
crime. Defenders said Babbitt, troubled by mental illness since his 
youth, cracked under the pressure of 77 days of shelling, misery 
and death during the siege of Khe Sanh in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The night he killed Mrs. Schendel, fog hung low over Sacramento  
as it had in Khe Sanh. Babbitt spent the day drinking, meeting up 
with an Asian-American man who was also a Vietnam vet. Drunk and 
stoned, he reached the senior citizen's complex where Mrs. Schendel 
was watching TV, probably a war movie called ``Tokyo Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said the fog, the drugs, the contact with an  
Asian and the war movie propelled Babbitt back to the 
kill-or-be-killed world of combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt received a Purple Heart in prison for wounds suffered  
during Khe Sanh. The rare death row ceremony infuriated Mrs. 
Schendel's family, who demanded -- and got -- legislation banning 
another such presentation.

<HEADLINE> The Derby Is the Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Once again, there's a hue and cry about reducing the Kentucky  
Derby to 14 starters from the present 20-horse limit. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been written that as many as nine of 19 starters in the  
125th Derby didn't get a fair shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest complaints, however, seemed to come from  
professional handicappers, who want to brag about picking the Derby 
winner. There also have been some yelps from losing trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	How the big bettors feel about big Derby fields is not known,  
but it can be assumed that if they feel the situation is not 
favorable, they lay off. 
</P>
<P>
	As for most of the people who show up at Churchill Downs on the  
first Saturday in May (151,051 this year), and for those who play 
office pools and attend parties, the size of the field is not 
important, nor is picking the right horse. Many of them, for 
various reasons, don't even get a glimpse of the wrong horse. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager of a bar-restaurant in midtown New York City drew  
Charismatic in a pool. So he sent a bartender to a nearby off-track 
betting parlor to wager $20 on the colt, whose on-track payoff of 
$64.60 was the third largest in Derby history. 
</P>
<P>
	To many people, the Derby is much more than a horse race. It's  
an event. 
</P>
<P>
	Do only motor racing fans follow the Indy 500? Are parties a big  
reason to watch the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
	So it was with Kentucky Derby CXXV.  
</P>
<P>
	``They call it a roller Derby. It's rough,'' trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas said. ``But that's what makes it unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, of course, was the winning trainer on Saturday for the  
fourth time, but he's also been in 15 other Derbies in which he 
lost and in which the smallest fields were 13 twice and the largest 
were 20 twice and 21 once. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about reducing the size of the field, trainer Nick Zito  
said you shouldn't narrow the dream of running in and winning the 
Derby. Zito, who has won two Derbies, finished 14th with Stephen 
Got Even, the second betting favorite, and 17th with Adonis. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden, whose Menifee was beaten by a neck by  
Charismatic, after being far back and being checked by traffic on 
the final turn, said he thought about reducing the size of the 
field, but he also said, ``I might win it some day because another 
horse gets into trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for this year's big field was that it was the 125th  
anniversary of America's Race. On the 100th anniversary, there were 
23 starters. There were 21 starters in 1981, after litigation. 
Since then, however, the 20-limit rule has been made court-proof. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety, of course, is a concern, but while the Derby is often  
roughly run, it seems the rough tactics aren't necessarily a result 
of rough riding. After, all, jockeys have to be aware of the 
consequences of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems Saturday was that the filly Three Ring (post  
No. 2), who was expected to get out and set the pace, allowing the 
field to string out a bit, was bumped at the start and then had her 
saddle slip. No rider on any other starter was especially anxious 
to take the lead, and so the field reached the first turn almost as 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a certain number of front runners should be required.  
Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the Derby. Let it alone, unless the risks can be proven to  
be unacceptable. And reducing risk doesn't seem to be a main reason 
behind the calls for change.

<HEADLINE> INS `Hubbing' Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service is  
being criticized over a plan to group illegal immigrants by 
nationality and ship them to jails in either Texas or Chicago to 
await deportation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, illegal immigrants awaiting deportation are generally  
jailed in whatever part of the country they are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS said the ``hub'' plan would be a cost-effective and  
efficient way to process detainees, most of whom are simply 
awaiting exit papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, however, said the proposal is racist and would  
demoralize immigrants, leaving them hundreds of miles from their 
families and any support services they would need if they choose to 
fight deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like the INS has forgotten they're people and not  
packages,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., chairman of the 
immigration task force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which 
has sent a letter of protest to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner. 
``It's like Federal Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would encompass the 18 states in the agency's central  
region. Illegal Mexican, Central American and Caribbean immigrants 
would be moved to separate facilities in Texas. All other 
immigrants in question -- those from Europe, Asia and Africa -- would 
be shipped to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an illegal immigrant from Honduras who is picked up  
in a workplace raid in Indiana would be sent to Dallas to await 
deportation or a hearing before an immigration judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, such a case would be handled at the nearest INS  
office, with the immigrant most likely detained at a county jail 
that contracts with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS said the plan is open to revision -- although officials  
would like to implement it early this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it is under pressure from Congress to quickly  
move immigrants out of detention and slash its backlog of cases. 
The agency noted that many detainees -- there are about 4,300 in the 
central region -- are convicted criminals who already have their 
deportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want these people near where we can quickly move them to  
their home country,'' said Brian Perryman, director of the INS 
district office in Chicago. ``A very small percentage of them are 
going to prevail even on appeal. Most of them are going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But immigrants rights groups believe ``hubbing'' essentially  
assures all detained immigrants will be removed from the country -- 
the convicted criminals as well as the asylum-seekers and wrongly 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think plantation slave owners were really clear that when  
you broke up families and sent them in lots of different directions 
you really did an effective job of breaking down people's sense of 
community and possibility and hope,'' said Alice Cottingham of the 
Chicago-based Fund for Immigrants and Refugees. ``I don't know how 
deliberate INS is in trying to get that same result, but I think 
anybody could guess that's going to be the result.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Put Boggs on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list for only the second time in his 18-year career 
Wednesday night after straining his left hamstring in Tampa Bay's 
10-7 win over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Boggs and designated hitter Jose Canseco were injured in  
the game. Canseco was listed as day-to-day after bruising his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs left after two innings. He grounded out in the second,  
then was replaced at third base by Bobby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be DL'ed and that's to quiet everything down -- his  
quad, his calf, both legs and get him back to being full 
strength,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said. ``It might be 
sooner than the 15 days is up, but the call right now is 7-to-10 
days, and it can go longer than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs has been slowed by right quadriceps tightness, sitting out  
Sunday's game. He returned Monday and tied Frank Robinson for 25th 
place on the career hits list at 2,943. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs' only other trip to the disabled list came in 1998 when he  
had a strained right calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's uncharted waters ... I'm optimistic,'' Boggs said.  
``That's the way I've always been and I'm not any different right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays called up infielder Herbert Perry from Triple-A  
Durham to take Boggs' place on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was hurt avoiding a tag at first base after hitting an  
opposite-field single in the third inning. He limped toward the 
dugout after being replaced by pinch-runner Danny Clyburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would doubt I would play him tomorrow (Thursday),''  
Rothschild said. ``It's an early (12:35 p.m. EDT) game and it's 
just not far enough removed. If he comes in and he feels great and 
he's doing jumping jacks, I'll consider it. ... but I don't 
anticipate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco has appeared in all but one game this season, missing  
only an April 29 game at the Chicago White Sox with abdominal 
muscle tightness. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Canseco has not homered in 27 at-bats, his longest  
drought this season, he began the night tied for for the AL lead in 
home runs with 10.

<HEADLINE> Landlords Opt To Leave HUD Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opal Henke doesn't quite know what she'd do if  
she lost her subsidized apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter would take her in. But that's not a satisfactory  
solution to Mrs. Henke, who now resides in a Department of Housing 
and Urban Development senior citizens complex in Wahoo, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't really want to depend on your children. They have  
their families to raise,'' Mrs. Henke told the House Banking 
housing subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Henke is among thousands of residents who face the possible  
loss of their homes as more and more landlords opt to leave a HUD 
``Section 8'' program that provides subsidized housing to the poor, 
elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD has put together an emergency response. But the department,  
lawmakers and housing advocates agree that a longer-term strategy 
is needed to preserve affordable housing stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without reform, the program risks losing the best of its ...  
housing, displacing thousands of low-income families and seniors,'' 
said Assistant Housing Secretary William C. Apgar. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one part of the 25-year-old ``Section 8'' program,  
landlords agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who 
pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the government pays the difference between what the  
tenant pays and its estimate of what the apartment would cost on 
the open market. But with the booming economy, many landlords are 
deciding not to renew their contracts. Instead, they're seeking 
more money on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, more than 17,000 units left the program -- more  
than three times as many as the year before. By 2004, HUD contracts 
covering 1 million units -- some in every state -- are due to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 1 million are at risk because their rents are  
below market, according to the nonprofit National Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD's $30 million emergency response will immediately boost  
rents for some contracts that are coming due. But the measure is 
only targeting high-quality housing in good neighborhoods that is 
at high risk of being lost. Market rents may be offered for some 
other properties on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Apgar said it would cost much more -- $600 million to $800  
million more a year -- for HUD to bring all below-market rents in 
the program to market levels. HUD now spends about $16 billion a 
year on Section 8 programs providing about 3 million units of 
subsidized housing.

<HEADLINE> Columbine H.S. Estimates Reach $50M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- It could cost $50 million to repair  
damage to Columbine High School and help students and staff deal 
with the shooting attack's aftermath, a top administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond asked state  
lawmakers Tuesday for $5 million to help cover the cost, citing a 
cash-flow problem that the district had before the April 20 
massacre that left 15 people dead, including two student gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Although lawmakers rejected her request, Gov. Bill Owens  
allocated $1 million for the district from the state's disaster 
fund. President Clinton has promised at least $1.5 million and the 
state Board of Education is looking at kicking in about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs, which Ms. Hammond said could reach $50 million, would  
include building repairs, replacement of supplies, victims' 
assistance counseling, increased security and replacement of 
traditional keys with electronically coded ones that cannot be 
duplicated. Police have said the two gunmen had duplicated metal 
school keys. 
</P>
<P>
	The request came two weeks after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold  
killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 others before 
killing themselves in the lunchtime massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone has identified one of  
Klebold's classmates, Brooks Brown, as a possible suspect. Harris 
saw Brown outside the school moments before the attack and warned 
him to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has repeatedly denied involvement, noting his brother was  
in the cafeteria when the shooting happened. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show this morning, Brown  
said he believed Stone was upset because Brown's parents criticized 
the sheriff's office for failing to take actions a year ago when 
they told deputies that Harris was building bombs and had 
threatened Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a smokescreen for him (Stone),'' Brown said. ``He knows  
he's screwing up and he's going to look really bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also aired a videotape of Brown, Klebold and an unidentified  
student produced six months ago that showed an animated Klebold 
carrying his black trenchcoat outside the school. Harris was not on 
the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold also was seen in the cafeteria, with the staircase to  
the second-floor library in the background. Most of the students 
were killed in the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching that video, it's kind of painful. At the same time,  
it's helpful, remembering the good times,'' Brown said. ``It still 
doesn't seem that Dylan could do this. This guy I've known since I 
was 5 is a mass murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone told today's Denver Post that witnesses have named another  
suspect who may have been a third gunman. He did not identify the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today the sheriff's deputy who  
investigated a van break-in by the two gunmen last year received a 
complaint not long afterward that they were setting off pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after deputy Mark Miller wrote a report on the pipe bomb  
complaint, a juvenile magistrate gave the two teens a form of 
probation for the break-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Magistrate John DeVita told the Times he would not have allowed  
probation had he known of the complaint, which also included 
information that Harris had posted three death threats against a 
classmate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller did not return a telephone call seeking comment from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, attorney Robert Ransome, who represents Mark Manes,  
said his client sold the semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Harris and 
Klebold and joined them on shooting excursions in the mountains in 
the month before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who was booked this week on suspicion of providing a  
handgun to a minor, knew nothing of the impending massacre, Ransome 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome is trying to negotiate a deal with prosecutors. The  
charge against Manes carries a maximum six-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are also performing ballistics tests to determine  
which weapons fired the fatal shots; Manes could face more serious 
charges if the TEC DC-9 was used to kill someone.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybean Futures Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures were mixed early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans futures prices 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were buffeted by conflicting reports out of the  
winter wheat crop tour, where scouts were finding above-average 
yields in some areas and below-average yields in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures retreated amid perceptions that farmers had gotten  
a large portion of what could be a bumper crop into the ground 
ahead of rain that moved into the Midwest today and was expected to 
linger for the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell on the theory that any acreage not planted with  
corn would be switched to soybeans. The government already is 
predicting record soybean plantings; additional sowings would 
further erode already weak export prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery was unchanged at $2.63 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3/4 cent to $2.22 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to $1.19 3/4 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 cent to $4.87 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercanitle Exchange, while feeder cattle were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .07 cent to 62.57 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .10 cent to 70.97 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .18 cent to 58.20 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .15 
cent to 58.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 82-Year-Old Is Mo. Senate Doorkeeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- At 82, B.W. Robinson has already  
retired from a career that took him to the pinnacle of Missouri 
public education. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never stopped teaching.  
</P>
<P>
	For the last 15 years, Robinson has enjoyed a second career:  
doorkeeper for the Missouri Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In that role, he has made a classroom out of the gateway to  
democratic action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still in education, in a sense,'' Robinson says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Senators ask me to talk to their groups about the interior of  
the Senate chamber, and who are the people in the paintings, where 
the mahogany and marble came from, and the lights and fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I can do that is because I like to teach. That  
Senate chamber is one of the elegant rooms in our state. It has 
beauty and architectural significance, and somebody needs to tell 
these young people about it. I'm afraid the fourth grade could 
visit from northwest Missouri and not get to hear the significance 
of these little details,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The title of doorkeeper may sound humble.  
</P>
<P>
	But then, Robinson is a humble man -- ever ready with a smile and  
a hearty handshake or an affectionate hug for visitors to the 
Senate's Pershing Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's humility shields his distinguished professional  
resume in education, starting in 1936 as a teacher of eight grades 
in a one-room schoolhouse and capped by two decades as the No. 2 
official in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't hint at his first-name relationships with the  
most influential Missourians, including Gov. Mel Carnahan, whose 
now-grown children Robinson knew from his eight years as school 
superintendent in Rolla, the governor's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	His quiet approachability also doesn't reveal a record of  
volunteerism that would tax much younger people, including world 
travels for Lions International as a member of the civic 
organization's international board. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention his efforts for Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the  
State Historical Society of Missouri, the University of Missouri 
Alumni Association, Cole County's meals program for senior citizens 
and Sunday mornings spent as senior usher at First Christian Church 
in the capital city. 
</P>
<P>
	The church door is where Robinson's welcoming hugs are  
showcased: ``Some of these dear ladies at church tell me that's the 
only loving they get all week, God bless them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of all his volunteer activities, Lions International has proved  
perhaps the most rewarding for its programs to help the visually 
impaired. And his world travels for Lions -- to every continent 
except Australia -- gave Robinson one of his most harrowing 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	On a flight in South Africa, a plane carrying Robinson and 26  
others crashed into a mountaintop near a wild animal preserve. Four 
people died at the scene, and the aircraft caught fire. Robinson 
helped pull survivors to safety, then fretted about whether hungry 
animals might be prospecting for a meal. The group spent 17 hours 
without water on the rugged mountainside before being discovered by 
a native woodsman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved that man to death, I was so glad to see him,''  
Robinson recalled. ``Later, the doctors said the wild animals 
weren't the biggest problem. It turns out some of the most terrible 
snakes were right around there, and that's what we should have been 
scared of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson spent almost two weeks in a Johannesburg hospital for  
his injuries, including torn ligaments and ripped muscles in his 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he walked out of the hospital using a cane and resumed his  
Lions speechmaking tour across Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``B.W. Robinson is the very definition of a gentleman. He is an  
awesome example of making the most of every minute, and he inspires 
with the service he turns in every day,'' said Larry Rohrbach, a 
Republican state senator who counts Robinson among his 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	The admiration for Robinson is bipartisan.  
</P>
<P>
	``B.W. is one of the best-known people in Missouri through his  
years in education, and now through his years at the door of the 
Missouri Senate,'' said Democrat Sen. John Scott, who hired 
Robinson while serving as Senate president pro tem in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was brought to the Senate, Scott said, because of his  
knack for remembering names and faces -- and for his discretion in 
dealing with Senate visitors of every rank, background and 
disposition. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent busy legislative day, Robinson greeted Secretary of  
State Bekki Cook. ``Now, what senator wants you?'' he asked with a 
gentle touch on Cook's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	That same greeting is repeated dozens of times each day to  
lobbyists and news reporters, politicians and legislative staffers, 
school groups and assorted hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been such a teacher to me as a lobbyist,'' said Coleen  
Coble, executive director of the Missouri Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble recalled her first tentative steps toward the Senate door  
years ago, and how she awkwardly asked Robinson to call out a 
veteran member who was tied up in heated floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``B.W. told me, `Dear, he is a little busy now. Why don't you  
just step up to the visitors gallery upstairs and I'm so sure he 
will want to visit with you when he is finished,' and it was so 
charming,'' Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he is energized by his contacts with people from  
many backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two things are operative with me: In the main, I have enjoyed  
good health. That enables me to do this. And second, because I do 
it and stay active, I believe it makes my health better,'' Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, whose wife died in 1979, arrives at the Capitol just  
after 8 a.m. on session days, ``which beats being at the house 
alone. I'm too busy meeting people to think about my own ailments 
or problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love being with people. It strengthens me. I just have a  
strong desire to see the world a little bit better than it might be 
if I didn't do the small things I do.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T emerged triumphant in the high-stakes  
takeover fight for MediaOne Group Inc., and along the way forged a 
deal with rival suitor Comcast Corp. that could further expand its 
reach into the nation's households. Under an agreement with Comcast 
reached late last night, the nation's biggest long-distance 
telephone company will complete its $54 billion acquisition of 
MediaOne, thus making AT&AMP;T the country's largest cable provider as 
well. Comcast, the No. 3 cable company, had been trying to line up

yesterday revealed more details of their infamous Hollywood feud. 
Katzenberg has sued Disney, claiming the company owes him at least 
$250 million in bonuses for work he did at the company before he 
quit in 1994. Eisner said he believed Katzenberg had a ``dark

<HEADLINE> Commission Urged To Block Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Representatives for Japan, Russia and Brazil  
are pleading with an independent government agency to oppose 
punitive tariffs under consideration by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	During a rare public appearance, the representatives argued that  
factors beyond their countries' control were responsible for last 
year's surge in steel imports to the United States, an increase 
blamed for thousands of U.S. layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Krueger, a Stanford University economics professor who  
testified on behalf of the foreign countries, said the financial 
crisis abroad has shown signs of easing. That crisis contributed to 
the surge in imports by lowering demand for the product there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resumption of more normal conditions in Asia, the rest of  
the world and the U.S. means that conditions are very different 
now, and it cannot be concluded there is a threat to American steel 
producers based on what happened then,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission, a fact-finding body  
that is independent from the administration, is considering whether 
the import surge has hurt or threatens to injure the domestic 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	That finding is a major factor in determining whether the  
administration will impose steel tariffs against Japan, Russia and 
Brazil. Rulings are due this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruled last week that Japan has illegally  
dumped a core steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel, in U.S. 
markets at prices below production costs or home-market prices. The 
department earlier found evidence of dumping by Russia and Brazil 
and expect final rulings this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia may be able to avoid tariffs if that country finalizes an  
agreement with the United States to voluntarily curb shipments. 
Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem 
Steel, reiterated his opposition to the deal and threatened to 
challenge the agreement in federal court and seek legislative 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not stop the imports and is not in the public  
interest,'' Barnette told the trade commission. ``We will oppose it 
with all the resources we have available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing that dwelled as much on accounting mechanics as on  
the essence of trade policy, domestic producers and leaders of 
their workers' union tried to convince the commissioners that the 
industry is hurting despite strong demand for steel products. 
</P>
<P>
	``The domestic steel industry remains on the verge of a  
catastrophe,'' said George Becker, president of the United 
Steelworkers of America. ``Steelworkers are hurting wherever 
hot-rolled steel is made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the foreign countries said other factors -- and  
not dumping -- were responsible for the surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The domestic industry ... flat out simply did not have the  
capacity to meet increased demand,'' lawyer William Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration's top trade officials said  
at a separate forum that President Clinton's efforts to combat 
unfair steel shipments from Japan and other countries are showing 
dramatic results and will take the steam out of a congressional 
drive to limit steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the House voted 289-141 for legislation that would  
impose global quotas on steel shipments into the United States. The 
proposal is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky repeated the  
administration's view that the quota bill is clearly in violation 
of global trade rules administered by the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be a quota bill ultimately presented  
to the president,'' Barshefsky told the Society of American 
Business Writers and Editors. ``I think the president's program has 
been working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that assessment was disputed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., who said at the commission hearing that he believed the 
Senate was ``very close to being able to do what the House did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, a key supporter of restricting foreign steel, said  
action could come in ``another week or so.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Finish Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans retreated as rainfall in Midwest growing  
regions proved unexpectedly light and scattered, reigniting worries 
that fieldwork will proceed at a normal pace and lead to bumper 
harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans remain under heavy pressure from expectations for  
another record crop, which would come at a time when inventories 
remain high because of weak export demand and heavy competition 
from Brazilian crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by the decline in the corn and  
soybean markets. Traders sought direction after early tours of 
winter wheat growing regions found variable yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 cent to $2.62 a bushel; July corn  
fell 1 cent to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; July oats were unchanged at $1.18 3/4 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.84 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell 0.60 cent to 61.90 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.75 cent to 72.47 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 0.35 cent to 59.35 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 0.90 
cent to 57.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Most Oklahomans Don't Have Cellars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- We've all seen ``The Wizard of Oz.''  
Midwesterners know the drill. When they see a twister coming their 
way, they just head for the root cellar, close the door and wait it 
out, right? 
</P>
<P>
	That's a fairy tale for many. In real life, most of the people  
in the path of the killer twisters that swept through ``Tornado 
Alley'' this week didn't even have a basement to hide in. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's deadly tornadoes hit Oklahoma City the hardest, killing  
at least 38. Five more were killed in Kansas and another person 
died Tuesday in Texas, making this the nation's deadliest tornado 
outbreak since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	For many parts of Tornado Alley, which stretches from north  
Texas to the Dakotas, safe cellars are from days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 23 years of building, I've only done one,'' said Tom  
Vorderlandwehr, an Oklahoma City-area home builder. ``It's not 
something that's typical to the area any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many say the reasons are simple: soil conditions and cost.  
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma City much of the soil is red clay, which expands  
when wet and contracts when it dries. Because of the clay, a 
builder constructing a basement must remove twice as much dirt as 
normal and surround the home's concrete walls with more stable 
material. A finished basement can add $30,000 to $40,000 to a 
home's cost, builder Mark Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Texas, the soil is a black ``gumbo'' with a wildly  
fluctuating moisture content. Most homes are built above ground, 
either on pier-and-beam foundations or concrete slabs. Storm 
cellars, few and far between, were found in older, rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas, Dorothy's fictional home, the stable soil means most  
homes have basements. Wichita home builder Quentin Moeder said he 
never builds a home without one. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis George said that even in Oklahoma City's red clay, he can  
dig a cellar for as little as $20 a square foot, though it won't be 
pretty. ``Actually, a basement's about as cheap as putting a garage 
on,'' said George, who runs a backhoe service and builds homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Despain, a home builder and director of the Oklahoma City  
Board of Realtors, said that complacency, not cost, is the issue. 
Oklahoma City has been lulled into a false sense of security, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see, we haven't had very many of these massive storms that  
just swipe everything away,'' Despain said. ``People think they can 
just get in a closet and be safe, and we found out last night that 
you can't. When we have a storm like last night, you've just got to 
be underground to be safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His office manager was left in critical condition after she was  
swept from the bathtub where she was hiding under a mattress and 
was thrown two blocks. Several of the dead from Monday's storms 
were found huddled in bathtubs or under heavy furniture -- the 
places experts say you should go if you don't have a basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale said he's installing a lot of storm rooms above ground  
inside new homes, using concrete walls with a steel-reinforced 
ceiling. Texas Tech University in Lubbock has a research center 
looking to make buildings more storm resistant and provides plans 
for reinforcing a bathroom to make it a stronger shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes an extraordinary event like Monday's tornado --  
classified F5, the most powerful -- to change people's habits, 
Despain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of guessing that if today we advertised basements  
that we'd be busy for the next year building them,'' he said. ``I 
think I'm going to build me one after last night.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies Trade Spoljaric to Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- When the Philadelphia Phillies acquired  
left-hander Paul Spoljaric from Seattle last November, they heard 
almost immediately from the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, they finally struck another deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly after we traded for him, Toronto called us,'' Phillies  
general manager Ed Wade said after the trade for reliever Robert 
Person. ``Things really heated up last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoljaric, 28, struggled in all three of his starts this season,  
going 0-3 with a 21.13 ERA. He has a 15.09 ERA overall, including 
one relief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we overevaluated or overprojected him,'' Wade said. ``We  
tried to get something out of him and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Person, a 29-year-old right-hander, also struggled, going 0-2  
with a 9.82 ERA in 11 games. Since the start of the season, Person 
has gone from being the closer to a reliever that Toronto manager 
Jim Fregosi couldn't trust in clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bitter about the fact that I didn't get a chance to  
mess up as a closer,'' Person said. ``I just didn't do well when I 
wasn't the closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, he gave up five earned runs in just three  
innings against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have just liked him to be the setup man for us, but he  
wasn't throwing enough strikes,'' Fregosi said. ``There were a 
couple times on Tuesday night where he missed the catcher by three 
feet!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may get a chance to finish games for the Phillies, who lost  
closer Jeff Brantley last week to what could be a season-ending 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like his arm,'' Wade said. ``At the end of last year, he  
closed some games for the Blue Jays, and he's a guy we can put into 
the mix with the rest of our relievers. We thought it was a chance 
worth taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Spoljaric, the trade brings him back to Canada. He is a  
native of British Columbia and his wife is from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career with the Blue Jays, pitching parts of three  
seasons there before being traded to Seattle in the Jose Cruz Jr. 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going back to the Cruz deal, he was the make or break guy and  
we we're reluctant to part with him,'' Ash said. ``He plays better 
where he's more comfortable, and I don't think he ever felt 
comfortable in Seattle, and obviously he hasn't gotten off to a 
good start in the National League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi said Spoljaric will work in long relief. Asked if he can  
live with a closer by a committee bullpen, Fregosi said: ``As of 
right now yes, but ask me in a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fregosi brought up the possibility of moving starter  
Kelvim Escobar from the starting rotation to the closer's role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that has been talked about since spring  
training,'' Fregosi said. ``Personally, I would rather have him as 
a starter, but you never know. It may become a necessity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To fill Spoljaric's spot in the starting rotation Philadelphia,  
purchased the contract of right-hander Joel Bennett, who will get 
his first major league start on Saturday against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, Philadelphia optioned right-hander  
Steve Montgomery to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre of the 
International League.

<HEADLINE>  Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When John and Sheryl Molsbee were allowed  
back to their brick-and-frame home Wednesday, the roof was gone but 
Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't  
home when extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and 
killed 38 people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes 
in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you it was,'' said his wife, who hid with their  
19-year-old daughter, Kristy, under a blue flowered mattress in the 
master bedroom, then helped pull injured people from the wreckage 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Molsbees were among hundreds of people left homeless by the  
tornadoes who were allowed to return Wednesday to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had received about 100 missing persons reports, but  
they were uncertain how many were duplicates. A master list of 
those unaccounted for was expected by Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters were made available throughout the area for short-term  
housing, while officials made long-term arrangements for the 
suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the  
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster 
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance 
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to

<HEADLINE>  Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When John and Sheryl Molsbee were allowed  
back to their brick-and-frame home Wednesday, the roof was gone but 
Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't  
home when extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and 
killed 38 people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes 
in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you it was,'' said his wife, who hid with their  
19-year-old daughter, Kristy, under a blue flowered mattress in the 
master bedroom, then helped pull injured people from the wreckage 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Molsbees were among hundreds of people left homeless by the  
tornadoes who were allowed to return Wednesday to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had received about 100 missing persons reports, but  
they were uncertain how many were duplicates. A master list of 
those unaccounted for was expected by Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters were made available throughout the area for short-term  
housing, while officials made long-term arrangements for the 
suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the  
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster 
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance 
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to 
rent travel trailers to put on their property.''

<HEADLINE> Early Toolmakers Had Real Knack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Early makers of stone tools were more skillful than previously  
believed, according to a team of archaeologists who painstakingly 
pieced together rocks broken 2.3 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A stone tool factory the team uncovered in Kenya is so old that  
the toolmakers might not even have belonged to the human 
evolutionary group Homo. 
</P>
<P>
	They could have been small ape-like pre-humans, but they were  
smart enough to methodically chip off as many as 30 sharp flakes 
from a single rock the size of a loaf of bread. The flakes are 
thought to have been used to cut and scrape plants and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The working scheme is more elaborate than anything else I have  
seen of this age,'' said Helene Roche, an archaeologist at the 
University of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The team excavated a small site in the Rift Valley, where  
several clues to humans' earliest ancestors have been found. They 
pieced together many of the more than 2,000 flakes they found, 
producing about 60 reconstructions of the original stones. It was 
like putting together a 3-D puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche and Anne Delagnes ``basically sat in camp for days and  
days and just looked at shapes and tried to match them back 
together. It's tremendously time-consuming, but it's really 
marvelous to see when it actually works,'' said Craig Feibel of 
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., a geologist on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, the team said two things demonstrate the skill of the early 
toolmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	One is that they chose their raw material well. They would  
strike a new rock a couple of times to see if it was the kind of 
lava that gave sharp-edged flakes, and if it wasn't, they would 
discard it and move on to another. The team found several of these 
discarded, chipped rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The other remarkable thing is that they knew where to start  
striking a rock and how to proceed so that each flake chipped off 
left a new surface suitable for striking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like they are just sort of randomly whacking away and  
knocking off whatever happens to come off,'' Feibel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is very exciting,'' said stone tool specialist  
Alison Brooks at the Smithsonian Institution, adding that the 
factory is at least 700,000 years older than previous finds of the 
same complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there are cores with up to 30 flakes removed is  
just unheard of for this time,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who the flakes belonged to is a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Two species of Australopithecus, upright-walking pre-humans,  
could have been around at this time, as well as the earliest 
members of the genus Homo, to which modern humans belong. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest stone tools ever found, 2.6 million years old, are  
thought to be the work of Australopithecines. This theory was 
strengthened by a find in Ethiopia, announced two weeks ago, of the 
2.5 million-year-old bones of a previously unknown species of 
Australopithecus together with animal bones cut by tools.

<HEADLINE> Feds Expand Sprinkler Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The federal safety agency that ordered a  
nationwide recall of 8 million trouble-plagued Omega fire 
sprinklers has expanded its investigation to all types of 
sprinklers used for fire safety in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is simply to look at the performance of fire  
sprinklers to see whether they perform as advertised,'' Russ Rader, 
a spokesman for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rader said federal law barred him from discussing specifics of  
the investigation, which began around the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPSC does not routinely expand an investigation after  
ordering a recall, he said in a phone interview from the agency's 
Washington offices. ``If we find in the course of an investigation 
that we feel it would be important to look at other similar 
products ... we certainly don't hesitate to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are at least 100 million sprinkler heads in use around the  
nation, and hundreds of types, said Steve Muncy, president of the 
Dallas-based American Fire Sprinkler Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like a fishing expedition,'' Muncy said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a proven fact that they're highly effective,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Rader said the CPSC was not questioning the safety record of  
sprinklers. ``We want to do an evaluation because it is a key 
safety device and is being used in more and more homes across the 
country,'' he said. ``It is our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported in August 1997 that the Omega  
sprinkler had a 35 percent failure rate in tests conducted for the 
Fairfax County, Va., Fire and Rescue Department and a 31 percent 
failure rate in tests by Underwriters Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of the Omegas, Central Sprinkler Co. of Lansdale, Pa.,  
dropped its opposition to a recall last October in settling a 
lawsuit filed by the safety commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Omegas have failed to activate in about 20 fires since 1990,  
causing injuries and millions of dollars in property damage, the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8.4 million Omegas are installed nationwide in schools,  
hospitals, hotels, dormitories, homes, apartment complexes, office 
buildings and prisons. They have been or are being removed from the 
White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Smithsonian museums and many 
other federal buildings. An additional 1.5 million are in use 
overseas.

	Fed Reports Economy at Strong Level  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy continues to operate at  
``generally strong levels and expand at a moderate pace'' as jobs 
remain plentiful and American consumers continue to spend briskly, 
the Federal Reserve said today. The nation's central bank released 
its ``beige book'' report, a survey of regional economic conditions 
before April 26. ``Most districts report recent improvement in the 
manufacturing sector,'' the report said. One persisting weak spot 
was identified by the Atlanta bank: Apparel production and orders 
remain low because of ``fierce foreign competition.'' The 
compilation of anecdotal information is collected by the Fed's 12 
regional banks for the benefit of Fed policy-makers who are 
scheduled to meet next on May 18. 

</P>
<P>
	Factory Orders Rebound in March  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department reported today that  
orders to American factories rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted $350 billion in March, following a 1.8 percent plunge in 
February. That recovery was stronger than analysts had expected, 
and the department softened its estimates of February's decline, 
originally reported at 2.5 percent. The March rise in factory 
orders was the fourth gain in six months.

	Analysts Mull Pan-Europe Exchange

	LONDON (AP) -- The wave of consolidation reshaping European  
companies has reached the trading floors of the region's stock 
exchanges. The heads of eight exchanges signed an agreement 
yesterday to work toward creating a Europewide stock market. The 
London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse, which formed a 
strategic alliance last July, are the nucleus of the group. Joining 
them were leading exchanges in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, 
Italy, France and Switzerland. While such a combination could lower 
costs for investors and enable Europe to better compete with Wall 
Street, some analysts said today that management and technical 
problems could stymie the international effort.

	Cadillac Passes Torch to Lincoln

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Cadillac's 48-year rule as the U.S. luxury car  
king is over after all, with GM's apologies to Lincoln. General 
Motors said today it has apologized in writing to Ford Motor's 
Lincoln unit for wrongly reporting in January that Cadillacs had 
outsold Lincolns during 1998. Cadillac had claimed that a late-year 
rally lifted it to the title by just a 222-car margin. But GM 
backtracked today, saying an internal audit showed Cadillac's 
December sales figures were overstated because of an improper 
reporting process. The revised final score: Lincoln 
187,121-Cadillac 182,570.

	Volkswagen Sued for `Nazi Nursery'

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Lawyers claiming to represent Russian and  
Polish slave laborers during World War II filed a class-action 
lawsuit today against German automaker Volkswagen, seeking 
reparations for the deaths of up to 400 children. The lawsuit says 
the children, put in a nursery at a Volkswagen plant where their 
parents were forced to build munitions and the ``Beetle,'' died 
from maltreatment and poor conditions. The suit, filed in U.S. 
District Court in Milwaukee, accuses the company of genocide and 
war crimes. Volkswagen A.G. reissued a statement first released in 
November. The children's death at the nursery ``is a tragic chapter 
from one of the darkest times of modern history,'' the statement 
said.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A group of creditors sued the owners of the

are seeking about $16 million they allege the owners took from the 
team during the year before the franchise declared bankruptcy. 
Named in the suit are Roger Marino, Howard Baldwin and Morris 
Belzberg. The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October. In addition 
to money the three owners received, the lawsuit is seeking the 
rights to a minor league hockey team signed over to Baldwin in 1996 
that is now worth $2 million.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc. reported it had sharply lower

managed health care company had warned last month that its results 
would come in below expectations. Humana reported operating 
earnings of $33 million, or 20 cents per share, down from $50 
million, or 30 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Also 
today, the company announced a $15 million tentative agreement to 
settle federal government claims that Humana benefited from 
Medicare premium overpayments earlier this decade.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior executive with America Online

$10 billion merger were taking place in the months before the 
Microsoft trial began, and that AOL considered the impact of the 
deal on the trial's outcome. ``It was dismissed as an issue not 
having an impact on our decision either way'', said Barry Schuler, 
president of AOL's interactive services division. U.S. District 
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided -- in the middle of 
Microsoft's antitrust trial -- that the software giant could begin 
gathering evidence about the implications of AOL's recent $9.9 
billion purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. AOL stock rose 2 7/8

	Universal Developing Music Software  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Universal, the world's largest music company,  
is investing in technology for selling and distributing music over 
the Internet, independently of an industry-wide effort. Universal, 
a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of the Seagram Co., said it was 
working with Intertrust Technologies Corp., to develop the 
necessary software. Intertrust's technology, dubbed Digibox, is 
designed to embed a code within recorded music that would prevent 
consumers from listening to it without paying for it. Universal 
decided to move ahead because it wants to be able to sell music 
online by Christmas, said Larry Kenswil, the company's head of 
electronic commerce. Universal stock was unchanged at 25 9/16

inmate was executed by injection Wednesday for killing a fellow 
inmate by setting a deadly blaze after the man had made a vulgar 
comment about his niece 
</P>
<P>
	Robert ``Bonzai Bob'' Wayne Vickers, 41, had spent 20 years on  
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers was sentenced to prison at 18 for grand theft then in  
1979 strangled his cellmate, Frank Ponciano, with a bedsheet 
because he didn't wake him for lunch and because he drank Vickers' 
Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers carved ``Bonzai,'' a misspelling of a Japanese war cry,  
in the victim's back with a sharpened toothbrush, earning him his 
nickname. He received the death penalty, but the verdict was 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death again, this time for killing fellow  
death row inmate Wilmar ``Buster'' Holsinger in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers became enraged after Holsinger made a vulgar remark  
about his niece, and tossed a flaming cup of hair tonic and toilet 
paper into Holsinger's cell, igniting a flash fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In another execution Wednesday, Texas was scheduled to put to  
death a man who beat a woman with a hammer, then strangled her 
during a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Clydell Coleman, 62, would be the oldest person executed in  
Texas since the state resumed carrying out the death penalty in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who worked as a janitor, was condemned for the 1989  
slaying of 87-year-old Leetisha Joe. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial testimony showed Coleman found Ms. Joe at home, Coleman  
covered her head with a blanket, hit her repeatedly with a hammer 
and then strangled her with her own stocking.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rebounded sharply Thursday morning  
as investors returned to the market for the first time this week 
after the string of national holidays. The dollar was higher 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.24 yen in late morning, up 0.66 yen from  
late last Friday in Tokyo but below its level Wednesday of 120.65 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 387.92 points, or 2.32 percent, to  
17,089.45 points at the end of the morning session. On Friday, the 
index lost 240.71 points, or 1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial markets were closed Monday through Wednesday  
as part of the nation's ``Golden Week'' holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Among positive factors supporting the Tokyo stock market were  
renewed hopes for a recovery in Japan's economy following Monday's 
summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi and indications that top officials in Japan's ruling party 
are studying a supplementary budget of spending to stimulate the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also said Tokyo share prices advanced amid reported  
buying from public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Clinton in Washington on Monday, Obuchi said  
he was determined to ensure a successful revitalization of the 
Japanese economy, which remains its worst recession since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling  
Liberal Democratic Party, hinted at a need for putting together a 
supplementary budget by autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 31.21 points, or 2.33 percent, to 1,368.33. 
The TOPIX fell 10.52 points, or 0.78 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
up 69.30 at 10,955.41. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, traders said the U.S. currency's  
weakness from its New York levels on Wednesday came on 
dollar-selling by players to cover their short, or oversold, yen 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 129.22 yen, up from  
126.86 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.370  
percent from 1.420 percent late Friday, pushing its price up to 
103.81 yen from 103.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> 2 Sets of Crosses Erected in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- An Illinois carpenter on Wednesday  
re-erected 13 wooden crosses honoring Columbine High School 
shooting attack victims, but omitted any remembrance of the student 
gunmen who killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But the action by Greg Zanis came a day after a Denver man,  
upset that the crosses were taken down Sunday, set up his own set 
of memorial crosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sets of six-foot crosses stand in a corner of Clement Park  
near an area of the school that has become a makeshift memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither set bears a cross for the two teen-aged gunmen, Eric  
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The pair killed 12 students and 
a teacher before taking their own lives in the April 20 rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the shooting, Zanis built 15 crosses in his  
Aurora, Ill., garage, drove to Littleton and put them on a hill in 
a park overlooking the school. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, Brian Rohrbough, whose son, Daniel, 15, was killed,  
and other relatives destroyed the crosses belonging to the gunmen, 
believing they should not be honored next to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Two smaller, thigh-high crosses were set up in their place.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Zanis returned to Littleton and took all of the  
crosses down, hoping to stem the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided it was too controversial,'' he said. ``I just wanted  
it to end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving about 350 phone calls from Littleton residents,  
Zanis agreed to return the crosses, choosing to install them on a 
corner of the park for better visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in town Wednesday to find that his crosses were  
preceded by those of Will Ambrose, 33, who said he was sad to see 
the original memorials taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver resident built 14 crosses, with one to represent  
Harris and Klebold. He decided not to put up the 14th cross after 
some people rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is still trying to find a fitting way to memorialize  
the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanis only brought 13 crosses with him Wednesday and hopes his  
work is done for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost 10 pounds worrying about the situation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Likely To Free Serb Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPANGDAHLEM AIR BASE, Germany (AP) -- An F-117 stealth fighter  
and two F-16s parked nearby, President Clinton today rallied 
American military personnel entering the seventh week of a NATO air 
assault on Yugoslavia: ``We must stand in Kosovo for the elemental 
principles of the common humanity of every breathing, living person 
in this continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just days after three American POWs were freed, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen, who is traveling here with Clinton, said 
the United States is prepared to release two captured Yugoslav 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect that within a relatively short period of time  
we could see their release'' -- but not as a goodwill gesture to 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Cohen told reporters after 
Clinton's four hours of military briefings at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Gen.  
Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed 
military personnel and their families at this base in southwestern 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Their trip to meet with servicemen and refugees of Kosovo was  
accompanied by the sobering news that the allied campaign in 
Yugoslavia had suffered its first U.S. losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans were killed when their Apache helicopter crashed  
on a training mission in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we grieve with their families and pray for them,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveying the airplane hangar overflowing with members of the  
armed forces dressed in camouflage uniforms, and their children, 
Clinton reiterated that the NATO mission in Kosovo is to defeat 
ethnic hatred and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is hard. I know too many of these pilots are  
flying long hours with too little rest. I know the stress and 
anxiety must be unbearable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But next time you are in a meeting of American service  
personnel, look around at your differences, at your racial 
differences ... the differences of religious faith and thank God 
that you live in a society that honors that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked American personnel for having helped end the war in  
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm sorry you have to do it all over again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	American armed forces are fighting to prevent world war in the  
future, Clinton said. ``If we don't want your successors to have to 
come to this continent and fight another bitter war, then we must 
stand in Kosovo for the elemental principles of the common humanity 
of every breathing, living person in this continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a press briefing after Clinton met with NATO  
Secretary-General Javier Solana and allied commanders, Gen. Wesley 
Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, said warplanes intensified 
strikes on Milosevic's ground forces. Over the past 48 hours, NATO 
hit 10 armored concentrations, 11 artillery sites, three command 
posts and 13 groups of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in Kosovo no longer have the ability to conduct  
``ethnic cleansing,'' Clark said. ``When they're not in hiding, 
they're busy repairing what we damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spangdahlem is home to the 52nd U.S. Air Force Fighter Wing,  
whose F-16s, A-10s and F-117 ``Nighthawk'' stealth fighters are 
flying NATO bombing raids over Yugoslavia. Many of NATO's 
humanitarian refugee operations are run out of Ramstein Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also planned to meet privately with the three U.S. POWs  
freed over the weekend by Milosevic in response to an appeal by the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson. The three -- Spc. Steven Gonzales of Huntsville, 
Texas, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez of Los Angeles and Staff Sgt. 
Christopher Stone of Smiths Creek, Mich. -- had been captured March 
31 while on patrol in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said it would be ``a matter of days'' before he makes a  
formal recommendation to Clinton on releasing the two Yugoslav 
prisoners being held in Germany. He emphasized their release should 
not be seen as any reciprocal goodwill gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Mr. Milosevic has made any goodwill overture  
to us. He acts in accordance with what he thinks would serve his 
interests and no amount of gestures on his part can in any way 
obscure or mask ... the stench of evil that is emanating from the 
killing fields in Kosovo,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's meeting with Solana focused mostly on plans for an  
eventual NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, said White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana also updated Clinton on new assessments -- not yet  
complete -- for a possible deployment of combat ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the United States, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
planned to greet a group of 400 Kosovar refugees who were flying to 
New Jersey. The refugees will live on a temporary basis with host 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was expected to meet in Bonn on Thursday with Russian  
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and then with the foreign ministers of 
the G-8 nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who is weighing how NATO should enforce U.S. and European  
Union embargoes designed to cut off Milosevic's oil supply, said he 
believed the bans could be backed up with force. The French have 
questioned the legality of searching ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that it takes military assets out there to  
enforce it, then that's what we should have,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking point in diplomatic efforts to end the Kosovo  
crisis concerns what kind of peacekeeping force would protect 
returning ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has offered to accept a small U.N. force and insisted  
that some 11,000 Serb troops remain in Kosovo. An estimated 40,000 
soldiers and special police are there now and stand accused of 
brutal ``ethnic cleansing'' of ethnic Albanian civilians. NATO has 
demanded the withdrawal of all Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton rejected Milosevic's suggestion that a peacekeeping  
force exclude NATO countries involved in the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't go back home without the United States and NATO,  
without our allies being involved in it,'' Clinton said in an 
interview granted to NBC aboard Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not after what they've been through.''

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs Grew Wings but Why? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The ancestors of birds may have evolved wings not for flying but  
for running faster, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study might answer a key question about the origin of bird  
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe birds descended from two-legged  
dinosaurs like Velociraptor, featured in ``Jurassic Park.'' The 
problem has been explaining how the clawed dinosaur forelimbs 
developed into the wings of the first known bird, Archaeopteryx, 
which lived 140 million to 150 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these dinosaurs must have had limbs that resembled  
wings, but not enough to allow them to fly. If they couldn't fly 
with them, why have wings? 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologist Luis M. Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of  
Los Angeles County and aerodynamic engineer Phillip Burger of the 
San Diego Natural History Museum think they have found the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe the crow-sized Archaeopteryx took off from the  
ground. But it appeared too weak to launch itself from a standing 
start, as most modern birds can, and too slow to gain lift from 
just running. 
</P>
<P>
	So how did it get into the air? In Thursday's issue of the  
journal Nature, Chiappe and Burger calculate that Archaeopteryx 
could almost quadruple its running speed with thrust from flapping 
its wings. 
</P>
<P>
	They estimate that with a runway of 10 to 15 yards, it could  
achieve the 18 mph takeoff speed in about three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Flightless ancestors of Archaeopteryx could have used  
rudimentary wings to speed up when chasing prey or escaping 
predators, Chiappe said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the theory does not fly with paleo-ornithologist Larry  
Martin of the University of Kansas at Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could increase your ground speed by flapping your  
wings, then I suppose birds that run on the ground would do this. 
As far as I know, there is no modern bird that flaps its wings to 
increase its ground speed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up on a farm. I've chased chickens. I know that when  
they get their wings out, it's about when they're ready to fall -- 
they use it as balance. But I've never seen one flap its wings with 
the idea of increasing its speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiappe disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to a chicken farm and chase a chicken very closely,  
the chicken will start flapping its wings and it will run faster,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and some other scientists favor the idea that  
Archaeopteryx and its immediate ancestors lived in trees and 
started flying by jumping off branches. The wings of its 
predecessors, if not good enough for flying, could have helped in 
gliding.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Revives Okla. Bomb Memories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When Paul Heath heard the tornado warnings,  
he drove to an unlikely spot for safety -- the building where he had 
survived a terrorist bombing four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With his wife, Willetta, in tow, he drove their 1986 blue  
Chrysler into the underground garage at the Alfred P. Murrah 
federal building. 
</P>
<P>
	There the couple huddled together, sitting out the deadly storm  
in the makeshift concrete bunker that had remained intact after the 
1995 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt safe there,'' Heath, a Veterans Administration  
psychologist and vice president of a bomb survivors' group, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Heath, the monstrous twisters that churned through Oklahoma  
revived horrifying memories of the bomb that killed 168 people in 
the Murrah building. 
</P>
<P>
	After the blast that April day, the fifth floor of his office  
broke away from him, but he managed to escape and return to guide 
others out of the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You revisit all the unresolved grief,'' the 62-year-old Heath  
said, referring to the tornado. ``I was teary-eyed. I had several 
waves of grief come over me ... that I haven't had in a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heath's home wasn't damaged, though he is now helping his older  
brother, whose house and possessions were destroyed. A condominium 
owned by his son also was leveled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday evening, when a tornado roared through the southern  
edge of this city and its suburbs, killing 38 people, Heath stayed 
up almost all night checking on others who made it out with him the 
day of the terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are lost and hurt, property has been damaged, just like  
the Murrah building,'' he said. ``I attended over 50 funerals. I 
probably won't be going to any funerals for these people, but my 
heart still feels compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a big difference between terrorism and a natural  
disaster, but Heath said there's a common bond between both groups 
of survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people felt every ounce of fear and emotion that I  
had,'' he said. ``They felt like they were going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heath has already noticed similar responses in the aftermath to  
the twisters. One man whose home was flattened by the tornado was 
in a store with him Tuesday, and had trouble finding his keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Heath helped him, understanding his anxiety: He had lost his  
keys 13 times after the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heath also said bomb survivors rebounded, and so, too, will  
the people who are in despair after losing so much in just a few 
moments of nature's fury. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people have more strength and resilience than they  
know,'' he said. ``And for sure, they will discover it. They'll 
say, `I'm alive, my family's alive and so are my neighbors.' And 
that's what's important.''

<HEADLINE> Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When John and Sheryl Molsbee were allowed  
back to their brick-and-frame home Wednesday, the roof was gone but 
Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't  
home when extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and 
killed 38 people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes 
in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you it was,'' said his wife, who hid with their  
19-year-old daughter, Kristy, under a blue flowered mattress in the 
master bedroom, then helped pull injured people from the wreckage 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Molsbees were among hundreds of people left homeless by the  
tornadoes who were allowed to return Wednesday to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters were made available throughout the area for short-term  
housing, while officials made long-term arrangements for the 
suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the  
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster 
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance 
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to 
rent travel trailers to put on their property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross also passed out vouchers for people to  
stay in motels until other provisions could be made. Churches 
distributed food and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucky Kilbourne, who was running a shelter at the Midwest City  
Community Center, said 220 people took refuge there Monday night, 
but the number had dwindled to 60 by Wednesday. He said hearing the 
stories of the displaced was almost more than he could bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they hold dear, things they need -- from medicine to  
books to personal belongings -- all gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said nearly 700 people were injured in the deadliest  
tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The damage estimate has been 
placed at more than $225 million. At least 1,500 businesses and 
homes in Kansas also were destroyed or heavily damaged in Monday's 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has authorized emergency disaster declarations  
for Oklahoma and Kansas, paving the way for federal emergency funds 
for home and business owners. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency had 300 staff members on hand to assist victims and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
formed grim processions as those lucky enough to have survived 
passed through police and National Guard checkpoints to view what 
was left of their homes before curfews resumed at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Oakcrest Church of Christ, Jean Clemence of Moore was  
walking around in a daze as her children gathered canned goods and 
other non-perishables from a food pantry hastily set up in a Sunday 
school class. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her boyfriend had ordered a storm cellar back in  
November, but the man who was supposed to install it dug the hole 
and just left it. Ms. Clemence said she had asked for the down 
payment back, and the man promised to come back Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's six months too late,'' she said. ``We're going to get our  
money back, I don't care. I think he owes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Molsbees' neighborhood, Shirley and Bennie Johnson's  
house was serving as a restroom retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got running water. If you've got to go, then come on  
in,'' Mrs. Johnson said. The house escaped with just shattered 
windows and cracked sheet rock. The 21 pictures of Southwestern art 
still hung in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson held up real estate fliers on the kitchen counter.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had this house for sale. A couple even checked it out  
Monday afternoon,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``Now, it's real cheap.''

<HEADLINE> Trial Date Set for Rodman Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman will go on trial Sept. 22 in a  
civil lawsuit filed by a cocktail waitress who accuses the former 
basketball star of groping her at a Sunset Strip hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Patterson sued Rodman in November 1998, alleging he groped  
her a month before at The Argyle Hotel, said her attorney, Gloria 
Allred. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball player's spokesman did not immediately return a  
phone call about the suit, nor did Rodman's attorney, Marty Singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was with the Chicago Bulls at the time. He was waived  
from the Los Angeles Lakers last month.

<HEADLINE> Back With His True Love: Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLE ROYALE, Mich. (AP) -- Les Mattson became a fisherman when he  
was only eight, joining his dad in seeking Lake Superior trout and 
herring. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, he still treasured that life, even after the  
government told him to hang up his nets. Overharvesting and the sea 
lamprey, an eel-like creature that sucks the insides out of fish, 
had taken their toll. The Great Lakes commercial fishing industry 
dried up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were telling us, `You're gonna starve doing this, it'll  
never bounce back like it was,''' Mattson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	For three decades he earned his keep in construction. But  
fishing remained his long-lost love. Finally they were reunited -- 
and the romance continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattson runs the Edisen Fishery, a demonstration project at Isle  
Royale National Park. For more than 80 years it was a small, family 
fishing operation, the kind that once was commonplace along the big 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He was intrigued when park officials approached him about the  
job seven years ago, but there was a catch: He'd have to conduct 
regular tours of the buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fisherman, a construction worker, but a lecturer? Not  
me. I didn't figure I could ever talk to groups,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But he'd be fishing for a living again, at last! It was an offer  
he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at 72, he considers himself a fair-to-middling tour guide.  
Better yet, he and wife Donna still arise several days a week at 
dawn and load their gear into the small boat. They coax the motor 
to life and rumble across the placid channel to open Superior 
waters, where they let down the nets -- a ritual that long ago 
became second nature to them, yet never grows old. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd go on forever, if they'd let us,'' says 64-year-old Mrs.  
Mattson. ``When a fisherman gets it in his blood, there's no 
getting it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Les Mattson is short and slender, with a graying mustache and  
short, thinning hair. His face is lined and weathered, but his 
lively blue eyes twinkle merrily as he chuckles at one of Donna's 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been married 45 years. One obvious reason for the  
longevity of their marriage: a shared passion for fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a partner,'' Mattson says, nodding across the kitchen  
table at his wife as she rolls a cigarette. ``In this business, 
you've got to have one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both were raised near Munising, on Superior's southern shore.  
Mattson's father immigrated from Finland around 1915. His mother, 
also Finnish and Laplander, detested the seafaring life, fearing 
for the safety of her husband and sons. 
</P>
<P>
	With good reason. Commercial fishing could be dangerous. At  
times when they were miles from land, sudden gales kicked up waves 
that turned the big lake into a watery roller coaster. Mattson 
recalls crashing at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm once forced him, his father and his brothers to take  
refuge for three days on the Laughing Whitefish River, a dozen 
miles from home. They had neither radio nor food, and subsisted on 
wild blueberries. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was never lucrative. ``I don't think any fisherman I  
ever knew drove a Cadillac,'' Mattson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they got by -- even during the Depression, when his father  
was more likely to swap his catch for butter or bear meat than 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mattson, like most other commercial fishermen, couldn't  
overcome the steep drop in lake trout and whitefish populations in 
the 1950s and later. He was still a young man when the state 
Department of Natural Resources shut down most of the Great Lakes 
fishery in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife continued sending in the annual fee to keep  
their license current, just in case things changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even kept the boat for years, and all the gear went bad. It  
finally rotted away; I never got a penny for it. I really had hopes 
they would bring the fishing back, but they never did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it appeared time would pass him by, opportunity  
knocked. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1890s, two Scandinavian immigrants had built a small  
fishery near Moskey Basin on the eastern side of Isle Royale, which 
would not become a national park for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Edisen family ran the operation until the  
mid-1970s. After they abandoned it, the National Park Service 
gained jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials asked Mattson, who was doing restoration work on the  
nearby Rock Harbor Lighthouse, to live temporarily at the fishery 
as caretaker. He and his wife stayed there off and on through the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	When park managers decided to restore and operate the fishery as  
a living history exhibit, Mattson was the natural choice for 
fisherman-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the longest running commercial enterprise out here since  
lumbering and mining went bust and the old private resorts went 
belly up,'' says Liz Valencia, the park official who supervises the 
fishery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted people to see a real fisherman catching real fish  
and processing them, with guts on the table and scales on the 
floor. We also needed someone who could maintain the buildings, and 
Les does that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, the Mattsons spend part of the year in a cabin at the  
fishery and the rest at their house in the Upper Peninsula town of 
Houghton. Three of their four children live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattson is clearly in his element as he escorts a visitor around  
the fishery grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kiddies like this,'' he says, raising a trap door in the  
floor of the dockside fish processing house. Below, a large lake 
trout thrashes about in a holding tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging, musty structure's log walls are lined with fishhooks  
and coils of rope. The floor is littered with old boat motors, 
washtubs and lots of fish scales. Nets and oars hang from the 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside lies a ramshackle 18-foot fishing boat. Mattson is  
fixing it up in his spare time, when he isn't repairing nets or 
doing other chores -- such as fishing. Always the fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	How long will they keep going? The Mattsons don't know, but say  
when they stop it will be for health reasons. They'll never get 
bored with the life they waited for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, especially when we go out in the early morning,  
and it'll be real calm and the sun's just coming up, and you can 
see the net way down in the water and the fish coming,'' Mrs. 
Mattson says. ``If I get excited about it, I can imagine how he 
feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She winks at her husband.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Mattson says. ``It does make me feel really at home.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Amy Fisher Granted Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A parole board has voted to release Amy  
Fisher after nearly seven years in prison for shooting her lover's 
wife in the face, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A state official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  
Wednesday that a three-member panel voted 2-1 to release Ms. 
Fisher. She is expected to be freed sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, 24, was interviewed by the panel Tuesday at Albion  
Correctional Facility in western New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Division of Parole spokesman Tom Grant had said the panel's  
decision was expected Thursday. He would not comment on the parole 
report, but added that Ms. Fisher would be notified of the panel's 
decision on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher was 16 when she shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the head  
at her home on New York's Long Island in 1992. Nicknamed the ``Long 
Island Lolita,'' Ms. Fisher was sentenced to 5 to 15-years in 
prison for first-degree assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge last month agreed to give her a shorter prison sentence,  
making her eligible for release. During a court appearance, Ms. 
Fisher took responsibility for the shooting and apologized to Mrs. 
Buttafuoco. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to you -- it wasn't your husband's fault ... it  
wasn't my father's fault. It was my fault and I'm sorry,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Buttafuoco, whose husband, Joey, served six months in jail  
for statutory rape after the affair, said her faith in God allowed 
her to forgive the woman who seriously wounded her. The two 
corresponded for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles, where Joey Buttafuoco  
has been a cable television talk show host.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Clayton Out 4 to 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Texas Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton is expected  
to be sidelined 4-6 weeks after an MRI revealed a torn muscle 
behind his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton, acquired July 31 from St. Louis in five-player deal,  
was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a strained 
muscle behind his right shoulder. An MRI by team physician Dr. John 
Conway on Tuesday revealed the tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional tests will be performed Thursday to find out exactly  
which muscle is torn, the team said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton, hitting just .150 before being placed on the DL, was in  
a 5-for-59 drought before being sidelined. In 52 games with Texas 
last season, he hit .285 with five home runs and 24 RBIs, but had 
just two hits in nine at-bats in three postseason games against the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Dransfeldt, recalled from Oklahoma City on Saturday, is  
expected to see most of the action at shortstop in Clayton's 
absence. He's started all four games since joining the team.

<HEADLINE> AP Photographer Weathers Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- I drove into the heart of the storm, my  
police scanner screaming, the radio broadcasting warnings of the 
approaching storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The sky turned midnight dark and hail pounded the roof of my  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rain stopped and there was no more hail. Just quiet. An  
eerie quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, debris flew and I saw it -- the funnel cloud, a  
quarter- to a half-mile away, straddling the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	I have chased tornadoes for a quarter-century, but this was the  
first I had seen on the ground. I stood there, a half-mile away, 
shooting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	I got back in my car and began driving. I stopped and shot more  
pictures. By now, it was so close I had to use a wide-angle lens. 
</P>
<P>
	I drove, I stopped, I shot. And then I realized the storm was so  
close I had no place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	I got out of my truck at an overpass and spotted a woman  
standing beside her van. I yelled at her to get against the pillars 
supporting the overpass. She ran to the side of her van for her two 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	I helped her get one girl out of the car seat, then I pushed and  
shoved them to the pillar and put my back to the storm. I stopped 
shooting when the funnel was maybe 150 feet away. By then, I could 
no longer stand. 
</P>
<P>
	I was hit by flying debris. I felt one of my two pagers slide  
out of its holder and bang against me. The pager went up in the 
tornado and vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	I hugged the little girls and the woman and kept telling it  
would be OK and to keep their faces down and not to look up. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was gone. The funnel crossed the expressway and we were  
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as I could stand, I began taking pictures again. The  
wind was still strong. The funnel cloud was less than 50 yards 
away. The wind was howling and I could barely stand, but the storm 
was moving away. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman asked if it was safe to continue on to Lawton, and I  
said it seemed OK. 
</P>
<P>
	In all the confusion, I forgot one basic rule of journalism.  
</P>
<P>
	I never got her name.

<HEADLINE> Dioxin Exposure Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer mortality increased by 60 percent for  
chemical workers who were exposed to high levels of dioxin, but 
levels of the chemical typically found in the environment appear to 
present no increased cancer risk, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In research published today in the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute, an analysis of the health records of workers 
exposed to various levels of dioxin showed that only those at the 
highest exposures had statistically significant increases in cancer 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Steenland, co-author of the study, said the research  
suggests most people typically are not currently exposed to 
dangerous levels of dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a significant increase in cancers until you get  
to the upper'' exposure levels, Steenland said Tuesday in a 
telephone interview. ``This is not raising a red flag by saying 
that low level exposure is causing a lot of cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the finding ``reassuring'' from a public health  
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland, a researcher with the National Institute for  
Occupational Safety and Health, said that the amount of dioxin in 
the environment is steadily declining because the products most 
commonly linked to the chemical are no longer being made. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin was a byproduct in the manufacture of herbicides and  
pesticides that were in common use decades ago. Production of the 
chemicals halted in the mid 1980s, and the environmental 
contamination has dropped steadily since. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for those who experienced high exposures, the chemical  
can persist in the body for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is one of the chemicals in Agent Orange, the herbicide  
used by the United States to kill jungle vegetation during the 
Vietnam War. Hundreds of American troops were exposed to the 
chemical, but not at the high levels experienced by many chemical 
plant workers, said Steenland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert N. Hoover, of the National Cancer Institute, said  
that the study by Steenland and his colleagues is ``a critical 
piece of evidence'' that shows dioxin, at its present levels in the 
environment, appears to present no significant threat to general 
public health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news from this study is the evidence that dioxin at  
high exposures is a'' cancer-causing chemical, said Hoover. ``The 
good news is that the low levels of exposure (now in the 
environment) are not likely to contribute much disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Steenland examined the health record of some 3,500  
chemical workers who were exposed to dioxin on the job during the 
1960s, '70s and '80s for periods of six months to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among workers with the highest exposure rate there was a 60  
percent increase in cancer deaths when compared to the rate of 
cancer deaths among the general public. This increase, said 
Steenland, was seen only in those workers whose dioxin exposure was 
100 to 1,000 times higher than the background exposure of the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said that dioxin seemed to cause all types of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	``The cancer elevation is not in some specific organ,'' he said.  
``We saw it in respiratory tract cancers and in digestive tract 
cancer. It was across the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland said the public health threat of dioxin is declining  
because nobody is regularly exposed to the high levels that once 
were common among chemical plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dioxin is not being added to the environment at anywhere near  
the rate it once was,'' he said. ``It is still produced by 
incinerators when they burn plastics, but it is becoming less and 
less.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotoes Stumped in 1st Round Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- With access restricted to one road by a  
freeway-construction project, the Phoenix Coyotes' headquarters 
resembles a mountainside bastion tucked into the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting seemed appropriate Wednesday, considering the  
potential ramifications of the Coyotes' latest playoff disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes failed to get past the first round for the eighth  
consecutive time and blew a 3-1 lead for the third time in 10 years 
when St. Louis beat them 1-0 in overtime the previous night. It was 
a loss that could bring far-reaching changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Schoenfeld said before Game 7 that his job depended on  
finishing off the Blues. General manager Bobby Smith likes 
Schoenfeld, whose team earned home-ice advantage with 90 points -- 
second-best in the history of the Winnipeg-Phoenix franchise. Owner 
Richard Burke doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	If Burke decides Schoenfeld must go, Smith might be next. The  
40-year-old executive began his playing career in Minnesota, still 
owns a home there and is considered a frontrunner to direct 
operations of the expansion Minnesota Wild. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate unrest will continue until May 18, when Scottsdale  
residents vote on using tax money to help build a 20,000-seat arena 
as part of a mall-redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke has received a death threat over the project, but  
continues to insist it has general support. He also makes no bones 
about his refusal to stay in the America West Arena in Phoenix, 
where balconies obstruct the view of more than 4,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite $25 million in operating losses in the three years  
since the team moved from Winnipeg to Phoenix, president Shawn 
Hunter believes the Coyotes are solid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great nucleus of the entire organization,'' Hunter  
said. ``Bobby makes the on-ice decisions, but I see a very good 
season to build from, and we have a lot to look forward to on and 
off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about our election in two weeks. Obviously, a new  
arena would take our franchise and hockey in the valley to a new 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes pulled out all the stops to stay alive in the  
postseason, even allowing center Jeremy Roenick to play the final 
game only weeks after he had his broken jaw rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, who led the Coyotes in assists (48) and points (72)  
during the season, played 38 shifts and had two shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see what they've battled through, with as many injuries  
riding against them, with how hard they've fought, I wanted to go 
down with them if they lost,'' he said about his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Keith Tkachuk led the Coyotes in goal-scoring (36) for  
the fourth straight season, but had one goal in the series. Rick 
Tocchet, who scored six goals against Detroit last spring, had none 
this time.

<P>
	Robert Reichel, obtained in a March 20 trade, had seven of his  
26 goals in 13 regular-season games with Phoenix, but scored only 
one in the playoffs and was booed for his soft style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-scoring Dallas Drake had four playoff goals, and Shane Doan  
and defenseman Teppo Numminen had two. So did journeyman Louie 
DeBrusk, who was a healthy scratch for the last game after Roenick 
came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Consistency is certain to be among the considerations in player  
decisions, and salaries will figure in if the arena project is 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Even players like Roenick, who will make $4 million next season,  
and Tkachuk, who is due to get $12 million over the next two, could 
be on the block -- something that seemed unthinkable when the 
Coyotes started 17-3-3 and went 17 straight games without allowing 
more than two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phoenix lost 11 of 13 games during one skid and finished  
39-31-12, barely holding onto fourth place in the Western 
Conference. Their three-game skid out of the playoffs was the 
second in two seasons with Schoenfeld at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might be a scapegoat, and it's usually the coach, but I  
sure hope not,'' Tkachuk said.

<HEADLINE> Three U.S. Violinists Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three American violinists have been named  
winners of the Avery Fisher Prize, the first women honored in the 
prize's 25-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Chang, Pamela Frank and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg were to  
be honored tonight at Avery Fisher Hall, with each to receive a 
$50,000 cash award. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of female recipients had become an issue, said  
Deborah Borda, executive director of the New York Philharmonic and 
a member of the Avery Fisher Artist Program since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times we tried to select a woman, or someone on the  
committee would push for a particular woman artist,'' said Borda. 
``But it didn't fly for whatever reasons with the full committee. 
And in making selections, excellence always comes first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chang, 18, has best-selling recordings and has been a  
soloist with orchestras around the world. Ms. Frank, 31, has a 
burgeoning solo career, and Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg, 38, has become 
known for dramatic performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous winners include cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Lynn Harrell;  
pianists Garrick Ohlsson, Murray Perahia, Richard Goode, Horacio 
Gutierrez, Andre Watts and Yefim Bronfman; violinist Elmar 
Oliveira; and clarinetist Richard Stoltzman.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes Mass Transit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore went to the heart of the  
nation's automobile industry to outline his ideas for relieving 
traffic congestion and improving living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed $6 billion to help communities develop  
alternatives to building more roads during his keynote address 
Tuesday at the National Town Hall Meeting on Sustainable America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need better and smarter mass transportation,'' Gore said.  
</P>
<P>
	Passenger vehicles and trucks should also be required to meet  
tough pollution standards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliance on the automobile is a national trend. Only 5.1 percent  
of commuters across the country use public transit, according to a 
National Public Transportation Survey. In Detroit, only 2 percent 
use public transportation to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech to nearly 3,000 local politicians and community  
activists, Gore also promoted $700 million in new tax credits for 
state and local bonds to build more livable communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Better America Bonds'' would preserve open spaces, build  
parks, improve water quality, and redevelop old, toxic industrial 
sites known as brownfields.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Wreckage Spews Guns Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Amid the ruins of Carlos Porcadas' home lay  
a lever-action .30-.30 caliber hunting rifle in a padded camouflage 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not mine,'' said the postal carrier, whose two  
daughters played nearby under his wife's supervision. ``I don't 
even hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gun, he said, literally fell from the sky.  
</P>
<P>
	Police in communities along the path of the tornado are finding  
numerous guns in the debris left after Monday's devastating 
twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	That guns were present in many of the houses destroyed is not  
unusual in Oklahoma, which has an estimated 1.1 million gun owners 
and issued 286,117 hunting licenses last year. But so many guns 
lying around in the open, available to just about anyone, is both 
unusual and reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday morning, Oklahoma City police had taken possession  
of 41 guns that had been found by searchers looking for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find them we secure them,'' Capt. Charles Allen said.  
``We have a moral responsibility to secure those so that they don't 
fall into the wrong hands or somebody trip on them or pick one up 
and it go off accidentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said police will work with residents to try to return lost  
guns to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Del City police Sgt. Jody Suit said officers in that suburb have  
turned in 18 firearms so far, including pistols, shotguns and 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who refused to give his name pestered Del City police  
about checking on his house, which was in an area closed to the 
public for safety reasons, until an officer agreed to escort him to 
the site Tuesday. Once there, the first thing he looked for was his 
Ruger handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a real good pistol,'' he told an officer. ``I wouldn't  
want it to fall in the wrong hands.''

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has recalled 57,200 of its  
1999 Expeditions and Navigators because of a problem that could 
cause the wheels to fall off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of one accident with two minor injuries,'' Ford  
spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall of the two sport utility vehicles affects models with  
optional 17-inch chrome-finished steel wheels. Ford said some 
wheels might not have enough contact with the hub, which could 
cause vibration or result in the wheel and tire falling off. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers will tighten the wheels and install a label with  
tightening instructions on each wheel at no expense to owners.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Helps Cut Bladder Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Drink more water -- and anything else, for that matter -- and you  
can lower your risk of bladder cancer, researchers reported today 
in the New England Journal of Medicine 
</P>
<P>
	American men who drank at least 11 8-ounce glasses a day of all  
liquids cut their risk of two common types of bladder cancer in 
half, compared with men who drank five glasses or less, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Water had an independent protective effect. Men who drank at  
least six glasses of water a day cut their risk of bladder cancer 
in half compared with men who had less than one glass, regardless 
of how much they drank in total liquids. 
</P>
<P>
	Bladder cancer strikes an estimated 310,000 people worldwide  
each year and is the fourth most common cancer among American men. 
Smokers are more susceptible than non-smokers, and it afflicts four 
times as many men as women -- possibly because few women smoked 
until recently, and the lag time from when a person starts to smoke 
to when the cancer shows up can be 40 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is the first to demonstrate a clear link between  
increased liquid intake and decreased bladder cancer of the two 
types most commonly found in developed countries: papillary and 
flat transitional cell carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at a third type, squamous cell carcinoma,  
which usually is associated with schistosomiasis, a water-borne 
parasitic disease common in Africa and parts of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain why drinking more liquids helps prevent the  
transitional cell cancers. But some researchers believe the bladder 
lining suffers less exposure to cancer-causing substances in urine 
when the urine is diluted and urination is more frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking greatly increases the quantity of carcinogens in urine,  
and this study, like previous research, found that the risk of 
bladder cancer was nearly four times higher among heavy smokers 
than it was among non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Quitting smoking is the best way to cut your cancer risk,  
according to the study's lead author, Dominique Michaud, a research 
fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. But smokers who 
can't or won't quit can still cut their cancer risk substantially 
by drinking more, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the eating, drinking, exercise and smoking  
habits of 47,909 American men from 1986 to early 1996. A similar 
large-scale study of women does not include enough cases of bladder 
cancer yet to yield statistically significant results, Michaud 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's study, 252 developed bladder cancer. The risk  
increased with age and was higher in the Northeast than in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides water, none of the other beverages had an independent  
beneficial or harmful effect. Although previous, smaller studies 
had suggested drinking large quantities of coffee or alcohol might 
be harmful, this study found no increased bladder cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jones, director of the University of Southern California's  
Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an accompanying 
editorial that the study was not sensitive enough to answer 
questions about whether water quality -- especially chlorination -- 
play a role in cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of what you drink may ... be as important as how  
much (or little) you imbibe,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's no rest for the St. Louis Blues.  
</P>
<P>
	Fresh off their seventh-game overtime victory over Phoenix on  
Tuesday night, the Blues now face the Dallas Stars in the second 
round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, beginning tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to find a way to slow them down and try to win a  
tight game like we did against Phoenix,'' Blues coach Joel 
Quenneville said. ``Dallas is well rested and will have a lot of 
energy in the first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have been waiting to play since completing a four-game  
sweep of the Edmonton Oilers on April 27. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock 
nevertheless expects a tough series in the Western Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. Louis has given us fits for three years,'' Hitchcock said.  
``We've struggled against them and they may be the toughest team 
for us to play. They play a very strong, tight team game. They're 
quick and they've been able to break down our forechecking patterns 
with good puck movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In tonight's other playoff matchup, Buffalo visits Boston in the  
Eastern Conference. The playoffs continue on Friday with Pittsburgh 
at Toronto in the East and Detroit at Colorado in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' victory over Phoenix was one of four series in which  
lower-seeded teams won first-round matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	The stunner was Pittsburgh's seven-game series triumph over New  
Jersey, capped by Tuesday night's 4-2 victory at East Rutherford. 
The Devils had the best record in the East and the Penguins were 
the eighth-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-seeded Sabres also pulled off a surprise by sweeping  
the second-seeded Ottawa Senators. Sixth-seeded Boston defeated No. 
3 Carolina in six games, although that was not as surprising. The 
Hurricanes were seeded higher because of winning the Southeast 
Division, but Boston had five more wins and five more points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars won their first-round series without any goal  
production from Brett Hull. He was one of the key members of a team 
that won the Presidents' Trophy with the best record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know that the goals are going to come,'' Hull said.  
``Still, it's been a little frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo won the season series from Boston, 4-1-0, but Sabres  
goalie Dominik Hasek doesn't think it will give his team an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play at least as well as we did against Ottawa,  
maybe even better, because we're facing a better team now,'' Hasek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins and Sabres each finished with 91 points, but Boston  
got the sixth seed because the Bruins had two more wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the regular season tended to determine anything in the  
postseason,'' Bruins coach Lindy Ruff said, ``Ottawa and New Jersey 
would be in the playoffs right now.''

<HEADLINE> Parma Wins Italian Cup in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- Parma won its second Italian Cup in the  
1990s, tying Fiorentina 2-2 Wednesday night to win the 
home-and-home final on the away-goals rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams, who also tied in the opener, finished 3-3 in the  
total-goals series. Parma, which won its first Italian Cup in 1992, 
won the title 2-1 on away goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Parma, fourth in the Italian League with three games remaining,  
plays Olympique Marseille in the UEFA Cup final May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernan Crespo's 27th goal of the season put Parma ahead in the  
43rd minute, but goals by Tomas Repka and Sandro Cois in a 
14-minute span gave Fiorentina a 2-1 lead in the 62nd. Paolo Vanoli 
tied it, scoring off a pass from Enrico Chiesa with 19 minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard-fought victory, achieved on Fiorentina's home  
field,'' Crespo said. ``I think we deserved the Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy: Knicks Won't Tank Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Even though the Knicks might be better off  
losing to the Heat tonight, coach Jeff Van Gundy insists his team 
will try to beat Miami -- even if it leads to a first-round matchup 
with Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming to play to win tonight,'' Van Gundy said after  
his team went through a morning shootaround. ``I've learned that 
whenever you try to manipulate, you always get your head handed to 
you for that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans and the league deserve teams that go out there and  
try to win, and that's what we're going to try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Knicks beat Miami and Detroit defeats Philadelphia, New  
York would move up to the seventh seed and face the Pacers in the 
first round. Indiana went 2-1 against the Knicks this season, 
winning two of the games decisively. If New York loses tonight, it 
would play Miami in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't match up well with Indiana and their big guys. We  
match up better with Orlando or Miami,'' Knicks forward Larry 
Johnson said Monday night after the team qualified for the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks went 1-2 against the Heat in their first three games,  
winning 10 days ago by coming back from a 20-point, second-half 
deficit in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	New York eliminated Miami in the first round of the playoffs  
last season, and their confidence seems to soar against their 
fiercest rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never better off losing than winning, and we're not as  
interested in who we play as how we're playing,'' said Van Gundy, 
who disclosed that Patrick Ewing and Chris Childs will sit out 
because of injuries. ``But if they were healthy, they're playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat coach Pat Riley could choose to rest some of his regulars,  
particularly Alonzo Mourning, who was kneed in the hip Tuesday 
night against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA vice president of operations Rod Thorn said the league  
expects both teams to use all their healthy players. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing with the eighth seed, the Knicks also would avoid a  
possible second-round matchup with Indiana, the team that 
eliminated them from the postseason last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Van Gundy said he would never tell his team to lose.  
</P>
<P>
	``Under no circumstances, none,'' he said. ``The game of  
basketball is more important than any one team's predicament. That 
doesn't mean you don't rest guys, because to me that's not tanking. 
Tanking is not putting forth your best effort to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were a 1- to 1 1/2-point favorite in Las Vegas, and  
Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Hilton said they would not take 
the game off the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought about scratching the game, but it's a national  
television game and people like to bet games on TV,'' said Scott 
Kaminski of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets betting lines 
for the casinos. ``I don't think the game is a problem. I still 
think they'll play to uphold the integrity of the game and the 
integrity of themselves.''

<HEADLINE> New 'Sacagawea' Dollar Coin Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First Lady Hillary Clinton unveiled the  
nation's newest coin at a White House ceremony Tuesday -- a 
gold-colored one dollar piece bearing the image of the Shoshone 
Indian Sacagawea. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coin will replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin,  
which went into circulation in 1979. The U.S. Mint expects the 
Sacagawea coin to be in circulation by early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The coin honors the young woman and teen-age mother who  
accompanied explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to the 
Pacific Ocean in 1805. At the unveiling were leaders of various 
American Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This coin is an excellent way to honor one Indian woman -- and  
all Native Americans,'' said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the choice of Sacagawea was a fitting tribute  
to the heritage and contribution of American Indian women to U.S. 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacagawea played an unforgettable role in the history of our  
nation,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``Every day this coin will remind us 
we are a nation of many cultures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the new coin, Sacagawea looks over her shoulder directly at  
the observer. Every other coin in use -- the penny with Abraham 
Lincoln, the nickel with Thomas Jefferson, the dime with Franklin 
Roosevelt and the quarter with George Washington -- shows the 
subject in profile. 
</P>
<P>
	In another departure from tradition, her infant son, Jean  
Baptiste, sleeps on her back. It is the first depiction of a child 
on a circulating U.S. coin. 
</P>
<P>
	The coin itself will be gold-colored and will have smooth edges  
in order for it to be easily distinguished from the similarly sized 
quarter. Its metallic composition has not been decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenna Goodacre, the Santa Fe, N.M., artist and sculptor who  
designed the image of the young Sacagawea, is also well-known for 
her design of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	------

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Introduces Boxing Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Boxing judges will now have to make financial  
and personal disclosures for fights in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, judges must be sanctioned by the state,  
and judges who live or are licensed in other jurisdictions must 
submit a sworn application and make other disclosures as well. 
</P>
<P>
	They include a credit check, notification of pending litigation  
-- such as bankruptcy or criminal proceedings -- and financial ties 
to the boxers, promoter, venue or television company. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves, which apply only to New York, were announced  
Wednesday by Gov. George Pataki and New York Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden, site of the March 13 
draw in which most observers believe Lennox Lewis beat Evander 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the boxers that got KO'ed, it was the fans,'' Pataki  
said. ``My personal opinion is the decision is indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a Senate committee approved a bill on Wednesday  
aimed at reforming the business side of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muhammad Ali Reform Act now goes before the full Senate,  
which passed a virtually identical version last year by voice vote. 
The House, however, did not take up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ali Act would protect boxers from exploitation by promoters  
and managers. It would require specific guidelines for contracts 
and disclosure of the financial dealings surrounding big fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki directed the New York State Athletic Commission, chaired  
by Mel Southard, to work with federal legislators to get the Ali 
Act passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two changes are to be implemented immediately by the New York  
Commission -- the selection of championship fight judges and tougher 
standards for becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Each sanctioning body with an interest in a title fight must  
submit three candidates for a judge, instead of one. The commission 
will select one from each set of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	It can reject the nominations and select a judge without further  
nomination. If only two sanctioning bodies are involved, the 
commission will select at least one independent judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges will need to pass written and oral examinations and  
attend a mandatory annual seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, today the public sees boxing's credibility on par with  
that of professional wrestling,'' Spitzer said. ``In short, the 
sweet science has turned sour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Manhattan grand jury is looking into the Lewis-Holyfield  
decision. Meanwhile, a lucrative rematch is in the works for Nov. 6 
or 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like it to take place in New York State,'' Pataki said.  
``If it does, it's going to be under these new rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pursuing the rematch,'' said Ken Munoz, executive vice  
president of the Garden. ``Frankly, it's somewhat difficult. 
(Promoter Don) King has a lot of offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas is being prominently mentioned as the site of a  
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	The following reforms for title fights also will be recommended  
to the Association of Boxing Commissioners at its annual meeting in 
July at Baltimore: 
</P>
<P>
	--A referee would be required to judge the fight, and his card  
would be considered if the decision is a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	--Each of the three judges' scorecards would be compared on a  
round-by-round basis, and after each round a consensus would be 
reached by rejecting the decision of the judge in the minority.

<HEADLINE> Callaway, Spalding Settle Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Callaway Golf, which sued Spalding  
Sports for promoting a golf ball as getting the best performance 
with Big Bertha clubs, announced Wednesday that the case has been 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	A Callaway spokesman said terms had to remain confidential under  
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the settlement corrects the problem that we  
perceived and appropriately protects our company, our customers and 
our shareholders,'' founder and chairman Ely Callaway said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in early 1998 and scheduled for trial in  
October, claimed that Spalding had misused Callaway trademarks and 
brand reputations with its Top Flite System C ball. Callaway 
accused Spalding of misleading the public into believing the ball 
would perform better with the Callaway clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spalding also marketed a System T ball that it said would work  
best with Taylor Made metal woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Without admitting wrongdoing, Spalding agreed to phase out the  
ball, along with the advertising and promotional material. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spalding is now focused upon its worldwide golf ball brands --  
Top Flite and Strata -- and sees no need to pursue some of the past 
decisions that may have diluted attention given to those brands,'' 
Spalding chairman Edwin L. Artzt said. ``We are happy to put this 
and other distractoins behind us.''

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Sued for `Nazi Nursery' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Lawyers claiming to represent Russian and  
Polish slave laborers during World War II filed a class-action 
lawsuit Wednesday against German automaker Volkswagen, seeking 
reparations for the deaths of up to 400 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says the children, put in a nursery near a  
Volkswagen plant where their parents were forced to build munitions 
and the ``Beetle,'' died from maltreatment and poor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had been German they would have been cared for  
period,'' said Lyn Rahilly, one of the attorneys. ``They were not 
cared for. The issue here is genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, accuses the  
company of genocide and war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen A.G. reissued a statement first released in November  
after CBS News aired a report on the nursery. The children's death 
at the nursery ``is a tragic chapter from one of the darkest times 
of modern history,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The widespread practice of forcing infants and children to be  
taken from their mothers and placed in special children's homes 
throughout Germany was another manifestation of the inhumanity of 
the Third Reich in World War II,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said there would be no other comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit lists only one laborer -- 78-year-old Anna Snopczyk  
of Poland, a slave laborer whose 2-month-old baby died at the 
nursery. Rahilly said the lawyers hoped the case would encourage 
others to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive  
damages, was based on information from war-crimes investigations 
and trial records, Rahilly said. It was filed in Milwaukee partly 
because of the area's large Polish population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other lawsuits in the United States have been brought by  
former slave laborers against Volkswagen and other German 
companies, seeking compensation for their experiences during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead attorney Michael Hausfeld, based in Washington, has been  
involved in several class-action cases brought on behalf of slave 
laborers and Holocaust survivors, including one against Swiss banks 
that resulted in a $1.25 billion settlement for Holocaust 
survivors.

<HEADLINE> Search Goes on After Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- Capt. James Smith told his soldiers  
to look everywhere as they plunged into a rubbish-filled creek bed. 
Look under the trees. Look in the trees. Don't touch any bodies you 
find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take your time,'' Smith said. ``This stuff is thick.''  
</P>
<P>
	Smith was leading a search Wednesday for five people still  
missing in the wake of tornadoes that plowed a six-mile path 
through the heart of this rural community 30 miles southwest of 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 11 people were killed.  
</P>
<P>
	Several victims have been found nearby, Grady County Sheriff  
Stan Florence says. But the missing might not even be missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the dead have yet to be identified, he said. Some of  
those on the missing list might have escaped and are unaware anyone 
is trying to find them. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma National Guardsmen clawed their way through twisted  
metal, toppled trees and other debris as Smith barked orders. 
</P>
<P>
	From the rubbish underfoot, Smith pulled a picture frame  
displaying a collage of photos of beaming young women. He also 
pulled two books from the mud and closed them gently. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you guys find personal items, go ahead and grab them,'' he  
calls out. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll tote them out and give them to family members.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith's isn't the only search going on in the area.  
</P>
<P>
	On a nearby hillside, Bob Chappell walked with his eyes to the  
ground, searching for jewelry that disappeared when the churning 
gray cloud sucked away his mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappell and his wife escaped just ahead of the storm. They  
found two of their horses a quarter mile away. A fresh mound marks 
their graves in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	He carried with him a gold watch unearthed from the yard, which  
has been scoured of grass by the storm. There are initials on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not mine,'' he says wearily. His search goes on.  
</P>
<P>
	After nearly two hours, the soldiers finished their work. Five  
people are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that means they're still alive, Smith says hopefully.  
</P>
<P>
	``We head back now,'' he says. ``We sit, we rest, we wait --  
until we're asked to do something again.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Criticizes Littleton Sheriff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A classmate who was harassed and  
threatened by gunman Eric Harris criticized the sheriff on 
Wednesday for suggesting that he has withheld information about the 
Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no evidence against me. They have nothing. Actually,  
I know that the FBI has said that I'm not a suspect. The DA has 
said that I'm not a suspect,'' Brooks Brown said in an interview 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both have said I'm just a witness. I don't know why Sheriff  
(John) Stone is doing this. ... I just don't think he's thinking 
before he talks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In newspaper and national television show interviews, Stone has  
said he believes Brown, 17, knows more about the April 20 attack at 
Columbine High School than he has told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's parents had earlier criticized Stone for failing to act  
after they had told deputies last year that Harris had threatened 
their son and had written about bombs and murder on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown knew Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, and had helped  
produce a videotape with Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	The day of the shooting, Harris warned Brown to stay away from  
the school moments before he and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students 
and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and his parents, Randall and Judy Brown, swept aside  
Stone's suspicions and said his comments stemmed from their 
criticism of his department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible; it's wrong,'' Randall Brown has said. ``He  
should be ashamed of himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone was not available for comment, but sheriff's spokesman  
Steve Davis reiterated Wednesday that no one has been labeled a 
suspect, including Brooks Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone retracted an earlier statement after he said three teens  
detained near the school on the day of the shooting were suspects. 
Other officials said the three had been cleared of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said earlier this week they were leaning toward  
the theory that Harris and Klebold acted alone, but Stone said he 
believes there may have been a third gunman, based on interviews 
with student witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said: ``We have had a lot of witnesses tell us there was a  
third suspect and we've said that from Day One. But, from Day One, 
we've said we hadn't had any concrete evidence to show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond said  
the long-term costs of dealing with the shooting, including legal 
fees and tougher security at other schools, could reach $50 
million.

<HEADLINE> Westwood Is Hot As Duval in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- While David Duval has won 11 tournaments in  
35 starts on the PGA Tour, Lee Westwood has quietly matched his 
victory total in Asia, Australia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Duval and Westwood lead the field at the Compaq  
Classic, with each hoping to add to his victory total. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to defend,'' Westwood said of his only U.S. victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Westwood was scheduled to tee off early today, but withdrew from  
Wednesday's pro-am with what a tournament official described as a 
right shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood experienced a ``twinge'' in that shoulder last November  
at the Hong Kong Open. He had a similar twinge Wednesday on the 
driving range, and after consulting in the medical trailer, decided 
to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Duval, Westwood won three tournaments at the end of 1997,  
seven in 1998 and one this year. In all, he had 13 top-10 finishes 
around the world in 1998, including four victories in Europe. He's 
also won in Asia and Australia, and two weeks ago he took the title 
in Macao. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all the great players,'' Westwood said. ``Most have  
won all over the world. Against different fields. On different golf 
courses. Under different conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the world's top-ranked player, has won four of the 10  
tournaments he entered this year. He started off with victories in 
the Mercedes Championships and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost in the second round of the Match Play  
Championship, Duval took three weeks off and returned to win The 
Players Championship and BellSouth Classic in consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Westwood, who turned 26 last week, has matched Duval in  
victories, he's not well known in the United States, where his only 
title was last year in New Orleans. And Westwood said, his game is 
still not on a par with Duval's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say I'd lose out around the greens,'' Westwood said. ``I'm  
not as good as David Duval at chipping or probably putting. But 
there might be something I do better than him. That's the way it's 
always going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked sixth in the World Golf Rankings, Westwood is still the  
down to earth kid from blue collar Worksop, England, a mining and 
farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	He married in January and bought a farmhouse and 50 acres of  
land just outside his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	An intense competitor on the course, Westwood doesn't let his  
killer instinct interfere with his life off the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody bothers me too much,'' he said. ``What's not to handle?  
You either do or you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood won the tournament in New Orleans last year with four  
consecutive rounds in the 60s -- 69, 68, 67, 69, finishing 15 under 
par on the tough 7,106 yards, par 72 English Turn course. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his ability to drive the ball and his accuracy,  
Westwood's composure on the course is what most of his peers 
comment on. Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal said that's 
Westwood's edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his attitude, his ability to relax that sets him apart,''  
Olazabal said. ``He is long and straight, yes. But when I look at 
Lee Westwood, I think of his composure. That impresses me most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood and Duval were tied for sixth place at the Masters.  
That was Westwood's best finish in a major, bettering a seventh he 
had in the 1998 U.S. Open. But he believes the U.S. victories will 
come as he refines his game. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing he isn't worrying about is his mental game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid of winning. I'm not afraid of losing,''  
Westwood said. ``It's only a game at the end of the day. It's not 
like war or anything like that. Some people treat it like that, 
which is the wrong attitude to have.''

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw, Jolly Look Ahead to WNBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly joke  
about what will happen if they find themselves guarding each other 
in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chamique said she would probably talk trash to Kellie, and  
Kellie said she would put a 3 right in her face if she did that,'' 
Tennessee Lady Vols coach Pat Summitt said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be interesting. I would like to see that myself.''  
</P>
<P>
	For one last time, the trio fielded questions in the Lady Vols'  
locker room. Trophies from Tennessee's six NCAA championships, 
including three in which Holdsclaw and Jolly played key roles, were 
pushed to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind them hung a blue backdrop covered with the logos of the  
WNBA. Holdsclaw was the league's top draft choice Tuesday, and 
Jolly was a fourth-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both of these young ladies will carry a winning  
tradition to the next level,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has hit me that I am not going to be wearing  
orange and white,'' said Jolly, sporting the blue and black uniform 
of the Cleveland Rockers, a gift Holdsclaw brought back from draft 
day ceremonies in New York. ``But I think I am ready to move on to 
a new part of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt said she knows that expectations will be running high,  
especially for Holdsclaw, a two-time AP player of the year and 
Tennessee's top career scorer with 3,025 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unbelievable the expectations that are out there for  
her, but there are a lot of people who also are very aware that she 
is going to a team that last year struggled,'' Summitt said of 
Holdsclaw's new team, the Washington Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think everyone is excited about having Chamique in the  
league and about the league in general,'' Summitt said. ``So I 
think there will be a lot of support there for her as well as for 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw is unfazed. She's known pressure ever since she  
arrived at Tennessee from Astoria, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gotta be confident,'' she said. ``I was confident for my  
four years here. If you are not confident, you are not going to 
accomplish anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both have business to attend to before the WNBA. They  
graduate May 14 -- Holdsclaw with a degree in political science and 
Jolly with a degree in math. The next day, Holdsclaw is a 
bridesmaid in Jolly's wedding in Sparta, Tenn. Then it's on to the 
pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time in my life and a time for  
transition,'' Jolly said. ``There are a lot of changes for me, but 
I am ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will the bright lights of the WNBA change Holdsclaw? ``Oh, my  
life has changed every year here,'' she said. ``I've experienced 
everything. And I think I have handled it well thus far. I am 
comfortable with who I am. A paycheck is not going to change me.''

<HEADLINE> Nuke Panel Drops Plant 'Watch List' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will  
no longer issue a ``watch list'' of the country's most troubled 
nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The list -- issued semiannually since 1986 -- will be replaced by  
a yearly announcement of plants needing ``agency focus'' and 
``regional focus,'' NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants needing agency focus would require ``the involvement of  
the NRC executive director for operations and the commission 
itself'' because of serious problems, Dricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants with lesser problems would receive the attention of a  
regional administrator. All others would be categorized as 
requiring only ``routine oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics feared the new system would mean less oversight for an  
industry they already consider a safety risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very bad. They're making it much more difficult to  
collect information about the reactors,'' said Wenonah Hauter of 
Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, a nuclear watchdog 
group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the nation's 103 nuclear power plants are currently on  
the watch list, the shortest roster since the system was 
instituted. The plants are Millstone Units 2 and 3 in Connecticut, 
and LaSalle Units 1 and 2 and the Clinton plant in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The new process will have inspectors concentrating their efforts  
on ``those things that most directly affect the safety of a plant'' 
rather than a laundry list of problems, Dricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the change, Dricks said, is that NRC officials  
believe the nuclear industry is safer than ever before.

<HEADLINE> Devils Rays' Canseco, Boggs Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays lost  
designated hitter Jose Canseco and third baseman Wade Boggs to 
injuries early in Wednesday night's game against the Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco left with a jammed right knee after hitting an  
opposite-field single in the third inning. He ran slowly down the 
first base line and limped toward the dugout after being replaced 
by pinch-runner Danny Clyburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco has appeared in all but one game this season, missing  
only an April 29 game at the Chicago White Sox with abdominal 
muscle tightness. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Canseco has not homered in 27 at-bats, his longest  
drought this season, he began the night tied for for the AL lead in 
home runs with 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs left after two innings because of a strained left  
hamstring. He grounded out in the second, then was replaced at 
third by Bobby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs has been slowed by right quadriceps tightness, sitting out  
Sunday's game. He returned Monday and tied Frank Robinson for 25th 
place on the career hits list at 2,943.

<HEADLINE> Goodrich Files Appeal on Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The BFGoodrich Co. is challenging a temporary  
restraining order that has delayed the company's planned $1.9 
billion merger with Coltec Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich filed an appeal Wednesday with the U.S. 7th Circuit  
Court of Appeals in Chicago which challenges a court order issued 
Friday. U.S. District Judge Allen Sharp of South Bend, Ind., 
ordered a delay of the merger until he can hear a lawsuit filed by 
AlliedSignal Corp. of New Jersey and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	About two months ago, AlliedSignal sued to block Goodrich's  
acquisition of Charlotte, N.C.-based Coltec. The suit said the deal 
would break a partnering agreement between AlliedSignal and Coltec 
and would violate U.S. antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal makes aircraft brakes and other aircraft parts.  
Opponents of a Goodrich-Coltec merger said it would create a 
monopoly in the manufacturing of landing gear for commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp has scheduled a July 12 hearing to consider the merits of  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts in this lawsuit did not warrant the issuance of a  
preliminary injunction and, in any event, all of AlliedSignal's 
claims against Coltec should be resolved in arbitration,'' said 
Terrence G. Linnert, Goodrich senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the merger is completed, Goodrich plans to move its  
corporate headquarters from Richfield to Charlotte, where Coltec 
has administrative offices.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Nervous About NCAA Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame, fearing a major  
investigation of its football program, hired a law firm to 
represent it before the NCAA Committee on Infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Dennis Moore said Notre Dame had been confident  
the gifts and trips booster Kimberly Dunbar showered upon up to a 
dozen current and former Irish players would be considered a 
secondary violation by the NCAA. But the school has to appear June 
4 before the committee, which usually handles only major 
infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could we be confident of that? The enforcement staff has  
recommended that the violation be secondary, but the committee on 
infractions say they want to hold a hearing and they don't hold a 
hearing that they don't regard as potentially major,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm of Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King has an office near the NCAA  
in Overland Park, Kan., and specializes in assisting colleges under 
investigation by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The university now has less than a month to fight the  
possibility it will be sanctioned for a major violation for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to go in front of a hearing. If you have to  
participate in a hearing in any situation like this, it's something 
to worry about,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, ESPN reported that Dunbar took boyfriend Jarvis  
Edison, with whom she had a child, on a $10,000 trip to Las Vegas 
in 1997 -- along with fellow player Allen Rossum and his girlfriend 
-- to see the Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson fight. According to the 
report, which cited unidentified sources, Dunbar paid $500 for the 
fight tickets through a South Bend ticket agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said the university is aware of the trip and has forwarded  
all information on Dunbar's relationship with players, including 
various trips and gifts, to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Though court documents outline a series of trips Dunbar took  
with players and others, the NCAA has informed the university it is 
only interested in trips and gifts she purchased after June 1995. 
That is when the NCAA determined Dunbar became a Notre Dame booster 
through her membership in the now-defunct Quarterback Club.

	One of those trips includes a 1995 weekend in Las Vegas that  
Dunbar took with then-boyfriend Derrick Mayes. She purchased three 
round-trip tickets for $1,836 apiece and paid $756 for their stay 
at the Luxor in Las Vegas, according to court documents.

	NCAA enforcement officials sent a recommendation to the  
committee on infractions last month that the contact be considered 
secondary violations. But the committee decided to hear the case as 
if there were major infractions, prompting fears the school could 
be cited for lack of institutional control and lose scholarships, 
recruiting days or TV privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	``No judgments have been made, except that it seems a little  
more serious than a secondary violation, and we want the university 
to respond and the enforcement staff to investigate a little more 
further to find out what occurred,'' said David Swank, an Oklahoma 
law professor who heads the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare for the committee to hold a hearing in cases where  
enforcement officials recommend the infractions be considered 
secondary. David Smrt, head of the NCAA's enforcement division, 
said a handful of the 1,500 discipline cases the NCAA handles each 
year go before the committee.

<HEADLINE> `Godfather of Soul' To Issue Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- James Brown is looking for a brand new bag --  
of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the lead of David Bowie and other singers, the  
Godfather of Soul plans to issue bonds that will pay interest from 
his song royalties, his agent confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bond issue gives James Brown an opportunity to enjoy  
financial freedom without having to sell off any part of a musical 
catalog that has taken a lifetime to create,'' said the agent, Jeff 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond broker David Pullman, who handled Bowie's $55 million bond  
transaction in 1997, wouldn't confirm reports that Brown will 
collect $35 million to $55 million from the deal. He said the 
amount of Brown's bonds has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond deals allow an entertainer to cash in ahead of time on  
royalties, instead of having to wait for them to be calculated and 
paid over a period of years. The song rights revert to the artist 
after the bonds are paid off, Pullman said.

	SALEM, Va. (AP) -- A judge dismissed charges Wednesday against a  
77-year-old woman who was hit with pepper spray and dragged from 
her car by a police officer after parking on the wrong side of the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	After a hearing, Judge George Harris dismissed reckless driving

</P>
<P>
	Ms. Akers was arrested Nov. 8 after driving across the road from  
her home to pick up her mail from her mailbox. She said she did

	Roanoke County Officer R.L. Metcalf stopped Akers when he saw  
her car facing the wrong way, and sprayed her through her cracked 
window after she pulled her car back into the driveway and refused 
to speak to him. He dragged her off to jail in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf said he feared Ms. Akers would use the car as a weapon.

<HEADLINE> GOP Reps. Seek Campaign Finance Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans favoring overhaul of the  
campaign finance system pressed Speaker Dennis Hastert without 
immediate success on Wednesday to allow legislation to the floor 
for a vote before September. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made it very clear that September is too late,'' Rep. Marge  
Roukema of New Jersey said after about two dozen GOP lawmakers met 
privately with Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the speaker had pledged to take their viewpoint under  
advisement. Asked what would happen if he refused to advance the 
timetable, she replied, ``Then we'd have a large problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, Republicans have withheld support from a  
Democratic-drafted petition designed to force the campaign finance 
legislation to the floor. But Mrs. Roukema said several of the 
lawmakers in attendance had referred specifically to the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said after the meeting  
that he had told Hastert, ``Please don't put me in the position of 
having to sign the discharge petition. But I would like to stay 
consistent, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wamp was one of several Republicans who backed campaign finance  
legislation last year in defiance of the wishes of his party's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, the principal Republican author  
of legislation to limit the amount of money in political campaigns, 
declined to comment after the closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert issued a written statement saying he had promised a vote  
``by September of this year.'' He added that he has ``serious 
concerns about certain definitions of reform that unduly regulate 
free speech and that unfairly discriminate against certain 
political parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The principal pending legislation would ban donations of  
so-called ``soft money,'' unregulated donations that both political 
parties use to bolster the efforts of individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say that ban and other provisions in the measure  
would violate the Constitution's First Amendment protection of free 
speech. Republicans have maneuvered for more than two years to 
block campaign finance legislation, as part of what officials have 
said is an attempt to preserve the party's traditional fund-raising 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal Democratic supporter of the measure, Rep. Marty  
Meehan, D-Mass., issued a statement saying that ``delaying debate 
on campaign finance reform until September is simply 
unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and others who attended Hastert's meeting with GOP  
lawmakers said the speaker had raised two main points. He said he 
feared that a soft money ban could mean ``unilateral disarmament'' 
for the Republicans, given labor unions' ability to raise and spend 
large amounts of money on campaigns, principally in support of 
Democrats. He also cited a busy House schedule as a reason for a 
September date. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Barrett, R-Neb., said he had told the speaker the  
heavy work schedule argument ``didn't seem to hold water'' since 
lawmakers are in session only three days a week, and many bills are 
minor, concerning such things as naming federal buildings.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Support for Gun Laws Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Support for gun control jumped in the week  
after the high school shootings in Colorado, according to an 
Associated Press poll, with a majority of Americans saying tougher 
gun laws are the most effective way to stem violence. 
</P>
<P>
	That 51 percent figure is up 9 percentage points from just  
before the deaths at the school. Also, 40 percent of adults said 
parents should face charges if a child younger than 18 commits a 
crime with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	ICR of Media, Pa., conducted one poll in the four days before  
the April 20 rampage. Some of the questions were repeated in an 
April 28-May 2 poll, allowing the impact of the shootings on the 
public to be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the school shootings, 47 percent said better enforcement  
of existing laws was the way to limit gun violence, while 42 
percent said tougher gun laws would be more effective. After the 
shootings, 51 percent said tougher gun laws would be more 
effective, while 39 percent said better enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar increase was found when people were asked whether they  
favored or opposed stricter gun-control laws. In the first poll, 55 
percent were in favor and 40 percent were opposed. The second poll 
found 63 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether President Clinton and others who are calling for tougher  
gun laws succeed may depend, in part, on whether the increased 
support is permanent or merely a short-lived reaction to the 
tragedy. Clinton's proposals include raising the legal age for 
handgun possession from 18 to 21 and holding negligent parents 
responsible when their children commit crimes with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seems it's too easy for minors to get guns, not just  
off the street but from within the household,'' said Maria Vigil, a 
26-year-old mother of four from Fort Collins, Colo., about 60 miles 
north of Denver. ``I like the idea of waiting until you're 21 to 
buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston has argued  
that better enforcement of current gun laws is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to shift positions after the Colorado  
shootings were senior citizens and women. Just over half of older 
Americans supported tougher gun controls before the shooting, 
compared with more than two-thirds afterward. Among women, 
two-thirds supported tougher gun laws in the first poll; about 
three-quarters favored them after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked after the shootings what one step would  
be most effective in stopping school violence, 27 percent said 
reducing violence in TV shows and movies, 23 percent favored using 
metal detectors in schools and 21 percent chose increased 
counseling for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	It stands to reason that having more violent images in movies,  
TV shows and video games would affect people's behavior, said Gary 
MacTavish, a 54-year-old engineer and father of three grown 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``American private industry spends billions of dollars on  
advertising because it works,'' said MacTavish, of St. Croix Falls, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The error margin in the most recent AP poll of 1,006 adults was  
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The error margin in the earlier 
poll of 765 adults was plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a choice of five factors as most to blame for the Colorado  
shootings -- school officials, availability of guns, the boys' 
parents, TV and movies or the Internet -- about four out of 10 
pointed to the shooters' parents. Other top factors cited were 
availability of guns, 24 percent, and TV and movies, 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings made many reflect on the responsibilities of  
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the Colorado thing, it scared me a lot,'' said Mati  
Nixon, a 28-year-old legal assistant and mother of two from Dallas. 
``They were breaking glass in the garage,'' she said, suggesting 
that should have raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is my son dressing in black? What's going on in the  
garage? I do blame their parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tess Salcedo, a 32-year-old mother of three from Lakewood,  
Calif., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's harder to hassle with your kids, easier to just say 'do  
what you want.' That's not the right thing to do -- it's not being a 
parent,'' she said. ``But if a kid is old enough to do an adult 
crime, the kid should pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on guns is based on telephone  
interviews with 765 randomly selected adults from all states except 
Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted April 16-19 by 
ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll on guns and school violence is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,006 people taken April 28-May 2 by ICR. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first poll, no more than one time in 20 should chance  
variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than 4 
percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all 
Americans were polled. The margin of error in the second poll is 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you favor stricter gun control laws or do you oppose them?  
</P>
<P>
	(April 16-19) Favor, 55 percent; oppose, 40 percent; don't know,  
11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	(April 28-May 2) Favor, 63 percent; oppose, 31 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Which of these is more likely to decrease gun violence ...  
</P>
<P>
	(April 16-19) Better enforcement of existing gun laws, 47  
percent; tougher gun laws, 42 percent; neither, 7 percent; don't 
know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	(April 28-May 2) Better enforcement of existing gun laws, 39  
percent; tougher gun laws, 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Three gun questions asked in the April 16-19 poll.  
</P>
<P>
	--As you may know, several cities have filed lawsuits against gun  
manufacturers to recover money spent by hospitals and police 
departments dealing with gun violence. Do you think gun 
manufacturers should be held responsible for these costs, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Should be held responsible, 21 percent; should not be held  
responsible, 70 percent; don't know, 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The federal government requires background checks for most gun  
purchases. Do you think these background checks help reduce the 
number of crimes committed with guns, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Helps, 52 percent; doesn't help, 42 percent; don't know, 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Does anyone in your household own a gun?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 44 percent; no, 55 percent; declined to answer, 1 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Three questions on school violence asked April 28-May 2.  
</P>
<P>
	--Which one of the following measures do you think would be the  
most effective way to stop violence in schools? 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing violence in TV shows and movies, 27 percent; putting  
metal detectors in schools, 23 percent; increasing counseling for 
teens, 21 percent; passing stricter gun laws, 10 percent; 
restricting Internet content, 9 percent; none of the above, 7 
percent; don't know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Thinking about the shootings last week at a Colorado high  
school, please tell me which one of these do you think is most to 
blame? 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' parents, 39 percent; availability of guns, 24 percent;  
television and movies, 14 percent; the Internet, 8 percent; school 
officials, 4 percent; none of the above, 6 percent; don't know, 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the parents should face charges if they have a  
child under 18 who commits a crime with a gun? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 39 percent; no, 52 percent; don't know, 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senator Targets Baseball Exemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator who wants baseball teams to share  
more of the costs of building new stadiums is threatening to take 
away the sport's cherished antitrust exemption unless owners step 
up to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he also would target  
professional football, which he said has been able to obtain 
lucrative television contracts because it essentially has a limited 
antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he was prepared for battle if team owners oppose  
legislation he introduced Tuesday to require them to set aside 10 
percent of television revenue and use the money to pay up to 50 
percent of stadium construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't want to build stadiums, we have to have a blood  
war,'' Specter said. ``If we are going to go to war, let's make it 
unconditional surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter brought up the issue with Assistant Attorney General  
Joel I. Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust 
division, during a Senate hearing. Specter asked Klein to look into 
the possibility of removing the exemption and plans to pursue that 
course if teams oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, passing his bill would give baseball,  
basketball, football and hockey broader exemptions allowing their 
leagues to deny a team's request to move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he supported reluctantly a recent initiative  
committing $320 million in state money for four new stadiums in his 
state, saying he had ``a gun at my head'' as teams threaten to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned  
in recent years,'' Specter said. ``One would think some of that 
giant revenue windfall might trickle down and be used to help 
finance new ballparks and stadiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter questioned why the public must commit more money for  
stadium construction when schools and housing are in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have long been concerned with the pressure put upon  
communities by baseball and football clubs seeking new playing 
facilities where, responding to a team's overt or tacit threat to 
move to another city, government leaders feel compelled to have 
taxpayers finance the lion's share'' of costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a reference to a recent bidding war in New England over  
the Patriots football team. After threatening to move to Hartford, 
Conn., the Patriots decided to stay in Massachusetts when the state 
came up with a $70 million plan for infrastructure improvements at 
their stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge signed a law that  
allocates $320 million for four new stadiums, two each in 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires team owners to finance one-third of the stadium  
costs. The rest would be split between the state and the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's bill would apply to any stadiums not yet completed, so  
it could affect those in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's antitrust exemption, granted in a 1922 U.S. Supreme  
Court ruling, allows baseball owners to block the sale of 
franchises without violating federal laws that prohibit unnecessary 
restraint on trade. Specter threatened to target that exemption 
previously, when the Pirates considered moving out of Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Students Face Long Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Those most severely wounded in the Columbine High  
School attack face a long and uncertain road to recovery -- one 
likely to be filled with physical and emotional obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatric therapists say the nightmarish images of exploding  
bombs and guns put to people's heads by killers Eric Harris and 
Dylan Klebold will linger for years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the victims also face the grueling physical rehabilitation  
that is needed after suffering gunshot wounds to arms and legs, and 
in at least three of the young victims, damage to the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a long way back for these kids,'' said Dr.  
Burt Katubig, a trauma surgeon at Denver's Swedish Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded  
23 others in the April 20 rampage before killing themselves. Five 
students remained hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ireland, 17, suffered a wound on the left hemisphere of  
his brain that damaged his language abilities and right-side motor 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old Anne Marie Hochhalter took a direct hit in  
the spinal cord. She also has injuries to her liver and vena cava, 
the major vein that returns blood from the lower leg to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Kirklin, 16, suffered wounds in the face, chest and legs.  
</P>
<P>
	Sean Graves, 15, was wounded in the abdomen and back. Richard  
Castaldo, 17, has wounds in his left arm, chest, lungs, spleen, 
kidney and back. Sean and Richard also suffered bruising and 
swelling in their spines, caused by the vibration of the bullet as 
it passed near the cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news for Sean, however, came Monday when he complained to a  
therapist about pain in his foot -- a sign that his spinal damage 
may have been temporary. He also was able to move the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	For Anne Marie, Richard and Sean, doctors won't know the full  
extent of the damage until the spinal bruising and swelling 
subside. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this type of injury, it's difficult to tell, but in  
Sean's case we've seen some really exciting progress,'' said Sara 
Spaulding, a spokeswoman at Swedish. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors will determine just how far each victim has to  
go -- chief among them the location of the spinal damage. The higher 
up on the spinal cord the damage occurs, the greater the paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sean, Richard and Anne Marie, rehabilitation has already  
started. Physical therapists are working with them on the basics, 
such as feeding and dressing themselves, and getting in and out of 
bed and wheelchairs. Strength training with weights and in the 
swimming pool will probably follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunshot wounds carry a particular risk of complications.  
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, it's one thing to dive off a diving board and  
break your neck,'' said Pat Bowen, a Boulder physical therapist. 
``There's no open wound you're dealing with. But with a shotgun 
wound, you're dealing with infection and healing with those soft 
tissue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frustration over the injuries is a certainty as the victims  
undergo rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not have sunken in yet, what they're going to be up  
against,'' Bowen said. ``You have to respect that and expect it, 
that there will be days when they're not going to want to 
participate at all. You go through those highs and lows with 
them.''

<HEADLINE>  WNBA Hopes Holdsclaw Brings in Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA is banking on Chamique Holdsclaw to be  
the crossover player of the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a four-time All-American who led Tennessee to three  
consecutive national titles, was the No. 1 pick by the Washington 
Mystics in Tuesday's WNBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the player of the present and the player of the future  
for our league,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said. ``Her eventual 
appeal could rival what Michael Jordan was able to do over his long 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``A casual basketball fan who hasn't quite turned on to women's  
basketball may be won over because of Chamique -- her mystique, what 
she does on the court, the whole package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a two-time national player of the year, was selected  
first even though pro players from the defunct American Basketball 
League were included in the draft. Holdsclaw was the only college 
player drafted in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	She is Tennessee's career scoring leader, surpassing Allan  
Houston with 3,025 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is where my grandmother wanted me to play,'' said  
Holdsclaw, a native New Yorker. ``I'm kind of glad I didn't go to 
New York, because I don't know if I could handle all the pressure 
and friends and fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former ABL player Yolanda Griffith was the No. 2 pick, going to  
the Sacramento Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, the 1998 ABL defensive player of the year, averaged  
17.2 points and 12.3 rebounds for the Chicago Condors. She's 
looking forward to playing with Sacramento's Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ruthie is a great defender and a great player,'' Griffith  
said. ``Once we learn to play with each other, we'll be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah chose center Natalie Williams, the ABL's player of the year  
in '98 who averaged 21 points and 11.6 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the only major transition will be adjusting to the  
smaller ball in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to improve on that 8-22 record,'' said Williams, a  
native of Utah. ``We're going to be very aggressive. It's going to 
be really fun to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles picked forward Delisha Milton of Portland, a member  
of the 1998 gold-medal World Championship team. Former San Jose 
Lasers guard Jennifer Azzi went to Detroit with the fifth pick and 
forward Crystal Robinson of the Colorado Xplosion was chosen by the 
New York Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA drafted 50 players in the four-round draft: 35 from the  
ABL, 12 from college and three from international teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With the influx of the ABL players, many of them Olympians or  
All-Americans, Ackerman called it the ``deepest draft in modern-day 
sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw proved her worth during her decorated college career.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the women's side, people most compare her to Cheryl  
Miller,'' Ackerman said. ``On the men's game, I hear her compared 
to Scottie Pippen. She's very agile, a good defensive player who 
can score, pass, has great court sense and is incredibly 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expansion teams picked seventh and eighth. The  
Minnesota Lynx took guard Tonya Edwards of the two-time ABL 
champion Columbus Quest, and the Orlando Miracle selected forward 
Tari Phillips of the Colorado Xplosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte followed with guard Dawn Staley, formerly of the  
Philadelphia Rage; Phoenix went for guard Edna Campbell of the 
Colorado Xplosion; Cleveland picked center Chasity Melvin of the 
Rage; and Houston selected the only international player in the 
first round, Natalia Zassoulskaia, a two-time MVP of the 
Euroleague, from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft was postponed a week because of a labor dispute  
between the players and league. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and players union agreed to allow three ABL players  
on each of the 10 established teams and five each on the expansion 
teams in Minnesota and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA begins its third 10-week season on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Wariner Wins Tops Country Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Wariner's oh-so-sad ``Holes  
in the Floor of Heaven'' was named song of the year at Wednesday's 
34th annual Academy of Country Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first one!'' said the jubilant Wariner, who shared  
the songwriting honor with fellow composer Billy Kirsch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based trio Dixie Chicks, sisters Martie Siedel and  
Emily Erwin and friend Natalie Maines, won both the top group and 
top new group awards. They hit it big with their weepy hit song 
``Wide Open Spaces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faith Hill, with a leading six nominations, kicked off the  
three-hour show by winning the top video award for ``This Kiss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm under so much pressure tonight I'm sick. At least I've got  
one,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hill, who entered the show with six previous academy  
trophies, needn't have worried. She soon shared the vocal event of 
the year award with husband Tim McGraw for their duet ``Just to 
Hear You Say That You Love Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer Jo Dee Messina, produced by McGraw, won the new female  
vocalist award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it. We fell away after our start in 1996 and  
it's great to have a second chance. It's a blessing from God,'' 
Miss Messina said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hill, McGraw, Garth Brooks, Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Wariner, George  
Strait and Shania Twain all were competing for top awards. 
</P>
<P>
	But the highlight of the three-hour CBS-TV special was expected  
to be the crowning of the Artist of the Decade, given to the most 
successful 1990s act best exemplifying the image of country music. 
</P>
<P>
	The award has been presented previously to Alabama, Marty  
Robbins and Loretta Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Twain was presented the Recording Industry Association of  
America's first diamond award for recognition of 10 million in 
album sales. It was a double-diamond for the Canadian sensation, 
who sold more than 10 million copies each of ``The Woman in Me'' 
and ``Come on Over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous performances were jammed into the show produced by Dick  
Clark, who boasted a host-less ceremony would guarantee a 
fast-pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hill led nominees with six, including the duet ``Just to  
Hear You Say That You Love Me'' with McGraw. Brooks, Wariner and 
Brooks &AMP; Dunn had four nominations apiece with Brooks, McGraw, Miss 
Twain and Brooks &AMP; Dunn all vying for entertainer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hill got nominations for her album ``Faith,'' song, single  
and video ``This Kiss,'' top female vocalist and vocal event of the 
year (her duet with McGraw). 
</P>
<P>
	Other multiple nominees included Miss Messina, the Dixie Chicks,  
The Wilkinsons, Martina McBride, Sawyer Brown, Vince Gill and Mark 
Wills. 
</P>
<P>
	A special Pioneer Award was presented to Glen Campbell, who  
couldn't believe it was already time in his career for such an 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how short a period it seems like -- 32 years --  
to 1967, and now I'm up here getting the Pioneer Award. Then I was 
getting the go get 'em award, you know. Time flies when you're 
having a big time,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners were selected by the 3,000 members of the Academy of  
Country Music.

<HEADLINE> Hottest Golfer? Watch Out for Webb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Behind the Titleist cap and  
wraparound sunglasses is the face of the most dominant player on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The expression rarely changes, and neither does the game. It is  
so good, so steady, that it seems like only a matter of time before 
the name shows up near the top of the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	No, not David Duval.  
</P>
<P>
	Karrie Webb has only three victories this year. Perhaps if she  
were to win the Titleholders Championship this week with a 59 on 
Sunday, the comparisons would be complete. Still, the results have 
been staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out each week and get myself in contention,''  
Webb said. ``I've done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A classic understatement from someone who, like Duval, prefers  
to let the performance speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Through nine LPGA events this year, Webb's worst finish was a  
tie for eighth in the Welch's Circle K Championship in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened with a 74 that week, her highest score of the year.  
In fact, Webb has shot par or better in 30 of 32 rounds. Her 
scoring average of 68.66 would shatter the record set by Annika 
Sorenstam last year when she became the first woman to break 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice has Webb finished out of the top three this year, and  
her victories have not exactly been run-of-the-mill. She set the 
LPGA scoring record with a 26-under 262 to win the Australian 
Masters, and also won the Standard Register Ping by four shots 
after putting together four rounds in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in golf is having the kind of year she's having, Duval  
notwithstanding,'' LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so Webb doesn't have $2.7 million in the bank right now, but  
only because LPGA purses are about one-fourth of what they are on 
the PGA Tour. But she is close to lapping the field with $578,724. 
Juli Inkster could win the next two tournaments and still be No. 2 
on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love where I am right now,'' Webb said. ``I don't really  
look at anyone chasing me. But we've got a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Duval, the only thing missing from her resume is a major  
championship. She's even the subject of the same ``Who's No. 1'' 
debate because the women's world rankings still have Sorenstam at 
the top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The players know better.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to raise their level because of how well she's  
been playing,'' said fellow Aussie Rachel Hetherington, who has 
done just that by winning the past two weeks. Webb finished one 
stroke behind both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's had such a great start, and her game is so solid,''  
Hetherington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hetherington knows that from experience. They used to be  
roommates on the junior circuit in Australia. Hetherington is two 
years old than the 24-year-old Webb but noticed something different 
about her the first time they practiced together. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had a good short game way before any of us did,''  
Hetherington said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what has set Webb apart from the rest of the field this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first LPGA player to surpass $1 million in  
earnings as a rookie in 1996 and winning her second Women's British 
Open a year later, Webb had what some called a marginal season last 
year -- only two victories and fourth on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	But Webb had reason to be dissatisfied. She ranked 49th in  
putting, so she sought out her coach in Australia and decided to 
putt crosshanded. She also got rid of what she calls her 
``crutches'' -- having caddie Evan Minster help line up her putts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how those two things would work together,'' Webb  
said. ``I really feel I've never been so confident as far as 
10-footers and in. I've never seen the ball roll so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Webb is on a big-time roll.  
</P>
<P>
	Dating to last year, she now has 11 consecutive finishes in the  
top 10. Whether she can keep that up depends on how she negotiates 
a dry, fast LPGA International course when the Mercury Titleholders 
starts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Ammaccapane is the defending champion of the nationally  
televised tournament that almost didn't happen when the LPGA ran 
into sponsorship problems. The tour subsidized the purse, and the 
players agreed to $100,000 less than it was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Se Ri Pak, a double major winner last year as a rookie but still  
looking for her first top 10 this year, skipped this week to play 
in Japan. Webb also was invited to play in the Gunze Cup in Tokyo, 
but decided to return to Daytona Beach, where she won in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Goodrich Files Appeal on Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The BFGoodrich Co. is challenging a temporary  
restraining order that has delayed the company's planned $1.9 
billion merger with Coltec Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich filed an appeal Wednesday with the U.S. 7th Circuit  
Court of Appeals in Chicago which challenges a court order issued 
Friday. U.S. District Judge Allen Sharp of South Bend, Ind., 
ordered a delay of the merger until he can hear a lawsuit filed by 
AlliedSignal Corp. of New Jersey and other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	About two months ago, AlliedSignal sued to block Goodrich's  
acquisition of Charlotte, N.C.-based Coltec. The suit said the deal 
would break a partnering agreement between AlliedSignal and Coltec 
and would violate U.S. antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal makes aircraft brakes and other aircraft parts.  
Opponents of a Goodrich-Coltec merger said it would create a 
monopoly in the manufacturing of landing gear for commercial and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp has scheduled a July 12 hearing to consider the merits of  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts in this lawsuit did not warrant the issuance of a  
preliminary injunction and, in any event, all of AlliedSignal's 
claims against Coltec should be resolved in arbitration,'' said 
Terrence G. Linnert, Goodrich senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the merger is completed, Goodrich plans to move its  
corporate headquarters from Richfield to Charlotte, where Coltec 
has administrative offices.

<HEADLINE> Talk Show Slaying Case Wraps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Talk show host Jenny Jones sat in court  
Wednesday as an attorney asked a jury to award $71.5 million in 
damages against her show for the death of a gay man who was killed 
after revealing a crush on another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, plaintiff's attorney Geoffrey Fieger told  
the jury they needed to ``instill a sense of responsibility in 
otherwise lawless people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has the audacity to come here today,'' Fieger said,  
pointing at Ms. Jones. ``It's important enough for Ms. Jones to 
come here today when the show is going to be held responsible for 
its actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will begin deliberating Thursday whether ``The Jenny  
Jones Show'' should be blamed for Amedure's death in 1995, three 
days after Amedure revealed a secret crush on Jonathan Schmitz 
during a taping of the show. The show never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones left without comment after closing arguments finished.  
It was her first appearance in court since testifying for three 
days in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family contends a mentally ill Schmitz was lured onto  
the show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated into 
murder when his secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger told the jury they should give the family $23.5 million  
for the last few seconds of Amedure's life, as he watched Schmitz 
walk into his trailer and shoot him, and should give the family 
another $48 million in compensation for losing Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jim Feeney spent a good part of his closing  
argument attacking Fieger, saying he just made up the $71.5 million 
request and twisted the evidence to suit his arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone wants to talk about a business whose calculation it  
is to humiliate and embarrass for profit, they need to look no 
further than what was done in this courtroom by the plaintiffs' 
attorney to the witnesses,'' Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also placed the blame squarely on Schmitz, saying ``there is  
only one person to blame for this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A man arrested for selling a handgun  
used by the Columbine High School killers is trying to work out a 
deal with prosecutors as investigators pursue a potential third 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Columbine students at the school during the April 20 attack  
have identified a potential third suspect, Sheriff John Stone said 
in today's Denver Post. He did not identify that person. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was quite possibly one other person shooting,'' Stone  
said. ``We do have witness statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a lawyer for Mark Manes said his client sold the  
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and joined 
them on shooting excursions in the Colorado mountains in the month 
before the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Manes -- a former Columbine student who was booked this week  
on suspicion of providing a handgun to a minor -- knew nothing of 
the impending massacre, lawyer Robert Ransome said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said he is trying to negotiate a deal with prosecutors.  
The charge against Manes carries a maximum six-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, stormed the school with bombs and  
guns, killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 others 
before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's remarks about a possible third attacker marked the  
latest turn in a case which has seen authorities appear at odds 
with each other over developments in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dave Thomas said the sheriff has not told him of any  
witness statements from students who named a third gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Stone's office is conducting the investigation. Maybe  
they've come up with something I don't know about,'' Thomas told 
the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the same sheriff's deputy  
who investigated a van break-in by the two gunmen last year also 
received a complaint not long afterward that they were setting off 
pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the deputy, Mark Miller, wrote a report on the pipe  
bomb complaint, a juvenile court magistrate gave the two a form of 
probation for the break-in. 
</P>
<P>
	The magistrate, John DeVita, told the Times he would not have  
allowed probation had he known of the complaint, which also 
included information that Harris had posted three death threats 
against a classmate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment by the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	The arrest of Manes, 22, was the first connected to the attack.  
Although he joined Harris and Klebold on three shooting excursions 
in the month prior to April 20, Manes knew nothing about their 
plot, Ransome said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got to that point, thinking what they might do with  
it,'' he said. ``It just never crossed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome would not say whether Manes had sold the two teen-agers  
ammunition, how much he charged for the gun, where they went 
shooting, who else accompanied them or what Manes may have known 
about the law involving gun sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the attack, the student gunmen used the TEC DC-9 purchased  
from Manes in late February and three guns -- two shotguns and a 
rifle -- that had been legally purchased by Klebold's girlfriend, 
Robyn Anderson, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Colorado law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can  
furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. Investigators have 
characterized Miss Anderson as a witness, not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are also performing ballistics tests to determine  
which weapons fired the fatal shots; Manes could face more serious 
charges if the TEC DC-9 was used to kill someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes bought the pistol at a gun show last fall, Ransome said.  
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the middleman was a pizza shop employee who  
worked with Harris and Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Sabres `Ruffed' Up for Bruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- For the second straight year, Buffalo coach  
Lindy Ruff -- a tough guy turned mellow -- has the Sabres in the 
Stanley Cup playoffs and winning when it counts. 
</P>
<P>
	He's 14-5 in the playoffs, but winning won't keep Ruff from  
worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gut-wrenching every game, no matter what,'' said Ruff,  
whose insides must be doing cartwheels about now. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Buffalo soars into Boston for the start of the  
best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinals Thursday on the impetus of 
a stunning sweep of favored Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that the Sabres won four out of five games against Boston  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're winning, you wonder when you're going to lose,''  
Ruff said. ``And when you're losing, you wonder if you're ever 
going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have done plenty of both this season, which included  
four preseason holdouts, a couple of key trades and a groin injury 
to two-time MVP goaltender Dominik Hasek. They have Ruff to thank. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's also that lengthy slide after Christmas that sent  
Buffalo tumbling from first to seventh in the conference. Ruff 
stood stoically through it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through everything,'' Ruff said. ``We had our down  
time but we just kept working and pulled ourselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff led the Sabres to the Eastern Conference finals last year,  
their first since 1980 when Ruff was a Sabres rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now Ruff must be wondering when his team is going to lose.  
Buffalo has won five straight including the playoffs and hasn't 
dropped a game since April 17 -- the last time it played in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff was hired in July 1997 after the club fired popular Ted  
Nolan, named the NHL's coach of the year for the 1996-97 season 
after taking the talent-thin Sabres to their first division title 
since 1981. Never had the league's top coach been unemployed by the 
following training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ruff became a popular target of fans and radio talk show  
hosts. But his players stuck by him. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing he doesn't get credit for is his ability to  
motivate,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said. ``Everybody always 
talks about Ted Nolan being a great motivator, which he was. But 
Lindy deserves credit for his ability to motivate too. He's been 
there as a player and knows what it takes to get up for a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff played the game face-first and has the scars to prove it.  
Going into the current season he still ranked fifth in team history 
in penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque, a rookie in 1979, the same year  
Ruff joined the Sabres as a second-round draft pick, recalls that 
Ruff usually was in the middle of things. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fierce competitor,'' Bourque said. ``That was his  
biggest asset, I think. He competed and played hard and always gave 
it his best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know him personally, but obviously he had something  
because he's done a good job ever since he's been there,'' Bourque 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did the tough guy do to kill time the first day of the  
series with Ottawa? Instead of the usual skate, the team went for a 
walk along the Rideau Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the season you don't always need a pre-game  
skate,'' said Hasek, who turned back all but six of the 162 shots 
he faced in the series. ``And the rink was very far from the 
downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, a taskmaster, worried he might have pushed his team too  
hard this season. ``We had a terrific start after a short summer,'' 
he said. ``We worked them extremely hard for the first couple 
months, and maybe that caught up to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff struggled to keep the team moving forward through some  
difficlut times that included the trade of disgruntled Matthew 
Barnaby and holdout Donald Audette, who led the team in goals in 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing you learn is don't get too high and don't get  
too low,'' Ruff said. ``It's natural to start feeling pretty good 
about yourself when you're winning a lot of games. It's also 
natural to get down when you're not winning. It's important for 
your team to maintain a balance in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff will claim success only when the Cup arrives.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to judge how well you're doing is to win the  
trophy at the end of the race,'' he said. ``The only way you can 
have true vindication and feel good about your job is to win the 
Stanley Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Plain Dealer Editor Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Douglas C. Clifton has resigned from The Miami  
Herald after eight years as executive editor to become editor of 
The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton will replace David Hall, editor of The Plain Dealer  
since 1992, who resigned effective May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug Clifton has the reputation of being one of the best  
editors in the country today, and his record speaks for itself,'' 
said Alex Machaskee, president and publisher of the Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton's departure comes less than a month after the Herald won  
its 16th Pulitzer Prize. The newspaper won for investigative 
reporting for a series of stories that exposed pervasive voter 
fraud in the city's mayoral election, which later was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation also comes at a time when the Herald's  
circulation has been declining and the newspaper has cut costs to 
boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton said he had mixed feelings about leaving the Herald and  
parent company Knight Ridder, where he had worked nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was presented with a new challenge, the opportunity to lead  
another strong metropolitan newspaper,'' he said in a statement 
Wednesday. ``I found the lure of a new journalistic challenge 
irresistible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton, 55, started at the Herald in 1970 on the paper's  
consumer Action Line. He worked as a reporter, city editor and 
deputy managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as news editor of Knight Ridder's Washington  
bureau and as managing editor of The Charlotte Observer before 
returning to the Herald in 1991 as executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Herald Publisher Alberto Ibarguen called Clifton a strong  
newsroom leader and a driving force behind the Pulitzer coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not a whole lot of editors who are willing to say,  
`Let's put 20 to 25 people on the story,' and that's what it took 
to get the story done,'' Ibarguen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton will leave the newspaper at the end of May. Managing  
Editor Larry Olmstead will run the news operation until a 
replacement is named, Ibarguen said.

<HEADLINE> Six Cubans Who Missed Flight Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six Cubans who missed a flight carrying the  
Cuban baseball team back to Havana left for home this morning after 
assuring U.S. immigration officials their return was voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Mueller, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, said no Cuban diplomats were present when the interviews 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``All assured the INS that their return to Cuba was voluntary,''  
he said. When the chartered aircraft carrying the delegation from 
Baltimore took off at dawn Tuesday, the six were missing because 
they overslept. None was a team member. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the Cuban delegation, Rigoberto Herrera,  
requested asylum at police headquarters in Baltimore about 10 hours 
after the Cubans beat the Orioles 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Through an interpreter, a lieutenant on duty ``understood he was  
requesting asylum and immediately notified INS officials,'' said 
police spokesman Robert Weinhold. Herrera is now in INS custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a foe of Fidel Castro's regime, said  
the man's full name is Rigoberto Herrera Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez also said two other Cubans may have asked for asylum  
but Justice Department officials said they were not aware of any 
such request. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS would not comment on possible defections.  
</P>
<P>
	The official Cuban government list of the delegation that  
traveled to Baltimore included Rigoberto Betancourt. The government 
news agency said he was a 54-year-old retired pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He played Cuban baseball between 1965 and 1975 and was known for  
an excellent curve ball. Three times he was part of the national 
team and was known as ``el Pequeno Gigante del Box,'' or the 
``Little Big Man in the Box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials denied that any members of the delegation had  
defected but said six Cubans had overslept and missed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defectors,'' said the spokesman for the Cuban  
diplomatic mission in Washington, Luis Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 Cubans were part of the delegation that attended  
Monday night's game. Besides players, the delegation included 
journalists, retired ballplayers, ordinary citizens, members of 
youth groups and outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	During a long speech welcoming the players in Havana, Castro  
criticized defections in general but said nothing about anyone 
staying behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a rematch after the Orioles defeated the Cubans in  
Havana 3-2 on March 28. The Orioles became the first major league 
team in 40 years to play in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> FEC Recommends Dole Repay $3.7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and  
Bob Dole will owe the taxpayers some money, but only a fraction of 
what Federal Election Commission auditors originally wanted them to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Having rejected the initial recommendations, the FEC is poised  
to ask Dole to return $3.7 million to the U.S. Treasury and 
Clinton's campaign to repay $143,092, according to audits presented 
to the six-member, bipartisan commission at last week's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC auditors had initially recommended that the Dole campaign  
return a record $17.7 million and the Clinton campaign $7 million, 
but the commission rejected the findings in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has yet to approve the lower figures, but they  
reflect previous decisions made by the board, and are not expected 
to change before the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, the campaigns may wind up paying even less. The  
commission voted to ask the 1992 Clinton campaign to repay $4 
million, but settled for $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole campaign lawyer Kenneth Gross said the committee would  
challenge the FEC's repayment order. The campaign can submit 
written information and argue the case in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised FEC audit cited the Dole campaign for overcharging  
the press and Secret Service for airfare, for failing to include 
some debts as expenditures, and for paying for some campaign 
expenses from a separate account that could only be used to fund 
the costs of complying with federal election laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton campaign was cited for using money raised for the  
primaries to pay for some general election expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC auditors said last December that both Clinton and Dole  
illegally coordinated supposedly independent ads run by the 
Democratic and Republican national committees during the 1996 
campaign and, in so doing, exceeded the spending limits the two 
candidates agreed to when they accepted taxpayer assistance for the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission voted, 6-0, later that month to reject the  
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Eisner Testifies in Katzenberg Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner  
testified he refused to settle a dispute with former film boss 
Jeffrey Katzenberg over a bonus because he was angry at Katzenberg 
for disclosing company business to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner's testimony Tuesday revealed more details of their  
infamous Hollywood feud. Katzenberg has sued Disney, claiming the 
company owes him at least $250 million in bonuses for work he did 
at the company before he quit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner said he believed Katzenberg had a ``dark side'' and  
acknowledged he may have told an author, ``I hate the little 
midget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an exchange extraordinary in the secretive entertainment  
industry, Eisner was confronted by Katzenberg's attorney, Bert 
Fields, on statements Eisner made to Tony Schwartz, collaborator of 
Eisner's autobiography ``Work in Progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was true that Eisner told Schwartz, ``I think I hate  
the little midget,'' referring to the 5-foot-4 Katzenberg, Eisner -- 
one of the most powerful men in Hollywood -- warned Fields to back 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're getting into an area that I will say is  
ill-advised,'' Eisner told the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner didn't say why he felt it was wrong to pursue such  
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eisner acknowledged he may have made the statement in anger  
after the bitter breakup of the corporate partners. Katzenberg left 
Disney after Eisner refused to promote him to president. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner also acknowledged that he was so mad at Katzenberg he was  
unwilling to reach a settlement in the former executive's claims to 
lucrative bonuses -- a percentage of all the income Disney films and 
merchandise will ever make. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner said he became upset after receiving a fax, inadvertently  
sent to him, suggesting Katzenberg had leaked details of their 
financial negotiations to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg was a hard-working film executive, but his practice  
of going to the media ``just got really annoying,'' Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Disney chairman frequently said he couldn't remember events,  
but said he was certain Katzenberg knew and agreed he wouldn't get 
an incentive bonus if he failed to serve out the entire contract. 
</P>
<P>
	After early talks, Disney secretly paid Katzenberg $77 million  
in a partial settlement, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> All American Meats Recalls Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Nearly 83,000 pounds of ground beef are being  
recalled from Illinois, Indiana and Michigan after E. coli 
contamination was found in one meat sample. 
</P>
<P>
	All American Meats Inc., of Springfield, Neb., is recalling  
ground beef produced at an Omaha plant April 14, according to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators said the meat was sold for further processing  
at places such as butcher shops and grocery stores, but they were 
prohibited by law from telling consumers or local health officials 
precisely which companies bought the meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled beef was shipped in 10-pound blocks packed four or  
eight to a case. Each block has an expiration date of April 28 and 
includes Establishment 20420 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The contamination was discovered Monday when a product sample  
taken by the inspection service on April 27 came back with a 
positive result for E. coli O157:H7, which can cause serious 
illness and sometimes death, especially in children and the 
elderly. Symptoms include chills and bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if anyone has become ill after  
eating the meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The best defense for consumers against the bacteria is  
thoroughly cooking the beef, to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was ordered Tuesday. All American Meats has contacted  
its customers affected by the recall verbally and by letter, the 
government said.

<HEADLINE> Visa Fraud Said To Be Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More fraud is being found in visa programs  
that allow foreigners to work in the United States, State 
Department and immigration officials told a House panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some applicants are overstating their educational and  
professional achievements to secure visas reserved for 
professionals with special skills or for employees of multinational 
companies, the witnesses told the House Judiciary immigration 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, petitioning companies turn out to be either  
non-existent or mom-and-pop shops passing themselves off as 
multinational corporations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are increasingly seeing are cases where brokers are  
facilitating production of visas approved for individuals in the 
U.S. on the premise that they will assume a highly technical job -- 
only to find that the individuals are low-skilled workers slated 
for employment as janitors or nurses' aides or store clerks,'' said 
the State Department's inspector general, Jacquelyn 
Williams-Bridgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has faced ``significant challenges'' in  
processing visas, she added, citing insufficient consular staffing 
and lack of training. She and the Justice Department's inspector 
general, Michael Bromwich, also blamed insufficient coordination 
between the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A consular official defended the State Department's performance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Given available resources, we believe we are doing a good job  
in detecting fraud,'' said Nancy Sambaiew, deputy assistant 
secretary of state for visa services. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department processed 8.1 million visa applications  
last year -- spanning everything from tourist and student visas to 
employer-based visas. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the large majority of these visas are issued routinely,  
our experience shows that worldwide, there is a small percentage of 
fraud ... and in a few geographic locations, there are serious 
problems,'' Sambaiew said, identifying China, India and Russia as 
the trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony focused on two visa programs -- the H-1B visas for  
skilled workers and the L visas for multinational companies' 
managers. Some 38,000 L visas and 65,000 H-1B visas were issued 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	After much lobbying from the high-tech sector, which complained  
of a shortage of computer programmers and other skilled 
professionals, Congress last year agreed to temporarily increase 
the number of H-1B visas by 142,500 visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration lawyers and corporate interests contend that only a  
fraction of visas are issued on fraudulent grounds. They fear that 
the talk of fraud will lead to new regulations on employers or 
restrictions on the number of available visas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must work together to combat fraud while helping employers  
meet their valid personnel needs,'' said Lynn Shotwell of the 
American Council on International Personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint INS-State Department investigation found that a fifth of  
the visa petitions examined out of the U.S. consulate in Chennai, 
India, listed fraudulent work experience. In 45 percent of the 
3,247 Chennai petitions surveyed, the claims couldn't be verified.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Im Bank Tries To Recoup PAL Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank has begun  
moves to recover the four Boeing jumbo jets it helped Philippine 
Airlines acquire, in a serious blow to the ailing carrier's 
recovery plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Wednesday to Manila's Securities and Exchange  
Commission, U.S. Ex-Im Bank vice president Robert Morin said it 
started the recovery effort after deciding the airline's 
rehabilitation process ``lacks fundamental attributes of 
transparency, fairness and predictability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It advised the commission that it plans to ask the U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court to reconsider its decision to yield to the 
Philippine financial rehabilitation process. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Philippine officials said Wednesday that the Ex-Im Bank's  
move complicates their efforts to ensure that the airline stays in 
operation. The four Boeing 747-400 jets claimed by U.S. creditors 
run the carrier's long-haul flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one problem piled on top of another. Obviously, it's  
not going to be easy,'' said Presidential Executive Secretary 
Ronaldo Zamora. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank had sought the U.S. court's help in recovering  
the aircraft after Philippine Airlines failed to make timely debt 
payments. Last year, U.S. authorities seized two PAL Boeing 747 
planes in Los Angeles and Hong Kong but returned them after airline 
officials appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank apparently urged the U.S. court not to take any  
further action while PAL officials negotiated a debt restructuring 
and made a partial interest payment early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Ex-Im Bank and other major PAL creditors were  
displeased last week when businessman Lucio Tan reassumed active 
management control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, which holds a 70 percent stake, has had a strained  
relationship with PAL's unions, and the creditors say they want the 
airline run by professional managers. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to service its $2.2  
billion debt, largely owed to U.S. and European creditors, because 
of mounting losses which forced it to temporarily shut down last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has been unable to find investors to infuse $200 million  
into the airline, a key element of its rehabilitation plan. The SEC 
has given PAL until June 4 to find the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Zamora said a group of Kuwaiti investors has offered to provide  
the money if they are allowed to manage the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwaiti ``aviation interests that appear to be serious  
investors'' sent the proposal directly to President Joseph Estrada, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether the offer would be acceptable to PAL or  
its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The rehabilitation plan also calls for a reduction of the  
airline's fleet from 54 to 22 planes and its labor force from 8,000 
to about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan is also seeking management help from Germany's Lufthansa,  
officials said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Jockeys Hurt in Churchill Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Two jockeys were injured and a colt had  
to be destroyed during a race Wednesday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockeys Joe Judice and Sebastian Madrid were thrown from their  
horses in separate incidents during the second race. 
</P>
<P>
	Judice, riding My Precious Hero, was thrown while entering the  
stretch when his mount clipped heels with another horse and fell to 
the track. My Precious Hero, the 3-year-old son of Sea Hero, 
apparently broke his neck and was euthanized. 
</P>
<P>
	Judice broke his left shoulder and will be out between four and  
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Madrid was hurt when his mount, Altar Bound, stumbled at the  
start of the race. Madrid suffered a minor injury to his left bicep 
when he was grazed by Altar Bound's hoof. Madrid was examined by a 
doctor and returned for the next race. 
</P>
<P>
	Altar Bound was not injured and was captured by track outriders.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's feature race, Relic Reward, with Calvin Borel  
aboard, rallied from 1 1/2 lengths back at the top of the stretch to 
edge Truluck by a neck in a $53,305 allowance race for 3-year-olds 
and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Relic Reward covered the 1 1-16 miles in 1:43 4-5 and paid $24,  
$7.20 and $5.40. Truluck, the 4-5 favorite, returned $2.80 and 
$2.60. Shed Some Light finished another nine lengths back in third 
and paid $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Relic Reward won $30,380 to boost his lifetime earnings to  
$205,922. He has won twice this year and seven times in 26 career 
starts.

<HEADLINE> O's Kamieniecki Set for Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Scott Kamieniecki, who has pitched in only 12  
games since 1997, will likely make his 1999 debut Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki began the season on the disabled list with a  
hamstring injury. But he has already pitched in two minor league 
games and started on the mound against Cuba on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander declared himself ready to go after throwing in  
the bullpen Wednesday, and will start Saturday against Detroit if 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt fine today,'' Kamieniecki said. ``You've got to start  
sometime. The sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gives me a start, fine -- I'll go out there and do it. If  
he doesn't, I guess I'll get some more work in and try to 
improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Kamieniecki can't go, then Rocky Coppinger will get the call.  
But Kamieniecki expects to be on the mound -- finally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why I can't go out and throw 100 pitches. I threw  
60 10 days ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Orioles were winless in 16 games when trailing after  
the eighth inning before rallying to beat the White Sox 9-5 in 10 
innings Tuesday night. The game might end up being a turning point 
in the season. If nothing else, it shows that Baltimore can't 
abandon hope when trailing late. ``You start the season hoping to 
have a couple games like that,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``It 
shows you can come back.'' Before Tuesday, the Orioles were 0-14 
when trailing after six innings.

<HEADLINE>  New Boeing Rocket Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
malfunctioned shortly after liftoff Tuesday night and placed a 
communication satellite in the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second flight of a Delta III. The inaugural  
flight eight months ago ended in a midair explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a significant disappointment to Boeing and, I  
believe, to Boeing's customers,'' said Gale Schluter, vice 
president and general manager of Boeing's expendable launch 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we rushed into this,'' he said at a somber news  
conference early Wednesday. ``We had a very comprehensive 
return-to-flight program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage used to boost the Orion satellite ignited  
properly the first time, but not the second time. That left the 
satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the Pacific for  
Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high perch. It 
was unclear whether the satellite could be boosted into the right 
orbit using on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third time in less than a month that a satellite has  
ended up in the wrong orbit. The two other satellites were launched 
aboard the Air Force's Titan IV rocket, built by Lockheed Martin 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday night's  
launch. Not only did it mark the Delta III's return to flight, it 
was the fifth launch attempt in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way down to zero, but  
the rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the error and aimed for a 
Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to review data 
from last week's botched Titan IV launch, which stranded a military 
communication satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rockets use similar upper-stage engines.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole industry is having its problems at the moment,''  
Boeing mission director Rich Murphy said Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff. The rocket used up all 
of its hydraulic fluid for steering and broke apart when it 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's debut ended up being a $225 million disaster and  
cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed. 
Tuesday's mission cost $230 million.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Lundy Gets One Month in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern running back Dennis Lundy  
today was sentenced to one month in prison and two years of 
probation for lying to a federal grand jury investigating gambling 
at his university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very sorry for what I did. Not only did it hurt my  
mother and family but my team suffered as well. I just want to get 
this behind me no matter what happens,'' Lundy told U.S. District 
Judge David Coar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy was told to report Sept. 1 to begin serving his time.  
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty in February to one count of perjury.  
</P>
<P>
	Lundy also admitted to intentionally fumbling near the goal line  
in a 1994 game against Iowa so his team would not cover the point 
spread and he would win a $400 bet. The Wildcats lost to Iowa 
49-13. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate first accused Lundy of doing that to protect a bet.  
An assistant coach overheard the accusation, and the school 
launched an investigation, which was quickly turned over to federal 
authorities. It led to the indictments of Lundy and some other 
former players.

<HEADLINE> NATO Continues Pounding Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Undeterred by poor weather, NATO  
pounded targets across Yugoslavia on Wednesday. Much of the 
Yugoslav capital was without power for a third day, as diplomats 
stepped up efforts to find a solution to the war over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mysterious twist, a Kosovo Albanian leader thought to be  
under house arrest flew out of Yugoslavia to Rome. Ibrahim Rugova 
held talks with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema ``on a 
political-diplomatic solution to the conflict'' and the premier's 
office said afterward that Rugova ``will be able to contribute as a 
free man'' to the peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if Rugova, whose delegation opposed Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic's at peace talks in France, had 
brought proposals from Milosevic, or whether Rugova had resumed 
activity as an advocate for Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the apparent wide differences on both sides of the  
conflict, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin was hopeful after 
separately meeting Milosevic and President Clinton last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``My optimism has grown after this trip to the United States,''  
Chernomyrdin said on arrival in Moscow early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers from western powers and Russia were also to  
meet Thursday in Bonn, Germany, to try to agree on the outline of a 
Kosovo peace plan that could later be endorsed by the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	At Spangdahlem air base in Germany, President Clinton lamented  
the deaths of two U.S. aviators killed when their Apache helicopter 
crashed in northern Albania and rallied American military personnel 
as the NATO air assault on Yugoslavia entered its seventh week. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton spoke, NATO continued hammering Yugoslav military  
airports, power lines and oil depots all over the country. Allied 
officials said some of the strikes had to be abandoned because of 
bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, said allied  
warplanes had intensified their airstrikes on Milosevic's ground 
forces, hitting 10 armored concentrations, 11 artillery sites and 
three command posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in Kosovo no longer have the ability to conduct  
``ethnic cleansing,'' Clark said. ``When they're not in hiding, 
they're busy repairing what we damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The air campaign is working and working well,'' Clark said.  
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking point in diplomatic efforts to settle the  
Kosovo crisis concerns what kind of peacekeeping force would 
protect returning ethnic Albanian refugees, 675,000 of whom have 
fled Kosovo since the air campaign began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has offered to accept a small U.N. force and insisted  
that some 11,000 Serb troops remain in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 40,000 soldiers and special police are there now  
and stand accused of brutal attacks and atrocities on ethnic 
Albanian civilians. NATO has demanded the withdrawal of all Serb 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army special anti-terrorist unit ``liquidated'' four  
and captured one member of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation 
Army on Wednesday, Serb television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton rejected Milosevic's suggestion that a peacekeeping  
force exclude NATO countries involved in the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't go back home without the United States and NATO,  
without our allies being involved in it,'' Clinton said in an 
interview granted to NBC aboard Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also met with three U.S. POWs freed over the weekend by  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who is traveling with Clinton,  
said the United States is prepared to release two captured Yugoslav 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials also stood firm in their defiance.  
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said Yugoslavia will  
pull some of its forces out of Kosovo only after NATO troops leave 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Vujovic also said an unarmed U.N. mission in Kosovo was  
possible, but its composition and mandate and other details could 
be decided upon only by the United Nations and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 675,000 mostly ethnic Albanian refugees, or about  
one-third of Kosovo's population, have poured out of Kosovo since 
the airstrikes began. Many say they were expelled by Serb forces 
into neighboring Albania and Macedonia, which closed its border at 
Blace on Wednesday, saying it would only let in the same number as 
were flown out of the country each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian leader Rugova and his family arrived in Rome as  
guests of the government, Italian officials said. Rugova, believed 
to have been under virtual house arrest in Yugoslavia, met Italy's 
premier and other officials shortly after arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova helped negotiate the Rambouillet peace accord that was  
rejected in February by Serb delegates. Since then, he has held a 
series of meetings with senior Serbian officials, purportedly to 
work out a political settlement, but basically on Belgrade's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic said recently that he hoped to broker a peace  
agreement with Rugova, who was shown meeting with the Yugoslav 
leader on Serb TV earlier in the NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A convoy from the Greek branch of Doctors of the World (Medecins  
du Monde), meanwhile, was hit by a bomb Wednesday inside Kosovo on 
its way from Macedonia to Pristina, the humanitarian group said. No 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO denied Yugoslav claims it hit the convoy of three trucks  
and a jeep carrying medicine to a Pristina hospital.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Ready To Go After NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After winning their second Central Division  
title, the Indiana Pacers are ready to go after a bigger prize -- 
the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the fun begins,'' Mark Jackson said. ``This is what we've  
been working for for months, even when there was a lockout and we 
held our own practices so we'd be ready when the season began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Indiana's early preparation -- not to mention the  
retirement of Michael Jordan and the breakup of the defending 
champion Chicago Bulls -- that made the Pacers the early favorites. 
After losing to Chicago in the seventh and final game of the 
Eastern Conference series last year, the Pacers were determined to 
come back stronger this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams were not allowed to hold formal practices with their  
coaches during the lockout last summer and fall, but most of the 
Pacers stayed in town and worked out together on their own. Were it 
not for five one-point losses in late March and early April the 
Pacers (33-17) would have the best record in the East and a 
guaranteed home-court advantage through the first three rounds of 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Their sixth one-point loss, to Orlando on April 27, was their  
final defeat of the regular season. They came back with a pair of 
overtime wins against Charlotte and Atlanta, then blew out New York 
by 23 points and, in the final regular-season game Tuesday night, 
beat Cleveland by 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``These last two games I don't think we even needed our starting  
five back in the game in the fourth quarter,'' said Rik Smits. ``We 
took care of things early. That's nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to have been the favorite from the beginning this  
year,'' Smits added. ``Obviously, we haven't done as well as we 
should have. Maybe this underdog role will fit us better. We've 
always done well with it in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team took Wednesday off and will begin practice for the  
playoffs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud we won the division championship. It was one of  
our goals,'' said Jackson, whose first season with Indiana also 
produced a Central Division title in 1995. ``We didn't achieve some 
of the others we set, so now we've got to go after them in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a seasoned team. We know what the playoffs are all  
about, and now we've got to go out and perform like we are capable 
of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers reached the Eastern Conference championship series in  
1994, 1995 and 1998, losing each time in the seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finishing with four (victories) in a row was good, and in the  
fashion that we won, two overtime games in a row and two blowouts 
at home,'' Reggie Miller said. ``It's a good indication, it's a 
good sign. Our defense is really starting to step up, which is 
probably the most important thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to win a championship this year, our defense  
has to really come each and every night,'' Miller said. ``I'm sure 
we can play much better. In the past we have. If we can build on 
this, then I'll be happy.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Limits Class-Action Suit Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal courts would have a bigger say in  
how class-action lawsuits are conducted under a bill intended to 
curb abuses of cases that can include large numbers of plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unethical attorneys representing a group of plaintiffs sometimes  
arrange their cases so that they receive fees so large they leave 
their clients with little or nothing, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, 
and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said Tuesday during a Senate 
subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill they have introduced would set new rules for class-action  
suits and allow many of them to be moved from state to federal 
courts, where class-action rules are stricter. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more people recognize that the class action system is  
being abused, and that the people who are supposed to be helped by 
this process are instead getting used,'' Grassley said at a hearing 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on administrative 
oversight and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department objected to the bill, arguing that  
pushing a lot of cases from into federal court would not 
necessarily solve any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing magical about federal courts,'' said Eleanor  
Acheson, a Justice Department assistant attorney general. ``We do 
not believe that federal policy on class actions is sacrosanct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also opposing the bill is Public Citizen Litigation Group, the  
litigating arm of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is ``an unwise and ill-considered incursion by the  
federal government on the jurisdiction of the state courts,'' Brian 
Wolfman, a group attorney, said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and Kohl said they were taking aim against attorneys  
who mislead their clients into taking settlements that offer them 
little of value or even cost them money, while their lawyers pocket 
bill fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard about settlements where plaintiffs receive coupons of  
little value or redemption restrictions making them practically 
useless, yet their attorneys receive millions of dollars in 
attorneys' fees,'' Grassley said. ``We heard about lawyers using 
the state court system to get the lowest settlement amount possible 
for defendants and the highest amount in attorneys fees for 
plaintiff class lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohl said one of his constituents won a little over $4 as her  
share in a class-action lawsuit against her mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, her lawyers charged her $80 for their work.  
``In total, her lawyers managed to pocket over $8 million in fees, 
but never explained to the court or to their own clients that the 
class -- not the defendant -- would pay the attorneys' fees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require that state attorneys general be notified of any  
proposed class settlement affects their residents so they can 
object if the settlement terms are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	--Penalize frivolous class action filings by requiring courts to  
impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that attorney fees be based on a reasonable percentage  
of damages paid to class members. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow more class-action lawsuits to be moved from state court,  
either by a defendant or unnamed class member, to federal court. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kentucky: We're Not Ducking Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky responded angrily Wednesday to  
charges of ducking an early season basketball date with Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple assistant athletic director Lynn Snyder said Tuesday that  
the Wildcats had refused to play the Owls in the Dec. 30 Sugar Bowl 
Classic doubleheader in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want to play us, which was very disappointing to  
us and to the Sugar Bowl,'' Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky basketball spokesman Brooks Downing said Wednesday that  
the school has no say in whom it plays in the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to the Sugar Bowl committee,'' Downing said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sugar Bowl Classic is part of the festivities leading up to  
the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl, which will have the nation's two top-ranked 
college football teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Kentucky players, starting center Michael Bradley and backup  
guard Ryan Hogan, announced last week that they were transferring, 
and Snyder said he was told Kentucky didn't want to play another 
top team after playing a tough nonconference schedule last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess (Kentucky coach Tubby Smith) lost a couple of  
players,'' Temple coach John Chaney said. ``He's got a tough time. 
They don't want to play us. I can't get in their heads and know 
why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downing called such claims preposterous.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have played one of the toughest schedules on an annual  
basis over the last few years,'' he said. ``For us to be accused of 
ducking anyone is almost ludicrous.''

<HEADLINE> First American, Valhol at Pimlico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Valhol and First American, who both finished  
back in the pack at the Kentucky Derby, arrived at Pimlico on 
Wednesday in preparation for the Preakness on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol finished 15th and First American 16th in the Derby, won  
by 31-1 shot Charismatic. Until Wednesday, it was unclear where 
either horse would race next. 
</P>
<P>
	First American, like many in the Derby field of 19, ran into  
trouble at the start and never got going. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made his move in the stretch, but by that time there was no  
more horse. He had nothing left,'' trainer Eduardo Caramori said 
Wednesday. ``He's fit, and we thought he was ready. So we're going 
to try again like everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First American jogged Monday and galloped Tuesday before being  
shipped from Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to make sure he was fine. He is. Nothing  
happened to him,'' Caramori said. 
</P>
<P>
	First American will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, who was on  
the horse in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol, the Arkansas Derby winner whose jockey Billy Patin was  
accused of carrying an illegal electrical device, was ridden in the 
Derby by Willie Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	A full field of 14 3-year-olds is expected in the Preakness. If  
more enter, the field will be determined based on earnings from all 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those set for the Preakness are the top four Derby  
finishers -- Charismatic, Menifee, Cat Thief and Prime Timber, 
trained by Bob Baffert, who also is considering running the filly 
Silverbulletday, winner of the Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Derby horses headed for Pimlico include Adonis, Stephen  
Got Even, Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid, Worldly Manner. Vicar 
remains a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Other non-Derby horses ready to try the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness  
include Badge and Patience Game.

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies As Twisters Hit Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- People who fled neighborhoods that suffered  
the worst damage in Oklahoma's deadliest tornadoes in five decades 
started returning today, many of them finding only rubble where 
their homes had stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homes had been destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
	Police had kept the hardest-hit areas of southwestern Oklahoma  
City off limits until today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, hundreds of cars lined up bumper to bumper at a  
police checkpoint, where they had to show identification and prove 
that they lived in the neighborhood before they could be allowed 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned residents of some other areas had been allowed in  
Tuesday to search for precious mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes killed at least 43 people in Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday. More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas 
on Tuesday, killing one more person. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds more were injured as entire communities were reduced to  
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Destruction was most severe in Oklahoma County, which includes  
Oklahoma City and half a dozen other communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's strictly just a guess but we are thinking between 2,000  
and 3,000 houses (demolished). I don't have any estimates on 
businesses,'' David Van Nostrand, director of the Oklahoma County 
Emergency Management Office, said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,500 businesses and homes in Kansas were destroyed or  
heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those with major losses from Monday's storm was Jon  
Hansen, the assistant Oklahoma City fire chief who also was the 
fire department spokesman during the downtown federal building 
bombing. He lost most of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably have to destroyed. I can't live there again.  
But it is not as bad as some of the others guys around here,'' 
Hansen said. ``I am really fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the wreckage on Tuesday, Hansen said, he was able to rescue  
his daughter's gold fish and gerbil. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of Monday's outbreak of 76 twisters, one that was at least a  
half-mile wide struck parts of Oklahoma City with wind estimated at 
more than 260 mph, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration said. The tornado was classified an F5, the most 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	It carved a 19-mile gash through the area, killing at least 38  
people. Tornadoes in Kansas killed five people, including a 
month-old baby in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary estimate from the Southwestern Insurance  
Information Service, an industry trade group, said insured losses 
in Oklahoma City could reach $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Van Nostrand disputed that. ``We probably will never give  
you a dollar figure simply because we can't be sure it's 
accurate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem with locating and assessing the damage, Van Nostrand  
said, is that the tornado destroyed virtually all of the street 
signs and addresses in the affected neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeastern Texas late Tuesday, a tornado damaged about 150  
buildings and injured at least 14 people in the town of DeKalb. A 
woman was killed in neighboring Titus County. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I remember is that the lights went off and the  
roof came off,'' said James Sckittone, 18. ``Everybody started 
crying and praying. It looked like an atomic bomb fell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Arkansas, thunderstorms also spawned tornadoes,  
large hail and heavy rain Tuesday, leaving thousands of people 
without electricity. Several houses and a church were damaged. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's tornado outbreak was the nation's deadliest since 42  
people were killed last year in Florida. It was also the deadliest 
to hit Oklahoma since 1947, when a twister killed 113 people in 
Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and James Lee Witt, head of the  
Federal Emergency Management Agency, surveyed the damage Tuesday. 
President Clinton, who has declared 11 Oklahoma counties disaster 
areas, is expected to visit the stricken area Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Midwest City senior center, Belinda Bentley of the  
Heartland Rescue Care Team loaded up cases of bottled water. She 
said many of the businesses that have donated food and supplies 
also helped out after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again it's Oklahoma, and we're all working together,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists May Learn From Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Scientists hope to find clues to unlock  
the mysteries of deadly twisters amid the rubble of tornado-ravaged 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The system that tore through the state might be especially  
revealing because it produced so many twisters and was tracked for 
so long by radar, researchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many things that are special and even historic about  
this storm,'' said Texas Tech meteorologist Steve Weinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from Texas Tech hope to find the Holy Grail of  
tornado research -- the key to using radar to predict the path of 
the twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	While storm chasers traditionally are interested with what  
causes one storm to produce a tornado while another fizzles, 
``rubble rooters'' in Oklahoma are trying to find better ways to 
warn people which tornadoes are going to pose a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to learn from looking at the path of the tornado, with  
the goal of being able to look at a radar and know how powerful it 
is and where it's going,'' Weinbeck said. ``Right now, people have 
to rely on reports from the ground. If you could get that from 
radar, you'd get more emergency personnel where it's needed, as 
it's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Texas Tech teams are combing through the rubble to learn  
which rooms in a house are most likely to survive twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among all the devastation there is usually a safe area in  
homes,'' said researcher Larry Tanner. ``We seem to find that many 
times a small interior space towards the middle of the home can 
withstand incredible devastation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be because rooms in the center of the house benefit  
from all of the house's structural support, Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the destroyed homes in Oklahoma seem to support the theory  
that a tornado strips a house in layers, working toward the center.

<HEADLINE> National Geographic in TV Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National Geographic is teaming up with Fox and  
NBC to expand its overseas TV operations and lay the groundwork for 
a cable network in the United States to compete with popular nature 
channels like Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear when the U.S. channel might be launched, but the  
joint venture announced Wednesday gives National Geographic, 
publisher of the venerable wildlife and exploration magazine, the 
backing of two experienced players in the American television 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fox and NBC, the arrangement provides a well-known brand  
name to ensure broad appeal overseas, where the success of programs 
can vary widely from country to country. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the strength of the National Geographic name would be  
an advantage in going up against U.S. competitors like Discovery 
and Animal Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have in National Geographic is the ultimate global  
brand,'' NBC executive Tom Rogers told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	National Geographic already has partnerships with NBC in Asia  
and the Middle East, and with NBC and Fox's affiliate BSkyB in 
Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, owned largely by Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch,  
will own half of the new venture with National Geographic, which 
will own a 25 percent stake. NBC, which is a subsidiary of General 
Electric Co., will also own 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other financial terms, such as the size of the investments in  
the venture, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	National Geographic first launched its television operations  
during the fall of 1997, starting overseas, where it's easier to 
get regulatory clearance than in the United States. Since then, its 
has expanded quickly into 54 countries, reaching nearly 40 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The new partnership marks the latest move by National Geographic  
beyond its traditional role as a magazine publisher and producer of 
PBS-style documentaries and the long-running TV show ``Explorer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Geographic recently released its first feature film,  
``Mysteries of Egpyt,'' which is playing in IMAX theaters, and has 
been beefing up its online presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Conscious of the need to protect its image, National Geographic  
has retained full editorial control of the programming that goes 
out on its channels. 
</P>
<P>
	In order not to jeopardize the nonprofit status of its parent  
organization, the 111-year old National Geographic Society, most of 
National Geographic's profit-making businesses are gathered under a 
company named National Geographic Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Allen, president of National Geographic Ventures, said that  
in a world flooded with information, National Geographic could 
prove successful at quenching ``a thirst for authenticity, depth 
and thoughtfulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What our viewers expect is the same level of reliability and  
engagement, and we've provided that in every medium we've operated 
in,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reports Economy at Strong Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers are bouncing back from a  
slump caused by economic troubles abroad, the Federal Reserve said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most districts report recent improvement in the manufacturing  
sector,'' the nation's central bank said in its latest survey of 
regional economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories benefited as American consumers, feeling secure about  
their jobs, spent more than they did last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong  
levels and to expand at a moderate pace,'' the Fed said in its 
``beige book'' report, named for the color of its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The compilation of anecdotal information is collected by the  
Fed's 12 regional branches for the benefit of Fed policy-makers, 
who are scheduled to meet next on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	With consumer demand so strong, analysts have been watching for  
signs of inflation that might compel the Fed to raise interest 
rates. However, the regional branches' reports on conditions across 
the country through April 26 indicated that prices generally remain 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Improvement in manufacturing was broad-based, the Fed said --  
from increased demand for medical and automotive equipment reported 
by the Boston bank, to stable orders for computers and 
telecommunications equipment noted in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	One persistent weak spot was identified by the Atlanta bank --  
apparel production and orders remain low because of ``fierce 
foreign competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe into  
recession has severely cut into American exports and also exposed 
U.S. manufacturers to increased competition from lower-priced 
foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has been performing well,  
manufacturers have been forced to cut more than 300,000 jobs in the 
past year as the U.S. trade deficit hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	However, brisk spending by American consumers -- fueled by  
overall low unemployment and stock market gains -- has cushioned the 
blow and kept the U.S. economy growing at a robust 4.5 percent 
annual rate during the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said  
orders to U.S. factories rose 2.0 percent in March to a seasonally 
adjusted $350 billion, following a 1.8 percent drop in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the February setback, orders during the first three  
months of 1999 were 3.6 percent higher than in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does look as if the effect of the global economic shock,  
which was felt in manufacturing, ... seems to be wearing away,'' 
said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors rallied once the Fed's report was released  
Wednesday afternoon, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 69 
points to close at 10,955, after dragging it down by more than 100 
points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment is so low that many parts of the country are  
experiencing labor shortages, the Fed said. But it said there were 
no reports of significant pickup in wage increases, which can be an 
early warning sign that inflationary pressure is building. Instead, 
some companies are improving their benefits and offering hiring and 
retention bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident consumers are spending on luxury items, notably cars.  
Home sales and residential construction also remain strong. 
Commercial building projects are continuing at a good clip too, 
although some areas, including Atlanta, reported slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said rising prices for building materials, oil and gas  
were exceptions to low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, farmers are still being hurt by low international  
commodity prices, the Chicago bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The March increase in factory orders was led by a 2.9 percent  
jump in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to 
last three or more years. That followed a 3.9 percent drop in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders were up for transportation equipment, including motor  
vehicles and parts, industrial equipment and machinery, electronic 
and other electrical equipment, and primary metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for nondurable goods also rose in March, by 0.8 percent,  
building on a 1.1 percent February rise. Petroleum and coal 
products, food, tobacco and chemical orders were all up, but orders 
for textiles and paper products fell.

<HEADLINE> $5.4M Radiation Case Settlement Ok'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal judge has approved a $5.4 million  
settlement of lawsuits by families of cancer patients who subjected 
to Cold War radiation experiments by University of Cincinnati 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit charged that the approximately 90 cancer patients  
who received radiation treatments from 1960 to 1972 in Cincinnati 
were not fully informed of the risks, or told that the Defense 
Department was getting the results to learn what might happen to 
troops exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the plaintiffs has died. The defendants never  
conceded that the experiments contributed to the deaths of the 
patients, who already had advanced cases of cancer when they 
underwent experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Eugene Saenger, one of the chief researchers, has said his  
main objective was to study experimental treatments for patients 
with inoperable cancer to see if he could stop the growth of 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The university administration believes the research was  
appropriate and there was no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement approved Tuesday gives each of the families about  
$50,000, plus the right to have the patient from their family 
listed on a plaque in a courtyard at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Foster, a Cincinnati woman whose grandmother Parthenia  
Marshall, 82, died in 1982 after receiving the radiation 
bombardments, said Tuesday she is pleased with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad it's over,'' Ms. Foster said.  
</P>
<P>
	The case puts researchers on notice that people who are  
experimented on must be told what is being done to them and why, 
said Robert Newman, a lawyer for about 50 plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government can't trick people into being part of a drug trial  
or a psychological experiment or radiation experiment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon paid $651,000 -- about 60 percent of the funding --  
for the results of the experiments. The government, the university, 
the researchers and the city will pay the settlement. The hospital 
where the tests were conducted was formerly run by the city and 
then by the university.

<HEADLINE> FTC: Dura Lube Claims Misleading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dura Lube products claiming to reduce engine  
wear by half, lower emissions and improve gas mileage when added to 
motor oil are misleading and unsubstantiated, the government 
charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission said the makers of Dura Lube--  
Herman Howard, Scott Howard and the six companies they control -- 
will face an administrative trial for violating federal law with 
false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the complaint, ads for Dura Lube claimed it could  
prolong engine life and reduce the risk of serious engine damage 
compared to using motor oil alone. Promotional materials also 
indicated that tests had established such performance results as 
reduced engine wear and improved gas mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission denied that tests actually corroborated these  
claims and charged the company with false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Howard, chief executive officer of Dura Lube, said his  
company stands behind the claims made about the product and that 
extensive testing has been done to corroborate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done testing and testing and testing. It's been a very  
costly thing,'' said Howard, of the Stamford, Conn.-based company. 
``We're going to vigorously defend against the charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission said Dura Lube ran advertising for years  
without doing the appropriate testing and only began tests after 
being contacted by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not getting good results,'' said Mary Engle,  
assistant director of the enforcement division for the FTC's bureau 
of consumer protection. ``They haven't shown the results that 
support their claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dura Lube -- which manufactures Super Engine Treatment and  
Advanced Engine Treatment -- is one of the largest engine treatment 
companies in the country and sells its products through 
infomercials and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission labeled the company's promotional endorsements --  
including one featuring a former NASA astronaut endorsing the 
product based on testing -- as false. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FTC alleged that Dura Lube said its products  
had been tested by the Environmental Protection Agency, when they 
had not. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is seeking to bar unsubstantiated performance  
claims about the product and to prohibit misleading ads. An 
administrative trial will be scheduled for some time in during the 
next year.

<HEADLINE> Computer Problems Cancel Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Computer problems today at the main air traffic  
control center for O'Hare International and Midway airports caused 
numerous flight delays and cancellations for passengers traveling 
into and out of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the software problem was fixed by late morning, flight  
backups were expected to continue throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeoffs and landings were delayed for an hour or more, said  
Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Monique Bond. She did not 
know how many flights were delayed or how many, if any, were 
diverted from the airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started when the Tracon Center in Elgin tested new  
software that displays a plane's size on radar screens, said Tony 
Molinaro, a spokesman at the Federal Aviation Administration's 
Great Lakes office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, controllers never lost sight of planes and did not lose  
communication with planes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines canceled 25 percent -- 164 -- of its afternoon  
flights into and out of O'Hare, said spokeswoman Kristina Price. 
American Airlines canceled 42 of its 337 flights, said spokeswoman 
Mary Frances Fagan.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Ravages Okla. Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- Mickie Hansen sat in borrowed  
clothes, digging with a butcher knife at the ground where her home 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baby, you're not going to find anything,'' her husband, Mike,  
offered gently. 
</P>
<P>
	But she kept digging, searching for a missing ring, a treasured  
belt buckle, anything that hadn't been swept away when a tornado 
roared through this small community 30 miles southwest of Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three trailers, a barn, dogs. We have nothing now,'' she said,  
stabbing at the ground. ``Nothing was insured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bridge Creek is an unincorporated town of two churches, a school  
and 8,000 scattered residents. The tornadoes that left at least 38 
dead across the state started the fatal assault here, killing 11 
people. Four were still missing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grady County Sheriff Stan Florence said the twister that cut  
through Bridge Creek went on a six-mile rampage and grew to a mile 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Merschon, who took shelter with his wife and daughter, was  
listening to radio reports about stormy weather Monday when the 
enormous wedge-shaped tornado topped the hill across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	It hit his home with a ferocious roar, shattering windows,  
ripping away part of the roof. In a minute, it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you do?'' he said with a shrug as he picked through  
the mud-covered wreckage of his house. ``I feel fortunate. 
Everyone's alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He marveled at what was not destroyed: a ceramic teapot sat  
unscathed in front of a broken window. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street at the Ridgecrest Baptist Church, two day-care  
workers, who had shuffled the last of the children home before the 
storm hit, emerged unharmed from a supply closet. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the church lay in a mangled metal heap. Its  
brand-new 15-passenger van was tossed into what was once the 
sanctuary. A grand piano, minus its legs, rested in orange mud. 
</P>
<P>
	Twisted metal rods that once formed the roof clanked noisily in  
the wind as the Rev. Tom Duckett tried to salvage church records 
and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologized for the mud on his hands. He stressed that the  
church is its people, not a building. He said he didn't know where 
the church would gather next. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth of the matter is I don't understand natural  
disasters,'' he said. ``What I do know is that the Lord will heal. 
He'll bring good from the worst of situations. We'll wait to see 
what he does with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duckett worried that friends could be among the dead. Grady  
County authorities said one victim was as young as 5 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know every death will hit us here,'' Duckett said of the  
close-knit community where church and school are the focus of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen, who fled to a neighbor's house with his family just  
ahead of the storm, returned to see the bodies of neighbors lying 
in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been trying to start a small trailer park. But nothing  
remained Tuesday. Even his carefully tended Bermuda grass lawn had 
been vacuumed away, leaving a path of stark red clay winding to the 
next hillside. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaves were stripped from a thick stand of trees bordering  
his property, along with the bark. The scent of fresh-cut wood 
filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think the trees will ever come back?'' Hansen's  
11-year-old son, Justin, asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't think so,'' he answered. ``But if we rebuild,  
we'll put in an underground house. And we'll plant a tree on top.''

<HEADLINE> Six Flags Owner To Buy White Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The owner of the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement  
park has agreed to buy the troubled White Water-Atlanta Water Park 
and American Adventures Entertainment Park, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Parks, which has corporate offices in New York and  
Oklahoma City, will buy the two attractions for an undisclosed 
amount within a month, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Water parks work well in combination with theme parks,'' said  
Gary Story, president of Six Flags Theme Parks. He said his company 
has wanted to add a water park since it bought Six Flags Over 
Georgia a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both recognized rather than building a water park at Six  
Flags and being in a head-to-head battle, it made more sense to 
buy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Dollar City, which owns White Water and American  
Adventures, also runs Stone Mountain Park in DeKalb County under a 
contract with the state. The Branson, Mo.-based company is being 
sued by four families whose children became ill at the water park 
last summer during an outbreak of E. coli.

<HEADLINE> Internet Portals See Big Payoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Watching the Internet explode around him,  
Vincent Schiavone quietly began buying domain names that began with 
the number four: 4wine.com, 4babies.com, 4soccer.com, 
4anything.com. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday -- three years after the Philadelphia entrepreneur  
began buying ``4'' domains -- Schiavone will officially launch 
4anything.com, adding yet another portal to burgeoning market led 
by companies like Yahoo! Inc. and Excite Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet, as hot as it is, is really still in its  
infancy,'' said Schiavone on Tuesday at an Internet commerce 
conference in San Francisco. ``We want to lead the second wave of 
portals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portals are the entry points for users to venture onto the  
Internet. Consumers use them to find a wealth of online services 
such as free e-mail, news, chat and personalized functions like 
stock quotes, local weather and sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prosperous world of the Internet, portals have seen big  
payoffs. They make money selling advertisements, and by pointing 
customers to businesses. New York-based Jupiter Communications 
estimates that online retail sales generated by portal sites will 
represent $2.4 billion out of the $13 billion total projected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the market has evolved, companies such as Yahoo! and America  
Online Inc. have become dominant, becoming among the most visited 
sites on the Internet. Others, such as Excite Inc., have been 
acquired by companies eager to tap into the portals' power.. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the established portals are geared toward the average  
Web surfer, offering a wide range of options. Now a new era of more 
sophisticated portals -- dozens of them -- are searching out a much 
more targeted audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first come on the Internet, they are so  
overwhelmed by all the information that these big established 
portals serve a very important function as a funnel. But as users 
become more savvy, they realize these portals have editorial 
slants, or are simply too broad, for what they need,'' said 
Jonathan Yarmis, an eMarketWorld executive vice president from 
Richmond, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Long Island, N.Y., cousins Andrew, 32, and Steven,  
26, Deitch scraped together $10,000 to launch FreeWebCentral 
specifically for business visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical section doesn't focus on self help tips. Instead,  
they publish drug databases and the full text of scientific journal 
articles. The stock area includes a ticker tape, global clocks and 
a stock split calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular spot is a link to unclaimed bank, dividend and  
tuition accounts gathered from state comptrollers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4anything.com, Schiavone said his users are going to be  
consumers who don't want the obscure and bizarre items buried deep 
in the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not giving them the volume of the Web,'' he said.  
``We're going through that volume ourselves, and just giving our 
users the best of the Web.''

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson Honored by Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The music has ended, the lights are back on and  
the Chicago Bulls' ``Last Dance'' is now truly over. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 11 months after winning their sixth championship, former  
coach Phil Jackson returned to the United Center on Wednesday night 
for a halftime ceremony in his honor. A banner commemorating his 
nine years with the Bulls was unveiled, hanging right next to 
Michael Jordan's in the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked last year about it being the last dance and what a  
wonderful last dance we were going to have. And it was just a 
terrific season, a wonderful year for us,'' Jackson said. ``This is 
the final groping after the last song has been sung and we're ready 
to go home from that dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time, didn't we?''  
</P>
<P>
	And then Jackson was gone, leaving the floor for good with his  
family as a Grateful Dead song began playing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lovefest the likes of which hasn't been seen in a year.  
Jackson got a standing ovation when he was introduced, and fans 
remained standing for the 20-minute ceremony. His former assistants 
were there, as were Bill Fitch, his college coach, and former Sen. 
Bill Bradley, his New York Knicks teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been looking forward to this all year long. It's about  
the only thing I have looked forward to,'' Tex Winter, an assistant 
to Jackson and new coach Tim Floyd, said as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Michael Jordan sent his regards.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you get another job somewhere else, you'll always be  
known as the Chicago Bulls' head coach,'' Jordan said in a 
videotaped greeting. ``So I wish you the best. If you need me, give 
me a yell. But not for playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only blemish was when fans booed as Jackson thanked chairman  
Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, who were in the 
United Center, but not on the floor with all the other dignitaries. 
Fans blame Reinsdorf and Krause for driving Jackson away and 
breaking up the six-time champions. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more boos when Winter said it won't be long before  
Jackson is back on the floor -- somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question he's one of the great coaches of all time,''  
Winter said. ``If he doesn't become the Secretary of the Interior, 
he'll be coaching somewhere else pretty soon, I'm afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In nine seasons with the Bulls, Jackson compiled a 545-193  
record and was coach of all six of their championship teams. He has 
higher winning percentages, .738 overall and .733 in the playoffs, 
of any coach in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jackson roared off on his Harley-Davidson last June, he was  
burned out and disillusioned. His squabbles with Krause had reached 
the point where they couldn't work together anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wondered if he'd ever want to coach again, he found  
over the past few months that he's still drawn to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very comfortable in saying it was real easy for me to  
sit back and observe a game here or there and not go to any arenas 
and just see basketball for what it's worth,'' he said. ``In that 
regard, the game has lost something. 
</P>
<P>
	``But basketball is right now a sport in which many people say  
it still needs leadership and direction from coaching, and that is 
an arena that intrigues me still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might sit out another year and help with Bradley's  
campaign, but everything he said points to him returning. Some 
teams already have contacted him through his attorney, Todd 
Musburger, but there haven't been any serious negotiations nor has 
Jackson made any decisions. That will come when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson admits the thought of coaching without Jordan intrigues  
him, though that won't be the reason he returns. He still loves the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not anxious, I'm not chomping at the bit to get back and  
prove my mettle as a coach without Michael Jordan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he won't take just any job. The money, city, players and  
opportunity to win all need to be right, as does the structure of 
the organization. He'll want some control over personnel decisions, 
something he didn't have in Chicago, but doesn't want the other 
duties a general manager has. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's rancor toward Krause seems to have faded with his time  
off, and he said he never had any problem with Reinsdorf. He talks 
to Winter and assistant Frank Hamblen on a regular basis, and 
occasionally to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	He's even watched a few Bulls games -- three, to be exact -- and  
admits it's a little strange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's been heartrending to see them lose to the Miami  
Heat with only 49 points. But they won last Saturday with 101,'' he 
said. ``(But) I think I was spared a lot of remorse probably and a 
lot of heartache perhaps. ... In my regard, it was something for 
myself in which I wasn't going to be able to compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's got no doubt the Bulls would have been ``at the top  
of the heap'' if they'd stayed together one more year, he has no 
regrets about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad about retiring at the appropriate time,'' he said.  
``I have no regrets at all. I don't think there could have been a 
greater scenario than to have been part of this thing.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Linebacker Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Lorenzo Ferguson, who started every game  
at linebacker for Virginia Tech last season, was suspended 
indefinitely from the team, the school's athletic department said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the department would release no further information,  
campus police said Ferguson, 21, was arrested Tuesday and charged 
with two counts of breaking and entering, two counts of forgery and 
three counts of misdemeanor petty larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech Police Chief Mike Jones said two checks and a wallet were  
stolen from three rooms in a university dormitory April 13. 
Ferguson allegedly made out both checks to himself for $75, forged 
the victims' signatures on the documents and deposited them into 
his account at the Virginia Tech Credit Union, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson was arraigned Wednesday in Montgomery County General  
District Court and released on $8,500 bond, pending a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, a redshirt sophomore from Chesapeake, Va., was third  
on the Hokies with 80 tackles last season. He also had three 
interceptions, all of them in Virginia Tech's early season 37-0 
victory against Clemson.

<HEADLINE> Father's Name Added to Son's on Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The name of an Air Force sergeant killed in  
Saigon in 1956 -- before the conflict in Vietnam became a 
large-scale war -- was added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech. Sgt. Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr. was the first known U.S.  
casualty of the Vietnam War. Inscription of his name on the 
memorial also marks the only time a father and son have been 
honored there together. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgibbon's son, Marine Lance Cpl. Richard B. Fitzgibbon III,  
was killed in action in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgibbon's family and friends worked 15 years to have his name  
added to the V-shaped, black memorial where names of those killed 
in the war are grouped by year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon and the nonprofit group that administers the  
memorial initially said Fitzgibbon was not eligible, because the 
cutoff date was Jan. 1, 1961. In agreeing last year to add 
Fitzgibbon's name to the 58,191 already on the ``Wall,'' the 
Pentagon said it has revised the eligibility date to November, 
1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``An extensive search of the records indicates they were the  
only American father and son service members to die in Vietnam,'' 
the Pentagon said in a statement last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Fitzgibbon was a member of the Military Assistance  
Advisory Group in Vietnam. The Pentagon statement said he died ``in 
the line of duty,'' but it did not exactly state how he died. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pentagon had used 1961 as the date for the official  
commencement of the war in Vietnam. This ceremony is evidence that 
the United States was fully engaged in Vietnam in 1956,'' said Rep. 
Edward Markey, D-Mass., who lobbied for adding Fitzgibbon's name to 
the Wall.

<HEADLINE> Devils Clueless to Playoff Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Wondering how the New Jersey Devils  
can post the best record in the Eastern Conference in the regular 
season and then flop in the playoffs in each of the past three 
seasons? 
</P>
<P>
	You're not alone. They don't have a clue either.  
</P>
<P>
	Promising not to overreact but insisting he would make any move  
deemed necessary, general manager Lou Lamoriello promised on 
Wednesday to take a close look at his team after its second 
straight first-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Penguins were the latest to embarrass the Devils,  
beating them 4-2 in the deciding Game 7 on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an organization today that is satisfied,''  
Lamoriello said. ``This is an organization that is expected to win 
and should win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils have only done that in one series since winning the  
Stanley Cup in 1995. They missed the playoffs in 1996 and they were 
beaten in the second round by the New York Rangers the following 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two playoffs have been disasters. The upstart Ottawa  
Senators thoroughly outplayed New Jersey in the first round last 
year, a result that led to Jacques Lemaire's resignation as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Ftorek's new system created a more offensive-minded team,  
but the postseason was again a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think personally this team is fine,'' said center Bobby  
Holik, who led New Jersey with seven postseason points, all 
assists. ``We don't have a lack of talent, skill or size or depth 
or anything else. We have a lack discipline and concentration, but 
not all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holik isn't the only one who feels the Devils have the talent to  
win another Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every guy here has the will and wants to win,'' said Devils  
defenseman Scott Niedermayer. ``Mentally we're not on the right 
track. That's the only answer I can come up with and I know it's 
not a good answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are positives to be taken out of this season that saw the  
Devils post a 47-24-11 record, a mark that included an NHL-record 
28 wins on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of the young players developed, particularly the line  
of Jason Arnott (27 goals), Petr Sykora (29 goals) and Patrik Elias 
(17 goals). Brian Rolston also had a career year with 24 goals, 
while goaltender Martin Brodeur won 39 games in a year where his 
goals against average climbed to 2.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some changes are expected. Left wing Dave Andreychuk and center  
Bobby Carpenter are both unrestricted free agents. There is a good 
chance neither will be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils also have seven restricted free agents, including  
Arnott, Rolston and Elias. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we have the necessary tools and ingredients to go  
forward,'' Lamoriello said. ``We just have to find out some reasons 
why it didn't happen the last two years and go forward. But we are 
not going to accept and just stay pat and stand still and hope.''

<HEADLINE> Slain Reporters' Names Memorialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Unlike most Washington area memorials  
built to honor heroes long dead, the one to slain journalists is 
destined to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	That fact and the addition of the names of 29 editors,  
reporters, photographers and broadcasters killed last year made it 
a solemn service for relatives and friends gathered at the 
shimmering glass and aluminum memorial Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish that this wall could be like the other great monuments  
in our capital -- unchanging, commemorating the past, fixed in time, 
instead of the expanding, growing list that we all know will never 
be closed,'' said Kati Marton, journalist and author who addressed 
the memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial stands amid tall  
buildings on a second-story plaza near the Newseum journalism 
museum, across the Potomac River from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our celebrity-drenched age, where journalists often think  
they're bigger than the stories they cover, these 29 reporters 
stand out as permanent reminders of our beloved profession's old 
values,'' Ms. Marton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She criticized ``the last few years of obsessive preoccupation  
... with stories of celebrity mayhem and sex scandals in high 
places.'' With the Kosovo crisis, she said, ``The world has once 
again reminded us that it is much too dangerous a place to turn 
news into entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony that mixed honors for slain journalists with  
warnings for an increasingly dangerous profession, the Freedom 
Forum rededicated the monument that now contains more than 1,000 
names. Some 200 that were overlooked are to be added next year, in 
addition to those who have died or will die this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances of the 1998 deaths varied widely. Mahmoud Saremi,  
the Afghanistan bureau chief for Iran's official news agency, was 
executed by the Taliban militia in Afghanistan. Hope Bartlett, a 
23-year-old Florida TV reporter, was thrown overboard from a boat 
and drowned after removing her lifejacket to tape a segment for a 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members of slain journalists were among those at the  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Mimi Gosney, of Lexington, Ky., showed her son David the name of  
his grandfather, Joe Morton, an Associated Press war correspondent 
killed in Austria in 1945. Others pointed to the names of 
colleagues and friends. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Plain Dealer Editor Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Douglas C. Clifton, executive editor of The Miami  
Herald for eight years, has resigned to become editor of The Plain 
Dealer of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton will replace David Hall, editor of The Plain Dealer  
since 1992, who resigned effective May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug Clifton has the reputation of being one of the best  
editors in the country today, and his record speaks for itself,'' 
said Alex Machaskee, president and publisher of the Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton's departure comes less than a month after the Herald won  
its 16th Pulitzer Prize. The newspaper won for investigative 
reporting for a series of stories that exposed pervasive voter 
fraud in the city's mayoral election, which later was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation also comes at a time when the Herald's  
circulation has been declining and the newspaper has cut costs to 
boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton said Wednesday he had mixed feelings about leaving the  
Herald and its parent company Knight Ridder, where he had worked 
nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was presented with a new challenge, the opportunity to lead  
another strong metropolitan newspaper,'' he said in a statement. 
``I found the lure of a new journalistic challenge irresistible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton, 55, started at the Herald in 1970 on the paper's  
consumer Action Line. He worked as a reporter, city editor and 
deputy managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	He also served as news editor of Knight Ridder's Washington  
bureau and as managing editor of The Charlotte Observer before 
returning to the Herald in 1991 as executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Herald Publisher Alberto Ibarguen called Clifton a strong  
newsroom leader and a driving force behind the Pulitzer coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not a whole lot of editors who are willing to say,  
'Let's put 20 to 25 people on the story,' and that's what it took 
to get the story done,'' Ibarguen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton will leave the newspaper at the end of May. Managing  
Editor Larry Olmstead will run the news operation until a 
replacement is named, Ibarguen said.

<HEADLINE> Last At-Bats for Providence Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I.(AP) -- Freshman outfielder Mike Scott knew this  
was coming since October, but it's still tough accept.	
</P>
<P>
	At the end of May, the Providence College baseball team shuts  
down after 78 years -- a casualty of the school's need to comply 
with Title IX requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the team I love to play for,'' said Scott, who leads  
the Big East Conference in triples. ``It's hard to take it all in, 
believing they could actually do something like this to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Friars (40-13) are third in the conference with a 15-8  
record and looking for a spot in the NCAA tournament. Their last 
regular-season game is May 15, at home against Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friars have had just one losing season this decade (1993),  
won the Big East tournament title in 1992 and the Big East 
regular-season title in 1995. They earned the school's first trips 
to the NCAA tournament in 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is no saving this team.  
</P>
<P>
	The school said in October it was dropping baseball, men's golf  
and men's tennis after the academic year in accordance with Title 
IX, the law barring sex discrimination at institutions receiving 
federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The same kinds of cuts are being made in colleges across the  
country. The NCAA says it is unclear how many baseball teams have 
folded because of Title IX because the organization does not track 
such statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of NCAA schools with baseball teams has remained  
steady at 84 percent, NCAA spokeswoman Kimberly Dixson said. The 
losses of some baseball teams can be offset by other schools 
picking up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school, Scott thought about playing at the  
University of New Hampshire. Then New Hampshire dropped baseball 
and he looked elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they cut the program, my Dad and I looked at PC,'' Scott  
said. ``We both said, `Nah, it'll never happen there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	While more women than men attend Providence, the school has a  
higher percentage of male athletes. Male athletes make up 41 
percent of the students and 54 percent of its athletes. Women make 
up 59 percent of the students and 47 percent of its athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	That disparity would not pass a Title IX test, administration  
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's seven scholarships will be distributed to women's  
soccer, softball, ice hockey and field hockey as baseball players 
graduate or transfer. Operating funds will move to the women's 
athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director John Marinatto said Providence did not have  
the resources to add more women's programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis and men's golf were supposed to be dropped along  
with baseball, but they have been temporarily spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of those two programs have pledged to raise the about  
$10,000 a year for the next three years to allow this year's 
freshmen players to finish their careers at Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to our kids, knowing what they've committed  
to and worked for and the success they've had,'' Providence 
baseball coach Charlie Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Providence's underclassmen on the baseball team aren't  
staying. Scott, a Darien, Conn., native, is transferring to 
Connecticut. Keith Reed, a junior outfielder, probably will be 
selected in June's major league baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our motivation is to win the Big East Tournament, get a bid to  
the (NCAA) regionals and shove it in the face of the 
administration,'' Scott said. ``Just to come back and say, `Look 
what you did, look what you're cutting.'''

<HEADLINE> Cadillac Passes Torch to Lincoln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Cadillac's 48-year rule as the U.S. luxury car  
king is over after all, with GM's apologies to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors said Wednesday it has apologized in writing to  
Ford Motor's Lincoln unit for wrongly reporting in January that 
Cadillacs had outsold Lincolns during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac had claimed that a late-year rally lifted it to the  
title by just a 222-car margin. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM backtracked Wednesday, saying an internal audit showed  
Cadillac's December sales figures were overstated because of an 
improper reporting process. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised final score: Lincoln 187,121-Cadillac 182,570.  
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Jim Farmer said Wednesday the inaccuracy ``was a  
combination of internal control breakdowns and some overzealousness 
on the part of some of our team members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, even Cadillac had expected to lose the sales  
crown. GM ordered the audit after Cadillac's figures were 
questioned, though Wednesday's statement didn't specify by whom. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln spokesman Jim Trainor resisted the temptation to gloat  
about his division's sudden ascension to the luxury crown, 
insisting ``we've never focused on it, so I don't want to go too 
overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, it makes us feel a little better, but we've got other  
things we're focusing on,'' he said. ``This action by Cadillac 
exemplifies the integrity we've always said is the basis for a 
luxury brand. It is another example of what makes this rivalry so 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Farmer said those responsible for the inflated figures have  
been disciplined for succumbing ``to marketing stress to maintain a 
position.'' He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that the inflated delivery report caused the media,  
in particular, to believe that Cadillac dealers had indeed sold 
more vehicles in December -- and thus for the entire 1998 calendar 
year -- than Lincoln,'' Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales 
chief, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning in the marketplace obviously is very important to us,  
but nothing is more important than our integrity, whether it's the 
product we put on the road or how we represent ourselves in the 
reporting of our results. General Motors will assure the process 
for reporting dealer sales will be accurate,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's statement said ``the inaccuracy did not in any way'' affect  
the company's financial reporting, including year-end numbers 
related to production, revenue and income.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin Wants Experts' Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. has turned to a panel of  
experts to figure out why four launches have failed in the past 
eight months, destroying rockets and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of between 10 and 12 experts will conduct a thorough  
review of the company and report its findings by Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the panel members will be drawn from outside the  
company, spokesman James Fetig said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure we got people who were not directly  
associated with the business itself, people who might be able to 
see problems that we ourselves would be too close to see,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bethesda-based company experienced two failed launches last  
week. On April 27, a Lockheed Martin-made Ikonos I satellite being 
launched for Space Imaging, Inc., a private company half-owned by 
Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Corp., failed to reach its proper 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Space Imaging would not say how much it paid for  
the satellite and the launch. Lockheed Martin, which made the 
Athena II rocket, would not give specific launch cost but said 
Athena launches cost in the low to mid-$20 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday a $433 million Titan IV rocket also failed to lift  
an $800 million military satellite into the right orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	President and CEO Pete Teets said in a statement that the rocket  
failures were ``unacceptable in a company that takes the concept of 
performance and quality as seriously as Lockheed Martin does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 12, another Titan rocket and its military satellite blew  
up shortly after being launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The 
military did not release the cost of the satellite, but the launch 
cost $344 million, Fetig said. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, a $250 million military satellite being propelled by  
a $432 million Titan IV rocket failed to reach its proper orbit 
after an upper stage made by Boeing Co. failed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Chao, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New  
York, said Lockheed is under pressure in an inherently risky 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is on to get these launched,'' he said. ``The  
question is, is it just bad luck ... or, in trying to get all these 
up there, have we put in something in the process that is making it 
more likely for failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Stewart, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said  
the company needs to find out if technical problems are causing the 
rocket failures, and if so, if there is a common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, they are still trying to identify the problem  
and are far from a solution,'' Stewart said. ``These are serious 
issues for them to confront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin employees more than 165,000 people worldwide and  
had sales of more than $26 billion in 1998.

of 1,000 people commissioned by the Yellow Pages. The pollsters 
gave respondents separate lists of five male and five female 
modern-day business leaders and asked who on the lists had the 
greatest vision. Gates, the Microsoft Corp. chairman, was by far 
the most-cited man, named by 44.5 percent of the respondents. He 
was followed by Disney chief executive Michael Eisner, cited by 
14.3 percent; Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, with by 14 percent; Ted 
Turner of Turner Broadcasting with 10.5 percent; retired Chrysler 
chairman Lee Iacocca, cited by 8.5 percent, and investor Warren 
Buffett, who had 1.8 percent. Another 6.4 percent didn't know or 
had no response. Ms. Winfrey was cited by 42.1 percent and was 
followed by Martha Stewart with 20.9 percent, cosmetics executive 
Estee Lauder with 9.6 percent, former Washington Post publisher 
Katharine Graham with 6.7 percent, and fashion designer Donna Karan 
and Morgan Stanley executive Elaine LaRoche, who each had 3.5 
percent. Another 13.6 percent didn't know or had no response.

	FASTEST-GROWING SPORTS: Snowboarding was the fastest-growing  
sport last year based on the number of participants, reports the 
National Sporting Goods Association. The NDP Group of Port 
Washington, N.Y., conducted a random survey of more than 15,000 
households and found that snowboarding grew by 29.1 percent over 
1997 to 3.6 million participants. The second fastest growing sport 
was backpacking/camping, up 21.8 percent to 14.6 million. No. 3 was 
windsurfing, which increased 17.3 percent to 600,000, followed by 
snorkeling with 17 percent growth to 7.3 million, and baseball, up

	TROUBLE-SPOTTING: If you're worried about losing valued  
employees, one way to be sure you keep them is to keep an eye out 
for unhappy or disgruntled workers and take steps to make them feel 
better. That advice comes from the management consulting firm 
Personnel Decisions, which says employees give off signs that 
they're unhappy that a boss can spot. For example, if workers won't 
put in some extra effort, chances are they aren't satisfied on the 
job. Do workers focus on problems and not try to find solutions? Or 
are they defeatist or apathetic? More warning signals. Other signs 
to look out for: clock-watching, unenthusiastic about projects, and 
workers who are absent or often sick.

<HEADLINE>  Oklahomans Return to Tornado Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- When John and Sheryl Molsbee were allowed  
back to their brick-and-frame home Wednesday, the roof was gone but 
Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't  
home when extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and 
killed 38 people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes 
in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you it was,'' said his wife, who hid with their  
19-year-old daughter, Kristy, under a blue flowered mattress in the 
master bedroom, then helped pull injured people from the wreckage 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Molsbees were among hundreds of people left homeless by the  
tornadoes who were allowed to return Wednesday to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelters were made available throughout the area for short-term  
housing, while officials made long-term arrangements for the 
suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the  
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster 
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance 
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to 
rent travel trailers to put on their property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross also passed out vouchers for people to  
stay in motels until other provisions could be made. Churches 
distributed food and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucky Kilbourne, who was running a shelter at the Midwest City  
Community Center, said 220 people took refuge there Monday night, 
but the number had dwindled to 60 by Wednesday. He said hearing the 
stories of the displaced was almost more than he could bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they hold dear, things they need -- from medicine to  
books to personal belongings -- all gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said nearly 700 people were injured in the deadliest  
tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The damage estimate has been 
placed at more than $225 million. At least 1,500 businesses and 
homes in Kansas also were destroyed or heavily damaged in Monday's 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
	More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas on  
Tuesday, killing one person. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has authorized emergency disaster declarations  
for Oklahoma and Kansas, paving the way for federal emergency funds 
for home and business owners. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency had 300 staff members on hand to assist victims and 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	All around Oklahoma City, cars -- some with smashed windows --  
formed grim processions as those lucky enough to have survived 
passed through police and National Guard checkpoints to view what 
was left of their homes before curfews resumed at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Oakcrest Church of Christ, Jean Clemence of Moore was  
walking around in a daze as her children gathered canned goods and 
other non-perishables from a food pantry hastily set up in a Sunday 
school class. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her boyfriend had ordered a storm cellar back in  
November, but the man who was supposed to install it dug the hole 
and just left it. Ms. Clemence said she had asked for the down 
payment back, and the man promised to come back Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's six months too late,'' she said. ``We're going to get our  
money back, I don't care. I think he owes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Molsbees' neighborhood, Shirley and Bennie Johnson's  
house was serving as a restroom retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got running water. If you've got to go, then come on  
in,'' Mrs. Johnson said. The house escaped with just shattered 
windows and cracked sheet rock. The 21 pictures of Southwestern art 
still hung in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson held up real estate fliers on the kitchen counter.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had this house for sale. A couple even checked it out  
Monday afternoon,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``Now, it's real cheap.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G May Sell Prell Shampoo Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. may sell its Prell  
shampoo brand, as part of the company's ongoing program of getting 
rid of product lines that do not fit into its strategic plans for 
increasing its worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G is soliciting bids for Prell, but will keep the brand if an  
acceptable offer is not received, management said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prell represented less than 1 percent of P&AMP;G's total global  
beauty care sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	If Prell is sold, management expects to reassign the brand's  
employees to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Management wants to concentrate on building worldwide sales of  
other P&AMP;G brands including Pantene Pro-V and Head &AMP; Shoulders, said 
Rob Matteucci, vice president and general manager of the company's 
hair care business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based consumer products maker had worldwide sales  
of $37.2 billion during the year ended June 30, 1998. Its beauty 
care brands also include Pert Plus, Oil of Olay, Safeguard, 
Noxzema, Secret, Old Spice, Cover Girl and Max Factor.

<HEADLINE> Universal Music Plans Online Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the music industry's latest, and biggest,  
step into the digital world, Universal Music Group is developing 
technology that would allow it to sell and distribute recordings on 
the Internet ahead of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal, the world's largest music company, entered into a  
partnership with a California-based software company, InterTrust 
Technologies Corp., to develop a system that would allow customers 
to download music to their computers in a secure format that 
prevents mass copying. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the deal, Universal hopes to begin distributing music  
over the Internet by the Christmas shopping season. That could move 
it ahead of the music industry's Secure Digital Music Initiative, 
an effort to establish a technological standard for portable 
Walkman-like devices that record and play copyright-protected 
digital music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try and find out what the consumers want and what  
they're willing to pay for,'' Larry Kenswil, head of electronic 
commerce at Universal, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing for sure is people want to download music,'' he  
said. ``It is a thriving legitimate market with some small 
independents and there's a big illegitimate market that is 
thriving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pact with InterTrust was announced on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Universal's announcement is significant because it marks the  
first attempt by a major music company to go digital. Universal can 
offer music by some of the world's biggest stars. The company's 
roster of artists includes Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Boyz II Men, 
Nine Inch Nails and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's move underscores the music industry's difficult  
search for a way to take advantage of the Internet and, at the same 
time, curb piracy that, Kenswil said, costs companies about $5 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legitimate music market is worth about $40 billion a year  
and a report by Forrester Research said digital distribution of 
music will be worth $1.1 billion by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Piracy thrived before the Internet, but the development of an  
audio format called MP3 has posed an especially vexing problem. MP3 
technology allows for the creation of near CD-quality music that 
can be easily downloaded from the Web. Anyone with the right 
equipment can record music from a CD onto a computer and then give 
it away to millions of people by posting it on a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another challenge comes from Web sites like MP3.Com, which use  
MP3 technology legally to allow unknown artists to sell their music 
via the Web, thus bypassing the control of music companies. Songs 
by most major artists have not been legally available for digital 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology companies, including Sony, Microsoft and IBM  
are competing to develop secure systems for digital transmission of 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Universal-InterTrust system won't rely on MP3, but will use  
a different technology that will include safeguards to deter 
pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can expect to see more and more of companies making these  
kinds of announcements as the industry turns from emotion to 
action,'' said Ron Rappaport, an analyst with Zona Research. 
``There's been a lot of whining and screaming over MP3, but if the 
music industry had moved faster three years ago, they wouldn't be 
in this position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Universal is not breaking ranks with the Digital Music  
Initiative, Kenswil said. Universal will continue to participate in 
the project and will comply with whatever standard the group 
approves. Participants hope to announce that standard sometime next 
month, but the timetable for development of the technology into a 
commercial product is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Another analyst, Mark Hardie with Forrester Research Inc., said  
companies such as Universal are eager to start doing business on 
the Internet and aren't willing to wait for the initiative to 
complete its work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a break from their stance last December when all of the  
companies got up on a stage and said MP3 is bad and people are 
pirating our music and we're going to launch an initiative to study 
it a year,'' Hardie said. ``I said in December they're not going to 
wait, they're going to break ranks, and they are.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Revives Disaster Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks to the congressional fight over the  
campaign against Yugoslavia, a stalled package of aid for Central 
America and U.S. farmers seems likely to be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders plan to make that Central America  
legislation, technically in conference between the House and 
Senate, the home for billions of dollars to pay for the fight over 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the Yugoslavia money to the Central America conference  
report would speed consideration of the defense money and take 
advantage of congressional rules eliminating the possibility of 
amendments. The strategy underlines Republican leaders' concerns 
that otherwise, a lengthy, divisive Senate debate over President 
Clinton's Balkans policy would result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have time'' to consider the Yugoslavia  
spending legislation separately, Senate Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters Tuesday. ``The 
Department of Defense is running out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House, which has rules that let it move quickly, plans to  
vote on a $12.9 billion version of the Yugoslavia measure Thursday. 
That is twice what Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	After House passage, which is considered likely, the Senate  
would never vote on a separate Yugoslavia bill. Negotiations 
between the two chambers over the package's size would begin 
immediately, with the compromise placed into the Central America 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders hope to send Clinton a package late next week that many  
participants expect will include about $9 billion for the 
confrontation over Kosovo, plus aid for Central America and U.S. 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved $1.3 billion for Central America and farmers  
on March 24. The Senate passed a $2.4 billion measure the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials and Democratic lawmakers urged  
GOP leaders to rush a compromise bill to the president so the money 
could move quickly to Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch 
and to American farmers hurt by low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Central America legislation has gone nowhere. It has  
been slowed by disputes between the two chambers, and between 
Congress and Clinton, over GOP proposals to cut other programs to 
pay for the measure and over Senate provisions dealing with tobacco 
settlement money and help for the steel, oil and mining industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many Republicans have shown little enthusiasm for a  
package dominated by foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Central America measure has been legislatively  
resurrected, Democrats tried pressuring Republicans to move the 
legislation Tuesday by emphasizing its aid for American farmers. 
The House version has $152 million for the farmers, the Senate bill 
$592 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get help out to farmers and ranchers now,'' said  
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who held a news 
conference with rural bankers and a half-dozen Senate Democrats. 
``We could lose 20 to 30 percent of our producers in the coming 
year'' without the aid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill contains language that would forbid the federal  
government from sharing any of the $246 billion tobacco companies 
agreed to pay the states to settle health-related lawsuits, and 
Stevens and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said they 
expect that to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, that language and the GOP's proposed spending cuts  
drew White House warnings that Clinton would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said if acceptable spending cuts were worked out, he  
would urge the president to sign the bill and fight over tobacco 
another day.

<P>
	BAKEWELL, England (AP) -- Artist George Butler, the oldest living  
member of Britain's prestigious Royal Watercolor Society, died 
April 19 at age 94. 
</P>
<P>
	His delicate landscapes and studies of ballet dancers have been  
exhibited throughout Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler's first one-man show was at the Redfern Gallery in 1927.  
He later had shows in Paris and Aix-en-Provence, France, and 
Chatsworth, England. He also exhibited regularly at London's Royal 
Academy, the New English Art Club, the Royal Society of British 
Artists and in French galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	His subjects were typically young girls, often ballet dancers,  
or delicate landscapes of Britain or France. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler was elected to the Royal Watercolor Society as an  
associate member in 1956 and as a full member the following year.

</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kepes wrote or illustrated 17 children's books including

</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Award-winning folklorist Americo Paredes, a  
professor emeritus at the University of Texas, died Wednesday. He 
was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	A founder of the Center for Mexican American Studies and the  
Center for Intercultural Studies of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, 
his works include the novels ``George Washington Gomez'' and ``The 
Shadow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other honors recognizing his contributions to literature  
and folklore, Paredes was awarded the Charles Frankel Prize from 
the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Orden del Aguila 
Azteca (Order of the Aztec Eagle), Mexico's highest honor given to 
scholars from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When he received the University of Texas Presidential Citation  
in 1997, it was said that his seminal folklore studies in the 1940s 
and 1950s lay the foundation for understanding the people and 
culture of the Lower Rio Grande border area. 
</P>
<P>
	He received an award from the American Folklore Society's  
Section on Latino, Latin American and Caribbean Folklore in 1997 
recognizing him as ``the most important and influential American 
folklorist in the field of Mexican-American and borderlands 
folklore.''

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Phra Charun Bhaanchan, a Buddhist monk  
who founded a temple that helped Thai drug addicts and then became 
a sanctuary for thousands of ethnic Hmong from neighboring Laos, 
died Tuesday of kidney failure. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Phra Charun, whose work with addicts won him the prestigious  
Ramon Magsaysay Award for public service, had been receiving 
treatment for diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Special Branch police officer, Phra Charun founded his  
temple, Wat Tham Krabok, in Saraburi, 55 miles north of Bangkok, in 
1957. His program using herbal remedies to treat drug addicts was 
unique at the time, and one of the few ways Thais addicted to drugs 
could receive treatment without criminal stigma. 
</P>
<P>
	The temple, which will now be run by his younger brother, has  
been the focus of controversy by becoming home to 13,000 ethnic 
Hmong people, many believed to be illegal immigrants from Laos. The 
Laotian government claims some are former anti-communist fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magsaysay awards -- regarded as Asia's version of the Nobel  
Prizes -- are given annually in several categories and are named 
after the Philippine president killed in a 1957 air crash. Phra 
Charun received the award in 1975.

</P>
<P>
	Tired of lugging around the hefty bass fiddle, which would  
frequently go out of tune, Price bought a Fender electric bass for 
$100, according to former Grand Ole Opry announcer Eddie Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with Country Music Hall of Famer ``Little'' Jimmy  
Dickens, Price became the first to play the electric bass on stage 
at the Opry in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a 1997 interview with Price, Stubbs said the Georgia  
native was ``quite possibly the first to play that instrument in

its wealth and violent deaths, died Sunday after plunging from his 
Manhattan high-rise. He was 54 and had been under psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's father, William Woodward Jr., was killed in 1955 by  
his wife, Ann, at their estate on Long Island. A grand jury cleared 
Mrs. Woodward of wrongdoing. She killed herself shortly before the

Woodward's brother died after jumping from a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward twice ran for office unsuccessfully, in 1978 for the  
state Senate and in 1981 for the New York City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a reporter for The New York Post from 1968 to 1971.

	PITTSFIELD, Maine (AP) -- Irving ``Fishbones'' Stevens, who  
gained fame with his stories about life as a Depression-era hobo, 
and creator of Irving's Fly Dope, a homemade fly repellent, died 
Tuesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens was named King of the Hobos in 1988 at the annual  
National Hobo Convention in Britt, Iowa. At the 1993 convention, he 
crowned his daughter as Queen of the Hobos. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens' first book, ``Fishbones, Hoboing in the 1930s,''  
published in the 1980s, contained more than a dozen stories based 
on his recollections of his life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	His second book, published in 1992, was ``Mandy's Washtub and  
Other Stories,'' a compilation of Maine folklore written over a 
10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens is remembered by fishermen and campers for Irving's Fly  
Dope, the foul-smelling fly repellent that he mixed, bottled and 
distributed for 30 years until environmental licensing fees led him 
to quit the business.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Worries About Markov, Jagr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Daniil Markov and Jaromir Jagr are the Toronto  
Maple Leafs' two main worries as they prepare to face the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Markov was a key contributor paired with Dimitri Yushkevich on  
defense when the Maple Leafs knocked off the Philadelphia Flyers in 
the first playoff round, but he's hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a little problem and we're not sure he's going to be  
ready,'' coach Pat Quinn said after practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Markov skated with the reserves, and Quinn declined to be  
specific about his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really didn't want him to go on the ice at all so we said,  
`If you want to skate you're going with that group,''' Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Markov would play in Game 1 Friday, Quinn paused before  
replying, ``We anticipate that he'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev, who missed the last three games  
of the Flyers series with a strained shoulder, probably will play 
in Game 1 Friday against the Penguins, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, the NHL scoring champion, lifted the Penguins to a huge  
upset of the New Jersey Devils after missing three games with a 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can shut Jagr down,'' said Maple Leafs  
defenseman Bryan Berard. ``He's a big concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's the best player in the game today. We can't  
eliminate him. We'll try to contain him and limit his options. If 
we can take his ice away, I think we'll have success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jagr is a concern, Martin Straka, who had six goals and  
five assists against New Jersey, and Alexei Kovalev, who had four 
goals and six assists against the Devils, are major threats, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pittsburgh has a lot of skilled forwards,'' said Berard.  
``It's going to be a different series from Philadelphia, but they 
do play the trap in the neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be okay if we limit our turnovers and get our offense  
going. We have to watch our turnovers because if we make mistakes 
they have some smart players who can jump through the holes and 
create odd-man rushes. That would be costly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto and Pittsburgh are meeting in the playoffs for the first  
time since 1977, when the Maple Leafs won a best-of-three 
preliminary round 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split four games during the regular season. They  
haven't met since Jan. 28 in Pittsburgh. Toronto used goaltender 
Jeff Reese, who no longer is on the roster, and the Penguins won 
6-0. Captain Mats Sundin referred to it as his team's worst game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph said he's looking forward to  
facing Jagr, Straka, et al. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you play against a Jagr, a Gretzky, a Forsberg, it's  
a challenge,'' Joseph said. ``You want to play great. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play a different style (than Philadelphia). Philly was  
more dump it in and grind you in the corners and cycle the puck. 
Pittsburgh is more a carry it over the line and make 2-on-1 plays 
trying to make plays off the rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different thought process. Still, my job stays the  
same: I have to stop the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh forward Matthew Barnaby predicts a high-scoring  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be that much hitting,'' Barnaby said  
of the Maple Leafs after the Penguins' big Game 7 win in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	But fans who think they'll see freewheeling hockey might be in  
for a surprise, says Maple Leafs forward Steve Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try and play the same way (as against  
Philadelphia) with good strong defensive hockey and a good 
transition game,'' he said. ``Our transition game worked well for 
us all year, and in the last series, strong defensive play helped 
us win it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can incorporate both, we can do very well.''  
</P>
<P>
	Quinn concurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our games against them were way too wide open for me,'' Quinn  
said. ``We know it's a team that if you make errors with the puck 
they'll make you pay. When they create a scoring opportunity it's 
usually a dandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso did not play a full game against  
Toronto during the regular season. Peter Skudra shut out Toronto 
twice but he's been the backup since Barrasso recuperated from 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our basic strategy from the start of the playoffs was  
that it was not about them,'' Barrasso said after the upset of the 
Devils. ``It was about us. If we played like we were capable, and 
we played our system and were aggressive, we knew we could beat 
anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Tougher Rules for NY Fight Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strict background checks, including financial  
disclosures, of title fight judges in New York are now required. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the boxers that got kayoed, it was the fans,'' Gov.  
George Pataki said of the controversial draw between Lennox Lewis 
and Evander Holyfield that spurred the reforms announced Wednesday 
by Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. ``My personal opinion 
is that the decision was indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, today the public sees boxing's credibility on par with  
that of professional wrestling,'' Spitzer said. ``In short, the 
sweet science has turned sour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Manhattan grand jury is looking into the Lewis-Holyfield  
decision. Most observers felt Lewis won the match for the 
undisputed heavyweight title March 13 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a lucrative rematch is in the works for Nov. 6 or  
Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like it to take place in New York state,'' Pataki said.  
``If it does, it's going to be under these new rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pursuing the rematch,'' said Ken Munoz, executive vice  
president of the Garden. ``Frankly, it's somewhat difficult. 
(Promoter Don) King has a lot of offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas is being prominently as the site of a rematch.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, judges must be sanctioned by the state,  
and judges who reside, or are licensed, in other jurisdictions must 
submit a sworn application for a license and make certain 
disclosures. They include a credit check, revealing pending 
litigations such as bankruptcy or criminal proceedings and any 
financial ties with either boxer, promoter, the venue or television 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in Washington, a Senate committee approved Wednesday a  
bill aimed at reforming the business side of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muhammad Ali Reform Act now goes before the full Senate,  
which passed a virtually identical version last year by voice vote. 
The House, however, did not take up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ali Act would protect boxers from exploitation from  
promoters and managers by requiring specific guidelines for 
contracts and disclosure of the complicated financial dealings 
surrounding big fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki directed the New York State Athletic Commission, chaired  
by Mel Southard, to work with federal legislators to get the Ali 
Act passed and signed in law. 
</P>
<P>
	Also to be implemented immediately by the New York Commission  
are the way championship fight judges are selected, and tougher 
standards for becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Each sanctioning body with an interest in a title fight must  
submit a list of three candidates for judge, instead of one, and 
the commission will select one from each set of candidates. It can 
reject the nominations and select a judge without further 
nomination. If only two sanctioning bodies are involved, the 
commission will select at least one independent judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges will need to pass written and oral examinations and  
attend a mandatory annual seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	The following reforms for title fights also will be recommended  
to the Association of Boxing Commissioners at its annual meeting in 
July at Baltimore: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A referee would be required to judge the fight, and his card  
would be considered if the decision is a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Each of the three judges' scorecards would be compared on a  
round-by-round basis, and after each round a consensus would be 
reached by rejecting the decision of the judge in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And independent poll of boxing writers, broadcasters and  
historian would rank fighters.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Coach Seeks Asylum in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Cuban pitching coach walked into police  
headquarters after wandering the streets of Baltimore for eight 
hours and said he wanted to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberto Herrera requested asylum around 10 a.m. Tuesday, some  
10 hours after the Cubans beat the Orioles 12-6. He arrived at a 
downtown Baltimore police station hours after his countrymen 
hastily boarded a plane for Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Through an interpreter, the lieutenant on duty ``understood he  
was requesting asylum and immediately notified INS officials,'' 
said police spokesman Robert Weinhold. Herrera is now in the 
custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a foe of Fidel Castro's regime, said  
the man's full name is Rigoberto Herrera Betancourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other Cubans who missed the flight home Tuesday did so  
accidentally and will be allowed to return home without U.S. 
intervention, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez said two other Cubans may also have asked for asylum,  
but the Justice Department officials, asking not to be identified, 
said they were not aware of any such request. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Ferro, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Maryland  
district director, said other Cubans could be missing from the 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Cuban government list of the delegation that  
traveled to Baltimore included Rigoberto Betancourt. The government 
news agency said he was a 54-year-old retired pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He played Cuban baseball between 1965 and 1975 and was known for  
an excellent curve ball. Three times he was part of the national 
team: during the Central American-Caribbean games in Puerto Rico in 
1966, in the Pan American games in Winnipeg in 1967, and during a 
tour of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently he worked as a pitching trainer in a Havana  
province. He was known as ``El Pequeno Gigante del Box,'' or the 
Little Big Man in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials denied any members of the delegation defected,  
but said six Cubans overslept and missed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defectors,'' the spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic  
mission in Washington, Luis Fernandez, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The (Baltimore) Sun, Fernandez likened  
their experience to the movie ``Home Alone,'' in which a young boy 
is accidentally left at home when his family leaves on a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six were planning to catch another flight home  
either Tuesday or today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a senior administration official said the  
government was making arrangements to talk to the six -- despite the 
Justice Department conclusion -- to learn whether they want to 
return voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS would not comment on possible defections or say if the  
agency had been contacted by the six. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 Cubans were part of the delegation that attended  
Monday night's game. Besides players, the delegation included 
journalists, retired ballplayers, ordinary citizens, members of 
youth groups and outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	During a long speech welcoming the players in Havana, Castro  
criticized defections in general, but said nothing about anyone 
staying behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a rematch after the Orioles defeated the Cubans in  
Havana 3-2 on March 28, when the Orioles became the first major 
league team in 40 years to play in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Pick Up Pieces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Misty Seeber spent her 22nd birthday  
picking through the rubble of her shattered mobile home, turning 
over broken boards and twisted sheets of metal. She was hunting for 
her husband's wedding band. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find his wedding ring, we'll be happy,'' she said  
Tuesday. ``The most important thing is we're alive. Everything else 
is replaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Seeber was one of dozens left homeless when a fierce  
tornado smashed through Lake Shore Mobile Home Park on Monday, 
spawned by the same storm system that produced even deadlier 
tornadoes in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas tornado cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide  
in southern Wichita and suburban Haysville. Five people died, 
including two at Lake Shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearby 20-acre lake was filled with debris -- insulation from  
the mobile homes, floating pieces of wood and clothing, blown there 
by the howling wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Where there once stood mobile homes, now there were empty  
spaces. One lot was barren except for a pile of insulation and a 
wooden chair. Nearby, a maroon blanket was high in a tree branch, 
flapping in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelpha Collins, her gray hair askew, paused in the middle of  
what had been her home. An uprooted tree now occupied her favorite 
chair and the walls where her pictures once hung were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her losses, Mrs. Collins remained upbeat as she sifted  
through the rubble. At one point, she found the big white family 
Bible and declared: ``It's important. It sure is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel lucky we made it. Other things you can replace,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 of 300 mobile homes at Lake Shore and an adjacent  
mobile home park were damaged or destroyed, said Terri Moses, 
Wichita's deputy police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates showed that more than 8,000 buildings were  
damaged in Sedgwick County. Gov. Bill Graves toured the area, which 
was granted a federal disaster declaration to clear the way for 
various forms of aid. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night, buzzing chainsaws were finally silenced in  
Haysville. National Guard soldiers patrolled to deter looting. Many 
of the homeless stayed with family members. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be another long night in the dark.  
</P>
<P>
	The evening before, Darrell Zehr figured he would be safe inside  
the cinderblock warehouse where he was working when the tornado 
struck. But even that sturdy structure couldn't stop him being 
sucked into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I couldn't breathe,'' he recalled. ``The wind  
was knocked out of me. The roof fell on me. The wall fell on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got up and examined the damage to the building -- roof gone,  
walls gone, nothing left but a huge pile of cinderblocks. The 
damage to himself? A bruised finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised I lived through it,'' said Zehr, 44. ``With all  
the devastation last night, to walk out of here with minor injuries 
-- I can't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the night shift at the Cessna aircraft plant in Wichita,  
29-year-old Richard Dwyer said he called his wife of one month 
urging her to get out of their one-story rented house. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she had stayed there, she would have gotten cut up,'' he  
said of wife Summer, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	A large piece of lumber pierced the living room wall. The  
windows of the house, on which Dwyer had just put a $4,000 down 
payment, were blown out by the tornado. The contents -- uninsured -- 
were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first house and her first house, and it is a bad  
deal,'' Dwyer said. But they were both safe, and when they returned 
home Tuesday morning, they found that their cat was hiding in a box 
spring under a bed.

<P>
	``Burning London: The Clash Tribute'' (Epic) -- various artists  
</P>
<P>
	The Clash was many things. Cute, however, was not one of them,  
which is why opening a tribute album to the legendary punk rock 
band with a song by No Doubt is such a grave miscalculation. Things 
improve after that, but only to the level of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Urge and 311 contribute the most solid, energetic cuts with  
``This Is Radio Clash'' and ``White Man in Hammersmith Palais.'' 
Cracker's transformation of ``White Riot'' into a slow country tune 
and the rap remake of ``Should I Stay or Should I Go'' by Ice Cube 
and Mack 10 are the most successful efforts by artists putting 
their own stamps on the songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the versions are dreary and predictable, raising a  
series of questions we don't want to answer: Isn't a Clash cover by 
Rancid redundant? Isn't ``Clampdown,'' the one song anyone would 
figure the Indigo Girls would cover, sort of the musical version of 
telegraphing a basketball pass? What were the Afghan Whigs thinking 
when they morphed ``Lost in the Supermarket'' into Ben E. King's 
``Stand by Me''? And is Clash drummer Topper Headon so desperate 
for work he had to join them? 
</P>
<P>
	The richness of the Clash's songwriting is what comes through  
most clearly. If this album causes a few young fans to seek out the 
originals for inspiration, as these contemporary artists did, then 
the tribute has performed a valuable service.

	``Galo Negro'' (Putumayo) -- Sam Mangwana  

</P>
<P>
	Sam Mangwana mixes pan-African pop styles with influences from  
Portugal, the Caribbean and Latin America into a masterful blend on 
``Galo Negro.'' He is backed by the sinuous, sensual guitar work of 
Papa Noel, driving percussion that mixes world rhythms at will, and 
a female chorus that Mangwana frequently engages in 
call-and-response. All these make ``Galo Negro'' stand out in a sea 
of world music releases. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangwana sings mostly in Lingala, and also in Portuguese. But  
his somewhat weathered, soulful voice makes a knowledge of either 
language unnecessary. Adding even more depth to ``Galo Negro'' is 
the accordion of Madagascar's Regis Gizavo, whose sound can 
transport listeners from a smoky bar in Lisbon to a dance floor in 
Africa in the blink of an eye. ``Galo Negro'' is wildly addictive, 
danceable and utterly wonderful.

	``Take Your Shoes Off'' (Rykodisc) -- The Robert Cray Band  

</P>
<P>
	Robert Cray's 11th album is also his best, a nod to the soul of  
Al Green and a tip of the cap to the blues of Albert King and other 
masters. But although Cray is clearly after a soul sound here, he 
is self-confident enough to go at it in his own way. That's why 
Cajun accordion ace Jo-El Sonnier shows up for ``Won't You Give Him 
One More Chance.'' The Memphis Horns add punch to the arrangements, 
which generally recall classic Memphis soul without nostalgia or 
mindless aping.

	``Bury The Hatchet'' (Island) -- The Cranberries.  

</P>
<P>
	``So much for the radio, everybody sounds the same,'' The  
Cranberries' Delores O'Riordan complains on her band's newest 
release, ``Bury the Hatchet.'' The song, ``Copycat,'' must be 
intended to be tongue in cheek because other tunes here are 
sprinkled with the sounds of The Cure and 10,000 Maniacs. On 
``Saving Grace'' the Irish rock quartet even comes dangerously 
close to lifting a melody from 1970s soft rockers Bread, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is hard to hate the Cranberries even in their  
hypocrisy. They are pop's play-it-safe band with a bubbly style 
that hasn't changed much through four releases. The Cranberries can 
simply blend into the background at any department store's junior 
section. ``Bury the Hatchet'' does offer the complementary rocker 
``Promises,'' but it mostly bounces behind shimmering guitars and 
O'Riordan's Celtic dialect. The disc stutters out of the gate, 
mostly because of O'Riordan's silly lyrics, but gets better with 
the best songs at the tail end. 
</P>
<P>
	After showing some promise earlier this decade with forceful  
songs like ``Zombie,'' it is time the Cranberries were taken for 
what they're worth and nothing more: easy listening.

<HEADLINE> `Noah's Ark' Leads NBC To Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's an old story, but that didn't drive viewers  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night of the biblical mini-series ``Noah's Ark'' on  
Sunday had higher ratings than any other TV movie this year, 
leading NBC to an easy victory during the first week of the 
important May ratings ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie performed better than anything NBC has televised since  
George Clooney's exit from ``ER'' in February. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than a month to go in the season, CBS leads NBC for  
the year's household ratings crown by one-tenth of a percentage 
point. NBC has a slightly wider lead over Fox in the ratings among 
adults aged 18-49, which advertisers covet. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 9.5 rating and 16 share, easily  
eclipsing CBS's 8.1 rating and 14 share. ABC had a 7.1 rating and 
12 share, while Fox was at 6.3 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 3.0 rating and 5 share  
and UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share. Nielsen said its ratings for 
Pax TV would not be ready until later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``100 Years of Great Women'' special performed well for  
the network, finishing 23rd for the week. CBS's reunion movie, 
``The Patty Duke Show'' finished a lackluster 49th place. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN had some rare good news with the performance of its ``WWF  
Smackdown'' special, the highest rated show on the network last 
week. UPN executives are already talking about making wrestling a 
regular part of the network special next year. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's two-part ``Mr. Murder'' movie had a dismal showing. Its  
second part last Tuesday finished tied for 82nd for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news race with a  
7.7 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was second at 7.6 
and 17, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.7 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 26-May 2, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: Noah's Ark, Part One,'' 
NBC, 20.9; ``ER,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.1; ``Friends,'' 
NBC, 13.9; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 
12.5; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 12.3; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 11.1; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
11.0.

<HEADLINE> Duke &AMP; Co. Indicted for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke &AMP; Co., a now-defunct securities firm, and  
18 former employees were indicted Wednesday on charges of 
defrauding thousands of investors out of tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	A 109-count indictment filed by Manhattan prosecutors alleged  
Duke's brokers colluded with salesmen at other firms to raise and 
keep the initial public offering prices of certain stocks 
artificially high. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke brokers and their favored investors, who prosecutors said  
numbered about two dozen at most, made money by selling the stock 
high while those who were not in on the scheme lost when prices 
tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Duke was ``a criminal enterprise''  
that ran a scheme to manipulate the stock prices of five companies 
from January 1995 through March 1998, when the company went out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporations whose IPOs were used to defraud investors were  
Renaissance Entertainment Corp., Sel-Leb Marketing Inc., Paravant 
Computer Systems, Bristol Technologies, IFS International, and 
Aviation Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Victor M. Wang, 34, of  
Sarasota Fla., was Duke's board chairman ``and was in charge of the 
criminal enterprise. He engaged in, directed and supervised illegal 
anti-competitive activities involving personnel at Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wang supervised securities frauds and thefts from investors in  
connection with the purchase and sale of stocks by Duke,'' 
Morgenthau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang and the other defendants are charged with grand larceny,  
enterprise corruption, criminal possession of stolen property, 
tampering with physical evidence, and violations of the state's 
general business law. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the defendants except Wang, Charles T. Bennett, 31, of  
Glen Cove, N.Y., and Steven R. Rosenblueth, 29, of Manhasset Hills, 
N.Y., were released in bond amounts that ranged from $100,000 to 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang, Bennett and Rosenblueth were jailed pending bail hearings  
Thursday, Morgenthau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau said four other former Duke brokers have already  
pleaded guilty to felony charges in connection with the scheme. He 
said his office's investigation of some of Duke's favored investors 
was continuing.

<HEADLINE> Last At-Bats for Providence Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I.(AP) -- Freshman outfielder Mike Scott knew this  
was coming since October, but it's still tough accept.	
</P>
<P>
	At the end of May, the Providence College baseball team shuts  
down after 78 years -- a casualty of the school's need to comply 
with Title IX requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the team I love to play for,'' said Scott, who leads  
the Big East Conference in triples. ``It's hard to take it all in, 
believing they could actually do something like this to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Friars (40-13) are third in the conference with a 15-8  
record and looking for a spot in the NCAA tournament. Their last 
regular-season game is May 15, at home against Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friars have had just one losing season this decade (1993),  
won the Big East tournament title in 1992 and the Big East 
regular-season title in 1995. They earned the school's first trips 
to the NCAA tournament in 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is no saving this team.  
</P>
<P>
	The school said in October it was dropping baseball, men's golf  
and men's tennis after the academic year in accordance with Title 
IX, the law barring sex discrimination at institutions receiving 
federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The same kinds of cuts are being made in colleges across the  
country. The NCAA says it is unclear how many baseball teams have 
folded because of Title IX because the organization does not track 
such statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of NCAA schools with baseball teams has remained  
steady at 84 percent, NCAA spokeswoman Kimberly Dixson said. The 
losses of some baseball teams can be offset by other schools 
picking up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school, Scott thought about playing at the  
University of New Hampshire. Then New Hampshire dropped baseball 
and he looked elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they cut the program, my Dad and I looked at PC,'' Scott  
said. ``We both said, `Nah, it'll never happen there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	While more women than men attend Providence, the school has a  
higher percentage of male athletes. Male athletes make up 41 
percent of the students and 54 percent of its athletes. Women make 
up 59 percent of the students and 47 percent of its athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	That disparity would not pass a Title IX test, administration  
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's seven scholarships will be distributed to women's  
soccer, softball, ice hockey and field hockey as baseball players 
graduate or transfer. Operating funds will move to the women's 
athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director John Marinatto said Providence did not have  
the resources to add more women's programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis and men's golf were supposed to be dropped along  
with baseball, but they have been temporarily spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of those two programs have pledged to raise the about  
$10,000 a year for the next three years to allow this year's 
freshmen players to finish their careers at Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to our kids, knowing what they've committed  
to and worked for and the success they've had,'' Providence 
baseball coach Charlie Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Providence's underclassmen on the baseball team aren't  
staying. Scott, a Darien, Conn., native, is transferring to 
Connecticut. Keith Reed, a junior outfielder, probably will be 
selected in June's major league baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our motivation is to win the Big East Tournament, get a bid to  
the (NCAA) regionals and shove it in the face of the 
administration,'' Scott said. ``Just to come back and say, `Look 
what you did, look what you're cutting.'''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Buys MediaOne for $54 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that AT&AMP;T Corp. has won a takeover fight to  
become the nation's largest cable TV company, a debate has begun 
over whether consumers also win. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T plans to offer its 16 million cable TV customers a broad  
array of telephone, Internet and TV services. Customers will only 
need one cable into their homes, and will receive just one, 
lower-priced bill, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambitious strategy, however, is being criticized by consumer  
groups, lawmakers and competitors. AT&AMP;T, already the largest 
long-distance phone company, will stifle competition with its 
dominance of cable TV and high-speed, ``broadband'' Internet 
access, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the debate is AT&AMP;T's plan to spend $54 billion  
to acquire MediaOne Group Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of high-stakes jousting, AT&AMP;T struck a truce late  
Tuesday with Comcast Corp., the No. 3 cable company, which had also 
sought to buy Denver-based MediaOne. Under terms of the pact, AT&AMP;T 
and Philadelphia-based Comcast will divvy up the cable TV customers 
of MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of  
America, said the costs of the deal for consumers outweigh any 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs are humongous in terms of the anti-competitive  
effects on cable and broadband services and the benefits of local 
phone competition are minuscule,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's competitors aren't mincing words either.  
</P>
<P>
	Keep America Connected, a coalition backed by regional phone  
monopolies, took out a three-quarter page advertisement Wednesday 
in The New York Times calling AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne a 
``dangerous and aggressive plan to dominate the way Americans 
communicate to an extent no force, institution, company or person 
has ever been allowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, for its part, claims it can save consumers 20 percent to  
25 percent off their cable and telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company plans to offer MediaOne customers  
combined cable, phone and Internet service early next year. The 
expanded service will include local, intrastate and long-distance 
phone calls, cable, and Internet access for a flat, monthly fee. 
Extra services, like call waiting and caller I.D., may also be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it may only charge customers between $4 to $6 for an  
extra line for a fax or computer, compared with the $17 charged by 
some phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more you buy from AT&AMP;T, the less it's going to cost you,''  
said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong will have to convince lawmakers that's a good  
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee's telecommunications subcommittee, which oversees 
telephone and television policies, is also concerned the planned 
merger would stifle cable TV competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin hasn't decide whether he will oppose the deal, but ``he's  
leaning against it at this point,'' said spokesman Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin intends to ask the Federal Communications Commission and  
either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission ``to 
take a hard look at this,' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T's investors are betting AT&AMP;T's chairman, who has proved  
a savvy negotiator in his deals with Comcast and MediaOne, will 
again prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's shares rose more than 10 percent Wednesday, up $5.37 1/2 to  
$56.93 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast's common shares rose about 14 percent, or $9.25, to  
$73.37 1/2 also on the Big Board. MediaOne's shares fell 75 cents to 
$76.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Under AT&AMP;T's pact with Comcast, the two companies plan to  
exchange 2.7 million customers, giving each company a stronger 
presence in markets they have targeted for growth. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T will get 700,000 subscribers in seven markets, including  
Atlanta, Sacramento, Chicago and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast will get 2 million subscribers in seven markets,  
including Michigan, New Jersey, Pennyslvania and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Man Strangles Second Wife in Hot Tub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A man serving a life sentence for suffocating  
his first wife in a bathtub was convicted Wednesday of strangling 
his second wife in a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Boczkowski, 43, was found guilty of murder in the 1994  
death of Maryann Boczkowski, 35, at their home. He could get the 
death penalty. The penalty phase was to begin Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he killed his wife because he did not want  
children and she was about to leave him. The defense argued that 
she drowned after sudden heart or liver failure brought on by years 
of heavy drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after her death was determined to be a homicide,  
authorities reopened an investigation into the death of 
Boczkowski's first wife, Elaine, 34, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Her body was found at the couple's home in Greensboro, N.C. Her  
husband said she had drowned after drinking, but an autopsy 
concluded the cause of death was chest compression. Boczkowski was 
convicted in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Holds Big Lead Over Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore are riding high,  
both nationally and in New Hampshire, in their races for the 
Republican and Democratic nominations for president, according to 
two polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican front-runner, has taken a strong lead over  
Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire and retains a big advantage 
nationally. On the Democratic side, Gore has expanded his lead 
nationally over Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, 
to an almost 3-1 margin. In another poll, he holds a similar lead 
in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had 66 percent in the national CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll,  
while Bradley had 23 percent. In mid-April, Bradley trailed the 
vice president 54 percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls are evidence of Gore's growing strength among  
Democrats, said spokesman Roger Salazar. ``As people get to know 
him better, we should only gain ground,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads Gore in a theoretical head-to-head match by 56  
percent to 40 percent, in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, about the 
same lead Bush has held over Gore since February. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Hampshire poll taken by the University of New Hampshire  
for CNN-WMUR, shows Bush, the Texas governor, at 37 percent, 
followed by Dole, the former Red Cross president, at 16 percent. 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has gained ground since January 
while advocating a tougher stance on Kosovo, was challenging Dole 
for second at 14 percent. A poll taken in January had Bush and Dole 
in a statistical dead heat, with McCain far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Among New Hampshire Democrats, Gore was favored by 68 percent  
and Bradley by 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national poll of Republicans, Bush was favored by 42  
percent and Dole by 24 percent. In mid-April, Bush led Dole by a 
53-16 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said the  
governor won't be traveling nationally until mid-June because the 
Texas Legislature is meeting until the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the campaign has pulled together its New Hampshire  
organization in the last month and noted that Sen. Judd Gregg, 
R-N.H., endorsed Bush in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 411 Republicans and 492  
Democrats was taken Friday through Sunday and has an error margin 
of plus or minus 5 percentage points for each group. The New 
Hampshire poll of 279 likely Republican voters had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 6 percentage points, while the poll of 202 
likely Democratic voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 7 
percent. The New Hampshire poll was taken April 26-May 2.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against First Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- First Union Corp. used Signet Banking  
Corp.'s retirement plans for its own profit when it took over 
Signet, costing Signet employees $150 million in lost retirement 
funds, a lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees are seeking that amount in a class-action lawsuit  
filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends that First Union, following the November  
1997 acquisition of Richmond-based Signet, illegally divested 
Signet employees of investments in popular mutual funds and stocks 
offered through their 401(k) plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union, the nation's sixth-largest  
bank, transferred the money into First Union-owned mutual funds, 
allowing it to charge fees for managing the money, the employees 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank violated a federal law requiring companies that set up  
401(k) or other pension plans to run them solely in the interests 
of their employees, not for their own profit, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union declined to comment on the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
	The former Signet employees argued that their retirement  
accounts sustained the losses because the investments available 
under Signet's 401(k) plan have increased in value while the First 
Union-controlled funds have stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also alleges that First Union failed to give many  
former Signet employees notice of the transfer of funds or their 
right to opt out of the transfer and roll over their retirement 
savings to individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	There are nine named plaintiffs, but Leider said about 5,000  
former Signet employees, many of whom now work for First Union, 
would fall under the class action.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Ranked on Fujita Scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists rank a tornado's intensity and estimate its wind  
speed based on observed damage, using a scale developed by the late 
University of Chicago researcher Tetsuya Theodore Fujita: 
</P>
<P>
	-- F0: Gale tornado. Wind speed: 40-72 mph. Damage: Some damage  
to chimneys; breaks branches off trees; pushes over shallow-rooted 
trees; damages signs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F1: Moderate tornado. Wind speed: 73-112 mph. Damage: Peels  
roof coverings; mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned; 
moving autos pushed off the roads; attached garages may be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F2: Significant tornado. Wind speed: 113-157 mph. Damage:  
Considerable damage. Roofs torn off frame houses; mobile homes 
demolished; boxcars pushed over; large trees snapped or uprooted; 
light objects become missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F3: Severe tornado. Wind speed: 158-206 mph. Damage: Roof and  
some walls torn off well-constructed houses; trains overturned; 
most trees in forests uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F4: Devastating tornado. Wind speed: 207-260 mph. Damage:  
Well-constructed houses leveled; structures with weak foundations 
blown off some distance; cars thrown; large missiles generated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F5: Incredible tornado. Wind speed: 261-318 mph. Damage:  
Strong frame houses lifted off foundations and carried considerable 
distances; automobile-size missiles fly through the air for more 
than 100 meters; trees debarked; steel-reinforced concrete 
structures badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, only one F5 tornado hits the United States each  
year. F5 twisters struck in 1998 in Waynesboro, Tenn., and Pleasant 
Grove, Ala.; in 1997 in Jarrell, Texas; in 1996 in Oakfield, Wis.; 
in 1992 in Chandler, Minn.; and in 1990 in Plainfield, Ill., 
Goessel, Kan., and Hesston, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the worst U.S. tornadoes on record, seven F5s struck  
the Midwest on April 3, 1974, including at Xenia, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	-- F6: Although he called it ``inconceivable,'' Fujita left open  
the possibility a tornado could cause a small area of damage even 
worse than F5 intensity. But he said evidence of an F6 tornado -- 
with wind speed up to 379 mph -- would probably be masked by damage 
from surrounding F4 and F5 winds.

<HEADLINE> NFL Agent Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Two weeks ago, agent Tank Black celebrated  
a record day at the NFL draft by having five of his clients 
selected in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's down to three.  
</P>
<P>
	Four former University of Florida players, including first-round  
picks Jevon Kearse and Reggie McGrew, recently fired Black because 
he is under investigation by the University of Florida Police 
Department and the NFL Players Association for possible violations 
of sports agents laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round picks Johnny Rutledge and Mike Peterson also fired  
Black. Kearse, McGrew and Rutledge signed with agent Leigh 
Steinberg. Peterson signed with Total Entertainment and Athlete 
Management in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, who is based in Columbia, said he doesn't blame the  
players for leaving after the way they've been treated in the 
investigation. He has hired a lawyer and will try to recover lost 
income. Agents receive a maximum 3 percent of a player's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, when players leave, it's something that the agent  
has done wrong to either the player or the family or not made good 
on something,'' Black said in The (Columbia) State today. ``None of 
that's happened here. None of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the environment that's been created (by the  
investigation) that has caused these players to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the players' association, Black has been under  
investigation since Jan. 29. He was accused of having a runner try 
to bribe an LSU assistant football coach to help him land defensive 
tackle Anthony McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
	But until April 14, the week of the draft, neither Black nor any  
of the players was questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 14, Black said the players were told they had to  
testify the next day. He said several were pulled over by police to 
be subpoenaed. They were subpoenaed again after the draft for 
further questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Reamining with Black are: Louisiana Tech wide receiver Troy  
Edwards, 13th pick of the draft by Pittsburgh; Tennessee linebacker 
Al Wilson, first-round pick of the Denver Broncos; and Clemson 
cornerback Antuan Edwards, first-round pick by Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, recovering from toe surgery, said he has concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been in the back of my head,'' Edwards said. ``He's got  
some issues that haven't been resolved. Until they get resolved, 
I'm going to stay with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black founded Professional Management Inc., in 1988 and made  
former South Carolina and Green Bay Packers wide receiver Sterling 
Sharpe his first client. Before the Florida players left, he 
represented seven of the top 46 players selected in the April 17-18 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his other clients are Jacksonville Jaguars running back  
Fred Taylor, Packers wide receiver Robert Brooks and Toronto 
Raptors guard Vince Carter, a leading candidate for NBA rookie of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time Black has been accused of wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The players' association, according to executive director Gene  
Upshaw, expects the results of its investigation to be announced 
soon.

<HEADLINE> Slain Reporters' Names Memorialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The names of 29 journalists were added  
Wednesday to a memorial honoring members of the media killed while 
covering world events. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony that mixed honors for slain journalists with  
warnings for an increasingly dangerous profession, the Freedom 
Forum rededicated a shimmering glass and aluminum monument that 
already contains more than 1,000 names. They date back to 1812. 
</P>
<P>
	The honored journalists include reporters, editors,  
photographers and broadcasters who lost their lives while reporting 
the news last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances of their deaths varied widely. Mahmoud Saremi, the  
Afghanistan bureau chief for Iran's official news agency, was 
executed by the Taliban militia in Afghanistan. Hope Bartlett, a 
23-year-old Florida TV reporter, was thrown overboard from a boat 
and drowned after removing her lifejacket to tape a segment for a 
story.

<HEADLINE> Jackson, Jordan Discussed Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Phil Jackson's special relationship with Michael  
Jordan hasn't changed just because the two don't work together 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said Wednesday he's talked to Jordan about the  
possibility of his former star player buying part of the Charlotte 
Hornets and becoming an NBA owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Michael a couple of times about his chances and  
about the negotiations. I'm very supportive of him getting involved 
and hope that it works out for him,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, they did talk about the possibility of Jordan hiring  
Jackson as his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed that as kind of an outside possibility, but there  
was really nothing concrete talked about,'' he said. ``And I really 
support the fact Paul Silas is a guy who deserves the chance, and 
would be a good choice and has indeed proved to have done a good 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silas, an assistant, became the interim coach when Dave Cowens  
resigned in early March. Jordan and current owner George Shinn 
reportedly have agreed that if Jordan becomes co-owner of the 
Hornets, Silas would be kept as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan wasn't present for Wednesday's halftime ceremony honoring  
Jackson, although he did send a videotaped message. Jackson said he 
talked to Jordan on Tuesday and understands why Jordan couldn't be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for the fact that I had to be here this year,  
it's more than likely I wouldn't be at an NBA game,'' Jackson said. 
``I'm happy that he was able to make a videotape and do what he 
could do to make this night as special as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eleven months after President Clinton  
announced his choice of Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador, 
the veteran diplomatic troubleshooter has yet to appear for a 
Senate confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Foreign Relations  
Committee, has declined to schedule a hearing -- despite increasing 
calls for him to do so from Democrats and even from a key 
Republican member of his own panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A Helms spokesman said Wednesday that the panel continues to  
conduct its own investigation and needs more documents from the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the panel's  
international operations subcommittee, urged Helms to speed up the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is now in our court, and we should act  
expeditiously,'' Grams told Helms in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams said the United Nations post remains vacant ``at a time  
when we badly need U.S. leadership on many sensitive foreign policy 
matters, including Kosovo.'' He called Holbrooke a ``highly 
qualified'' candidate for the post with ``a distinguished 
background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grams' office released the letter after the State Department  
said it had concluded yet another internal ethics investigation 
into Holbrooke -- and concluded he had not violated 
conflict-of-interest laws in accepting speaking fees last year 
while also serving as U.S. envoy to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms blames time-consuming internal ethics investigations by  
the Justice and State departments for most of the delay. But 
Democrats suggest politics, and GOP frustration with the Balkans 
conflict, are also playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that he's in trouble in the sense that he hasn't  
had his hearing yet,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the 
committee's senior Democrat. ``The longer a hearing is delayed, the 
more difficult it is for a nominee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Biden contended Holbrooke will be confirmed if the  
nomination ever gets to the floor. Biden said he has asked Helms 
for a ``straight answer'' on when hearings might be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thiessen, a Helms spokesman, denied that the committee is  
stalling but said getting the administration to share material from 
those internal investigations was ``like pulling teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a hearing until they share documents with this  
committee,'' Thiessen said. In particular, he complained that the 
Justice Department was not giving the committee what it had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only issue on the committee's mind right now is in doing a  
thorough review,'' Thiessen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those inquiries dealt largely with Holbrooke's private-sector  
contacts with former State Department colleagues. Holbrooke paid 
$5,000 to settle civil charges that he broke lobbying regulations, 
but without an admission of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke supporters contend that the ethics investigations were  
triggered by anonymous Holbrooke detractors within the State 
Department and that the committee's delay has also been deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there are any ethical problems with Holbrooke,''  
said Biden. ``I don't think there ever were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman Jim Foley said the  
administration considers the investigations completed -- and 
Holbrooke cleared. He said the administration continues to support 
Holbrooke and wants to see him confirmed soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in a brief  
interview, reiterated that the Republican-led Senate was not to 
blame for the delay. ``It's been the administration and all these 
investigations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he still hasn't decided whether to support Holbrooke,  
and ``I need to take a look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state and ambassador  
to Germany, negotiated with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
the 1995 accords that brought peace to Bosnia. He also made a 
last-ditch, unsuccessful appeal to Milosevic over Kosovo before the 
NATO air campaign began in March.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although Richard Holbrooke has been cleared of  
alleged ethics violations, his nomination to be U.N. ambassador 
remains on hold in the Senate. Democratic supporters suggested 
Wednesday the outspoken diplomat had become a target of Republicans 
frustrated with President Clinton's Kosovo policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after Clinton announced his choice of the Balkans  
troubleshooter for the United Nations post, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee has yet to schedule a hearing. But Clinton's 
administration itself delayed the nomination eight months while 
conducting its own investigation of Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there are any ethical problems with Holbrooke. I  
don't think there ever were,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, 
the committee's senior Democrat. ``There clearly is delay on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he has asked committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.  
for a ``straight answer'' on when hearings might be held. But 
Republicans suggested further study is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and other Senate Republicans note that even though Clinton  
announced the nomination in June 1998, he did not submit it until 
February -- after completion of a joint ethics investigations by the 
Justice and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms spokesman Mark Thiessen denied the committee was  
intentionally stalling and said getting the administration to share 
material from those internal investigations was ``like pulling 
teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a hearing until they share documents with this  
committee,'' Thiessen said. 
</P>
<P>
	One committee official said it seemed unlikely the review would  
be done before Memorial Day, meaning a hearing and Senate vote 
couldn't happen before June. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Helms came under pressure from Republican members of  
his own panel. ``I believe the ball is now in our court and we 
should act expeditiously on Mr. Holbrooke's nomination,'' Sen. Rod 
Grams, R-Minn., told Helms in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams, chairman of the subcommittee on international operations,  
said the UN post has long been vacant ``at a time we badly need 
U.S. leadership on many sensitive foreign policy matters, including 
Kosovo.'' Grams called Holbrooke ``highly qualified'' for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke is expected to receive wide bipartisan support if the  
nomination ever makes it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The State and Justice inquiries largely cleared Holbrooke of  
earlier allegations of conflict of interest violations, although 
Holbrooke paid $5,000 to settle civil charges that he broke 
lobbying laws in his private-sector contacts with former State 
Department colleagues. Holbrooke maintained he did nothing wrong 
and was paying the charges simply to end the matter quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Wednesday announced a subsequent  
internal investigation had cleared Holbrooke of allegations that he 
improperly accepted private speaking fees last fall while trying to 
broker a peace deal on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had been accused of improperly accepting private  
speaking fees while serving as a U.S. envoy to the Balkans, 
including a $16,000 fee for a speech on Kosovo last November at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department Inspector General Jacquelyn L.  
Williams-Bridgers said in a statement that the investigation ``did 
not find evidence of a clear violation'' of any federal rules and 
that she had ended the inquiry on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state and ambassador  
to Germany, negotiated the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the 
war in Bosnia. He is currently a vice president at the investment 
banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senate aides, and some Republicans as well, suggested  
privately that Holbrooke's role in the Balkans had become a 
political liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Holbrooke's name is often mentioned as a potential  
secretary of state in a Gore administration also doesn't help, the 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he didn't know ``whether the Republicans' political  
leadership has decided that (Holbrooke) is a scalp. ... It's 
obvious that he's in trouble,'' but he added, ``I still believe he 
will be confirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has sat on nominations before. In 1997, the North Carolina  
conservative blocked the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. 
William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be ambassador to Mexico by 
refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Holbrooke associates said Wednesday he was determined to  
continue seeking Senate approval -- and was not considering 
withdrawing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the key U.N. post has been vacant since former  
representative Bill Richardson left last September to assume his 
present job as energy secretary.

<HEADLINE> Governors Plan New Math Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. math students lag behind youngsters in  
other countries because their lessons don't focus on advanced 
topics, says a group of governors and corporate leaders who plan to 
create a new eighth grade math test to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states have agreed to use the test once it is developed a  
year from now, Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve Inc., a 
Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit group, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that students in top-performing nations are  
expected to learn advanced math concepts such as algebra and 
geometry at earlier grade levels than U.S. students. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign students, who outperformed U.S. students at the eighth  
and 12th grade levels in math, also concentrate on fewer, but more 
advanced topics. Students in the United States tend to pack in many 
more lessons, much of it being simple computations and work with 
fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no clear sense in this country of what sixth- through  
eighth-grade math should be other than the basic repetition of the 
first four or five years of school,'' said William H. Schmidt, a 
researcher who compares students test scores globally. 
</P>
<P>
	The international report, Third International Mathematics and  
Science Study, drew wide attention last year when it showed that 
American high school seniors ranked near the bottom among the 21 
nations that participated. The U.S. eighth graders scored at the 
international average in math and below average in science. 
</P>
<P>
	The math partnership, funded by the group, will give teachers  
training and lesson material to prepare students for the new test 
it will develop. The test will focus on two-dimensional geometry, 
proportions, exponents and other skills and content that prepare 
students for algebra and other high school courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators criticized the report, saying the comparisons are  
unfair because -- unlike Americans -- other countries exclude 
nonnative speakers, test older children and concentrate lessons on 
core material in a given year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group Wednesday stopped short of calling for national  
testing, a Clinton proposal many state education officials and 
lawmakers oppose because they are against federal mandates on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a resistance to anything beyond local control,'' said  
Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah. ``That doesn't mean we 
shouldn't have standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would cost the group $2 million to develop the lessons and  
test, without an initial contribution from the states. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states will spend about $330 million in 2000 on  
their own standards and tests, but the move toward unified tests 
could save money, said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 states agreeing to give the test once it's developed are:  
Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. 
Leavitt said Utah is considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders said Wednesday that advanced math is not an  
abstract concept students will never use. Many high-tech jobs call 
for the analytical skills found in algebra and geometry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few if any jobs are going to be available if you don't have a  
world class education,'' said Louis Gerstner, IBM chief and an 
Achieve co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Achieve Inc. was created after a 1996 national summit on  
education convened by lawmakers and leaders seeking to improve 
education in all states through increased standards, testing, 
technology and measures to hold schools accountable for the 
performance of their students. Leaders also said Wednesday that a 
national summit would be held Sept. 30-Oct. 1 to discuss how to 
keep good schools on track and bring others up to par.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Internet Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In the wake of the Colorado school  
shooting, Internet companies have agreed to provide new tools for 
parents to restrict and monitor online material such as violent 
video games and hate-group sites, Vice President Al Gore said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort will ``honor the lives'' of the victims at Littleton,  
Colo., Gore said as he announced an agreement for online providers 
to offer parents new aids to keep youngsters away from 
``inappropriate'' Web sites with violent, pornographic or 
hate-filled content. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Internet companies will include on their  
home pages a link to a new site featuring a long list of aids for 
parents. Included will be technology that allows parents to 
restrict their children's access to Internet sites and keep tabs on 
which sites youngsters are visiting. It also would allow them to 
limit the time children spend online, and would provide access to a 
``guide to good content'' and safety tips for youngsters and 
parents interested in surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the changes will take effect in July.  
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the Internet's stunning technology gives  
children and families access to an incredible world of information 
and, like life itself, most of it is great,'' Gore said. ``But 
there are some dark corners, there are some fire zones ... from 
which children must be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Gore at the White House ceremony to announce the  
agreement were consumer activists, Internet company executives and 
Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., and Pat Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence on the Internet has been a hotly debated topic since  
the April 20 shootings at a Littleton high school left 15 dead, 
including two killers linked to hate groups who were said to have 
played violent video games. 
</P>
<P>
	While many sites on the Internet promote child safety, backers  
say the link from major Internet company sites and the push from 
Gore mean the site is likely to be widely used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only by making changes can we honor the lives of those who  
were killed,'' Gore said in an interview earlier in Des Moines. 
``Where Internet is concerned, this will give parents more tools to 
employ the latest blocking and filtering technologies to limit 
access to sites that are run by hate groups, violent games and 
other materials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the major Internet companies have agreed to the plan,  
and Gore aides said the deal would cover Internet sites that 
account for 95 percent of all Internet traffic. Those familiar with 
bargaining that led to the agreement said the plan also includes a 
campaign to market the new guide, financed largely by Internet 
companies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies involved in the agreement are: America Online,  
AT&AMP;T, At Home Network, Bell Atlantic, Commercial Internet eXchange, 
Disney Online, Excite, Lycos, MCI WorldCom, Microsoft, MindSpring 
Enterprises, Netscape Communications, Network Solutions, Prodigy 
Communications and Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the move, Gore seeks to focus attention on his  
connection to high-tech issues. He has formed an exploratory 
committee to look into the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination 
and is considered certain to run. 
</P>
<P>
	As he moves to define himself apart from President Clinton, Gore  
has offered a series of relatively modest proposals on various 
issues much like the one he announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say he's being overly cautious, and his rival for the  
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, argues that 
Democrats need to be the party of ``big ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argues he is offering mainstream proposals on ``kitchen  
table'' issues of concern to average voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have argued for even tougher restrictions on  
Internet content, but they run into free-speech arguments that have 
found sympathy in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Early Toolmakers Had Real Knack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Early makers of stone tools were more skillful than previously  
believed, archaeologists who painstakingly pieced together rocks 
broken 2.3 million years ago reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	A stone tool factory the team uncovered in Kenya is so old that  
the toolmakers might not even have belonged to the human 
evolutionary group Homo. 
</P>
<P>
	They could have been small ape-like pre-humans, but they were  
smart enough to methodically chip off as many as 30 sharp flakes 
from a single rock the size of a loaf of bread. The flakes are 
thought to have been used to cut and scrape plants and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The working scheme is more elaborate than anything else I have  
seen of this age,'' said Helene Roche, an archaeologist at the 
University of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The team excavated a small site in Kenya's Rift Valley, where  
several clues to humans' earliest ancestors have been found. They 
pieced together many of the more than 2,000 flakes they found, 
producing about 60 reconstructions of the original stones. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like putting together a 3-D puzzle.  
</P>
<P>
	Roche and Anne Delagnes ``basically sat in camp for days and  
days and just looked at shapes and tried to match them back 
together. It's tremendously time-consuming, but it's really 
marvelous to see when it actually works,'' said Craig Feibel of 
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., a geologist on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said two things demonstrate the skill of the early  
toolmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	One is that they chose their raw material well. They would  
strike a new rock a couple of times to see if it was the kind of 
lava that gave sharp-edged flakes, and if it wasn't, they would 
discard it and move on to another. The team found several of these 
discarded, chipped rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The other remarkable thing is that they knew where to start  
striking a rock and how to proceed so that each flake chipped off 
left a new surface suitable for striking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like they are just sort of randomly whacking away and  
knocking off whatever happens to come off,'' Feibel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is very exciting,'' said stone tool specialist  
Alison Brooks at the Smithsonian Institution, adding that the 
factory is at least 700,000 years older than previous finds of the 
same complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there are cores with up to 30 flakes removed is  
just unheard of for this time,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who the flakes belonged to is a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Two species of Australopithecus, upright-walking pre-humans,  
could have been around at this time, as well as the earliest 
members of the genus Homo, to which modern humans belong. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest stone tools ever found, 2.6 million years old, are  
thought to be the work of Australopithecines. This theory was 
strengthened by a find in Ethiopia, announced two weeks ago, of the 
2.5 million-year-old bones of a previously unknown species of 
Australopithecus together with animal bones cut by tools.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Links Coles to Atlanta Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- New evidence linking Australian Olympic  
official Phil Coles to Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games deepened 
controversy surrounding him Thursday as calls for his resignation 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents released in Atlanta show Coles was officially thanked  
for ``help and advice'' given to the Atlanta bid team before the 
International Olympic Committee chose the city as the site for the 
1996 summer games, a report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Coles was a member of the Melbourne, Australia team  
that was bidding against Atlanta for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of two Australian IOC members, has dug in against  
calls he should resign from the Sydney Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games (SOCOG) for links to scandals which organizers say 
are seriously damaging sponsorship and threaten to hurt ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway said Thursday that many  
existing sponsors had been ``treading water'' while the 
controversies continued, but they now wanted ``the decks cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the person charged with bringing off the biggest peacetime  
event on earth, I'm trying to raise $160 million in additional 
sponsorships, I've got tickets going on sale at the end of this 
month, I've got volunteers around the country being recruited,'' 
Hollway told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't need day after day of front page and other news  
stories that are clouding what we should be thinking about, which 
is the sport, the athletes, the magnificence of this event for 
Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has blamed the IOC votes-for-bribes scandal in part for a  
sponsorship shortfall of around $170 million Australian dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board, the organization's highest body, this  
week deferred a decision on allegations Coles had accepted 
excessive gifts from someone associated with the 1996 Athens bid. 
That came after new allegations surfaced Tuesday that dossiers on 
IOC members compiled by Coles for Sydney bidders had been given to 
members of the bidding team for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board is now expected to decide Coles's fate in  
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles received the most severe reprimand short of expulsion from  
the IOC after its investigation into the votes-for-bribes scandal 
surrounding the Salt Lake bid found he had accepted hospitality 
beyond IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles claims there is a conspiracy against him and vowed  
Thursday not to quit until he had looked his accusers in the face. 
He has previously said some disenchanted members of Melbourne's 
failed 1996 bid may be plotting to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to walk away until I look my accusers in the  
face and say you were wrong,'' Coles said. ``If I'm wrong, then I 
will have to go but I'm not wrong, I'm not wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among documents released by Atlanta recently was a letter from  
the Atlanta Organizing Committee to Coles thanking him for making 
time to meet the team in Seoul in 1988, The Sydney Morning Herald 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of Billy Payne, Charlie Battle and the rest of our  
Atlanta group, thanks again for your help and advice,'' Atlanta 
executive board member Horace Sibley wrote, the Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Walker, a member of Melbourne's bid, said Thursday that the  
``heat'' Coles is feeling is justice for his ``dalliance with 
Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pity that so many of us spent so much time  
pursuing the Games for 1996 for Melbourne and we find that one of 
our number chose to help the other side,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald also reported that Dick Ebersol, head of NBC Sports,  
one of the biggest underwriters of the Games, had added his voice 
to calls for Coles' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should certainly leave SOCOG,'' Eberson was quoted as  
saying. ``This issue clearly slows sponsorship sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senior IOC member Jacques Rogge said Coles should be able to  
defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rights as a defendant is to explain his defense. We'll  
make a judgment and I'll comment only after that,'' Rogge said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Many Women Without Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A greater percentage of women today know  
what's necessary to stay healthy than did five years earlier, but 
many lack the health insurance to help them do it, according to a 
survey released Wednesday on women's health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that nearly two of every five women in the  
United States have been physically or sexually assaulted during 
their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the 1998 Commonwealth Fund Survey of Women's Health  
reported increased attention to women's health issues since its 
last survey in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Government health agencies now dedicate offices to such  
concerns, and the issue has been a focus of major medical projects 
by the National Institutes of Health. The media, both daily 
newspapers and women's magazines, also devote more attention to the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress in the field, however, was described as uneven.  
</P>
<P>
	The report found an increase in the uninsured, particularly  
among working women with low to modest income levels. Last year, 35 
percent of women under age 65 with incomes of $16,000 or less were 
uninsured, compared with 29 percent in 1993. For women with incomes 
from $16,001 to $35,000, the uninsured rate increased from 15 
percent to 21 percent in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a booming economy and one striking finding of our  
survey is that it hasn't stopped the steady erosion of health 
insurance among adult women,'' said Cathy Schoen, one of the 
report's authors. ``This is particularly concentrated in the lower 
half of the income distribution but uninsured rates are across the 
board for all groups of women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found a high number of women were physically or  
sexually assaulted either as children or adults. Almost two out of 
every five women surveyed -- 39 percent -- said they had been victims 
of abuse or violence in their lifetimes, including rape, sexual 
assault or other physical attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shockingly high rates of violence are really underlining  
women's own efforts on their own behalf to stay healthy, to do what 
they can,'' Schoen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of abuse crossed income, ethnic and demographic lines,  
although poor women were at somewhat higher risk. Women who had 
experienced violent or abusive acts were significantly more likely 
to experience physical health problems, and nearly twice as likely 
to show signs of depression or anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the report include:  
</P>
<P>
	--No major improvements in preventive care among women, despite  
increased attention to the importance of breast and cervical cancer 
screenings. Overall, 64 percent of those surveyed had received a 
pap test and 66 percent received a clinical breast exam -- rates 
virtually unchanged since the 1993 survey. Mammography rates for 
women age 50 and older, however, increased from 55 percent to 61 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The smoking rate for all women remained at 1993 levels -- 23  
percent -- although the rate was notably higher for lower-income 
women, 32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--About three-quarters of insured women, 76 percent, were  
enrolled in a managed health care plan, such as a health 
maintenance organization. The managed care plans were usually more 
successful than traditional fee-for-service plans in making sure 
women received regular preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Women reported improved knowledge about certain health  
conditions and behaviors. Many were familiar with osteoporosis and 
more reported getting more calcium, such as by drinking additional 
milk or taking calcium supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	--One of three women in menopause used hormone replacement  
therapy. In 1993, the figure was one in four. The women most likely 
to use hormone replacement therapy were college-educated and had 
higher incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Women were more likely than men to take care of a sick or  
disabled relative, in addition to fulfilling work and childcare 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey sample was based on interviews with 2,850 women  
conducted from May 7 to Nov. 10, 1998, by Louis Harris and 
Associates for the Commonwealth Fund, a national philanthropy based 
in New York City. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Spartans' Star Still Coy on Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State University point guard  
Mateen Cleaves still was being coy Wednesday on when he will 
announce his decision about entering the NBA draft or staying with 
the Spartans for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Michigan State sports information department  
announced Cleaves would hold a news conference that afternoon. But 
the briefing was canceled when Cleaves' mother, Fran, couldn't 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Fran Cleaves said she spent the entire day talking to NBA  
general managers, scouts and other counselors, trying to help her 
son evaluate his prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry that I'm holding everybody up. But we still have  
some investigating to do,'' she told the Lansing State Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reported that Cleaves said he expected to make an  
announcement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michigan State sports information officials on Wednesday  
said they had no information on when or how Cleaves would make his 
announcement, or even if he would. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves refused to tip his hand on his decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really thought about it that much,'' Cleaves told  
the State Journal. ``I haven't even sat down with Coach (Tom Izzo) 
yet to talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time All-American point guard this year helped Michigan  
State get to its first NCAA Final Four appearance in 20 years, 
where the Spartans were lost to national runnerup Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves averaged 11.7 points, 7.2 assists and 1.8 steals in  
leading Michigan State to the Big Ten regular season and tournament 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He has until midnight May 16 to declare for the June 30 NBA  
draft. He has not registered with an agent, according to Pam Burke 
of the NBA Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves has asked Izzo and his mother to do most of the research  
on where he would go in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want what's best for the kid,'' Izzo said. ``That  
hasn't changed one iota.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Summarizes Regional Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summaries of regional economic conditions before April 26,  
compiled by the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve: 
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON -- Economic activity increased moderately. ... The retail  
and manufacturing sectors report single-digit sales increases from 
a year earlier. ... While retailers ... are not raising their own 
prices, manufacturers report that ... a few are raising their 
selling prices. Strong demand is propelling increases in activity 
in residential real estate. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- The economy ... retains significant upward momentum,  
along with generally stable prices. Retailers report that sales 
have been on or above plan. ... Housing markets have tightened 
significantly ... especially in New York City. ... Office markets 
in and around New York City appear to have stabilized. ... 
Purchasing managers report a strong pickup in manufacturing 
activity ... along with declining commodity prices but continued 
inflation in costs of contracted services. ... There are increasing 
signs of labor shortages. ... 
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA -- Economic activity continued to advance. ...  
Manufacturers reported increases in shipments and orders ... and 
the number of firms noting slower business decreased. ... Retailers 
generally said sales remained on an upward track, although the rate 
of gain eased. ... Auto sales have been steady and above the rate 
recorded in the early spring of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND -- The ... economy continues to perform at a high  
level. Some pickup in manufacturing production has been experienced 
while retail and construction activity remain quite strong. ... 
Temporary employment agencies indicate that a lack of workers 
continues to hamper their ability to meet demand. ... Wage growth 
appears to have accelerated slightly for workers under collective 
bargaining agreements. ... Some cost-of-living adjustment clauses 
have been replaced with performance bonuses. ... Weather has been 
favorable for ... farmers. ... Most crops are reported to be ahead 
of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND -- The ... economy advanced at a quicker pace. ...  
Retailers reported bustling sales -- especially for big-ticket items 
-- and services-sector activity rebounded. ... Manufacturing 
continued to strengthen. ... In real estate markets, the pace of 
development and sales remained rapid. ... Labor markets tightened 
further but, outside of manufacturing, wages and prices increased 
only moderately. ... Farmers made good progress with their spring 
planting, but crop prices remained low. 
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA -- The Southeast economy continues to grow moderately,  
but ... outlooks have become less upbeat. ... Retail sales were 
weaker. ... Recent reports on the tourism and hospitality sector 
have been very positive, but contacts in Florida have become more 
concerned about the international portion of the state's tourism. 
... Builders report single-family construction is still growing 
slowly, and nonresidential construction declined somewhat. ... 
Factory production has increased slightly ... but manufacturers' 
outlooks are less optimistic. ...Tight labor markets remain a 
problem ... but significant wage increases are largely limited to 
skilled labor. ... Anticipate few price changes over the next 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO -- Economic conditions ... remained strong. ... Retailers  
continued to reap the benefits of confident consumers and strong 
home sales. Overall construction activity appeared to gain momentum 
in spite of shortages of skilled labor and some building supplies. 
... Manufacturing activity was strong, but mixed, as some of the 
region's mainstay industries continued to struggle. ... Concerns 
over labor shortages became more pronounced and there were few new 
reports of intensifying wage pressures. Low commodity prices 
continued to plague farmers. ... 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS -- Business conditions remain strong. Tight labor  
markets ... are affecting many firms' plans for expansion or 
relocation. Wage pressures, however, remain subdued, and material 
costs, except those affected by the recent surge in oil prices, 
have shown little upward movement. Housing markets are vibrant. ... 
Planting progress is still on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS -- The overall ... economy continues to flourish,  
although natural resource-based industries are still floundering. 
... Forward momentum continues for construction, consumer spending 
and manufacturing. But low commodity prices persist in depressing 
farm income and curbing metal mining. Businesses would still like 
to hire additional workers and are facing some material shortages, 
which are causing isolated price increases. However, no general 
acceleration in wage and price increases is noted. 
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY -- The ... economy expanded modestly. ... Retail  
sales were again outstanding, with vehicle sales rebounding nicely. 
... Construction activity remained strong and energy activity may 
be poised for a turnaround. ... Manufacturing activity held steady. 
... Growing conditions continue to be generally favorable. Labor 
markets ... remained very tight, with wage pressures continuing to 
mount. Retail prices edged up, as did prices for some construction 
materials, while prices for several manufacturing materials fell as 
factories took advantage of cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS -- The ... economy continued to expand. ... Manufacturing  
activity was up slightly, with several industries reporting 
improving sales. Retailers said sales growth continued to exceed 
expectations. ... Construction activity also continued to increase, 
and ... building was constrained by labor and materials shortages. 
... Agriculture conditions remain difficult, with low commodity 
prices and concerns about dry soil. ... More farmers are expected 
to quit production this year. 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Robust economic activity ... despite continued  
restraint from weak trade conditions. Sales were strong for 
retailers and providers of services. ... Vigorous activity and 
further expansion in housing and real estate markets. ... 
Manufacturers and agricultural producers were hampered by 
international trade conditions ... although a slight improvement 
was noted in agriculture. Price increases were limited overall, 
despite a sharp increase in the price of gasoline and rising prices 
for some services.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Fires Five Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has fired five employees  
suspected of helping organize a sickout by ticket agents and 
baggage handlers that caused flight cancellations last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline spokesman Jack Evans said two people worked in Las Vegas  
and one each in Seattle, Portland and San Diego. The five, all 
customer service agents, were fired Monday afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists denied any knowledge  
of or involvement in a sickout. The union said it would file 
grievances on behalf of all five to try to get their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
	All the airline's unions are negotiating updated contracts  
except its pilots, whose most recent package was signed in 1997. 
Workers have complained that the talks are progressing slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day they don't pay us more money is a day they save  
money,'' said Steve Stanczyk, secretary-treasurer of the machinists 
Local 2202. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of disgruntled employees at Alaska right  
now,'' he said. ``And these firings made things worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 28 flights were canceled April 16 because a  
higher-than-average number of ticket agents and baggage handlers 
called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier still is investigating a slowdown by mechanics for  
six days last week that caused more than 200 flights to be canceled 
because airplanes were not ready to fly as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines schedules about 500 departures daily.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Falling; Dow Drops 77.03 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors ignored a  
recovery in the bond market and continued to take profits in 
technology and energy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 77.03 at 10,809.08. The Dow gained as much as 39 points in 
early trading before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell after a strong opening. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 11.27 at 1,320.73, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was down 46.56 at 2,438.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp., said  
he was unconcerned about the drop in stock prices. ``You're getting 
some profit-taking, a normal pull-back after huge gains, which is 
very healthy for the market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawler also said he did not believe interest rates would move  
much higher and jeopardize stock gains. ``I don't think there's any 
real great fear of inflation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates were investors' primary focus early in the  
session, as they were Tuesday, when a sharp rise in rates pushed 
the Dow down 128.58 to 10,886.11. The 30-year Treasury bond was 
down slightly this morning but by noon had recovered, its yield 
down to 5.69 percent from 5.71 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recovery in the bond market didn't help stocks.  
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were sharply lower, with America Online down 6  
3/16 at 120 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led lower by Chevron, down 2 4/5 at 97 9/16. And  
General Motors was down 2 7/8 at 86 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 3 7/8 at 55 7/16 after the  
company won a lively bidding contest for MediaOne, a cable company, 
making AT&AMP;T the nation's largest cable provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in yet another demonstration that the economy  
continues to be strong, the National Purchasing Management 
Association said its index of business activity among 
non-manufacturing companies rose to 64.0 in April from 62.5 in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Commerce Department reported new orders to American  
factories rose 2 percent in March, more than wiping out a 
1.8-percent February decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank  
Global Asset Management, said the positive economic news raised 
concerns about inflation. The Federal Reserve is more likely to 
push interest rates higher if it appears inflation is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newbridge Networks were down sharply after the  
Canadian networking concern warned late Tuesday its fiscal 
fourth-quarter profits will come in significantly below analysts' 
forecasts. Newbridge Networks was down 8 11/16 at 28 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other networkers were lower in early trading in sympathy with  
Newbridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers by 8 to 5 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 403.08 million shares, down 
from Tuesday's pace of 437.95 million.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Bruins Feature Top Goalies / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Boston goalie Byron Dafoe had a scoop  
for reporters about his Buffalo counterpart, Dominik Hasek: ``We've 
got to remember that he is human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that claim after Wednesday's practice, Hasek's saves  
sometimes seem out of this world. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he's flopping on the ice or snatching a puck out of the  
air, he's the NHL's best goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means the Bruins will have a tough time scoring against  
the Sabres in their second-round playoff series beginning Thursday 
night in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	So they plan to rely on quantity -- plenty of shots on goal and  
plenty of Bruins blocking Hasek's view in front of the net -- to try 
and beat the NHL's most valuable player the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``His style is so unorthodox, you basically try to put the puck  
on net and try to get as much traffic in front,'' said Boston wing 
Anson Carter. ``He doesn't play standup style. He doesn't play 
butterfly style. He just stops the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was outstanding in Buffalo's four-game sweep of Ottawa in  
the opening round. That followed a regular season in which he led 
the NHL in save percentage and was second with nine shutouts and 
second with a 1.87 goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dafoe wasn't far behind.  
</P>
<P>
	He actually led the league with 10 shutouts, was second in save  
percentage and third with a 1.99 goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play at least as well as we did against Ottawa,  
maybe even better, because we're facing a better team now,'' Hasek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a lot of scoring in the best-of-7 Eastern  
Conference semifinal between two defensive-minded teams. Especially 
since Miroslav Satan, who led Buffalo with 40 goals, may miss the 
opener with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one less scorer for Dafoe to worry about.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek ``is a good goaltender. We have a good goaltender, too,''  
Bruins coach Pat Burns said. ``You're going to have to really shoot 
like you mean it and get to the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, though, has had more success over a longer period of time  
than Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Dominik, they have Byron,'' Buffalo's Brian Holzinger  
said. ``We like our chances with Dom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo had the upper hand in the regular season, going 4-1  
against the Bruins. Boston's only win came in its next to last 
game, 2-1 in overtime on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins and Sabres each finished with 91 points, but Boston  
got the sixth seed and Buffalo the seventh because the Bruins had 
two more wins. The matchup was set when eighth-seeded Pittsburgh 
eliminated first-seeded New Jersey on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Boston nor Buffalo expects their regular-season meetings  
to have any effect on the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the regular season tended to determine anything in the  
postseason,'' Ruff said, ``Ottawa and New Jersey would be in the 
playoffs right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, Boston scored six goals in four games  
against Hasek, while Buffalo had 14 in five games against Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're getting chances, you're going to score some goals,''  
Boston captain Ray Bourque said. ``Not all that many goalies are 
able to steal a game on their own. He's capable of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe, though, welcomes the challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know he's going to have a great series so I've got to try  
to be just as good to match him,'' Dafoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, he added, he's never met Hasek, although they'll  
get together when the teams line up to exchange handshakes at the 
end of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get to shake his hand, that's for sure,'' Dafoe said. ``I  
hope I'm smiling when I'm doing it.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Rise Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crude and its products finished higher on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange after a rocky session in which 
investors worried about current and future supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices originally retreated as weekly inventory statistics from  
the American Petroleum Institute released after the close of 
trading Tuesday indicated that refiners sharply increased 
production of unleaded gasoline just as U.S. demand eased. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped relieve concerns that supplies may be tight through  
the peak warm-weather U.S. driving season and caused sharp declines 
in futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices later bounced higher on news of the shutdown of a  
gas-making unit at Lyondell-Citgo Refining Co.'s refinery near 
Houston. The unit refinery handles 265,000 barrels of crude a day. 
Market participants said the shutdown could last for two weeks, 
although the company refused to provide details of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude rose 6 cents to $18.98 a barrel; June heating oil  
rose .28 cent to 45.79 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline rose 
.06 cent to 56.25 cents a gallon. June natural gas remained 
unchanged at $2.359 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in June  
rose 12 cents to $17.05 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Cali Cartel Lawyers Denied New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday refused to grant a new  
trial for two lawyers convicted of funneling hush money, delivering 
threats and preparing false affidavits for Colombian drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Michael Abbell and William Moran last December  
sought a new trial because a judge dismissed a juror in the men's 
trial last summer after other jurors said she was prejudiced. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 11 convicted Moran and Abbell of two conspiracy  
charges that each could bring them 20 years in prison. The jurors 
deadlocked on two other conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William M. Hoeveler said he would hold a hearing on  
whether Moran and Abbell's racketeering conspiracy conviction 
should stand. He also acquitted them of conspiracy to import 
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the charges on which 
the jury deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbell's attorney, William Moffitt, said he found the ``opinion  
puzzling, to say the least'' and would appeal once his client is 
sentenced. Moran's attorney did not immediately return a message 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Moran and Abbell, a former extradition  
expert with the Justice Department, went beyond just zealously 
representing their clients, members of the Cali drug cartel, and 
actually took part in their crimes.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Thome Begins Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jim Thome got into one fight, but decided to  
skip another. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome dropped his appeal and began serving his three-game  
suspension for charging the mound in a game last month between the 
Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig suspended Thome and Cleveland pitcher  
Jaret Wright along with Boston pitcher Rheal Cormier and Darren 
Lewis for their involvement in two bench-clearing incidents in the 
April 23 game. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome had considered serving his suspension while the Indians  
were on the road last week, but decided to sit out the first three 
games of Cleveland's eight-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Seattle Mariners starting left-handers -- Jeff Fassero  
and Jamie Moyer -- during their stop, Thome said he discussed the 
situation with Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove and they figured now 
was as good a time as any for the first baseman to take a 
mini-vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get it out of the way,'' Thome said. ``It's  
something that with the next two days being against lefties, I just 
wanted to get it over with. I didn't want to have it lingering 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome is batting .287 overall, but just .188 against lefties.  
</P>
<P>
	He is allowed to work out with the Indians during his suspension  
but is banned from sitting in the dugout during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome said he wasn't sure where he would watch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' he said. ``You got me, this is my first  
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome, who is good friends with Cormier, was given a ride back  
to the Indians' hotel following the brawl by the Boston pitcher. He 
said he expected to be suspended, but promised he wouldn't make a 
habit of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, when you charge the mound, you're  
going to get three games,'' he said. ``Now I know I'll be back 
after three days. Don't look for Jim Thome to charge the mound in 
the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Thome out, Richie Sexson started at first for Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Launch Failures Have Cost $3.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two launch explosions. Three  
satellites stuck in useless orbits. Another satellite vaporized in 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has had six U.S. rocket failures in less than  
nine months with losses totaling $3.5 billion, mostly at taxpayer 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the worst string of botched U.S. rocket launches since the  
mid-1980s; space shuttle Challenger was among the casualties back 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	The question being asked Wednesday just hours after the latest  
mishap was: What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem, I think, is that this is still hard. We have not  
learned how to make the launch systems that we have anywhere near 
the reliability of aircraft, for example,'' said John Logsdon, 
director of George Washington University's space policy institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so as long as we use these systems, there are going to be  
failures. Now when they all come in a row, it's really kind of 
nasty. But statistically, I think that's as likely as any other 
outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six rockets were carrying three military satellites, two  
commercial communication satellites, and a privately owned 
satellite capable of taking detailed, military-quality photographs 
of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the rockets were launched by the Air Force; three by  
aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the safety implications for NASA's space shuttle program,  
the shuttle itself, at least, has no parts in common with the 
errant rockets. But the same two contractors that built them -- 
Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. -- also work on the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underneath, there may be some systemic problems,'' Logsdon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the shuttle program has been affected by the launch  
fiascos. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is grounded, and its telescope-delivery mission in July  
is on hold, until the Air Force figures out why an upper-stage 
motor on a Titan IV rocket failed during a satellite launch last 
month. The same kind of motor will be used to propel NASA's $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's newest rocket, the Delta III, was the latest to flop.  
</P>
<P>
	After a month of delays, including a countdown that went all the  
way down to zero without an engine ignition, the Delta III blasted 
off Tuesday night. Everything seemed to go well until 22 minutes 
into the flight, when the upper stage that's needed to boost the 
satellite into a higher orbit either did not fire for the second 
time or did not fire long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of circling Earth thousands of miles high, the  
communication satellite was left in a useless, lopsided orbit 98 
miles by about 860 miles. The chances of saving the satellite were 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second botched flight in a row for the Delta III,  
which was intended to grab more of the launch market for Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight in August ended in a fireball 71 seconds  
after liftoff because of a poor computer program. The satellite was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in August, an Air Force Titan IV rocket carrying a spy  
satellite blew up less than a minute into flight. An Air Force 
investigation uncovered faulty wiring as well as questionable 
quality control by Lockheed Martin. All Titan models were grounded 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan IV -- the Pentagon's most powerful rocket and the only  
one able to lift hefty military payloads -- was back in action April 
9. But the missile-warning satellite it was carrying ended up in a 
useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Titan IV lifted off last Friday, but that military  
communication satellite also ended up in an orbit thousands of 
miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who is in charge of the  
Cape Canaveral Air Station, said there appears to be no 
similarities among the three failed Titan IV missions, which cost 
about $1 billion each. Nonetheless, Titan launches are on hold, as 
are Deltas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of all this, Lockheed Martin's relatively new  
Athena II rocket failed following its launch from California last 
week. A protective shroud did not separate from the Earth-imaging 
satellite aboard and dragged it back down through the atmosphere, 
where it burned up. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale Schluter, a Boeing vice president, said one explanation for  
recent launch failures may be that so many more rockets are flying. 
Boeing averaged six rocket launches a year from 1993 to 1998, and 
expects to triple that from 1998 to 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing not only an increase in rates, but we're also  
seeing new products being brought to market, and I think when you 
put all that together, that has a bearing on the performance that 
we're seeing right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Cuts Boost Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With OPEC members sticking to their plans about  
cutting oil output, gas prices seem unlikely to decline any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	An eagerly awaited report from the Organization of the Petroleum  
Exporting Countries this week or next is expected to show that OPEC 
members are abiding by their recent pledge to trim production. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Tuesday that could help push crude above $20 a  
barrel, nearly twice was it was last December. That means the glory 
days of prices below $1 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline are 
likely over -- at least for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't see any huge increases like the spike we had  
for the six-week period from mid-March through April,'' AAA 
spokesman Jerry Cheske said Tuesday. ``The way things are now, 
prices might rise another nickel a gallon or may even have peaked, 
but they're not going to go down again soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline now averages about $1.23 per gallon around the country,  
up from just 99 cents in February. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway,  
agreed in March to cut their combined daily production by 2.7 
percent, or 2.1 million barrels, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministry in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer,  
said Tuesday that a report due in the next few days will show 
countries participating in the latest round of cuts reached nearly 
80 percent of that goal in April, with 100 percent compliance 
likely to come later this month. Most of the major producers 
already have said in separate reports that they've reached their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC seems to have met or exceeded what was needed to turn on  
the market,'' said John Saucer, an energy analyst for Solomon Smith 
Barney in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of cuts comes on top of 3.1 million in  
reductions pledged over the past year -- moves that had little 
effect on prices at the pump amid weak demand in Asia and Europe, 
widespread cheating on exports and increased output from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices for crude have jumped since March in futures trading  
as anecdotal confirmation of the latest round of cuts began to come 
in, including a steep decline in imports to America and 
cancellation of some large orders to European and Asian buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for delivery in June finished at $18.93 barrel Tuesday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, about 83 percent higher than a 
12-year low of $10.35 a barrel posted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides OPEC cutbacks, other factors have contributed to the oil  
price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, Americans took to the roads for an early start to the  
peak driving season. And, several refineries experienced production 
problems in California, one of the largest consumer states. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand to the Far East, which fell sharply last year, also is on  
the rise. Recent estimates have demand in that region rising this 
year by about 2 percent, said analyst Ed Kevelson at Paribas 
Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wouldn't have been a big story a year ago, but it's a big  
story from where we came,'' Kevelson said. ``With what looks like a 
solid driving season on the way in the United States and Europe and 
rebounding Asian demand, and reduced production, the market has 
been pricing in a target of about $20.50 a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a chance oil producers, heady over the recent  
increases, could return to the ways of the past and begin exporting 
beyond their pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to see them in their best behavior mode in  
May and probably June,'' said Saucer of Solomon Smith Barney. 
``After that, there may be some `leakage', but they've finally 
begun to realize that tough times call for tough measures. There's 
not a lot of incentive for them after seeing prices fall so low 
last year to go back to that.''

<HEADLINE> Hens Lay Eggs With 'Good Fat' / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETALUMA, Calif. (AP) -- There's something fishy going on at an  
egg farm in bucolic Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Mahrt's hens are feasting on more than just corn and  
soybeans. Dining on algae is giving their eggs a power dose of DHA 
omega-3 fatty acids -- the ``good fat'' doctors say is great for 
your eyes, brain and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The eggs look, smell and taste generally the same as regular  
eggs. Some think they taste better, says Mahrt, a third-generation 
egg farmer in the town once known as the Egg Basket of the World. 
But these eggs have three times the amount of DHA and six times 
more vitamin E, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand it's going to take awhile to understand because  
people go 'An egg's an egg,''' Mahrt said. ``But it's not. If 
you're going to eat eggs anyway, why not eat eggs that are extra 
healthy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said for years that omega-3 fatty acids,  
polyunsaturated acids found in breast milk, cold-water fish and 
wild game, lower the rate of coronary heart disease. The American 
Heart Association suggests eating several helpings of fish a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahrt began paying attention to studies that showed Greenland  
Eskimos -- eating seal, walrus and mackerel -- had lower heart attack 
death rates than the Danish. 
</P>
<P>
	``What intrigued me was that Eskimos almost had no  
cardiovascular disease. And they eat a high-fat diet all animal in 
origin,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning that the American diet was particularly low in DHA,  
Mahrt started thinking of ways to make an egg filled with omega-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a great fish-eating society. That's why people are  
looking at eggs -- it's something people eat,'' said Lucia Kaiser, a 
nutrition expert at the University of California, Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahrt encountered scientist Bill Barclay, who founded OmegaTech  
Inc. to restore DHA to the American food supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish oil capsules gave eggs a fishy taste. And feeding chickens  
salmon didn't work. Barclay discovered a marine algae rich in DHA 
off the California coast, which he engineered in a dried form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone back down the food chain and naturally brought the  
DHA from the algae to the chickens,'' Barclay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the algae is grown on farms in San Diego -- without  
chemicals, fertilizers or the threat of ocean pollution. A year 
ago, OmegaTech began producing the eggs at Gold Circle Farms in 
Boulder, Colo., with a label that bills them as ``The Extra 
Nutritious Egg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, the nutritionist, called the egg ``promising.''  
</P>
<P>
	``If you were consuming even a single egg a day, this enrichment  
still could have great benefits,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahrt produces the eggs under the Gold Circle Farms label  
throughout Northern California; other farms do the same in Southern 
California, Denver, Indianapolis and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Up among the rolling hills of Petaluma, where hundreds of egg  
farms flourished 60 years ago, Mahrt has about 4,000 to 5,000 hens 
who feast on the mixture.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Broadly in Sell Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar sold off broadly Wednesday as traders  
bought euros amid some second-guessing about the invincibility of 
the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The European currencies also gained strength amid hints of a  
peaceful solution to the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.65  
Japanese yen, down from 120.85 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose 
against the dollar, trading at $1.0740, up from $1.0617. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders bought euros, which have been sliding since their launch  
in January, once the new currency breached a psychologically 
important level, said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange 
Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then U.S. stocks started falling, with the Dow Jones industrial  
average dropping as much as 110 points before ending nearly 70 
points higher, and that ``got people spooked,'' Solin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, U.S. Treasury bond yields had been rising, both  
indications to some that the U.S. might not remain the world's 
strongest economy, with Europe and Japan the weaker cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the costly and deadly conflict in Kosovo began  
showing signs that peace was possible, easing another pressure 
weighing on European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar didn't fall against the yen until late afternoon,  
when a rumor spread about a Renault-Nissan transaction that would 
require large amounts of yen for the deal, Solin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4944 Swiss francs, down from 1.5110;  
and 1.4515 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4529 late Tuesday. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.6377, up from $1.6292. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on the euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8212 German 
marks, down from 1.8422; 6.1087 French francs, down from 6.1784; 
and 1,801.80 Italian lire, down from 1,823.74.

<HEADLINE> Kings Fiset Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Kings goalie Stephane Fiset  
has undergone surgery to repair a tear in his left abdominal wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiset, 28, had surgery Monday and will be in rehabilitation  
about three weeks. He is expected to have a full recovery, the team 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was not related to groin injuries suffered in the  
early weeks of the Kings' season. Those injuries kept Fiset out of 
23 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quebec native was acquired by the Kings in a four-player  
deal with the Colorado Avalanche on June 20, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The goalie was first drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the  
second round in 1987. He was the 24th overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiset had a 18-21-1 record in 42 games with the Kings, with a  
goals-against average of 2.60 and a .915 save percentage.

<HEADLINE> Dad Sentenced for Attacking Ref </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A father who punched a referee after his  
11-year-old son lost a wrestling match was sentenced to up to one 
year in jail by a judge who wanted to send a message. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Chambers, 41, of Sicklerville, N.J., was convicted  
Tuesday of assaulting referee Rich Vees, 22, during a novice clubs 
wrestling tournament at Council Rock High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers, a former Upper Darby police officer, admitted hitting  
Vees but claimed it was in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks County Judge Barry McAndrews found Chambers guilty of  
assaulting a sports official, simple assault and disorderly 
conduct, and sentenced him to two to 12 months in county prison. 
McAndrews said that parents should not teach their children that a 
``culture of violence'' is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers was arrested Jan. 9 after his son lost a close match.  
Chambers reacted by screaming obscenities and charging across the 
gym to confront Vees as 300 people in the stands and dozens of 5- 
to 14-year-old wrestlers watched, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vees said Chambers punched him several times before coaches and  
parents swarmed onto the mat to break it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even get a chance to raise the winning kid's hand,''  
Vees said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chambers' attorney, Gavin Lentz, asked the judge to  
consider a sentence of probation, McAndrews refused and said he had 
a message to send to other parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this culture of violence, we wring our hands when something  
goes wrong ... and sometimes someone ends up hurt or even dead,'' 
he said. ``What Mr. Chambers did was wrong, and it set a very bad 
example for his son and all the other children who were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Chambers was sentenced, his son began to cry and was led  
from the courtroom by a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Vees said he was satisfied with the sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with parents all the time,'' he said. ``Most are nice,  
some yell a lot, but you get used to that. People, especially kids, 
have to know you can't just hit somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Chambers is scheduled to graduate from Rowan  
University's MBA program next week, McAndrews allowed him to post 
$15,000 bail and report to prison May 17.

<HEADLINE> Longtime USC Golf Coach Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stan Wood, whose Southern California golf  
teams played in 22 NCAA championships in his 25 years as coach, has 
died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood died of a heart attack Monday while playing the 16th hole  
at Los Robles Golf Course in Thousand Oaks. It was his first round 
of golf in more than a year, the university said in a statement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of his players at Southern Cal won major titles as  
professionals, including PGA champions Al Geiberger in 1966 and 
Dave Stockton in 1970 and 1976; Masters champion Craig Stadler in 
1982; and U.S. Open champion Scott Simpson in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25 years at USC, his teams won 14 conference  
championships and had a dual meet record of 462-37. He also helped 
create the Golf Coaches Association of America and served as 
chairman of the NCAA Golf Committee from 1965 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood attended Southern Cal and worked for the Los Angeles Mirror  
as a golf writer before returning to coach at his alma mater. He 
became head coach in 1955 and retired in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is survived by his wife Marianne and his two stepsons.

	Kosovo Refugees Arrive in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- Kosovo refugees arriving in the United  
States today from Macedonia stepped off buses that took them to 
their temporary homes at Fort Dix, where they shook hands with the 
camouflage-clad soldiers welcoming them. Reporters were barred from 
speaking to the refugees. Most of the 20,000 refugees that the 
United States has agreed to accept will be directly placed with 
sponsoring families or relatives upon arrival. But the group 
arriving at Fort Dix from Macedonia today were deemed at special 
risk because they had no family members available to help them or 
were staying in unstable refugee areas.

	Poll: Gun Law Support Jumps  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the wake of the high school shooting in  
Colorado, support for gun control among Americans rose 9 percentage 
points, with a majority of Americans saying tougher gun laws are 
the most effective way to stem violence. That is what 51 percent of 
those polled think, an increase from just before the deaths at the 
school. Those most likely to shift positions after the Colorado 
shootings were senior citizens and women. Just over half of older 
Americans supported tougher gun controls before the shooting, 
compared with more than two-thirds afterward. Among women, 
two-thirds supported tougher gun laws in the first poll; about 
three-quarters favored them after the shootings.

Monday's macaroni dinner was still in a pot on the stove. ``It's 
worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't home when 
extraordinarily massive twisters leveled 3,000 homes and killed 38 
people in Oklahoma. Five people were killed by tornadoes in Kansas. 
Officials said nearly 700 people were injured in the deadliest 
tornado to hit Oklahoma since 1947. The damage estimate has been 
placed at more than $225 million. At least 1,500 businesses and 
homes in Kansas also were destroyed or heavily damaged in Monday's

whether to remain part of Indonesia or seek independence. The

the 800,000 Timorese reject autonomy, Indonesia has pledged to put 
the half-island territory on the road to independence.

AOL was actively involved in sensitive negotiations with Netscape 
Communications Corp. Those talks culminated months later in AOL's 
nearly $10 billion purchase of Netscape, the Internet pioneer whose 
Web browsing software is a focal point of the government's 
antitrust case against Microsoft. Microsoft has maintained that it 
didn't know about the plans by two of its chief software rivals 
until news reports of the deal surfaced late in November, and that 
it wasn't able to explore the implications of the new alliance on

<HEADLINE> Internet Portals See Big Payoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Watching the Internet explode around him,  
Vincent Schiavone quietly began buying domain names that began with 
the number four: 4wine.com, 4babies.com, 4soccer.com, 
4anything.com. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday -- three years after the Philadelphia entrepreneur  
began buying ``4'' domains -- Schiavone will officially launch 
4anything.com, adding yet another portal to burgeoning market led 
by companies like Yahoo! Inc. and Excite Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet, as hot as it is, is really still in its  
infancy,'' said Schiavone on Tuesday at an Internet commerce 
conference in San Francisco. ``We want to lead the second wave of 
portals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portals are the entry points for users to venture onto the  
Internet. Consumers use them to find a wealth of online services 
such as free e-mail, news, chat and personalized functions like 
stock quotes, local weather and sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prosperous world of the Internet, portals have seen big  
payoffs. They make money selling advertisements, and by pointing 
customers to businesses. New York-based Jupiter Communications 
estimates that online retail sales generated by portal sites will 
represent $2.4 billion out of the $13 billion total projected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the market has evolved, companies such as Yahoo! and America  
Online Inc. have become dominant, becoming among the most visited 
sites on the Internet. Others, such as Excite Inc., have been 
acquired by companies eager to tap into the portals' power.. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the established portals are geared toward the average  
Web surfer, offering a wide range of options. Now a new era of more 
sophisticated portals -- dozens of them -- are searching out a much 
more targeted audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first come on the Internet, they are so  
overwhelmed by all the information that these big established 
portals serve a very important function as a funnel. But as users 
become more savvy, they realize these portals have editorial 
slants, or are simply too broad, for what they need,'' said 
Jonathan Yarmis, an eMarketWorld executive vice president from 
Richmond, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Long Island, N.Y., cousins Andrew, 32, and Steven,  
26, Deitch scraped together $10,000 to launch FreeWebCentral 
specifically for business visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical section doesn't focus on self help tips. Instead,  
they publish drug databases and the full text of scientific journal 
articles. The stock area includes a ticker tape, global clocks and 
a stock split calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular spot is a link to unclaimed bank, dividend and  
tuition accounts gathered from state comptrollers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4anything.com, Schiavone said his users are going to be  
consumers who don't want the obscure and bizarre items buried deep 
in the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not giving them the volume of the Web,'' he said.  
``We're going through that volume ourselves, and just giving our 
users the best of the Web.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Western Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A yellowed portrait of Bob Wills smiles down  
on every rocker who takes to his well-worn stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cain's Ballroom, a faded old dance old hall across the railroad  
tracks from Tulsa's modern skyscrapers, has played host to the Sex 
Pistols, Van Halen, The Police, REM and Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	But through the screaming guitars, flying sweat and crashing  
bodies on the dance floor, Wills' grin stands out like the floating 
grin of a Cheshire cat -- cool above the madness. 
</P>
<P>
	The king of Western swing once predicted rock 'n' roll would  
live forever. Would he smile knowing his name is now forever tied 
to rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been tickled to death,'' Guy Logsdon, a local  
historian, surmises of Wills' induction in March into the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A permanent exhibit at the hall's museum in Cleveland honors  
Wills and his Texas Playboys as early influences in paving the way 
for rock nearly seven decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wills is also in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville --  
one of just a handful of such crossovers, and therefore grist for 
the eternal debate about whether rock and country can be mentioned 
in the same breath. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Pugh, research librarian for the Country Music Hall of  
Fame, could recall only two inductees from the rock genre: Elvis 
and Brenda Lee. ``And Brenda Lee is really more pop than rock 'n' 
roll,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis' induction into the Country Hall of Fame last year brought  
a mixed response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do hear from people. Some applaud it. There are some who  
deplore it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic in the other direction is somewhat busier. Artists as  
varied as Jimmie Rodgers, Louis Armstrong, Hank Williams, The Ink 
Spots and Pete Seeger have been inducted into the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, but as ``early influences'' -- a category that doesn't 
exist in the Nashville pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in the end it's the music that matters, not the category,  
as Wills would probably have been the first to point out. 
</P>
<P>
	Wills, who died in 1975, had a barrier-breaking ``rock 'n' roll  
attitude'' long before it came to be, said Robert Santelli, the 
museum's director of education. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his band introduced drums and electric guitars to country  
music, and then fused country strings and big band jazz into one 
lively beat that was popularized as Western swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coolest thing about Bob Wills' music is it had a sense of  
back beat to it,'' Santelli said. ``Rock 'n' roll lives by its back 
beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that beat thrived on the spring-backed dance floor of the  
Cain's Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas native brought his music to Tulsa in 1934 and his band  
set young dancers spinning to such songs as ``San Antonio Rose'' 
and ``Spanish Two-Step.'' Their fame spread with cross-country 
tours, Hollywood movies and a radio show that Wills' brother, 
Johnnie Lee Wills, continued through the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Young rockers like Chuck Berry were listening, and Berry in turn  
influenced rock 'n' roll's pioneers, Santelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legacy and legend meet at Cain's under a banner that reads,  
``Home of Bob Wills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck performed at Cain's in 1996, and before going on stage he  
studied the portraits of bygone stars that line the dance floor 
walls, said promoter Davit Souders. The rock singer strolled from 
Gene Autry to Kay Starr to Tex Ritter and Tex's horse to Wills, 
soaking up the atmosphere of Wills' old stamping ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That night, some members of the band showed up in cowboy hats.  
And Beck shouted to a crowd of teen-agers jumping madly on the 
springy floor, ``What would Bob Wills think of y'all smashing each 
others' heads?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real tribute to Wills comes every March when former Texas  
Playboys reunite in honor of his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their hair shines silver, and they joke about Viagra. But when  
the former sidemen of the Wills' brothers took the stage in March 
in white cowboy hats and black vests, the music came fast and 
furious. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiddle player Curly Lewis, at age 74 with one lung removed from  
surgery, drew the first sweet notes, and dancers flocked under the 
red neon star on Cain's low ceiling. The first break didn't come 
for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the music in it. It's the rhythm in it,'' said  
76-year-old Arnold Siepert, who traveled from Dallas to dance for 
four hours and returned the next day to dance three hours more. 
``It puts it in your bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wills' music thrived on combining imagination with the popular  
dance of the day, said Logsdon, a Tulsa music scholar who makes 
historic recordings for the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Bob had a band today, he'd be playing what the popular  
dance demanded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wills told The Tulsa Tribune in 1958 that rock 'n' roll would be  
around forever. He figured he had been playing it since at least 
1928. But he was careful to make a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why, we don't know anything else,'' Wills said. ``We just keep  
the beat clean and hard and don't clonk it up like this so-called 
rock 'n' roll. If they can't dance to our rhythm, then they just 
plain can't dance. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Texas Playboys also draw the line.  
</P>
<P>
	A shout rose from the dance floor during the last reunion show,  
and vocalist Truitt Cunningham strained to hear from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say you want some rock 'n' roll?'' he asked in disbelief,  
the smiling portrait of Wills gazing down upon him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Cunningham chuckled dryly, ``I don't think so.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Reports Economy at Strong Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- U.S. manufacturers are bouncing back from a slump  
caused by economic troubles abroad, the Federal Reserve said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most districts report recent improvement in the manufacturing  
sector,'' the nation's central bank said in its latest survey of 
regional economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories benefited as American consumers, feeling secure about  
their jobs, spent more than they did last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong  
levels and to expand at a moderate pace,'' the Fed said in its 
``beige book'' report, named for the color of its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The compilation of anecdotal information is collected by the  
Fed's 12 regional branches for the benefit of Fed policy-makers, 
who are scheduled to meet next on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	With consumer demand so strong, analysts have been watching for  
signs of inflation that might compel the Fed to raise interest 
rates. However, the regional branches' reports on conditions across 
the country through April 26 indicated that prices generally remain 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Improvement in manufacturing was broad-based, the Fed said --  
from increased demand for medical and automotive equipment reported 
by the Boston bank, to stable orders for computers and 
telecommunications equipment noted in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	One persistent weak spot was identified by the Atlanta bank --  
apparel production and orders remain low because of ``fierce 
foreign competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe into  
recession has severely cut into American exports and also exposed 
U.S. manufacturers to increased competition from lower-priced 
foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has been performing well,  
manufacturers have been forced to cut more than 300,000 jobs in the 
past year as the U.S. trade deficit hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	However, brisk spending by American consumers -- fueled by  
overall low unemployment and stock market gains -- has cushioned the 
blow and kept the U.S. economy growing at a robust 4.5 percent 
annual rate during the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said  
orders to U.S. factories rose 2.0 percent in March to a seasonally 
adjusted $350 billion, following a 1.8 percent drop in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the February setback, orders during the first three  
months of 1999 were 3.6 percent higher than in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does look as if the effect of the global economic shock,  
which was felt in manufacturing, ... seems to be wearing away,'' 
said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors rallied once the Fed's report was released  
Wednesday afternoon, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 69 
points to close at 10,955, after dragging it down by more than 100 
points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment is so low that many parts of the country are  
experiencing labor shortages, the Fed said. But it said there were 
no reports of significant pickup in wage increases, which can be an 
early warning sign that inflationary pressure is building. Instead, 
some companies are improving their benefits and offering hiring and 
retention bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident consumers are spending on luxury items, notably cars.  
Home sales and residential construction also remain strong. 
Commercial building projects are continuing at a good clip too, 
although some areas, including Atlanta, reported slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said rising prices for building materials, oil and gas  
were exceptions to low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, farmers are still being hurt by low international  
commodity prices, the Chicago bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The March increase in factory orders was led by a 2.9 percent  
jump in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to 
last three or more years. That followed a 3.9 percent drop in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders were up for transportation equipment, including motor  
vehicles and parts, industrial equipment and machinery, electronic 
and other electrical equipment, and primary metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for nondurable goods also rose in March, by 0.8 percent,  
building on a 1.1 percent February rise. Petroleum and coal 
products, food, tobacco and chemical orders were all up, but orders 
for textiles and paper products fell.

<HEADLINE> Weather News Hurts Grains, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid fears beneficial growing weather will lead to 
increases in already plentiful U.S. inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude and its products edged higher, while  
palladium bounced off its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans retreated as rainfall that moved in Midwest  
growing regions proved unexpectedly light and scattered, reigniting 
worries that fieldwork will proceed at a normal pace and lead to 
bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading had ended, the National Weather Service reinforced  
European weather models that predicted Midwestern temperatures will 
be above-normal over the next week, with only light rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans in a particular are under heavy pressure from  
expectations for another record crop, which would come at a time 
when inventories remain high because of weaker export demand and 
heavy competition from competing Brazilian crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by the decline in the corn and  
soybean markets. Traders sought direction after early tours of 
winter wheat growing regions found variable yields, with crops 
doing better in some areas and worse than thought in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 cent to $2.62 a bushel; July corn  
fell 1 cent to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; July oats were unchanged at $1.18 3/4 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.84 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products finished higher on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after a rocky session in which investors 
worried about current and future supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices originally retreated as weekly inventory statistics from  
the American Petroleum Institute released after the close of 
trading Tuesday indicated that refiners sharply increased 
production of unleaded gasoline just as U.S. demand eased. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped relieve concerns that supplies may be tight through  
the peak warm-weather U.S. driving season and caused sharp declines 
in futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices later bounced higher on news of the shutdown of a  
gas-making unit at Lyondell-Citgo Refining Co.'s refinery near 
Houston. The unit refinery handles 265,000 barrels of crude a day. 
Market participants said the shutdown could last for two weeks, 
although the company refused to provide details of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude rose 6 cents to $18.98 a barrel; June heating oil  
rose .28 cent to 45.79 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline rose 
.06 cent to 56.25 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York after the Philippines opened bids to buy sugar on the 
world market,a move that reinforced ideas demand is on the rise 
after a long glut. 
</P>
<P>
	That country's move to buy 300,000 metric tons of raw sugar  
follows recent buying from Iran and others and provides relief to a 
market that has been pressured for weeks by concerns producers will 
bring in a second consecutive bumper world harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	July sugar rose 0.21 cent to 4.82 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Automakers Do Well in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The auto industry's U.S. sales last month  
improved 4 percent over the year-ago performance, but it was 
foreign automakers who has the most to brag about. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler arm of  
DaimlerChrysler AG managed only a 1 percent improvement over April 
1998. Asian automakers together posted a 13 percent gain, while 
European automakers were up 15 percent -- their 19th consecutive 
month of double-digit improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was virtually alone among the major automakers in reporting a  
sales decline for April. Purchases of its cars and light trucks 
were off 4 percent compared with a robust year-ago performance. 
GM's said Tuesday that its car sales declined nearly 5 percent 
while sales of its light trucks were down 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Only DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz unit also posted a decline.  
Its sales were down 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the year-to-year decline, GM managed to edge its U.S.  
market share up just over the 30 percent barrier for the first time 
in seven months -- to 30.4 percent from 29.5 percent in March. For 
the year through April, GM's share stood at 29.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's fighting to get back above 30 percent for all of  
1999 because its North American production empire is geared to 
operate profitably at that level. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Roberts, GM's North American sales chief, said the  
year-to-year sales comparison was skewed by GM's successful 
``loyalty coupon'' discount campaign that boosted sales in April 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It meant that this past April we were playing catch-up,''  
Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year GM played down the coupons' effect, saying they were  
used in only 2.5 percent of its April retail sales. Ford and the 
then-Chrysler Corp. quickly matched GM's discounts and generated 
sales gains a year ago and again last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's biggest problem is a product portfolio that remains far  
heavier in cars than trucks as the U.S. market continues its 
decade-long shift toward pickups, SUVs and minivans. Trucks also 
are far more profitable than cars, which are selling at the levels 
they are only because of deep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a margin standpoint it's obvious: GM continues to lag  
DaimlerChrysler and Ford in profitability,'' said analyst Richard 
Hilgert of Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``It also hampers their ability to gain 
market share while DaimlerChrysler and Ford are able to manufacture 
more trucks as a percentage of their output.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts told reporters he was optimistic about GM's progress. He  
noted that the redesigned version of GM's best-selling vehicle, its 
full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup, remained in high demand and was 
putting the company on pace for a record-setting year in truck 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're building momentum,'' he said. ``We are putting more  
capacity into place. Our sales lead over our domestic competition 
is the biggest it's been since before the work stoppage last year, 
which had a crippling effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's market share plummeted last summer when the United Auto  
Workers virtually shut down its North American production with two 
parts plant strikes. For months afterward, the automaker cited the 
strikes' effect on its inventories for its lagging market share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take a position from here forward of no  
excuses,'' Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> Watercolor Painter Butler Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKEWELL, England (AP) -- Artist George Butler, the oldest living  
member of Britain's prestigious Royal Watercolor Society, has died 
at age 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, whose delicate landscapes and studies of ballet dancers  
have been exhibited throughout Britain and France, died April 19 in 
the northeast English town of Bakewell where he lived, news reports 
said. Cause of death was not given. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Sheffield, Butler attended the Sheffield College of Art  
and the Central School of Art in London. He worked for an 
advertising agency for many years while painting and exhibiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler's first one-man show was at the Redfern Gallery in 1927.  
He would later have shows in Paris and Aix-en-Provence, France, and 
Chatsworth, England. He also exhibited regularly at London's Royal 
Academy, the New English Art Club, the Royal Society of British 
Artists and in French galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	His subjects were typically young girls, often ballet dancers,  
or delicate landscapes of Britain or France. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler was elected to the Royal Watercolor Society as an  
associate member in 1956 and as a full member the following year. 
He was also active in the Artists' General Benevolent Society, 
serving as its vice president in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Kcenia Kotliarevskaya, died in 1992. He is survived by  
a son and a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral details were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern Player Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern running back Dennis Lundy was  
sentenced to one month in prison and placed on probation for two 
years Wednesday for lying to a federal grand jury investigating 
campus gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very, very sorry for what I did,'' Lundy said. ``Not only  
did I hurt my mother and my family, but my team suffered as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy, 26, admitted that he lied in his initial appearance  
before a federal grand jury investigating gambling by Northwestern 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with evidence of his lies, Lundy admitted that he had  
not only gambled on games against Notre Dame and Ohio State but 
deliberately fumbled the ball on the 1-yard line in a 1994 game 
against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that the fumble was designed to win a $400 bet by  
making sure that the Wildcats wouldn't cover the point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer John Murphy told U.S. District Judge David Coar  
that Lundy's reason for lying was understandable enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shame that drove him to tell these falsehoods,'' Murphy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that since pleading guilty, Lundy had spoken at a number  
of schools under an NCAA program on the dangers of gambling by 
student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that Lundy has received strong support from his  
employer and that he and his fiancee have a child on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This speaks to the kind of person he is,'' Murphy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coar set a Sept. 1 surrender date so that Lundy can be on hand  
for the birth of his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy was accompanied in the courtroom by his mother, who  
watched solemnly as the judge imposed the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	After court, Lundy and his mother eluded reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	In an NCAA-sponsored appearance in February, Lundy told Kentucky  
athletes that his deliberate fumble was induced by gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that I had a couple of hundred dollars on the game,''  
Lundy said. ``Gambling itself -- that overrode. I was not thinking 
logically at the time.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Deride New Insurance Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to shift the health care debate, Aetna  
Inc. plans to offer a set of bare-bones insurance policies aimed at 
workers who have no insurance at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates complained that the new plans would leave  
anyone with a serious illness a stack of bills, but Aetna officials 
said some coverage is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a modest first step, but it's something,'' said Aetna  
President and CEO Richard L. Huber. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, announced Wednesday, comes as the insurance and  
business communities try to shift attention away from popular 
proposals that seek to protect those with insurance from 
cost-cutting strategies sometimes employed by health maintenance 
organizations and other managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Their rallying cry has been the uninsured as they argue new  
regulations will drive up the cost of insurance and force employers 
to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said its basic coverage is meant to draw attention to the  
larger problem: 43 million Americans who are uninsured, most of 
whom live in working families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far less vital to continue to add additional benefits for  
those who already have coverage than providing access to basic 
coverage for the uninsured,'' said Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna also said it would donate $100,000 to put on a national  
conference and facilitate a dialogue between the government and 
private sector about the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is considered a supplementary plan, meaning  
customers are reimbursed directly after they go to the doctor or 
the hospital. By labeling it a supplement, Aetna can avoid state 
mandates for minimum benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has approval to sell these plans in three  
states -- Connecticut, Maine and Texas -- and intends to begin this 
summer. It has applications pending in 25 other states. It will 
sell to companies with at least two employees, but not directly to 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans are much less expensive than most on the market, with  
monthly premiums ranging from $46 to $91 for an individual and $156 
to $275 for a family. As with all insurance, an employer could pick 
up part of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But these plans provide much less than typical insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, a patient would get $50 toward a doctor's visit no  
matter how much the doctor charged. But since many visits cost 
considerably more than $50, the patient would have to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for a hospital stay. The middle plan would pay  
$750 a day for the first three days, $350 a day for the next seven 
days and $100 a day for the rest of the stay. That's not likely to 
cover most hospital bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates said the plans won't do consumers much good  
if they get sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what it offers, that's not very cheap,'' said Pat Schoeni  
of the National Coalition on Health Care, which released its own 
report Wednesday predicting that the number of uninsured Americans 
will continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Families USA, a consumer group that focuses on health, said  
these policies were offered in the early 1990s and were not popular 
because the benefits were so minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pollack, the group's executive director, said these plans  
might tempt some businesses to cut back on more generous coverage 
offered now. 
</P>
<P>
	``These plans provide insurance that doesn't insure,'' he said.  
``They don't cover you when you are sick and they leave you with 
massive bills to pay.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Honored at Music Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Garth Brooks won artist of the  
decade and entertainer of the year but it was country sweetheart 
Faith Hill who stole the Academy of Country Music Awards show with 
four trophies Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I would ever win this award,'' Miss Hill said  
in tears after winning the top female singer honor. Husband Tim 
McGraw, top male singer of the year, watched adoringly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kiss'' won her single of the year and the video trophy,  
and she shared the vocal event of the year award with McGraw for 
the duet ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is the best-selling male singer in music history. Marty  
Robbins, Loretta Lynn and Alabama won in previous decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Leno presented the trophy, given for the recording star who  
best represented the image of country music through appearances and 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who has sold more than 95 million albums, said he wasn't  
deserving of the recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me there's two artists in our industry that I think we  
have very much taken for granted -- I don't mean to offend anybody, 
I'm just telling you like it is,'' Brooks told the audience, saying 
that he wanted to cut the plaque in half. 
</P>
<P>
	``George (Strait) isn't here for one half,'' he continued. ``The  
other half I think we need to give to an artist that has given 
everything an artist can give to country music, and I don't think 
been thanked near enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks left the stage to hand the award to Reba McEntire, but to  
his surprise she wasn't in her seat. The gesture drew wild cheers 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based Dixie Chicks, sisters Martie Siedel and Emily  
Erwin and friend Natalie Maines, won album of the year for ``Wide 
Open Spaces'' as well as top group and best new group. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Wariner's oh-so-sad ``Holes in the Floor of Heaven'' was  
top song and Miss Hill's upbeat ``This Kiss'' was best single. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first one!'' said the jubilant Wariner, who shared  
the songwriting honor with fellow composer Billy Kirsch. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer Jo Dee Messina, produced by McGraw, won the new female  
vocalist award. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Mark Wills, known for his ballad ``Wish You Were  
Here,'' was the new male vocalist winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it OK to cry now?'' Wills asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain was presented the Recording Industry Association of  
America's first diamond award for recognition of 10 million in 
album sales. It was a double-diamond for the Canadian sensation, 
who sold more than 10 million copies each of ``The Woman in Me'' 
and ``Come on Over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous performances were jammed into the show produced by Dick  
Clark, who boasted a host-less three-hour ceremony would guarantee 
a fast-pace. 
</P>
<P>
	A special Pioneer Award was presented to Glen Campbell, who  
couldn't believe it was already time in his career for such an 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how short a period it seems like -- 32 years --  
to 1967, and now I'm up here getting the Pioneer Award. Then I was 
getting the go get 'em award, you know. Time flies when you're 
having a big time,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners were selected by the 3,000 members of the Academy of  
Country Music.

<HEADLINE> Commission Urged To Block Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Representatives for Japan, Russia and Brazil  
are pleading with an independent government agency to oppose 
punitive tariffs under consideration by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	During a rare public appearance, the representatives argued that  
factors beyond their countries' control were responsible for last 
year's surge in steel imports to the United States, an increase 
blamed for thousands of U.S. layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Krueger, a Stanford University economics professor who  
testified on behalf of the foreign countries, said the financial 
crisis abroad has shown signs of easing. That crisis contributed to 
the surge in imports by lowering demand for the product there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resumption of more normal conditions in Asia, the rest of  
the world and the U.S. means that conditions are very different 
now, and it cannot be concluded there is a threat to American steel 
producers based on what happened then,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission, a fact-finding body  
that is independent from the administration, is considering whether 
the import surge has hurt or threatens to injure the domestic 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	That finding is a major factor in determining whether the  
administration will impose steel tariffs against Japan, Russia and 
Brazil. Rulings are due this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruled last week that Japan has illegally  
dumped a core steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel, in U.S. 
markets at prices below production costs or home-market prices. The 
department earlier found evidence of dumping by Russia and Brazil 
and expect final rulings this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia may be able to avoid tariffs if that country finalizes an  
agreement with the United States to voluntarily curb shipments. 
Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem 
Steel, reiterated his opposition to the deal and threatened to 
challenge the agreement in federal court and seek legislative 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not stop the imports and is not in the public  
interest,'' Barnette told the trade commission. ``We will oppose it 
with all the resources we have available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing that dwelled as much on accounting mechanics as on  
the essence of trade policy, domestic producers and leaders of 
their workers' union tried to convince the commissioners that the 
industry is hurting despite strong demand for steel products. 
</P>
<P>
	``The domestic steel industry remains on the verge of a  
catastrophe,'' said George Becker, president of the United 
Steelworkers of America. ``Steelworkers are hurting wherever 
hot-rolled steel is made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the foreign countries said other factors -- and  
not dumping -- were responsible for the surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The domestic industry ... flat out simply did not have the  
capacity to meet increased demand,'' lawyer William Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration's top trade officials said  
at a separate forum that President Clinton's efforts to combat 
unfair steel shipments from Japan and other countries are showing 
dramatic results and will take the steam out of a congressional 
drive to limit steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the House voted 289-141 for legislation that would  
impose global quotas on steel shipments into the United States. The 
proposal is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky repeated the  
administration's view that the quota bill is clearly in violation 
of global trade rules administered by the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be a quota bill ultimately presented  
to the president,'' Barshefsky told the Society of American 
Business Writers and Editors. ``I think the president's program has 
been working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that assessment was disputed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., who said at the commission hearing that he believed the 
Senate was ``very close to being able to do what the House did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, a key supporter of restricting foreign steel, said  
action could come in ``another week or so.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Mull $4.3 Bil. in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of senators, troubled by the crisis in  
farm country, is considering adding $4.3 billion in emergency aid 
for farmers to a supplemental package already moving through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said after the hour-long meeting that while there is  
consensus that action is needed to deal with the low prices 
plaguing the farm economy, there are concerns about pushing 
additional money onto a supplemental bill that has already been 
delayed for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has got to be done this year,'' said Sen. Chuck  
Grassley, R-Iowa, one of 14 senators who met privately for more 
than an hour Wednesday. ``I think there is a consensus on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is timing and how much,'' said Sen. Larry Craig,  
R-Idaho. ``The feeling is this could be bad timing unless this is 
the only train leaving the station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., ``This may be the only bite at  
the apple. There may only be one supplemental this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, if the group is successful, would be included with  
$152 million for farm loans already moving through Congress. That 
money is attached to an overall supplemental package, which also 
has money for Central America disaster victims. Lawmakers have also 
indicated they will add about $9 billion for the confrontation in 
Kosovo to the package. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the money would come out of this year's $111 billion  
surplus, which many lawmakers have pushed to use for Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal being considered for farmers has $1.5 billion to  
make up for a shortfall in last year's disaster package and $2.8 
billion in additional market transition payments to compensate for 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the quickest way of getting funds out there,'' Sen. Tom  
Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the market transition payments. Farmers 
already get the payments each year as part of the 1996 farm law. 
The money being discussed by senators would amount to about a 50 
percent increase in the annual payment given to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's emergency package also included $2.8 billion in  
market transition payments as well as $2.3 billion in disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The market payments were dispersed not long after the bill was  
passed last fall, but Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has 
complained of a burdensome process required to distribute the 
disaster payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the problems, the disaster payments are not expected  
to be delivered to farmers until June. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the delay problem, lawmakers said Wednesday they were  
recently told by USDA that an additional $1.5 billion is needed to 
accommodate the large numbers of eligible farmers who signed up for 
disaster aid. Sign-up was only completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people are not going to get what they thought they were  
going to get because there's not sufficient money,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental process has already been contentious and it is  
unclear whether House budgeters would be receptive to the Senate 
idea. The farm loan money has been on hold since March as lawmakers 
fought over offsets. Glickman has said that many state farm offices 
are already out of money to authorize loans for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Don't Bury the Penguins Just Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins aren't extinct yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were supposed to be gone by now, not just from the  
NHL playoffs but possibly the league itself, a bankrupt franchise 
with a wealth of scorers but no money to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins defied the odds -- and their creditors -- with a  
remarkable first-round upset of the New Jersey Devils achieved 
mostly by their resolve to win amid the organization's own 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at least until their conference semifinal series begins  
Friday in Toronto, the Penguins can forget their off-ice troubles 
and the memories of past playoff failures and enjoy the biggest 
upset in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	And they can celebrate life. After all, the NHL can't fold a  
franchise while it still is playing, can it? 
</P>
<P>
	``I had great moments with Ronnie (Francis) and Mario (Lemieux),  
but this is my biggest moment as a player,'' said Jaromir Jagr, who 
succeeded the two as captain and thrived in the role. ``People will 
judge you by how you do as a captain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone in the NHL questioned Jagr's leadership ability and  
courage -- and many did -- they no longer can after he got off the 
trainer's table to lead the Penguins to victories in Games 6 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one day after he could barely skate because of a painful  
groin injury that kept him out of four games, Jagr scored the tying 
and winning goals in the Penguins' win-or-be-gone 3-2 victory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in pain again Tuesday, but set up the final two goals as  
the Penguins won 4-2 to advance into the second round of the 
playoffs for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins became the fourth No. 8 seed to oust a No. 1 seed  
since the NHL adopted its current playoff format in 1994. They also 
will be underdogs in the next round against Toronto, but not as 
overwhelmingly so as in the Jersey series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a high-scoring series,'' the  
Penguins' Matthew Barnaby said. ``It's going to be a lot of 
up-and-down hockey. I don't think there will be that much 
hitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a scenario, though not likely -- has there ever been an NHL  
playoff series without much hitting? -- might favor the Penguins' 
stable of scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as many teams do, the Devils often seemed to forget that  
Jagr isn't the Penguins' only threat. Martin Straka had six goals 
in the series, the most of any NHL player in the first round, and 
Alexei Kovalev had 10 points despite missing the first game with an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins wouldn't be here without Jagr, and they know  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir wouldn't let us lose,'' Kovalev said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is credited as the man who saved hockey in Pittsburgh,  
and he is trying to do so again by extracting the franchise from 
bankruptcy proceedings. But give Jagr a save, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I didn't think we could win the series without him, and  
that was pretty prophetic,'' said coach Kevin Constantine, who was 
holed up Wednesday pouring over video of the Maple Leafs. ``We were 
playing good (without Jagr) but not that good. We won two games 
before he returned, and that's a testimony to the other players. 
But we were two minutes away from elimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr tied Game 6 by scoring with just 2:12 left -- not just in  
the game, but maybe in the Penguins' very existence -- and then won 
it in overtime. The breathless comeback clearly swung the momentum 
the Penguins' way, and the Devils subsequently were a desperate, 
unconfident team in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But no desperate than the Penguins. Even as the playoffs  
continue, the NHL is filing documents in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
outlining plans for the dissolution of the franchise should 
Lemieux's reorganization plan fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants the situation resolved by May 31, when the  
Penguins might still be playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is awful special, based on some of the adversity our team  
went through,'' Constantine said. ``We're still hanging in there.''

<HEADLINE> Networks Raise Hourly Ad Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leave it to the networks to adopt this pricing  
policy: The less you like their wares, the more you get to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Their audience continues to erode. They failed this season --  
their fourth in a row -- to launch a single breakout hit. Even their 
most popular shows are hitting new heights for rating slumps. 
(Item: Last Thursday's ``Must-See'' NBC lineup landed the puniest 
first-run scores among 18-to-49 viewers in five years.) 
</P>
<P>
	What have the networks done in response? They upped the ``ticket  
price'': the hourly ad count. 
</P>
<P>
	An average hour of prime-time TV last November contained 15  
minutes, 44 seconds of advertising, according to a recent study. 
That was a leap of 25 seconds over the year before, and the highest 
level since trade groups began gauging it a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For every 44 minutes of what you presumably turn on your TV to  
see -- say, Ranger Walker taking someone apart or Dr. Mark Greene 
putting someone back together -- you are afflicted with roughly 16 
minutes of messages about products that glide on without clumping, 
that leave you behind it, if you're not in it, or that won't fill 
you up and never let you down. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, TV fills you up, often lets you down and expects you  
to pay for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	With April 15th fresh on your mind, you might think of TV ads as  
another form of tax, one you pay with your time and attention. It's 
a steadily increasing tax on programs that you may not even like 
and certainly have no vote on. (Has your family ever been among 
those 5,000 Nielsen families? Have you ever known one that was?) 
This is taxation without representation! 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there's a loophole for the viewer who applies it:  
Tape your favorite shows and fast-forward through the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, more than 95 percent of all prime-time viewing is  
directly off the air ... with commercials and other nonprogram 
clutter intact. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's another, more cutting-edge answer: the brand-new  
ReplayTV (produced by Replay Networks Inc.) and TiVo (made by a 
company of the same name) are set-top boxes that store programs on 
an internal hard disk for later viewing. Unlike VCRs, these gadgets 
let you pause, then resume, an off-the-air program -- or leapfrog 
through each of its commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Just think: A life without commercial clutter would mean a 25  
percent saving of your TV-viewing time. Which gives you the time to 
watch that much more TV! 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe you don't like fudging on your 1040 form, but TV is a  
system you can beat at no risk. Unless you happen to be in a 
Nielsen family, the eyeballs you withhold from a commercial will 
never be missed! 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, this is not a total solution to the commercial glut.  
Nor is it a permanent one. Already, networks are exploring ways to 
permeate their programs with ads you can't avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, ABC promoted an upcoming show with a ``crawl''  
along the bottom of the screen simulating a news bulletin: ``ABC 
STORM ALERT: Stephen King's 'Storm of the Century' is coming this 
Sunday... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Disney-owned ``Sports Night,'' which airs on  
Disney-owned ABC, has woven into its storyline plugs for other 
Disney enterprises, such as when a ``Sports Night'' character 
reluctantly attended Disney's Broadway musical ``The Lion King'' 
and then raved about it to her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	During sportscasts, ``virtual billboards'' are inserted that  
only the TV audience can see. And not long ago, an episode of UPN's 
``Seven Days'' tested video voodoo that allows advertisers to have 
their products digitally added to a scene in post-production. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't forget your basic on-air peddling.  
</P>
<P>
	Tonight at 11 p.m. EDT, ``Law &AMP; Order'' star Jerry Orbach will  
appear on Home Shopping Network hawking merchandise that 
commemorates the NBC series' 200th episode (airing the hour 
before). You want a set of handcuffs used on the show or a ``Law &AMP; 
Order'' director's chair? Order-takers will be standing by. 
</P>
<P>
	Can it be very long before the shop-at-home function fully  
merges with each program? You like that lipstick Monica Lewinsky is 
wearing on her Barbara Walters interview? Why wait until tomorrow, 
when the stores might be sold out? What if you could 
point-and-click on ABC's Web site to order ``Glaze'' from Club 
Monaco before Barbara says good night! 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt that's the future. But, right now, while you can still  
distinguish TV shows from advertising clutter, shouldn't you try to 
dodge it? You won't always have the chance. In the long run, you 
know, there are only three sure things: death, taxes and TV 
commercials.

<HEADLINE> Launch Failures Have Cost $3.5B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two launch explosions. Three  
satellites stuck in useless orbits. Another satellite vaporized in 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has had six U.S. rocket failures in less than  
nine months with losses totaling $3.5 billion, mostly at taxpayer 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the worst string of botched U.S. rocket launches since the  
mid-1980s; space shuttle Challenger was among the casualties back 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	The question being asked Wednesday just hours after the latest  
mishap was: What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem, I think, is that this is still hard. We have not  
learned how to make the launch systems that we have anywhere near 
the reliability of aircraft, for example,'' said John Logsdon, 
director of George Washington University's space policy institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so as long as we use these systems, there are going to be  
failures. Now when they all come in a row, it's really kind of 
nasty. But statistically, I think that's as likely as any other 
outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six rockets were carrying three military satellites, two  
commercial communication satellites, and a privately owned 
satellite capable of taking detailed, military-quality photographs 
of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the rockets were launched by the Air Force; three by  
aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the safety implications for NASA's space shuttle program,  
the shuttle itself, at least, has no parts in common with the 
errant rockets. But the same two contractors that built them -- 
Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. -- also work on the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underneath, there may be some systemic problems,'' Logsdon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the shuttle program has been affected by the launch  
fiascos. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is grounded, and its telescope-delivery mission in July  
is on hold, until the Air Force figures out why an upper-stage 
motor on a Titan IV rocket failed during a satellite launch last 
month. The same kind of motor will be used to propel NASA's $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's newest rocket, the Delta III, was the latest to flop.  
</P>
<P>
	After a month of delays, including a countdown that went all the  
way down to zero without an engine ignition, the Delta III blasted 
off Tuesday night. Everything seemed to go well until 22 minutes 
into the flight, when the upper stage that's needed to boost the 
satellite into a higher orbit either did not fire for the second 
time or did not fire long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of circling Earth thousands of miles high, the  
communication satellite was left in a useless, lopsided orbit 98 
miles by about 860 miles. The chances of saving the satellite were 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second botched flight in a row for the Delta III,  
which was intended to grab more of the launch market for Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight in August ended in a fireball 71 seconds  
after liftoff because of a poor computer program. The satellite was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in August, an Air Force Titan IV rocket carrying a spy  
satellite blew up less than a minute into flight. An Air Force 
investigation uncovered faulty wiring as well as questionable 
quality control by Lockheed Martin. All Titan models were grounded 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan IV -- the Pentagon's most powerful rocket and the only  
one able to lift hefty military payloads -- was back in action April 
9. But the missile-warning satellite it was carrying ended up in a 
useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Titan IV lifted off last Friday, but that military  
communication satellite also ended up in an orbit thousands of 
miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who is in charge of the  
Cape Canaveral Air Station, said there appears to be no 
similarities among the three failed Titan IV missions, which cost 
about $1 billion each. Nonetheless, Titan launches are on hold, as 
are Deltas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of all this, Lockheed Martin's relatively new  
Athena II rocket failed following its launch from California last 
week. A protective shroud did not separate from the Earth-imaging 
satellite aboard and dragged it back down through the atmosphere, 
where it burned up. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale Schluter, a Boeing vice president, said one explanation for  
recent launch failures may be that so many more rockets are flying. 
Boeing averaged six rocket launches a year from 1993 to 1998, and 
expects to triple that from 1998 to 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing not only an increase in rates, but we're also  
seeing new products being brought to market, and I think when you 
put all that together, that has a bearing on the performance that 
we're seeing right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Wants Web-Hookup Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telecommunications regulator  
today called for a nearly $1 billion increase in spending for a 
program that provides schools and libraries cheap hookups to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Bill Kennard of the Federal Communications Commission  
wants the program -- overseen by the FCC -- to get the maximum 
authorized: $2.25 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the politically touchy program must be approved by  
three of the FCC's five commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Susan Ness said she supports funding to the  
maximum. Commissioner Gloria Tristani, a big supporter of the 
program, wasn't immediately available for comment but lobbyists say 
she could be Kennard's third vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The program needs to have money assured for its second fiscal  
year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC scaled back the program's budget after  
consumer groups and some lawmakers called for cuts or halts in 
funding, fearing it would lead to higher phone bills. The Internet 
program is paid for by fees the FCC imposes on telecommunications 
companies, which pass them on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the FCC authorized $1.93 billion for the program's  
first 18 months. That translates into nearly $1.3 billion for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard and Ness said consumers' phone bills wouldn't go up  
because fees to pay for the increased Internet access would be 
offset by some $1 billion worth of reductions in other telephone 
fees, which get passed along to consumers in their long-distance 
bills. Those reductions are expected to come July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no earthly reason why funding at the cap should  
result in any adverse impact on consumers,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups believe that long-distance customers who  
make few calls could be hit with an increase because a proportional 
amount of the reduction in the other phone fees may not be passed 
along to them. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC spokeswoman Joy Howell said the commission is studying the  
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC didn't know how much each telephone customer would be  
assessed to cover the $2.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we follow this course, we will be able to wire 528,000  
public school classrooms to the Internet,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand from schools and libraries for the second budget  
cycle is estimated to total $2.435 billion, according to the 
Universal Service Administrative Company's Schools and Libraries 
Division, which federal regulators designated to hand out the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The division said it has received more than 32,000 applications  
for money in the second cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first cycle, the division has made commitments totaling  
$1.66 billion to 25,785 applicants. Schools and libraries that 
received subsidies say it has been an important tool for students 
to obtain information. 
</P>
<P>
	The program provides eligible schools and libraries with  
discounts that range from 20 percent to 90 percent off the costs of 
various equipment and services they need to connect to the 
Internet, depending on the recipients' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the administration supported the program's creation  
in a 1996 law. But afterward, lawmakers and the administration 
clashed over how the FCC would pay for it.

<HEADLINE> Business Owners Deal With Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWEST CITY, Okla. (AP) -- A handmade sign lay propped against  
the mountain of twisted metal, soggy insulation and crumbled 
sheetrock that once was a Super Surplus store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearance Sale.''  
</P>
<P>
	It was an appropriate message in a two-block area leveled by a  
monster tornado Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Silsby, an owner of the store, used his fingers to count  
off the 15 or so family-owned businesses that once lined the 
heavily traveled street. 
</P>
<P>
	An automotive repair business, a tire store, a lawn mower shop.  
They all looked the same -- nothing but rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Silsby doesn't believe any lives were lost in the wreckage, just  
livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was the shock of, 'I've lost everything,' '' he said  
Wednesday. ``Now it doesn't matter. We can replace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Jim Anderson, putting back the pieces will be a little more  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did he lose his used motorcycle shop, the same tornado  
that passed through this area of Midwest City stopped first in 
Moore to suck up his house and hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it hasn't sunk in yet,'' he said. ``Yesterday,  
I woke up and said it has to be a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for dozens of business owners devastated by Monday's storms,  
the nightmare is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	They must negotiate with insurance companies, hope for a fair  
and quick settlement, and eventually -- if they can manage it -- get 
back to business. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of insurance adjusters have converged in central Oklahoma  
to assess the damage to homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Morris said he hopes to work out a speedy insurance  
settlement so he can start rebuilding his engine repair business. 
</P>
<P>
	But first he must figure out a way to untwist the giant steel  
frames that were used to haul hoist vehicles weighing up to 9,000 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``See those big blue posts?'' Anderson said. ``The tornado just  
picked them up and twisted them around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two blocks away at Second Hand Sports, owner John Coles boarded  
up huge panels of broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	His business is one of the few in the area still standing. And  
despite the blown-out windows, many of the basketballs, exercise 
benches and weightlifting gloves still neatly line the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who had no insurance to cover the contents of his  
business, says he lost about $10,000 in merchandise. And he doesn't 
know if his landlord will repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad I have another job,'' said Coles, who works as  
an aircraft mechanic at the nearby Tinker Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Just south of the strip of businesses are four motels that front  
Interstate 40. Three were demolished in Monday's storm. The power 
remained off at the fourth, La Quinta Inn. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of Comfort Inn said he was too upset to talk about his  
loss. The 150-room hotel is missing its roof and the walls resemble 
a Jenga game ready to topple. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lewter, president of the Oklahoma City Hotel and Motel  
Association, estimated the loss of the three hotels at $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The total loss in Oklahoma likely will exceed $225 million, said  
Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern Insurance Information 
Service. He said the tornado could end up being one of the 
costliest in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	In Midwest City, about 20 businesses received heavy damage, said  
Stan Greil, president of the city's chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys said 16 business were  
destroyed in his city and nine received major damage. At least 
eight businesses were destroyed in Choctaw when the storm hit the 
city's business district. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial help is available for businesses located within the  
counties designated as federal disaster areas. They are eligible 
for low-interest and long-term Small Business Administration loans 
and can file an amended federal tax extension deduct their property 
losses.

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Favored in Las Vegas Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- After spending decades keeping mobsters such as  
Meyer Lansky and Tony ``the Ant'' Spilotro out of prison, lawyer 
Oscar Goodman made a dramatic opening statement in the political 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman came within 277 votes Tuesday of winning the mayor's job  
outright against eight other candidates, establishing himself as 
the solid favorite in next month's runoff against longtime 
politician Arnie Adamsen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, both Goodman and Adamsen referred to New York  
Yankees legends in assessing their chances in the final election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the luckiest man alive,'' Goodman said, paraphrasing Lou  
Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ain't over till it's over,'' Adamsen said, quoting Yogi  
Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	It almost was over Tuesday night, when Goodman got 24,267 votes,  
or 49.4 percent, just short of the 50 percent plus one vote needed 
to win the job without a runoff. Adamsen was second with 14,395 
votes, or 29.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're right at the brink,'' Goodman said. ``It's just another  
month before we get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, 59, played himself in the movie ``Casino'' and was  
known for decades as the mouthpiece for the mob because of his 
defense of people like Spilotro, who according to legend put a 
rival's head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman transformed himself into a populist favorite in his  
first try for political office. He said he was a defender of the 
oppressed and the only candidate who would impose fees on 
developers to help solve the city's traffic and air pollution woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the mayor has only one of five votes on the City Council  
and doesn't represent the Las Vegas Strip and its glittering 
megaresorts, Goodman promised to turn the job from one of cutting 
ribbons and settling neighborhood disputes into a position yielding 
real clout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of ideas and I've never been hesitant to express  
myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast, Adamsen is a 12-year city councilman who  
bills himself as ``Mr. Crossing Guard, Mr. Public Safety'' and 
touts his ability to work within the system to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken hits for three weeks and I'm still standing,''  
Adamsen said. ``We're wiping the slate clean now. I'll debate him 
any time, any place and on any issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen said the city had not yet returned a verdict in favor of  
Goodman. ``Fifty percent of the jury wasn't convinced,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Attacks Willey's Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Kathleen Willey testified Wednesday she  
felt threatened when one of President Clinton's lawyers suggested 
she assert her Fifth Amendment rights rather than answer questions 
about an alleged sexual advance by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like that was a threat coming from the president,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey is the star witness against her former friend, Julie  
Hiatt Steele, who is charged with lying to investigators in 
testimony last year that contradicted Mrs. Willey's. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys hammered at Mrs. Willey's credibility, asking  
why she now remembers the alleged encounter with Clinton and her 
conversations with Ms. Steele in much more detail than she did the 
first time she told the story under oath -- during her January 1998 
deposition for the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain her memory lapses, Mrs. Willey said the Fifth  
Amendment reference -- which she took as a warning she was at risk 
of incriminating herself -- and other ``badgering'' by Clinton 
lawyer Robert Bennett affected her state of mind during the 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the courthouse, Bennett called her testimony ``an  
absolutely bald-faced lie.'' He said he met with Mrs. Willey in the 
presence of her lawyer but never suggested that she assert her 
Fifth Amendment rights nor threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied under oath that he made a sexual advance  
toward Mrs. Willey. White House spokesman Jim Kennedy had no 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey also testified that she had been frightened by a  
threatening encounter, two days before the deposition, with a 
stranger who mentioned her missing cat and slashed car tires. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony crucial to the prosecutors' case against Ms.  
Steele, Mrs. Willey described Clinton grabbing and kissing her on 
Nov. 29, 1993, during a meeting in the White House, and she said 
that she had talked with her former friend about it that day and 
``many, many times'' since. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Ms. Steele ``wanted to be very much into this story''  
and ``wanted to make money off of it,'' even suggesting they sell 
Mrs. Willey's story to a tabloid newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is charged with lying under oath to Kenneth Starr's  
investigators. She told FBI agents and two grand juries that she 
never heard Mrs. Willey's allegation against the president until 
1997, when, she said, Mrs. Willey asked her to lie to corroborate 
her story to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The third day of the trial focused on contradictions between  
Mrs. Willey's testimony in the Jones deposition and her later 
statements to prosecutors, in a nationally televised interview and 
from the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to limit any damage to their witness, prosecutors led her  
through one admission: Mrs. Willey misled Starr's investigators 
when they asked about a past relationship in which she had 
pretended to be pregnant. ``I lied to them,'' she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, Ms. Steele's lawyers showed that Mrs.  
Willey had been given a second grant of immunity from prosecution 
from Starr's office as a result of that lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a former member of Starr's team, who is now a defense  
lawyer representing Ms. Steele, peppered Mrs. Willey with questions 
about why during the Jones deposition she answered 63 times that 
she could not recall key facts about the encounter with Clinton or 
subsequent conversations about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two months later, defense lawyer Eric Dubelier  
demonstrated, Mrs. Willey provided a wealth of information to 
Starr's office on the alleged incident after being granted complete 
immunity from prosecution. And she provided a detailed version of 
the encounter with Clinton in a ``60 Minutes'' TV interview last 
year and again on the witness stand Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Jones deposition, Mrs. Willey also said she couldn't  
remember her off-the-record meeting with Newsweek reporter Michael 
Isikoff in March 1997, which led to the first disclosure of her 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Willey left the witness stand, Steele friend Amy  
Horan testified she initially refrained from telling Starr's grand 
jury some information because Ms. Steele was so insistent that 
she'd never confided the Clinton-Willey encounter to Mrs. Horan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she was trying to change my story,'' Mrs. Horan  
said of Ms. Steele. But as Starr's prosecutors were moving last 
year to question Mrs. Horan, Ms. Steele insisted ``we have never 
discussed this,'' Mrs. Horan testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Mrs. Horan testified, she believes Ms. Steele told her  
in 1993 about Clinton's alleged advance to Mrs. Willey and is 
positive Ms. Steele relayed it to her in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Pornography Prosecutions Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping up prosecutions of  
pornography-related offenses could reduce crime, say lawmakers and 
anti-pornography activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research has shown that pornography contributes to sexual  
assault, including rape and molestation of children,'' Rep. Joe 
Pitts, R-Pa., said Wednesday at a news conference called to observe 
May as Victims of Pornography Month. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of child molesters revealed that 87 percent of those who  
molested girls and 77 percent of those who molested boys admitted 
using hard-core pornography regularly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws are already in place,'' said Rep. John Hostettler,  
R-Ind. ``We need the Justice Department to enforce the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene McConnell, who lives in Cincinnati, said he started looking  
at pornography at age 12. Although he wasn't proud of it, he didn't 
think he was hurting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he gradually became obsessed with it, he told reporters. And  
he thinks that played a role in his impulsive decision to jump into 
a woman's car and try to rape her years later. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, now vice president of victim assistance for the  
National Coalition for the Protection of Children &AMP; Families, said 
he broke away from pornography for a while at age 16 after becoming 
overwhelmed with shame for having molested a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to it years later after he began having trouble  
in his marriage. Soon afterwards, he began frequenting strip clubs 
and massage parlors and paying prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17 years ago, he forced his way into the woman's car  
and grabbed her by the throat. But then he realized he was about to 
damage another person's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear in her eyes was like being hit with a baseball bat,''  
McConnell said. ``I said, `I'm sorry, I've made a serious mistake,' 
got out of the car and walked away.'' The woman wrote down his 
license plate number and turned him in to police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard thousands of stories from men ... who have similar  
stories to my own,'' he said. ``They may not have taken it to the 
extent that I did, but pornography played a significant role in 
their dysfunctional relationships.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T To Acquire MediaOne for $54B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T emerged triumphant in the high-stakes  
takeover fight for MediaOne Group Inc., and along the way forged a 
deal with rival suitor Comcast Corp. that could further expand its 
reach into the nation's households. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's strategy also included a $5 billion investment from  
Microsoft, published reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with Comcast reached late Tuesday night, the  
nation's biggest long-distance telephone company will complete its 
$54 billion acquisition of MediaOne, thus making AT&AMP;T the country's 
largest cable provider as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, the No. 3 cable company, had been trying to line up  
partners to make a counter-bid to AT&AMP;T, but will abandon that 
quest. 
</P>
<P>
	However, AT&AMP;T agreed to an exchange of cable systems with  
Comcast that could result in Comcast eventually gaining 2 million 
of AT&AMP;T's cable subscribers at a cost of up to $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and USA Today reported today that AT&AMP;T and  
Microsoft had reached an agreement for the software maker to buy 2 
percent to 3 percent of AT&AMP;T at a price of about $5 billion. The 
deal would forestall a possible bid for MediaOne by Microsoft 
against AT&AMP;T, and give Microsoft a stronger position in the market 
for operating systems used to run cable TV set-top boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Comcast-AT&AMP;T deal, the two companies agreed to  
continue doing business with each other. Comcast will offer 
AT&AMP;T-branded products to its cable subscribers as soon as AT&AMP;T 
concludes separate business deals with two other unnamed companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not disclose what services Comcast would offer  
or when, but AT&AMP;T is planning to use cable wires to deliver local 
and long-distance phone service, high-speed Internet access and 
interactive entertainment to millions of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been moving rapidly into the cable business, first  
buying No. 2 cable company Tele-Communications Inc., last year and 
more recently snapping up smaller cable systems and signing 
affiliation agreements with others. Its aim is to become a dominant 
national player in providing the next generation of 
telecommunications and entertainment services, using the cables 
into millions of American homes as the foundation. Comcast had 
sought MediaOne with similar goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian L. Roberts, president of the Philadelphia-based Comcast,  
said the agreement with AT&AMP;T would give it more than 8 million 
subscribers and allow it to provide new products to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a different outcome than our MediaOne proposal, but it  
is an elegant win-win result,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable company, welcomed  
the announcement. ``This removes a lot of the uncertainty we were 
facing,'' said Steve Lang, spokesman for Denver-based MediaOne. 
``We look forward to moving ahead and we wish the people of Comcast 
the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The initial swap of cable systems between AT&AMP;T and Comcast will  
give Comcast a net gain of 750,000 subscribers. It will pay AT&AMP;T 
between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast will also receive an option to purchase from AT&AMP;T over  
the next three years additional cable systems with a total of about 
1.25 million subscribers for $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said the swaps were designed to make their  
sprawling cable systems more geographically contiguous with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction makes strategic sense for both companies,''  
said AT&AMP;T chairman and CEO C. Michael Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	An AT&AMP;T spokesman declined to elaborate on what cable systems  
would be exchanged. However, earlier Tuesday evening, AT&AMP;T 
announced a deal to pay $2.2 billion in stock for another cable TV 
provider Lenfest Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenfest has about 1.5 million subscribers in Greater  
Philadelphia and is one of five cable companies, including Comcast, 
that serve that area. AT&AMP;T already owns a portion of Lenfest and 
the deal means it would buy the remainder of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is intended to a close a bidding war for MediaOne that  
will give AT&AMP;T access to 60 percent of American homes with cable. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne had originally signed a deal March 22 to be taken over  
by Comcast, but AT&AMP;T topped the bid, prompting MediaOne to abandon 
Comcast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast had until Thursday to come up with a counteroffer, a  
deadline that sent Comcast scrambling to find help. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and America Online Inc., who both signed  
confidentiality agreements to examine MediaOne's secret internal 
financial data last week, had been reported to be examining a 
possible partnership with Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, a major competitor to AT&AMP;T in the long-distance  
business, was also reportedly interested in getting involved in the 
deal, though had declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement Tuesday, Comcast said it will receive a  
$1.5 billion breakup fee for abandoning the MediaOne agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne deal and the AT&AMP;T-Comcast deal still must  
pass shareholder and regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Parents Buy Home So Teen Can Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARRINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- Srinu Yeshwant was a lucky boy indeed  
when his parents gave him a new truck. But with a parking crunch at 
his high school, he also needed a place to park it. 
</P>
<P>
	So his parents bought a $180,000 bungalow -- complete with  
driveway -- adjacent to campus. 
</P>
<P>
	But their gift has created an uproar in this upscale suburb  
about 30 miles northwest of Chicago. Neighbors say they resent an 
absentee owner using a home on their street primarily for its 
driveway, and the town's attorney and zoning commission are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's kind of arrogant,'' Ray Peters said while mowing  
his lawn on Tuesday. ``Don't you think it would be cheaper to buy 
him a limo?'' 
</P>
<P>
	School renovation has forced students who want a slot in the lot  
to arrive well before Barrington High School's first bell at 7:25 
a.m. The Yeshwants live in nearby South Barrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like getting up at 6 a.m.,'' said Yeshwant, 17.  
</P>
<P>
	No one lives at the Yeshwants' sparsely furnished house, which  
sits on a dowdy street in the upscale suburb about 30 miles 
northwest of Chicago. Their son and five friends simply use the 
driveway to park their cars, avoiding the early trek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand all the hoopla over this little thing,''  
said Chilakamarri Yeshwant, the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greg Furda, chairman of the town's zoning commission, was  
not sympathetic. ``Nobody is going to run a parking lot in this 
town while I'm around,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Roenick Returns To Coyotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- All-Star center Jeremy Roenick returned to the  
Phoenix Coyotes' first line and special teams Tuesday night for 
Game 7 of their playoff series against the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick warmed up without a helmet, but then donned his helmet  
and a new, hinged mask to protect his broken jaw, shattered 20 days 
earlier by an elbow from Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Oral surgeon Reed Day said the recovery was possible in that  
amount of time because of several factors, including the strong 
constitution of the 29-year-old Roenick, the Coyotes' leading 
scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Day also implanted titanium plates to hold Roenick's jaw  
together rather than wiring them in place. That allowed Roenick to 
take in enough food to avoid losing weight and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentist Rick Lawson also fitted Roenick with an extra-soft  
mouthguard. The NHL had to approve his protective faceguard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeremy is a very bright and articulate young man who knows  
exactly what he's doing and is well aware of the risks,'' Day said, 
adding that he had no misgivings. He said if Roenick broke his jaw 
again, it could be repaired again. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, who had 24 goals and a team-high 48 assists before his  
injury on April 14, tried out the protective gear by taking blows 
from ``sticks and fists and elbows'' under Day's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick's right thumb also was broken when Craig Ludwig of the  
Stars slashed him a split second before Hatcher crushed him into 
the boards. Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said the prognosis 
for that injury to heal was 2-4 weeks, and said he expected no 
problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was suspended for two games of the regular season and  
five playoff games because of the elbow and the retaliation factor, 
hitting Roenick the next time the teams played after Roenick 
knocked out Mike Modano of the Stars on March 23 with a hard check 
behind the net. That hit was unpenalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars swept Edmonton in the first round, so Hatcher must sit  
out Game 1 of the second round.

earlier by an elbow from Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Oral surgeon Reed Day said the recovery was possible in that  
amount of time because of several factors, including the strong 
constitution of the 29-year-old Roenick, the Coyotes' leading 
scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Day also implanted titanium plates to hold Roenick's jaw  
together rather than wiring them in place. That allowed Roenick to 
take in enough food to avoid losing weight and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Dentist Rick Lawson also fitted Roenick with an extra-soft  
mouthguard. The NHL had to approve his protective faceguard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeremy is a very bright and articulate young man who knows  
exactly what he's doing and is well aware of the risks,'' Day said, 
adding that he had no misgivings. He said if Roenick broke his jaw 
again, it could be repaired again. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, who had 24 goals and a team-high 48 assists before his  
injury on April 14, tried out the protective gear by taking blows 
from ``sticks and fists and elbows'' under Day's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick's right thumb also was broken when Craig Ludwig of the  
Stars slashed him a split second before Hatcher crushed him into 
the boards. Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said the prognosis 
for that injury to heal was 2-4 weeks, and said he expected no 
problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was suspended for two games of the regular season and  
five playoff games because of the elbow and the retaliation factor, 
hitting Roenick the next time the teams played after Roenick 
knocked out Mike Modano of the Stars on March 23 with a hard check 
behind the net. That hit was unpenalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars swept Edmonton in the first round, so Hatcher must sit  
out Game 1 of the second round.

<HEADLINE> Hugh Downs Is Retiring From '20/20' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Genial broadcaster Hugh Downs, who has been a  
host of ABC's ``20/20'' since its second week in 1978, said 
Wednesday he's leaving the show in September. 
</P>
<P>
	True to form for someone who studied gerontology and launched a  
side business on keeping active in the later years, the 78-year-old 
Downs didn't mention retirement. Rather, he said he wants to pursue 
opportunities in new media. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fast-moving cybernetic age holds such challenge and  
opportunity that I now find it irresistible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs, who splits his time between homes in Arizona and New  
York, has been cutting back his time on ``20/20.'' The newsmagazine 
airs five times a week. He is co-host of the Friday broadcast with 
Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio, native began working at NBC after serving in  
the Army during World War II. He was host of NBC's ``Caesar's 
Hour'' with Sid Caesar and helped launch the ``Tonight'' show with 
Jack Paar in 1957. Downs was also host of the daytime game show, 
``Concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downs began a nine-year hitch on the ``Today'' show in 1962 and  
he narrated many NBC nature documentaries. He was lured back into 
network news in 1978. Ms. Walters joined as co-anchor of 20/20 in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guinness Book of Records certified him in 1985 as having  
logged the greatest number of hours on network commercial 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a reason for that,'' said ABC News Chairman Roone  
Arledge. ``His warmth, intelligence and his common sense have 
endeared him to generations of viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anchor lineup for next season's ``20/20'' will be announced  
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Are Cash Balance Pension Plans Bad? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Many of America's largest companies are switching  
from traditional pension plans to cash balance pension plans, and 
the change often may not be good for older workers, warns a pension 
specialist at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older workers could lose 20 percent to 50 percent or more  
under a new cash balance plan compared with what they might have 
earned under their traditional pension plan,'' says Robert 
Pennington, an academic associate at the college. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash balance plans have been around since the 1980s, but only in  
recent years have many companies started to switch to them. 
</P>
<P>
	A cash balance pension plan is a defined benefit plan with  
features that are similar to a defined contribution plan. Defined 
benefit plans guarantee the employee a specified payment at 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the payout of 401(k) plans and other defined  
contribution plans depends on how much the employee or employer, or 
both, put into the employee's account and how well those investment 
contributions grow over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash balance plan resembles a defined contribution plan,  
such as a 401(k) plan, because it creates a hypothetical account 
for each employee, Pennington explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The employer contributes annually to each ``account,'' typically  
based on a set percentage of pay for all participants. For example, 
each participant might be credited with an amount equal to 4 
percent of pay. In addition, the accounts earn an ``interest 
credit,'' based on an interest rate specified by the cash balance 
plan. Thus, employees can watch their ``accounts'' grow in value as 
they do with defined contribution plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But a cash balance plan is still basically a defined benefit  
plan. ``The assets are pooled as they are in any defined benefit 
plan. The individual accounts are only bookkeeping entries. 
Participants don't have access to the accounts as they do with 
401(k) plans, and the company directs how the plan assets are 
invested,'' Pennington says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cash balance plans tend to favor younger employees while  
having a negative effect on older employees,'' Pennington notes. 
The reason is that cash balance plans are career average plans that 
accrue gradually each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger workers like the plans because they start accruing  
pension benefits faster and earlier in their employment; once they 
are vested, they can roll over the assets more easily than with 
traditional pension plans. This is enticing because today's younger 
workers often change jobs more frequently than previous generations 
of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Older employees who have worked for the same company for a long  
time prefer the traditional pension plan, according to Pennington, 
because the retirement benefits are heavily weighted toward the 
worker's highest average pay, usually in the last years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The real problem for older workers occurs when companies switch  
from their old plan to a cash balance plan, Pennington says. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the older worker won't get the benefit of having a  
pension based on the higher-paying last years of salary. 
Essentially, their pension benefits won't increase much once the 
new plan goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, when some companies switch to cash balance plans the  
newly created hypothetical accounts for existing employees are 
actually less than what the accounts would currently be worth under 
the traditional pension. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, older employees frequently take a step backwards,  
and it may take them several years to earn back what they lost, 
says Pennington. Ultimately, they end up with less than what they 
would have earned under the old plan -- sometimes a lot less. 
</P>
<P>
	This perceived unfairness of cash balance plan conversions has  
prompted at least one lawsuit by older employees charging age 
discrimination, Pennington says. However, the federal government 
has had the plans under review for years and has yet to find them 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Many large employers with traditional pension plans are  
switching to cash balance plans because the plans are less 
expensive to operate, may alleviate underfunding problems with 
current traditional pensions, and because younger workers like 
them, Pennington says. 
</P>
<P>
	What should you do if your employer is considering switching to  
a cash balance plan? Pennington recommends first that you talk to 
your benefits administrator and your financial planner to see what 
impact the new plan would have on your pension benefits. In some 
cases, workers are finding they are better off taking early 
retirement. If you continue to work for the employer, ``maximize 
contributions to the employer's 401(k) plan if one is offered,'' 
Pennington suggests.

<HEADLINE> Governors Plan New Math Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. math students lag behind youngsters in  
other countries because their lessons don't focus on advanced 
topics, says a group of governors and corporate leaders who plan to 
create a new eighth grade math test to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states have agreed to use the test once it is developed a  
year from now, Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve Inc., a 
Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit group, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that students in top-performing nations are  
expected to learn advanced math concepts such as algebra and 
geometry at earlier grade levels than U.S. students. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign students, who outperformed U.S. students at the eighth  
and 12th grade levels in math, also concentrate on fewer, but more 
advanced topics. Students in the United States tend to pack in many 
more lessons, much of it being simple computations and work with 
fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no clear sense in this country of what sixth- through  
eighth-grade math should be other than the basic repetition of the 
first four or five years of school,'' said William H. Schmidt, a 
researcher who compares students test scores globally. 
</P>
<P>
	The international report, Third International Mathematics and  
Science Study, drew wide attention last year when it showed that 
American high school seniors ranked near the bottom among the 21 
nations that participated. The U.S. eighth graders scored at the 
international average in math and below average in science. 
</P>
<P>
	The math partnership, funded by the group, will give teachers  
training and lesson material to prepare students for the new test 
it will develop. The test will focus on two-dimensional geometry, 
proportions, exponents and other skills and content that prepare 
students for algebra and other high school courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators criticized the report, saying the comparisons are  
unfair because -- unlike Americans -- other countries exclude 
nonnative speakers, test older children and concentrate lessons on 
core material in a given year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group Wednesday stopped short of calling for national  
testing, a Clinton proposal many state education officials and 
lawmakers oppose because they are against federal mandates on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a resistance to anything beyond local control,'' said  
Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt of Utah. ``That doesn't mean we 
shouldn't have standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would cost the group $2 million to develop the lessons and  
test, without an initial contribution from the states. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states will spend about $330 million in 2000 on  
their own standards and tests, but the move toward unified tests 
could save money, said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 states agreeing to give the test once it's developed are:  
Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. 
Leavitt said Utah is considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders said Wednesday that advanced math is not an  
abstract concept students will never use. Many high-tech jobs call 
for the analytical skills found in algebra and geometry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few if any jobs are going to be available if you don't have a  
world class education,'' said Louis Gerstner, IBM chief and an 
Achieve co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Achieve Inc. was created after a 1996 national summit on  
education convened by lawmakers and leaders seeking to improve 
education in all states through increased standards, testing, 
technology and measures to hold schools accountable for the 
performance of their students. Leaders also said Wednesday that a 
national summit would be held Sept. 30-Oct. 1 to discuss how to 
keep good schools on track and bring others up to par.

<P>
	RONAN, Mont. (AP) -- Art Aylesworth, whose devotion to the  
colorful mountain bluebird led to the placing of bluebird nest 
boxes across Montana, died Saturday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Aylesworth was an early participant in state conservation  
organizations, pioneering efforts in goose nesting sites and other 
habitat restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
	He became widely known among conservationists as ``The Bluebird  
Man'' because of his quarter-century of passion for the spectacular 
mountain bird. 
</P>
<P>
	It began with a few nest boxes he built from scrap lumber at his  
ranch in 1974. He began giving away his boxes to anyone willing to 
put them out and to monitor their success. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mountain Bluebird Trails group that he founded 20 years ago,  
and headed until his death, estimated he and his volunteers had 
built and given away more than 35,000 bluebird nest boxes.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired police Lt. Daniel N. Cooke, a police  
department spokesman for 22 years and technical adviser to movies 
and television programs such as ``Dragnet'' and ``Adam 12,'' died 
April 30 of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	As the department's technical adviser to the entertainment  
industry, Cooke reviewed TV and movie scripts. He became a friend 
of ``Dragnet'' star and producer Jack Webb, who created the ``just 
the facts, ma'am'' image of Los Angeles police detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	In syndicated reruns, ``Dragnet'' was called ``Badge 714'' --  
Cooke's badge number. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1953, walking  
a downtown beat before becoming press relations officer in 1964. He 
retired in 1988.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Edward Davis, who became the first black American  
to own a new car dealership, died Monday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis worked at a Dodge plant before selling cars at a  
Chrysler-Plymouth dealership. Although he wasn't allowed to sell on 
the showroom floor with the white salespeople, he successfully 
promoted himself in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938, he opened Davis Motors Sales, a used car lot in  
downtown Detroit. In 1940, it became a Studebaker dealership. He 
kept the franchise until the manufacturer closed in 1956. In 
November 1963, he was awarded a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis retired in 1971 and became the manager for Detroit's  
Department of Street Railway Systems. He continued to work as a 
consultant to minority auto dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the National Association of Minority Automobile Dealers  
created the annual Edward Davis Pioneer Award. In January, Davis 
became the first black man to be inducted into the Automotive Hall

</P>
<P>
	Hendrix played left defensive end for LSU. He was a senior in  
1958, when the Tigers went 10-0 to win the national championship, 
then defeated Clemson 7-0 in the Sugar Bowl.

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Harry L. Kavetas, an Eastman Kodak Co.  
manager who streamlined the photography company to counter Japanese 
gains in the U.S. market, died of a heart attack Tuesday. He was 
61. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime executive at IBM Corp., Kavetas was hired as Kodak's  
chief financial officer in 1994. He took over with a new strategy 
to slash overhead and lay off 10,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, Kavetas and his boss, CEO George Fisher, resorted  
to even deeper cutbacks when rival Fuji slashed film prices in the 
United States and grabbed market share. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of this year, Kodak expects to trim more than $1  
billion in costs by eliminating almost one-fifth of its worldwide 
payroll of 100,500. The company has recently seen a sharp rebound 
in sales and profits.

introducing the electric bass to country music at the Grand Ole 
Opry, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of lugging around the hefty bass fiddle, which would  
frequently go out of tune, Price bought a Fender electric bass for 
$100, according to former Grand Ole Opry announcer Eddie Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with Country Music Hall of Famer ``Little'' Jimmy  
Dickens, Price became the first to play the electric bass on stage 
at the Opry in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a 1997 interview with Price, Stubbs said the Georgia  
native was ``quite possibly the first to play that instrument in 
country music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price played bass on Dickens' classics ``We Could'' and ``Take  
Me As I Am or Let Me Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price got his start with Tommy Scott in 1937 and also played  
with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys and George Morgan.

<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Robert R. Scherer, the vice president and  
market manager for Clear Channel Broadcasting, died Tuesday of 
cancer. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Scherer was hired by WHAS Inc. in 1963. He was an account  
executive, sales manager and general manager for WHAS/WAMZ radio 
until September 1996, when WHAS Inc. was sold to Clear Channel 
Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clear Channel, Scherer was named vice president and added  
market manager to his responsibilities in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also a past president and director of the Kentucky  
Broadcasters Association and a chairman and executive committee 
member of the Kentucky Derby Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Scherer received the Al Temple Award for outstanding  
contributions to the Kentucky Broadcasters Association. The

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- J. John Sepkoski Jr., a University of Chicago  
paleontologist known for his research of fossil records and the 
history of marine animal life, died Saturday of heart failure. He 
was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sepkoski's major accomplishments was analyzing data  
dating as far back as 600 million years and using it to study the 
history of oceanic life, said Douglas Erwin, a paleontologist at 
the Smithsonian Institution and editor of the journal Paleobiology. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Sepkoski and a colleague developed a theory that  
catastrophic extinctions of marine animals may have occurred about 
every 26 million years during the past 250 million years. These 
periodic events included the extinction of dinosaurs -- events that 
had been previously considered random occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial theory helped shape the view that mass  
extinctions of land and marine animals may have been caused by an 
external force, such as the impact of a comet or asteroid.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- William Woodward 3d, whose family was known for  
its wealth and violent deaths, died Sunday after plunging from his 
Manhattan high-rise. He was 54 and had been under psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward's father, William Woodward Jr., was killed in 1955 by  
his wife, Ann, at their estate on Long Island. A grand jury cleared 
Mrs. Woodward of wrongdoing. She killed herself shortly before the 
publication of a book by Truman Capote fictionalizing the incident. 
Woodward's brother died after jumping from a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward twice ran for office unsuccessfully, in 1978 for the  
state Senate and in 1981 for the New York City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a reporter for The New York Post from 1968 to 1971.  
Later he founded and published More, a journalism review. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward is survived by his wife and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Drifter Gets Death Sentence in Ore. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- Jurors decided Wednesday that a teen-age  
drifter should be executed for kicking his way into a house with a 
sawed-off shotgun and murdering the Marine Corps' first flying ace. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Fanus swallowed hard when he heard the sentence for the  
slaying of 82-year-old retired Maj. Gen. Marion Carl. 
</P>
<P>
	At 19, Fanus becomes the youngest person on Oregon's death row,  
where execution is by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge must yet formally approve the sentence, but under  
Oregon law he may not change it. The sentencing date was not 
immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors deliberated nine hours over two days before deciding  
on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl, who was buried with honors at Arlington National Cemetery,  
was awarded the Navy Cross for the World War II battles of 
Guadalcanal and Midway. After the war, he headed the Navy test 
flight program, briefly holding the air speed record. He later flew 
U-2 spy planes over China and commanded a helicopter squadron in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanus' mother, sitting behind her son, broke into tears as the  
verdict was read. ``The whole family is in shock,'' said Fanus' 
half-brother, Travis Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Alex Gardner said only: ``It's not something you  
celebrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments of the death penalty phase Tuesday, Gardner  
portrayed Fanus as a psychopath who would kill again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He punched his mother, he taunts his grandmother, he tortures  
animals,'' Gardner said. ``Nobody can relate with any kind of 
precision why he turned into this. But that's what he turned into. 
He said the shooting just seemed the logical thing to do.''

<P>
	Fanus was convicted last month of aggravated murder, attempted  
aggravated murder, robbery and theft for gunning down Carl and 
firing another blast that grazed 75-year-old Edna Carl in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carl testified that the young gunman, accompanied by a  
German shepherd dog, burst into their house and demanded cash and a 
car. She said the fatal shotgun blasts were fired when her husband 
came out of a back bedroom, startled the gunman and lunged at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark Hendershott argued that the shooting was  
an impulse, not deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
	He reminded jurors that Fanus' mother had abandoned him to go on  
a vacation when he was a week old, and that she spent the next two 
months in bars. Although his grandparents tried to give him a solid 
foundation, Fanus grew up from the age of 10 with his mother 
working for a traveling carnival.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cops on Trial in Louima Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Haitian immigrant who investigators say was  
sexually brutalized by officers in a New York City police station 
was the victim of revenge, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Five white officers went on trial on federal civil rights  
charges Tuesday in the case of Abner Louima. Prosecutor Kenneth 
Thompson said one of the officers, Justin Volpe, was angry because 
he was punched during a melee on a Brooklyn street. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be a price to pay for the assault,'' Thompson  
said. ``Because the evidence will show that when someone hurt 
Justin Volpe, he believed in hurting them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case, along with this year's police shooting of an unarmed  
African immigrant, has strained relations between the Police 
Department and the black community in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said Volpe, 27, mistook Louima for the real attacker --  
Louima's cousin -- as police tried to break up a brawl outside a 
nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Blinded by rage, the officer later rammed a broken broomstick  
into Louima's rectum and mouth in the bathroom of a Brooklyn police 
station, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged assault left Louima hospitalized with severe  
internal injuries and prompted widespread anti-police brutality 
demonstrations in New York. Charges against Louima were dropped 
within days of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, Abner Louima was tortured in that  
bathroom, and his torture was cruel and was simply inhumane,'' 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, said Louima had 150 million  
reasons to lie about the incident -- one for every dollar in his 
civil claim against the city. Louima is represented in that lawsuit 
by O.J. Simpson lawyers Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg also said that Louima's internal injuries were  
inconsistent with the prosecution's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima was not at the courthouse Tuesday. He has recovered from  
his injuries and is expected to be the government's key witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson acknowledged that Louima purposely delayed in telling  
authorities that his cousin -- who fled the scene and was never 
caught -- had punched the officer. He also told the jury that Louima 
lied initially when he claimed that the assaulting officers had 
taunted him by saying, ``It's Giuliani time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made his reputation as a  
law-and-order politician who made the city's streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That lie,'' Kornberg said, ``was told to create divisiveness  
in the city of New York, and it succeeded for a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Charles Schwarz, 33, Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese,  
35, are charged with violating Louima's civil rights by beating him 
after his arrest outside the nightclub. Prosecutors also allege 
that Schwarz held Louima down while Volpe rammed the stick into 
Louima's rectum and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' supervisor, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, is charged  
with helping cover up the attack. If convicted, Bellomo, Bruder and 
Wiese face up to 10 years in prison; Volpe and Schwarz could get 
life in prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Wants Web-Hookup Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries would get nearly $1  
billion in additional money for a program that gives them 
discounted hookups to the Internet under a proposal by the chairman 
of the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal won immediate support from teachers, librarians and  
Clinton administration officials, but it was denounced by some 
Republican lawmakers and consumer groups who fear it could lead to 
higher phone charges. The money is collected through fees on phone 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard wants the program -- overseen by the  
FCC -- to get the maximum authorized: $2.25 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we follow this course, we will be able to wire 528,000  
public school classrooms to the Internet,'' Kennard said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani support funding  
to this level -- giving Kennard the needed votes to implement the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The program -- which supporters say gives students and others  
access to information from a wide range of worldwide sources that 
they wouldn't otherwise have -- needs to have money assured for its 
second fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard and Ness said consumers' phone bills wouldn't go up  
because fees to pay for the increased Internet access would be 
offset by some $1 billion worth of reductions in other telephone 
fees, which get passed along to consumers in their long-distance 
bills. Those reductions are expected to come July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups believe that long-distance customers who  
make few calls could be hit with an increase because a proportional 
amount of the reduction in the other phone fees may not be passed 
along to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winding up for a big fight,'' said the Consumer  
Federation of America's Mark Cooper. ``They better find a way to 
fund it without increasing residential phone bills, particularly 
for the little guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FCC spokeswoman Joy Howell said the commission is studying the  
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC didn't know how much each telephone customer would be  
assessed to cover the $2.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., plan  
to offer legislation overhauling the politically touchy Internet 
program and limiting its funding. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to replace existing funding through fees on phone  
bills with one-third -- or $1.7 billion -- of the money currently 
collected through an existing federal excise tax on phones. The 
rest of the tax would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let the FCC become the tooth fairy,''  
Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC scaled back the program's budget after  
consumer groups and some lawmakers called for cuts or halts in 
funding, fearing it would lead to higher phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the FCC authorized $1.93 billion for the program's  
first 18 months. That translates into nearly $1.3 billion for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand from schools and libraries for the second budget  
cycle is estimated to total $2.435 billion. More than 32,000 
applications for money have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	An upcoming report by the Telecommunications Research and Action  
Center, which monitors long-distance rates, found that ``the cost 
of having and using long-distance service has skyrocketed for most 
consumers,'' said the group's chairman Samuel Simon. ``Today fees 
and surcharges are rapidly becoming a large part of the 
long-distance bill and are having a major effect on the bottom line 
for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program provides eligible schools and libraries with  
discounts that range from 20 percent to 90 percent off the costs of 
various equipment and services they need to connect to the 
Internet, depending on the recipients' needs.

<HEADLINE> Hottest Golfer? Watch Out for Webb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Behind the Titleist cap and  
wraparound sunglasses is the face of the most dominant player on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The expression rarely changes, and neither does the game. It is  
so good, so steady, that it seems like only a matter of time before 
the name shows up near the top of the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	No, not David Duval.  
</P>
<P>
	Karrie Webb has only three victories this year. Perhaps if she  
were to win the Titleholders Championship this week with a 59 on 
Sunday, the comparisons would be complete. Still, the results have 
been staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out each week and get myself in contention,''  
Webb said. ``I've done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A classic understatement from someone who, like Duval, prefers  
to let the performance speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Through nine LPGA events this year, Webb's worst finish was a  
tie for eighth in the Welch's Circle K Championship in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened with a 74 that week, her highest score of the year.  
In fact, Webb has shot par or better in 30 of 32 rounds. Her 
scoring average of 68.66 would shatter the record set by Annika 
Sorenstam last year when she became the first woman to break 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice has Webb finished out of the top three this year, and  
her victories have not exactly been run-of-the-mill. She set the 
LPGA scoring record with a 26-under 262 to win the Australian 
Masters, and also won the Standard Register Ping by four shots 
after putting together four rounds in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in golf is having the kind of year she's having, Duval  
notwithstanding,'' LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so Webb doesn't have $2.7 million in the bank right now, but  
only because LPGA purses are about one-fourth of what they are on 
the PGA Tour. But she is close to lapping the field with $578,724. 
Juli Inkster could win the next two tournaments and still be No. 2 
on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love where I am right now,'' Webb said. ``I don't really  
look at anyone chasing me. But we've got a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Duval, the only thing missing from her resume is a major  
championship. She's even the subject of the same ``Who's No. 1'' 
debate because the women's world rankings still have Sorenstam at 
the top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The players know better.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to raise their level because of how well she's  
been playing,'' said fellow Aussie Rachel Hetherington, who has 
done just that by winning the past two weeks. Webb finished one 
stroke behind both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's had such a great start, and her game is so solid,''  
Hetherington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hetherington knows that from experience. They used to be  
roommates on the junior circuit in Australia. Hetherington is two 
years old than the 24-year-old Webb but noticed something different 
about her the first time they practiced together. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had a good short game way before any of us did,''  
Hetherington said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what has set Webb apart from the rest of the field this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first LPGA player to surpass $1 million in  
earnings as a rookie in 1996 and winning her second Women's British 
Open a year later, Webb had what some called a marginal season last 
year -- only two victories and fourth on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	But Webb had reason to be dissatisfied. She ranked 49th in  
putting, so she sought out her coach in Australia and decided to 
putt crosshanded. She also got rid of what she calls her 
``crutches'' -- having caddie Evan Minster help line up her putts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how those two things would work together,'' Webb  
said. ``I really feel I've never been so confident as far as 
10-footers and in. I've never seen the ball roll so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Webb is on a big-time roll.  
</P>
<P>
	Dating to last year, she now has 11 consecutive finishes in the  
top 10. Whether she can keep that up depends on how she negotiates 
a dry, fast LPGA International course when the Mercury Titleholders 
starts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Ammaccapane is the defending champion of the nationally  
televised tournament that almost didn't happen when the LPGA ran 
into sponsorship problems. The tour subsidized the purse, and the 
players agreed to $100,000 less than it was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Se Ri Pak, a double major winner last year as a rookie but still  
looking for her first top 10 this year, skipped this week to play 
in Japan. Webb also was invited to play in the Gunze Cup in Tokyo, 
but decided to return to Daytona Beach, where she won in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Senate Praises Jesse Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted 92-0 Wednesday to commend the  
Rev. Jesse Jackson for winning the release of three American 
soldiers captured last month by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., saluted the  
civil rights leader for his successful intervention with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to secure the captives' freedom, and 
for ``his leadership and actions arising from his deep faith in 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three men are Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;  
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and 
Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas. They were captured 
March 31 while patrolling the Macedonia-Yugoslav border. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republican senators voted ``present'': Sens. Peter  
Fitzgerald of Illinois, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Jeff 
Sessions of Alabama, Craig Thomas of Wyoming and John Warner of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said  
he voted present because he does not want to encourage foreign 
policy missions by private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out fine, but what if it hadn't?'' he said in an  
interview. ``What if he'd gotten killed? We'd have another 
incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, said  
information is lacking on the Milosevic letter Jackson brought 
President Clinton and on whether Jackson made any commitments in 
winning the prisoners' release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far too early to render a judgment, other than to say  
we're grateful to God and to all the people involved,'' Warner said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Not voting were Democratic Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota,  
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reports Economy at Strong Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. manufacturers are bouncing back from a  
slump caused by economic troubles abroad, the Federal Reserve said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most districts report recent improvement in the manufacturing  
sector,'' the nation's central bank said in its latest survey of 
regional economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Factories benefited as American consumers, feeling secure about  
their jobs, spent more than they did last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong  
levels and to expand at a moderate pace,'' the Fed said in its 
``beige book'' report, named for the color of its cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The compilation of anecdotal information is collected by the  
Fed's 12 regional branches for the benefit of Fed policy-makers, 
who are scheduled to meet next on May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	With consumer demand so strong, analysts have been watching for  
signs of inflation that might compel the Fed to raise interest 
rates. However, the regional branches' reports on conditions across 
the country through April 26 indicated that prices generally remain 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Improvement in manufacturing was broad-based, the Fed said --  
from increased demand for medical and automotive equipment reported 
by the Boston bank, to stable orders for computers and 
telecommunications equipment noted in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	One persistent weak spot was identified by the Atlanta bank --  
apparel production and orders remain low because of ``fierce 
foreign competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis that has pushed one-third of the globe into  
recession has severely cut into American exports and also exposed 
U.S. manufacturers to increased competition from lower-priced 
foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall U.S. economy has been performing well,  
manufacturers have been forced to cut more than 300,000 jobs in the 
past year as the U.S. trade deficit hit record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	However, brisk spending by American consumers -- fueled by  
overall low unemployment and stock market gains -- has cushioned the 
blow and kept the U.S. economy growing at a robust 4.5 percent 
annual rate during the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said  
orders to U.S. factories rose 2.0 percent in March to a seasonally 
adjusted $350 billion, following a 1.8 percent drop in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the February setback, orders during the first three  
months of 1999 were 3.6 percent higher than in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does look as if the effect of the global economic shock,  
which was felt in manufacturing, ... seems to be wearing away,'' 
said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors rallied once the Fed's report was released  
Wednesday afternoon, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 69 
points to close at 10,955, after dragging it down by more than 100 
points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment is so low that many parts of the country are  
experiencing labor shortages, the Fed said. But it said there were 
no reports of significant pickup in wage increases, which can be an 
early warning sign that inflationary pressure is building. Instead, 
some companies are improving their benefits and offering hiring and 
retention bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident consumers are spending on luxury items, notably cars.  
Home sales and residential construction also remain strong. 
Commercial building projects are continuing at a good clip too, 
although some areas, including Atlanta, reported slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said rising prices for building materials, oil and gas  
were exceptions to low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, farmers are still being hurt by low international  
commodity prices, the Chicago bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The March increase in factory orders was led by a 2.9 percent  
jump in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to 
last three or more years. That followed a 3.9 percent drop in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders were up for transportation equipment, including motor  
vehicles and parts, industrial equipment and machinery, electronic 
and other electrical equipment, and primary metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for nondurable goods also rose in March, by 0.8 percent,  
building on a 1.1 percent February rise. Petroleum and coal 
products, food, tobacco and chemical orders were all up, but orders 
for textiles and paper products fell.

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' Stuff in Web Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New ``Star Wars'' merchandise just hit store  
shelves, but online auction sites are already crowded with listings 
offering to sell the much-hyped toys and products. 
</P>
<P>
	Some entrepreneurs wasted no time in recent days scouring stores  
for anything tied to the still unreleased ``Star Wars Episode I: 
The Phantom Menace,'' and then quickly reselling the items on 
auction sites such as Amazon.com, eBay.com and auctions.yahoo.com. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, thousands of just-released items were for sale and  
the bidders were jumping in, hoping to get some hard-to-find items, 
such as the popular Queen Amidala action figures and fashion dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though eBay had to temporarily suspend all auctions for  
almost six hours on Monday because of technical problems, on 
Tuesday it listed more than 4,700 auctions tied in to the movie. 
About half were action figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth of the ``Star Wars'' films is being released on May  
19, but ``Star Wars'' merchandise has long been popular on Internet 
auction sites. With a fanatical base of collectors, cyberspace has 
afforded fans the opportunity to find rare goods that were nearly 
impossible to get before. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are a `Star Wars' collector and you want something  
badly, lots of times the auctions are the way to go, and sometimes, 
they are the only way to go,'' said Seattle-resident and ``Star 
Wars'' fan club member Lauren Bock. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchandise for the new movie went on sale at stores early  
Monday, and anxious fans lined up for hours to get first dibs on 
everything from ``Star Wars'' pool accessories to ``Star Wars'' 
body lotion. 
</P>
<P>
	While many shoppers bought for themselves, there were those  
looking to make a fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
	One was 26-year-old screenwriter Eric Barker. He was shopping at  
a Toys R Us store in Los Angeles early Monday and hours later, was 
offering four of his purchases on Amazon.com's auction site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a few things I wanted, but I also got a few things that  
I could auction off,'' he said. ``I figured that way I could get my 
stuff for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barker chose a five-day auction, and in most cases, prices rise  
dramatically toward the end of the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	And people are clearly willing to pay a premium for the goods.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 3 3/4-inch Queen Amidala action figures, which retail  
for $7 to $8, had sold on eBay for twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	On Amazon.com, a poster promoting the new movie was up to $59  
from its $2.40 starting price, with the bidding not yet over.

<HEADLINE> Rider Antics Have Him Riding Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Once again, Portland Trail Blazers guard  
Isaiah Rider strolled in late for work. Again, he was benched for 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he has done on so many occasions during his brief  
Portland career, Rider zoned out on the court after getting into 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And his coach is getting tired of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't start because he was a few minutes late; that's the  
rule,'' Mike Dunleavy said after Tuesday night's 87-81 loss to the 
San Antonio Spurs. Asked if Rider's chronic lateness bothered him, 
Dunleavy said, ``It's always an issue. I'm never happy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Dunleavy and the Blazers' staff deflect questions  
about Rider's perplexing inability to get to the arena on time. But 
when Rider showed up late for the Tuesday's 4 p.m. shootaround, it 
caused a stronger reaction. Not only was it his fifth such 
tardiness this season -- not counting the three games he missed 
because of suspensions -- but it came before one of Portland's most 
important games of the season: against the Spurs, with the No. 1 
seed in the Western Conference on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy told local TV broadcasters before the game that Rider  
wouldn't start. Then after the game, Dunleavy dropped a minor 
bombshell when asked how much longer he'd tolerate the player's 
nonchalance about the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how long we'll continue this way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If this all sounds like the Dennis Rodman sideshow revisited,  
there's more. Rider, after scoring just three points in a 
season-low 16 minutes, left with 6:09 to play complaining of a 
bruised elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's last game in a Lakers uniform came in Portland, when he  
sat out the second half with what he told coaches was a sore left 
elbow. Two days later, Rodman was released after he showed up late 
for practice and said he couldn't find his shoes and socks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's three-year career with the Blazers has been marred by  
brushes with the law over marijuana, unregistered cell phones and 
moving violations -- he has been cited three times for having no 
Oregon driver's license -- as well as a three-game league suspension 
for spitting on a Detroit fan last season. Missed practice times 
and team flights have been less serious offenses, but more 
frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he has been suspended three times, each for one  
game. The suspensions were for leaving the bench in a brawl at 
Charlotte on Feb. 26; going into the stands to settle a dispute 
involving security and Rider's brother at Golden State on March 30; 
and kneeing and shoving Sacramento's Jon Barry on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Rider said he arrived at the shootaround only five  
minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't miss nothing,'' he said. ``I guess people are making  
a point. I mean, five minutes is nothing. Just a matter of putting 
on a uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After entering Tuesday night's game, at the start of the second  
quarter, Rider hit a 3-pointer and made a couple of nice passes. 
But generally he appeared lethargic. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Rider seemed disinterested, Dunleavy said, ``I  
can't say he was disinterested, but he didn't play very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's replacement at shooting guard, Jim Jackson, scored 15  
points. The Blazers are 8-1 when Jackson starts, and 27-13 when 
Rider starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, sounding subdued in the locker room, was asked whether  
Dunleavy's decision to bench him was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nah. It don't matter. We've got another game,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Against the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Derby Winner Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- State racing stewards disqualified Valhol as  
winner of the Arkansas Derby and suspended jockey Billy Patin on 
Wednesday after concluding he carried a banned electrical device. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards ordered that Valhol's $300,000 winner's share of the  
purse be returned and redistributed. Second-place finisher Certain 
was declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin was fined $2,500 and suspended through the end of 1999 --  
the maximum punishment available to stewards. The three-member 
panel referred the matter to the Arkansas Racing Commission with 
the suggestion it extend Patin's suspension through May 5, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules of the Association of Racing Commissioners  
International, Patin's suspension will apply not only to Arkansas 
but to races in all states, steward Leland Seba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin said he would appeal the decision to the state Racing  
Commission because the stewards ruling would ``tear apart'' his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol owner James D. Jackson, who wasn't accused of any  
wrongdoing, defended Patin, whom he replaced for Valhol's run in 
the Kentucky Derby. Valhol finished 15th in a 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think they had enough evidence to prove anything.  
Most everything they had was circumstantial, it's assumption,'' 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards' decision came after watching repeated replays of a  
videotape showing a black object falling from Patin's left hand 
after he rode Valhol to victory in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin watched without expression as the tape showed him crossing  
the finish line and then galloping his horse into the first turn. 
At that point, the object drops from his hand. The video was 
enlarged and shown in slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture is worth a thousand words. The tape pretty much  
speaks for itself,'' Seba said after the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin, testifying under oath, suggested the black object may  
have been one of the rubber bands he used to hold down the sleeves 
of his shirt to prevent wind from blowing up them. He said that 
when he returned to the jockey room after the race, he was missing 
one of the four rubber bands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have broke off. That's maybe the object that fell off  
my hand,'' Patin told the three stewards for Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn lawyer Jim Simpson called Patin's explanation ``an  
insult to your intelligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that racing as a whole cannot stand,''  
Simpson said in arguing for the stewards to disqualify Valhol and 
remove the purse from its owner, trainer and jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the April 10 race, Oaklawn president Charles J.  
Cella told the state Racing Commission that the track has 
``evidence that the jockey aboard the winner may have been in 
possession of an electrical device during the race.'' At Cella's 
request, the Racing Commission ordered the track to suspend 
distribution of the purse pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Jackson went to court and a judge released the  
first-place check so that Jackson's horse could have sufficient 
earnings to qualify for the Kentucky Derby. Jackson said he's spent 
none of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing behind Valhol in the Arkansas Derby were Certain,  
Torrid Sand and Ecton Park, Answer Lively and Etbauer, who by 
moving up to fifth place now becomes eligible for a share of the 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tractor driver Ismeal ``Smiley'' Sanchez told the stewards  
Wednesday that he found a device on the track after the Arkansas 
Derby. Stewards viewed the device, which included batteries wrapped 
in black electrical tape with metal prongs extending from the end. 
Sanchez said he found the device in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin lawyer J. Minos Simon attempted to show through  
questioning that the device could have been turned up by tractors. 
But Sanchez said the device was rather fresh looking and was not 
caked with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quantum leap will just not stand constitutional muster,''  
Simon said in a closing statement to stewards. ``You can't just say 
from the existence of this picture and the subsequent finding of 
this device on the track, automatically that means that this jockey 
here had it in his possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn turned over its evidence to the Thoroughbred Racing  
Protective Bureau, the investigative branch of the thoroughbred 
racing industry, and TRPB president Paul Berube testified Wednesday 
that fingerprint tests were inconclusive on the device. He said a 
microphone worn by Patin during the race picked up static shortly 
before and after the three-eighths mile marker on the track. He 
said that's approximately the point that Valhol took the lead. 
Berube said the static heard on the audio tape matched that of the 
device when tested in the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross examination, Berube acknowledged that the microphone  
could pick up noises within 25 feet. There were five or six horses 
within that range. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon questioned Berube about the effect of the device on a  
horse, but Berube said the device was not tested on a horse and he 
would object to doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon showed a videotaped re-enactment of a 3-year-old horse  
being shocked with an electrical device while galloping at his 
ranch and also of Patin dropping a black rubber band from the 
horse. Valhol did not react as the shocked horse did, Simon said, 
and the rubber band resembled the black object in the Oaklawn 
video. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol was second in a maiden race and fourth in the Louisiana  
Derby in his only two outings prior to the Arkansas Derby. As a 
30-1 shot in the field of seven, he paid $62.80 to win after a 
4 1/2-length victory.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Settles Assault Lawsuit </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman has settled a lawsuit that  
accused him of assaulting a college student. 
</P>
<P>
	The student's lawyer, Dan Conforti, wouldn't disclose the amount  
agreed to Tuesday. ``It was a fair settlement for my client and it 
was substantial,'' Conforti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sandeman, 23, filed suit two weeks ago, claiming that  
Rodman thumped him in the chest with his finger, chest-butted him 
and struck him in the face on Jan. 21 at a hamburger joint after he 
and friends pointed out the basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Rodman threatened to have gang members go after  
the group if they didn't leave the restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Deikel Departs As Fingerhut's CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) -- Ted Deikel, who started his career by  
founding a mail-order monkey business and built Fingerhut Companies 
into a multibillion-dollar marketing machine, has stepped down as 
Fingerhut's CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	William Lansing, 41, who joined Minnetonka-based Fingerhut as  
president a year ago, will takes over as CEO. Deikel, 63, will stay 
on as chairman through January. 
</P>
<P>
	The change had been anticipated since February, when Fingerhut  
said it was being bought for $1.7 billion by Federated Department 
Stores Inc., the nation's largest department store retailer and 
owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's. That deal closed March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tremendous debt of gratitude . . . is owed to Ted Deikel,  
who built Fingerhut into the direct-marketing powerhouse it is 
today,'' said James Zimmerman, chairman and CEO of Federated, in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing said the timing of Deikel's departure as CEO wasn't  
affected by the Federated deal. ``Our plan, when Ted brought me in, 
was that I would eventually take over the CEO role,'' he said. 
``We're pursuing the plan we would have pursued even if Federated 
had not come along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deikel, who owns about $80 million worth of Fingerhut stock, is  
expected to pursue entrepreneurial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Deikel joined Fingerhut in the accounts receivable department in  
1963, a year after marrying the founder's daughter and rose through 
the ranks as the company grew to become one of the country's 
largest direct marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	He quit the company after American Can bought Fingerhut in 1979,  
then rejoined Fingerhut in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Players Return Home Day Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six former baseball players from Cuba who  
missed a flight carrying an all-star team back to the island 
returned home Wednesday after assuring officials they were leaving 
the United States voluntarily, a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Cuban pitching coach who chose not to go back was  
interviewed by immigration officials about his request for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Mueller, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, confirmed that six Cubans were interviewed by INS 
officials and said no Cuban diplomats were present at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``All assured the INS that their return to Cuba was voluntary,''  
Mueller said. The six said they overslept Tuesday morning and 
missed the dawn flight from Baltimore-Washington International 
Airport that carried more than 300 of their compatriots home. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was the team of all-stars who scored a 12-6 victory  
Monday night over the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Few details emerged Wednesday about the status of Rigoberto  
Herrera, the Cuban pitching coach who defected Monday night after 
the game. Except to say INS interviewers conferred with him, 
officials declined additional comment. His precise whereabouts was 
not disclosed. At some point, officials said they expected his 
request for political asylum will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera, 54, a former pitcher, wandered the streets of downtown  
Baltimore much of early Tuesday after the game before turning up at 
a police station at 10 a.m. and asking for asylum, The Baltimore 
Sun reported Wednesday. He still had his blue Cuban delegation 
credentials around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission in  
Washington, said the Cuban government will facilitate communication 
between Herrera and his family on the island. Herrera reportedly 
has a former wife and children there. U.S. officials promised to 
pass on messages between Herrera and his family members. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the six who flew home Wednesday, Fernandez said he was  
caught by surprise when a reporter told him the group had been 
interviewed by INS agents at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who was at BWI for the departure of the Jamaica Air  
flight, said it would be a ``provocation'' for the interviews to 
have taken place without prior communication with Cuban officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Cuba would find it ``offensive'' if the six were asked  
if they were leaving voluntarily. It was not clear, he added, 
whether Cuba would lodge a protest with the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller said the interviews took place before the six got on the  
plane but said he could not be more specific. In Havana, the Cuban 
government denied reporters access to the six after they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Cubans were driven to Washington after missing  
the flight and spent part of the day viewing monuments, including 
the Lincoln Memorial. They spent Tuesday night at the homes of 
Cuban diplomats in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Passport restrictions required them not to travel 25 miles  
outside Baltimore without permission. It was not until after they 
arrived in Washington, more than 50 miles away, that Cuban 
officials asked the State Department for such permission, and it 
was granted.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche's Hunter To Sub for Yelle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The knee injury to Colorado center Stephane Yelle  
will mean more playing time for veteran Dale Hunter when the 
Avalanche entertain two-time defending champion Detroit in their 
second-round NHL playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Conference series opens Friday night in Denver.  
</P>
<P>
	Yelle, the Avalanche's third-line center who also is the team's  
best penalty killer, is sidelined indefinitely with a badly 
sprained left knee. He suffered it in Colorado's 3-2 overtime win 
over San Jose on Monday night that clinched that first-round 
series, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit wrapped up its opening-round series six days earlier,  
dispatching Anaheim in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephane is still out indefinitely at this time,'' Colorado  
coach Bob Hartley said Wednesday. ``I think (the doctors) are 
talking about a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give extra work to Dale Hunter. It makes it look  
like we made a great move when we acquired him at the trading 
deadline. He's experienced and he's a great playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, acquired from Washington on March 23, is making his 18th  
playoff appearance in 19 seasons. He is the only player in NHL 
history to accumulate 300 goals and 3,000 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stephane did a great job for us in killing penalties and  
playing a good checking role,'' Hunter said. ``So it's going to be 
a big job to fill. It's one of those things where I have to step it 
up and take a bigger part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here as a role player. Whenever they need me, I'm going  
to play. I think I give this team some depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado also is without forward Valeri Kamensky (broken arm)  
and defenseman Alexei Gusarov (knee). 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky, injured in Colorado's last regular-season game against  
the Red Wings on March 14, has resumed practicing, but Hartley had 
no timetable for his return. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Kamensky might play in this series, Hartley said, ``I  
think it's too early right now to assess when he's going to be 
available. He's getting much better and much stronger, but he 
doesn't have clearance from the doctors yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood has a sore knee. He practiced  
30 minutes Wednesday, the first time he has practiced since the 
Wings completed their sweep of Anaheim, but he is expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day-to-day thing,'' Detroit general manager Ken Holland  
said. ``Certainly we expect Chris to be in the net Friday. It 
doesn't look like a serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Red Wings weren't specific about the injury. Coach  
Scotty Bowman said Wednesday: ``He's got a sore knee. His knee is 
puffed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``the kind of injury he has, one or two days makes  
a big difference. If you go on too early, you set back the process, 
that's what it comes down to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Osgood can't play, his replacement would be Bill Ranford, who  
was picked up at the trading deadline from Tampa Bay. Ranford was 
3-0-1 for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the practice Wednesday, Ranford sounded as though he  
expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a great feeling not to play for three weeks and then  
have to go in and play,'' he said. ``That's the role I was given 
and I'm just going to go in there and do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit-Colorado is one of hockey's most bitter rivalries,  
dating to Colorado's 1996 Stanley Cup championship season. Claude 
Lemieux's hit on Detroit's Kris Draper in the Western Conference 
finals that year triggered a series of nasty altercations in 
subsequent matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got pretty intense there right after the year we won the  
Cup,'' Colorado's Adam Deadmarsh said. ``There were a lot of 
fights. It hasn't been as high since then, but obviously the play 
on the ice has been as good as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotion level is always really high when we play these  
guys. I really love playing the Red Wings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draper called it ``the best rivalry the NHL has to offer. It's  
going to attract a lot of interest from people who may not usually 
watch playoff hockey. It's something great to be a part of this 
rivalry. As a hockey player, these are the ultimate games, going in 
there and playing Colorado.''

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Tycoon Plans Cement Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A Cambodian business tycoon and a  
Chinese company announced a joint venture Wednesday to build an $80 
million cement factory in southern Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory, to be completed in Kampot province by the end of  
next year, will produce 50,000 tons of cement a year and employ 
1,000 people, the partners announced at a signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will indeed be a really excellent example of  
China-Cambodia cooperation,'' said chief partner Teng Bunma, whose 
Thai Boon Roong Group contributed $50 million to the project. 
</P>
<P>
	China Yuan Wang Group, which already has invested in six cement  
factories in Southeast Asia, is providing the other $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Cambodia's richest men, Teng Bunma was once considered  
extremely close to Prime Minister Hun Sen, and even bragged of 
giving Hun Sen $1 million during his violent coup against co-Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Teng Bunma's increasing legal troubles and notorious  
temper have encouraged Hun Sen to distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Teng Bunma is reportedly wanted in Hong Kong on charges of fraud  
and in Thailand for giving false information to obtain a Thai 
passport. He is banned from entering the United States because of 
alleged involvement in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese investment in Cambodia has been on the increase in  
recent years as Hun Sen has forged closer political ties with 
Beijing, which in the 1980s supported his enemy, the Khmer Rouge, 
in Cambodia's civil war.

<HEADLINE> Navy Man Demoted, Reprimanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A Navy enlisted man was demoted and given a  
reprimand letter for a punch that killed a hotel clerk in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Chief Petty Officer Ronald Endy could have gotten 10  
years in prison. Instead, he was reduced one military grade by the 
same court-martial jury that found him guilty of manslaughter last 
week.

Chanalata during an argument last May. Chanalata, who was a 
hemophiliac, died six days later of bleeding in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a Navy helicopter pilot was cleared of manslaughter  
but convicted of battery in the case Tuesday. The jury found that 
Lt. Brandon Fausti manhandled the clerk during the argument but did

<HEADLINE> Hoechst Plans Meet on Rhone-Poulenc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German chemical and life sciences  
group Hoechst AG said Wednesday that its supervisory board will 
make a final decision on its planned merger with France's 
Rhone-Poulenc SA within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came a day after Hoechst chairman Juergen Dormann  
told shareholders at the annual meeting that the merger, which will 
create a new ``life sciences'' company called Aventis, was not 
``100 percent certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A collapse can never be ruled out,'' he said, while adding  
that risks were ``calculable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merger of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, announced late last  
year, would create one of the world's biggest life sciences firms 
with annual sales of around $20 billion. No money is changing hands 
in the transaction, which the companies describe as a merger of 
equals, to be held 50-50 by each side. 
</P>
<P>
	At an extraordinary meeting of the Hoechst supervisory board  
Tuesday night, the management board presented its plan to merge the 
drug and agricultural products divisions and spin off its 
industrial chemicals business Celanese. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst said in a statement that the supervisory board supports  
the projects and would make a final decision on the main aspects of 
the deal by May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisory board meeting was called to discuss a revised  
merger plan following an objection to the original by a major 
shareholder, Kuwait Petroleum Corp., which holds 24.5 percent of 
Hoechst. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuwaitis objected to the plan to merge the companies in two  
stages over a two- to three-year period, and asked for the alliance 
to be completed by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders will vote on the new plan at an extraordinary  
meeting in June or July.

<P>
	What's your favorite flavor of ice cream? What computer games do  
you play? What are your hobbies? What do you do differently on the 
weekend than on a school day? Is anybody home when you return from 
school? How do you feel about your parents? Your brothers or 
sisters? 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister annoys me,'' one boy, Will, confides. ``She's a  
teen-ager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras mounted on the wall record the answers, and Nickelodeon  
executives watch from behind a one-way mirror. The network's 
success depends on knowing as much as possible about boys like 
these. No detail is too arcane. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is serious business at Nick and its cable cousins, MTV  
and VHI. Most networks just want to know what you think about their 
shows, but here they want to know YOU. They're developing a 
portrait of a new generation, and using it to guide virtually 
everything that goes on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy has served the networks well; they're among the  
most profitable in television. But it raises questions about the 
use of innocents for commercial gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really important for Nickelodeon to look at the world  
from a kid's point of view,'' said Herb Scannell, the network's 
president. ``And if you want to look at the world from a kid's 
point of view, the most important thing is to get a kid's point of 
view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful research arm of MTV Networks was built out of  
corporate necessity. When they were born, cable networks were 
barely on the radar screen of Nielsen Media Research, the company 
that measures viewership. The people who ran MTV and Nick needed 
some way to prove to cable operators and advertisers that people 
were interested in what they offered. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why MTV's first major ad campaigns brought in rock stars  
to demand, ``I want my MTV.'' It was a plea to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off competitors, the networks also needed to make  
themselves indispensable -- not just something to watch, but a 
friend. To keep friends, you'd better know what they like and don't 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the MTV Networks, research is not a back-room operation,''  
said Betsy Frank, head of the department. ``It is integrated 
completely with the programming department, the scheduling 
department and the marketing department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MTV thrives on being hip, and nothing is more stale than last  
year's style. The network sends teams of researchers onto the 
streets of the trendiest neighborhoods in the country, like Soho in 
New York City, to ask passersby why they're wearing what they're 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The network even hires ``cultural anthropologists'' to visit  
teen-agers' rooms and pick through their closets. What kind of 
socks are they wearing? What posters are on the wall? 
</P>
<P>
	But some research tools strike critics as being too intrusive.  
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon's spin-off network, Noggin, arranged to pay  
thousands of dollars to a school in Montclair, N.J. in exchange for 
allowing it to conduct weekly focus groups. Children were given 
disposable cameras and asked to record their activities in photos 
and words. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon also has a long-standing relationship with an  
``adopted'' day-care center in Harlem, which is paid $100 a month 
to enable the network to test some of its ideas on children. ``It's 
simply wrong to use public schools for snooping into the lives of 
impressionable children,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial 
Alert, a watchdog group on television advertising. ``Schools exist 
to teach kids to learn to reason, not to do market research that 
has no educational value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank said researchers aren't identified as working for  
Nickelodeon when they are in schools or day-care centers. She 
argued that there's a big difference between what Nick is doing and 
corporations that sell products in schools or beam TV shows with 
commercials into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we are bringing something good to the schools and we  
use it to develop programs that are more in tune with what kids 
want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During her ``zoom room'' session, Nickelodeon's Brandt wrote a  
list of topics on an easel: family, grandparents, TV, computers, 
music, friends, clothes. She asked each boy to walk to a corner of 
the room to signify how important each item was in their lives. All 
six moved into the ``very important'' corner when asked about the 
environment, as they did for family. But only one kid ran to the 
very important corner for TV; four went to important and one to not 
very important at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are in the midst of a wide-ranging leisure-time  
study about how young people spend their time, and have probed 
whether their use of computers has cut into TV viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Through such constant questioning, Nick knows that many young  
people feel stressed because of busy schedules and the need to 
pitch in with chores like cleaning and laundry. The networks also 
know that many teen-agers respect their parents -- no generation gap 
here -- and value family activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings guide decisions big and small. The title  
character of Nick's ``Hey Arnold!'' lives with his grandparents, 
and Chucky in ``Rugrats'' doesn't have a mom, because research 
showed so many young people in nontraditional families. Nick wants 
these youngsters to feel they're not unusual, said Cyma Zarghami, 
Nick's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers at MTV's spring break flashed fewer designer labels on  
clothes this year after researchers found many teen-agers resented 
``in your face'' marketing. The rooms on ``Real World'' were 
redecorated because viewers found them too idealized; not many kids 
would have the latest, most expensive computers that MTV had 
supplied cast members with, said top researcher Todd Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	VH1 set up a charity to fund music education in schools after  
surveys of parents indicated how important music was to them, said 
VH1's Colleen Fahey Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Tommy Lynch, creator of Nick's ``The Secret  
World of Alex Mack,'' wrote an episode about a parent-teacher 
conference at school that made the parents the butt of jokes about 
how clueless they were about their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with research showing how kids are liking their parents a  
lot more these days, Lynch made the adult characters much more 
sympathetic when he wrote a similar story for his new show, ``The 
Journey of Allen Strange.'' Parents offer to help their kids with 
homework, and take privileges away as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The research showed us at this time that kids wanted to hang  
out with their parents,'' he said. ``That tells me to make the 
parents a little more real and make the parents involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of research-driven television is that it can stifle  
creativity, placing a premium on giving an audience what it wants 
to see rather than risking innovation. Lynch said he has not been 
dictated to, but admits it's a delicate situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot for ``Alex Mack'' was written with a boy as the lead  
character. Nickelodeon executives suggested making it a girl. He 
agreed, figuring there was a better chance the network would buy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I have a problem is when I have a pilot and it  
doesn't test well,'' he said. ``Then I tend to blame the research 
process. But maybe that's my myopic view of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon's Christine Heye said giving research to producers  
is ``about helping to keep them informed, not necessarily to 
force-feed visions into a creator's mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another measure of the influence of the networks' research  
department, one of its former employees is co-creator of a popular 
Nickelodeon show. Angela Santomero has a master's degree in child 
development psychology. She used it to create ``Blue's Clues,'' an 
interactive show in which preschoolers solve mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm so much smarter about my material when I know what  
the audience is thinking,'' she said. ``I know why a show works or 
doesn't work.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Satellite Launch Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third time in less than a  
month, a botched rocket launch has left a satellite in the wrong 
orbit. This time, it was Boeing's newest rocket that malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second flight of a Delta III rocket. The first  
ended in a midair explosion last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we rushed into this,'' Gale Schluter, vice  
president and general manager of Boeing's expendable launch 
systems, said at a grim news conference early today. ``We had a 
very comprehensive return-to-flight program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orion communication satellite ended up in a lopsided orbit  
Tuesday night with a high point of 862 miles -- thousands of miles 
too low. With less than 14 hours of battery life remaining on the 
satellite, ground controllers scrambled to try to boost the 
spacecraft using on-board thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it was too soon to know whether the satellite  
could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space and Communications had intended to start using the  
Orion satellite this summer to serve Asia and the Pacific. If the 
satellite is lost, the company said it will have to rely on other 
spacecraft 22,300 miles up until a replacement can be launched in 
18 months or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission, which was insured, cost $230 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Just last Friday, an Air Force Titan IV rocket left a military  
communication satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. And 
on April 9, a missile-warning satellite ended up in a useless orbit 
following its launch aboard a Titan IV, which is built by Lockheed 
Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday  
night's launch -- the fifth attempt for a Delta III in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way to zero, but the  
rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the computer software error and 
aimed for a Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to 
review data from last week's failed Titan IV launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rockets use similar upper-stage engines.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, everything went well until 22 minutes into the  
flight. Mission director Rich Murphy said a part of the second 
stage needed to propel the satellite into a higher orbit either did 
not happen at all or did not last long enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Schluter said one explanation for recent launch  
failures may be the fact that so many more rockets are flying. 
Boeing averaged six rocket launches a year from 1993 to 1998, and 
expects to triple that rate from 1998 to 2003, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that our competitors are having similar  
experiences,'' Schluter said. ``The other thing is that Delta III 
is a brand new product. It's evolved from Delta II, but the upper 
stage is certainly new to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. It's designed to carry twice as much payload as the smaller 
Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight of the Delta III ended 71 seconds after  
liftoff last August when the rocket exploded. Because of a faulty 
computer program, the rocket used up all of its hydraulic fluid for 
steering and broke apart when it encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended up being a $225 million disaster and cost Boeing  
millions more for the investigation that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The next Delta III is scheduled to fly this fall. In all, the  
company has 18 firm launch commitments for the rocket line.

<HEADLINE> National Semiconductor Out of PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Facing declining sales, National  
Semiconductor Corp. plans to eliminating 550 jobs and stop 
developing technology for sub-$1,000 personal computers business. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came less than two years after National bought  
Richardson, Texas-based Cyrix Corp. for about $550 million to build 
microprocessors for low-cost PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a highly competitive market, including Intel and  
AMD, coupled with widespread drops in low-cost computers, has been 
tough for National's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will immediately cease slugging it out in the PC processor  
market, which has been dragging down our financial performance for 
several quarters,'' said National chairman Brian Halla. 
</P>
<P>
	National is also planning to sell a majority interest in its  
South Portland, Maine, wafer fabrication plant, a relatively new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	National Semiconductor Corp. celebrated the opening of the  
multimillion dollar manufacturing facility in June of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant produces 8-inch silicon wafers that form the circuitry  
inside devices such as cellular phones and small computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, National Semiconductor sold off neighboring  
Fairchild Semiconductor in South Portland for $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That spinoff was designed to free National of its lower-margin,  
memory- and logic-chip operations and enable it to focus on its 
more profitable primary business, making mixed-signal chips, which 
convert analog and digital signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 550 job cuts will be made through early retirement,  
attrition and layoffs, and includes 165 job cuts previously 
announced in Singapore. Overall, it represents about 5 percent of 
the company's employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of National Semiconductor rose $3.06 1/4 to $17.68 3/4 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Early Toolmakers Had Real Knack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Early makers of stone tools were more skillful than previously  
believed, according to a team of archaeologists who painstakingly 
pieced together rocks broken 2.3 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A stone tool factory the team uncovered in Kenya is so old that  
the toolmakers might not even have belonged to the human 
evolutionary group Homo. 
</P>
<P>
	They could have been small ape-like pre-humans, but they were  
smart enough to methodically chip off as many as 30 sharp flakes 
from a single rock the size of a loaf of bread. The flakes are 
thought to have been used to cut and scrape plants and meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The working scheme is more elaborate than anything else I have  
seen of this age,'' said Helene Roche, an archaeologist at the 
University of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The team excavated a small site in the Rift Valley, where  
several clues to humans' earliest ancestors have been found. They 
pieced together many of the more than 2,000 flakes they found, 
producing about 60 reconstructions of the original stones. It was 
like putting together a 3-D puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche and Anne Delagnes ``basically sat in camp for days and  
days and just looked at shapes and tried to match them back 
together. It's tremendously time-consuming, but it's really 
marvelous to see when it actually works,'' said Craig Feibel of 
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., a geologist on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, the team said two things demonstrate the skill of the early 
toolmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	One is that they chose their raw material well. They would  
strike a new rock a couple of times to see if it was the kind of 
lava that gave sharp-edged flakes, and if it wasn't, they would 
discard it and move on to another. The team found several of these 
discarded, chipped rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The other remarkable thing is that they knew where to start  
striking a rock and how to proceed so that each flake chipped off 
left a new surface suitable for striking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like they are just sort of randomly whacking away and  
knocking off whatever happens to come off,'' Feibel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is very exciting,'' said stone tool specialist  
Alison Brooks at the Smithsonian Institution, adding that the 
factory is at least 700,000 years older than previous finds of the 
same complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there are cores with up to 30 flakes removed is  
just unheard of for this time,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who the flakes belonged to is a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Two species of Australopithecus, upright-walking pre-humans,  
could have been around at this time, as well as the earliest 
members of the genus Homo, to which modern humans belong. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest stone tools ever found, 2.6 million years old, are  
thought to be the work of Australopithecines. This theory was 
strengthened by a find in Ethiopia, announced two weeks ago, of the 
2.5 million-year-old bones of a previously unknown species of 
Australopithecus together with animal bones cut by tools.

<HEADLINE>  Phil Jackson Honored by Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The music has ended, the lights are back on and  
the Chicago Bulls' ``Last Dance'' is now truly over. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 11 months after winning their sixth championship, former  
coach Phil Jackson returned to the United Center on Wednesday night 
for a halftime ceremony in his honor. A banner commemorating his 
nine years with the Bulls was unveiled, hanging right next to 
Michael Jordan's in the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked last year about it being the last dance and what a  
wonderful last dance we were going to have. And it was just a 
terrific season, a wonderful year for us,'' Jackson said. ``This is 
the final groping after the last song has been sung and we're ready 
to go home from that dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful time, didn't we?''  
</P>
<P>
	And then Jackson was gone, leaving the floor for good with his  
family as a Grateful Dead song began playing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lovefest the likes of which hasn't been seen in a year.  
Jackson got a standing ovation when he was introduced, and fans 
remained standing for the 20-minute ceremony. His former assistants 
were there, as were Bill Fitch, his college coach, and former Sen. 
Bill Bradley, his New York Knicks teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been looking forward to this all year long. It's about  
the only thing I have looked forward to,'' Tex Winter, an assistant 
to Jackson and new coach Tim Floyd, said as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Michael Jordan sent his regards.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you get another job somewhere else, you'll always be  
known as the Chicago Bulls' head coach,'' Jordan said in a 
videotaped greeting. ``So I wish you the best. If you need me, give 
me a yell. But not for playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only blemish was when fans booed as Jackson thanked chairman  
Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, who were in the 
United Center, but not on the floor with all the other dignitaries. 
Fans blame Reinsdorf and Krause for driving Jackson away and 
breaking up the six-time champions. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more boos when Winter said it won't be long before  
Jackson is back on the floor -- somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question he's one of the great coaches of all time,''  
Winter said. ``If he doesn't become the Secretary of the Interior, 
he'll be coaching somewhere else pretty soon, I'm afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In nine seasons with the Bulls, Jackson compiled a 545-193  
record and was coach of all six of their championship teams. He has 
higher winning percentages, .738 overall and .733 in the playoffs, 
of any coach in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jackson roared off on his Harley-Davidson last June, he was  
burned out and disillusioned. His squabbles with Krause had reached 
the point where they couldn't work together anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wondered if he'd ever want to coach again, he found  
over the past few months that he's still drawn to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very comfortable in saying it was real easy for me to  
sit back and observe a game here or there and not go to any arenas 
and just see basketball for what it's worth,'' he said. ``In that 
regard, the game has lost something. 
</P>
<P>
	``But basketball is right now a sport in which many people say  
it still needs leadership and direction from coaching, and that is 
an arena that intrigues me still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might sit out another year and help with Bradley's  
campaign, but everything he said points to him returning. Some 
teams already have contacted him through his attorney, Todd 
Musburger, but there haven't been any serious negotiations nor has 
Jackson made any decisions. That will come when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson admits the thought of coaching without Jordan intrigues  
him, though that won't be the reason he returns. He still loves the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not anxious, I'm not chomping at the bit to get back and  
prove my mettle as a coach without Michael Jordan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he won't take just any job. The money, city, players and  
opportunity to win all need to be right, as does the structure of 
the organization. He'll want some control over personnel decisions, 
something he didn't have in Chicago, but doesn't want the other 
duties a general manager has. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's rancor toward Krause seems to have faded with his time  
off, and he said he never had any problem with Reinsdorf. He talks 
to Winter and assistant Frank Hamblen on a regular basis, and 
occasionally to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	He's even watched a few Bulls games -- three, to be exact -- and  
admits it's a little strange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's been heartrending to see them lose to the Miami  
Heat with only 49 points. But they won last Saturday with 101,'' he 
said. ``(But) I think I was spared a lot of remorse probably and a 
lot of heartache perhaps. ... In my regard, it was something for 
myself in which I wasn't going to be able to compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's got no doubt the Bulls would have been ``at the top  
of the heap'' if they'd stayed together one more year, he has no 
regrets about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad about retiring at the appropriate time,'' he said.  
``I have no regrets at all. I don't think there could have been a 
greater scenario than to have been part of this thing.''

he'll be coaching somewhere else pretty soon, I'm afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In nine seasons with the Bulls, Jackson compiled a 545-193  
record and was coach of all six of their championship teams. He has 
higher winning percentages, .738 overall and .733 in the playoffs, 
of any coach in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jackson roared off on his Harley-Davidson last June, he was  
burned out and disillusioned. His squabbles with Krause had reached 
the point where they couldn't work together anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wondered if he'd ever want to coach again, he found  
over the past few months that he's still drawn to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very comfortable in saying it was real easy for me to  
sit back and observe a game here or there and not go to any arenas 
and just see basketball for what it's worth,'' he said. ``In that 
regard, the game has lost something. 
</P>
<P>
	``But basketball is right now a sport in which many people say  
it still needs leadership and direction from coaching, and that is 
an arena that intrigues me still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he might sit out another year and help with Bradley's  
campaign, but everything he said points to him returning. Some 
teams already have contacted him through his attorney, Todd 
Musburger, but there haven't been any serious negotiations nor has 
Jackson made any decisions. That will come when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson admits the thought of coaching without Jordan intrigues  
him, though that won't be the reason he returns. He still loves the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not anxious, I'm not chomping at the bit to get back and  
prove my mettle as a coach without Michael Jordan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he won't take just any job. The money, city, players and  
opportunity to win all need to be right, as does the structure of 
the organization. He'll want some control over personnel decisions, 
something he didn't have in Chicago, but doesn't want the other 
duties a general manager has. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's rancor toward Krause seems to have faded with his time  
off, and he said he never had any problem with Reinsdorf. He talks 
to Winter and assistant Frank Hamblen on a regular basis, and 
occasionally to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	He's even watched a few Bulls games -- three, to be exact -- and  
admits it's a little strange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's been heartrending to see them lose to the Miami  
Heat with only 49 points. But they won last Saturday with 101,'' he 
said. ``(But) I think I was spared a lot of remorse probably and a 
lot of heartache perhaps. ... In my regard, it was something for 
myself in which I wasn't going to be able to compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's got no doubt the Bulls would have been ``at the top  
of the heap'' if they'd stayed together one more year, he has no 
regrets about leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad about retiring at the appropriate time,'' he said.  
``I have no regrets at all. I don't think there could have been a 
greater scenario than to have been part of this thing.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Cuts Boost Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With OPEC members sticking to their plans about  
cutting oil output, gas prices seem unlikely to decline any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	An eagerly awaited report from the Organization of the Petroleum  
Exporting Countries this week or next is expected to show that OPEC 
members are abiding by their recent pledge to trim production. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Tuesday that could help push crude above $20 a  
barrel, nearly twice was it was last December. That means the glory 
days of prices below $1 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline are 
likely over -- at least for the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't see any huge increases like the spike we had  
for the six-week period from mid-March through April,'' AAA 
spokesman Jerry Cheske said Tuesday. ``The way things are now, 
prices might rise another nickel a gallon or may even have peaked, 
but they're not going to go down again soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline now averages about $1.23 per gallon around the country,  
up from just 99 cents in February. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway,  
agreed in March to cut their combined daily production by 2.7 
percent, or 2.1 million barrels, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministry in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer,  
said Tuesday that a report due in the next few days will show 
countries participating in the latest round of cuts reached nearly 
80 percent of that goal in April, with 100 percent compliance 
likely to come later this month. Most of the major producers 
already have said in separate reports that they've reached their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC seems to have met or exceeded what was needed to turn on  
the market,'' said John Saucer, an energy analyst for Solomon Smith 
Barney in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of cuts comes on top of 3.1 million in  
reductions pledged over the past year -- moves that had little 
effect on prices at the pump amid weak demand in Asia and Europe, 
widespread cheating on exports and increased output from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices for crude have jumped since March in futures trading  
as anecdotal confirmation of the latest round of cuts began to come 
in, including a steep decline in imports to America and 
cancellation of some large orders to European and Asian buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for delivery in June finished at $18.93 barrel Tuesday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, about 83 percent higher than a 
12-year low of $10.35 a barrel posted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides OPEC cutbacks, other factors have contributed to the oil  
price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, Americans took to the roads for an early start to the  
peak driving season. And, several refineries experienced production 
problems in California, one of the largest consumer states. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand to the Far East, which fell sharply last year, also is on  
the rise. Recent estimates have demand in that region rising this 
year by about 2 percent, said analyst Ed Kevelson at Paribas 
Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wouldn't have been a big story a year ago, but it's a big  
story from where we came,'' Kevelson said. ``With what looks like a 
solid driving season on the way in the United States and Europe and 
rebounding Asian demand, and reduced production, the market has 
been pricing in a target of about $20.50 a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a chance oil producers, heady over the recent  
increases, could return to the ways of the past and begin exporting 
beyond their pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to see them in their best behavior mode in  
May and probably June,'' said Saucer of Solomon Smith Barney. 
``After that, there may be some `leakage', but they've finally 
begun to realize that tough times call for tough measures. There's 
not a lot of incentive for them after seeing prices fall so low 
last year to go back to that.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Revives Disaster Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks to the congressional fight over the  
campaign against Yugoslavia, a stalled package of aid for Central 
America and U.S. farmers seems likely to be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders plan to make that Central America  
legislation, technically in conference between the House and 
Senate, the home for billions of dollars to pay for the fight over 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the Yugoslavia money to the Central America conference  
report would speed consideration of the defense money and take 
advantage of congressional rules eliminating the possibility of 
amendments. The strategy underlines Republican leaders' concerns 
that otherwise, a lengthy, divisive Senate debate over President 
Clinton's Balkans policy would result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have time'' to consider the Yugoslavia  
spending legislation separately, Senate Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters Tuesday. ``The 
Department of Defense is running out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House, which has rules that let it move quickly, plans to  
vote on a $12.9 billion version of the Yugoslavia measure Thursday. 
That is twice what Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	After House passage, which is considered likely, the Senate  
would never vote on a separate Yugoslavia bill. Negotiations 
between the two chambers over the package's size would begin 
immediately, with the compromise placed into the Central America 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders hope to send Clinton a package late next week that many  
participants expect will include about $9 billion for the 
confrontation over Kosovo, plus aid for Central America and U.S. 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved $1.3 billion for Central America and farmers  
on March 24. The Senate passed a $2.4 billion measure the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials and Democratic lawmakers urged  
GOP leaders to rush a compromise bill to the president so the money 
could move quickly to Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch 
and to American farmers hurt by low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Central America legislation has gone nowhere. It has  
been slowed by disputes between the two chambers, and between 
Congress and Clinton, over GOP proposals to cut other programs to 
pay for the measure and over Senate provisions dealing with tobacco 
settlement money and help for the steel, oil and mining industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many Republicans have shown little enthusiasm for a  
package dominated by foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Central America measure has been legislatively  
resurrected, Democrats tried pressuring Republicans to move the 
legislation Tuesday by emphasizing its aid for American farmers. 
The House version has $152 million for the farmers, the Senate bill 
$592 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get help out to farmers and ranchers now,'' said  
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who held a news 
conference with rural bankers and a half-dozen Senate Democrats. 
``We could lose 20 to 30 percent of our producers in the coming 
year'' without the aid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill contains language that would forbid the federal  
government from sharing any of the $246 billion tobacco companies 
agreed to pay the states to settle health-related lawsuits, and 
Stevens and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said they 
expect that to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, that language and the GOP's proposed spending cuts  
drew White House warnings that Clinton would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said if acceptable spending cuts were worked out, he  
would urge the president to sign the bill and fight over tobacco 
another day.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Reject Is Clippers Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Troy Hudson's name is not familiar but NBA  
fans are seeing a lot of him lately. He's the guy darting into the 
paint and making spectacular plays that show up on the late-night 
NBA highlights of another Los Angeles Clippers loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson was getting noticed even as the Clippers slid through  
another miserable season. ``I'm still just grateful I'm getting a 
shot,'' he said. ``Fortunately, I'm getting some minutes here, and 
I'm showing what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, Hudson was hoping the Sioux Falls Skyforce would  
make a long run through the CBA playoffs, the better to collect 
playoff money and gain exposure for an NBA shot next season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he played all 48 minutes of the Clippers' 99-82 loss  
to the Utah Jazz, recording 15 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all happened really fast,'' Hudson said. ``Sometimes I  
don't know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During another disastrous season for the Clippers, Hudson  
emerged as a dependable, sometimes brilliant point guard. In the 
last two weeks, he became LA's starter at the point, averaging more 
than 14 points, nine assists and five rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	After originally signing him to a 10-day contract as a temporary  
injury replacement, the Clippers, who ended their season Wednesday 
against Seattle, now have him locked up through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very thankful that we picked him up,'' Clippers coach  
Chris Ford said. ``I'm glad everybody else made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were perhaps the only team in the league that knew  
Hudson's potential. Utah had him on its roster early last season, 
but the rookie was the fourth point guard on the depth chart and 
was cut when John Stockton returned from an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson returned to the Delta Center Tuesday, bearing little  
resemblance to the timid rookie the Jazz remembered. He wears his 
hair in Allen Iverson-style cornrows now, and he ran the Clippers' 
offense with a confidence belying his 33 games of NBA experience. 
</P>
<P>
	As the season wound down, Hudson treated every night in the big  
leagues as an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can match up blow-for-blow with the best point guards  
in the world, that's what you dream about when you're down in the 
CBA,'' Hudson said. ``That's what every young point guard wants to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson left Southern Illinois after two seasons and entered the  
1997 NBA draft, but wasn't selected. He was invited to play with a 
Jazz summer-league entry, and he surprised almost everyone by 
making the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy was one of those guys who has trouble getting a shot in  
this league for whatever reason,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. 
``We liked him a lot, but we didn't need another player at his 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finished last year in the CBA. The Timberwolves cut him in  
January, and he was still in Sioux Falls when the Clippers, 
desperate for a point guard, gave him a call. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hudson arrived, the Clippers' guards began falling like  
dominoes. Darrick Martin, Pooh Richardson and Sherman Douglas were 
out with a variety of injuries during the last two weeks, leaving 
Hudson as the team's only healthy point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy has been asked to do a monumental task in the last few  
days ... and he's done a very good job,'' Ford said. ``He's gifted 
with tremendous quickness and a good shooting touch, and his 
decision-making is getting better all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Internet Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In the wake of the Colorado school  
shooting, Internet companies have agreed to provide new tools for 
parents to restrict and monitor online material such as violent 
video games and hate group sites, Vice President Al Gore says. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort will ``honor the lives'' of the victims at Littleton,  
Colo., Gore said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was being joined today by consumer activists, Internet  
company executives and lawmakers of both parties to announce an 
agreement calling for the online providers to offer new aids for 
parents to keep youngsters away from ``inappropriate'' Websites 
with violent or hate-filled content. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence on the Internet has been a hotly debated topic since  
the April 20 shootings at a Littleton high school left 15 dead, 
including two shooters linked to hate groups who were said to have 
played violent video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that we address all of the factors that have  
been identified as potential causes of that tragedy,'' said Gore. 
``No one single cause can take all the blame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Internet companies have agreed to include  
on their home pages a link to a new site featuring a long list of 
aids for parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Included will be technology that allows parents to restrict  
their children's access to Internet sites and keep tabs on which 
sites youngsters are visiting. It also would allow them to limit 
the time children spend online, and would provide access to a 
``guide to good content'' and safety tips for youngsters and 
parents interested in surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That access means ``parents and kids will be just one click away  
from a comprehensive resource guide,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	While many sites on the Internet promote child safety, backers  
say the link from major Internet company sites and the push from 
Gore mean the site is likely to be widely used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only by making changes can we honor the lives of those who  
were killed,'' Gore said in an interview. ``Where Internet is 
concerned, this will give parents more tools to employ the latest 
blocking and filtering technologies to limit access to sites that 
are run by hate groups, violent games and other materials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the major Internet companies have agreed to the plan,  
and Gore aides said the deal would cover Internet sites that 
account for 95 percent of all Internet traffic. Those familiar with 
bargaining that led to the agreement said the plan also includes a 
campaign to market the new guide, financed largely by Internet 
companies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the move, Gore seeks to focus attention on his  
connection to high-tech issues. He has formed an exploratory 
committee to look into the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination 
and is considered certain to run. 
</P>
<P>
	As he moves to define himself apart from President Clinton, Gore  
has offered a series of relatively modest proposals on various 
issues much like the one he is announcing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say he's being overly cautious, and his rival for the  
nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, argues that 
Democrats need to be the party of ``big ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argues he is offering mainstream proposals on ``kitchen  
table'' issues of concern to average voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have argued for even tougher restrictions on  
Internet content, but they run into free speech arguments that have 
found sympathy in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Davidson, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and  
Technology, an Internet civil liberties group based in Washington, 
said the voluntary plan is a workable balance between the needs to 
protect speech and children at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a group that cares about civil liberties and cares about  
kids, this is the right answer,'' said Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
	Others argued, however, that the issue ultimately boils down to  
one of parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Katharina Kopp, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Media  
Education in Washington, said the key is communications with 
youngsters about their online habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that it's much better for the parents to be  
involved with their children's online activities and have sort of a 
trusting relationship,'' she said.

	NATO Pounds Serbian Ground Forces  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Undeterred by poor weather, NATO  
pounded targets across Yugoslavia early Thursday. Much of the 
Yugoslav capital was without power for a third day, as diplomats 
stepped up efforts to find a solution to the war over Kosovo. On 
Wednesday, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, said allied 
warplanes had intensified their airstrikes on Serbian ground 
forces, hitting 10 armored concentrations, 11 artillery sites and 
three command posts. Serb forces in Kosovo no longer have the 
ability to conduct ``ethnic cleansing,'' Clark said. ``When they're 
not in hiding, they're busy repairing what we damaged.

NATO's latest assessment of possible scenarios for ground troops in 
Kosovo during a stop at alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,

<HEADLINE> Man Says He Targeted Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who drove his car into a crowded  
playground of children, killing two preschoolers and injuring five 
other people, told police he accelerated on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to execute these children because they were  
innocent,'' Steven Allen Abrams told police, according to Lt. Ron 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police that Abrams sped up Monday as he reached  
the Southcoast Early Childhood Learning Center schoolyard at 35 to 
40 mph, crashing through a fence and terrifying more than 40 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why he picked yesterday, why he picked this school, why he  
picked these kids, we don't know,'' Smith said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-year-old Sierra Soto and 3-year-old Brandon Wiener died  
under his 1967 Cadillac. Nicholas McHardy, 2, and Victoria Sherman, 
5, were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher's aide Danielle Knecht was treated for a broken leg at  
University of California, Irvine Medical Center and released, said 
nurse Chong Lee. Two other injured toddlers were treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams didn't know the children or anyone at the school, Smith  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his mind, he associated the school with the neighborhood he  
used to live in,'' Smith said. Five years ago, Abrams was arrested 
for stalking his girlfriend. They had lived near the preschool in 
the upper-middle-class neighborhood outside Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams worked at a concert ticket agency that was owned by his  
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the killings, Abrams rammed a car that  
cut him off on the nearby Costa Mesa Freeway, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	After plowing into the playground, Abrams calmly sat behind the  
wheel until police arrested him. Angry neighbors, parents and 
workers from a nearby church jeered as he was led away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I just kept saying it was an accident, it was an  
accident. But it wasn't and that makes it even worse,'' said 
resident Karen McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams, 39, faces two counts of murder and five counts of  
assault with a deadly weapon at his arraignment today, Smith said. 
Abrams was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	His 19-year-old daughter, Stephanie, expressed disbelief.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it wasn't my dad that did it. I believe he wasn't  
mentally sane when he did it,'' Ms. Abrams said. She said he worked 
six days a week, cooked dinner for her and was ``almost the perfect 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors sobbed Tuesday as they knelt in prayer at the  
schoolyard. A makeshift shrine sprouted along the fence with 
bouquets, balloons, stuffed animals and cards. 
</P>
<P>
	A cross erected in the playground read, ``Dear God, please  
protect our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school was closed Tuesday and will remain so indefinitely.

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	

</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Cate Blanchett  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Cate Blanchett was born May 14, 1969, in  
Melbourne, Australia. After high school, Blanchett studied fine 
arts and economics at the University of Melbourne. But after a few 
years, she dropped out to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	When she returned from Europe and Egypt, Blanchett was torn.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was failing miserably in economics and spending less and  
less time in the library, or in the galleries I should have been 
in. Those subjects were as different as the two sides of the brain. 
One was driven by guilt and one driven by my heart -- and of course 
your heart wins out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, after graduating from the National Institute of  
Dramatic Art in Sydney, Blanchett won two Sydney Theatre Critics 
Circle Awards; one of them for ``Oleanna,'' opposite Geoffrey Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	She also did several miniseries for Australian television, as  
well as several more stage productions, including ``The Tempest'' 
and ``Hamlet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchett so impressed director Bruce Beresford that he fought  
hard to get studio support for her to play the brave, rebellious 
nurse in ``Paradise Road,'' about a Japanese POW camp for women in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Big break:* Blanchett made her mark in America in ``Oscar and  
Lucinda,'' opposite Ralph Fiennes. 
</P>
<P>
	While still filming ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' she heard that she  
had won the title role in ``Elizabeth,'' this time opposite Joseph 
Fiennes, Ralph's younger brother. Her performance won an Oscar 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanchett is currently starring in ``Pushing Tin'' with John  
Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	As for flying back and forth between Down Under and Hollywood,  
Blanchett doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I happen to be someone who loves the 23-hour flights. Nobody  
can contact you, and you can sit and read and watch movies and 
catch up with things. It's true that there's a feeling in Australia 
that life happens elsewhere. There's also a feeling that we're 
trying to develop a Brat Pack, like the one America has, but 
frankly I have no interest in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Up next:* Blanchett will star in Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal  
Husband'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with Matt Damon, Jude Law 
and Gwyneth Paltrow.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Kyle Eastwood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kyle Eastwood is doing something his father only  
dreamed about. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, lanky and with wavy blond hair, the 30-year-old Eastwood  
has inherited his father's movie star looks, only a bit softer 
around the edges. When he was 13, he appeared with his father in 
``Honkytonk Man'' (1982). But unlike his sister Alison, Eastwood 
was never bitten by the acting bug. He did have notions of becoming 
a director, but ended up quitting film school to pursue a career as 
a jazz bassist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clint Eastwood learned the piano by playing along to jazz  
records, and even performed semiprofessionally. But he admits he 
``wasn't very disciplined'' about working at it and instead turned 
to acting. Still, he has never lost his passion for jazz, working 
it into his films whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Eastwood was exposed to jazz from an early age by his  
parents, who divorced when he was 11. He began playing electric 
bass in high school. After he left film school, he devoted himself 
to acoustic bass and, at 23, formed his own Los Angeles-based 
quintet. 
</P>
<P>
	The bassist's debut album, ``From There to Here,'' released last  
fall by Columbia, features the musicians from Eastwood's West Coast 
band, as well as assorted guests, including trumpeter Mark Isham, 
saxophonist David Sanchez and singer Joni Mitchell. Five of the 
album's 10 tracks are enhanced by an orchestra conducted by 
arranger Vince Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	In his self-effacing manner, Eastwood doesn't push himself  
forward by overdoing the bass solos or emphasizing his own 
compositions. He wrote only one of the tunes, ``Da Da Ba Ba Nu 
Nu,'' a witty, Thelonious Monk-influenced piece, inspired by his 
daughter's first words. Instead, much like a film director, 
Eastwood has focused on the overall ensemble sound, picking the 
material and his players, and trying to get the best performance 
out of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood now lives in New York, where he has put together a new  
quintet that is touring Europe before he returns home to perform at 
the JVC Jazz Festival in June. He was interviewed at a cafe around 
the corner from his loft in lower Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood, 
where he lives with his wife, actress Lora Gomez, and their 
5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	1. What does your debut album reflect about your musical tastes?  
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: It's primarily a jazz album, but I also wanted to  
represent a little flavor of R&AMP;B music, which is definitely a close 
second to jazz as my favorite kind of music. I tried to represent 
the different kinds of jazz that I like, whether it be the small 
ensemble or the more arranged and large ensemble stuff. I really 
like the mood on the Miles Davis and Gil Evans records with 
orchestra. I like dark, moody pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	I like a lot of R&AMP;B music, so I picked the Marvin Gaye tune,  
'Trouble Man.' Originally, I was just going to do that song 
instrumentally, but then my producer Larry Klein, who used to be 
married to Joni Mitchell, told me she was interested in singing it. 
It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. I actually didn't know 
what to expect. ... Because it's not like anything I heard her sing 
before. But I think she did a great job. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How did you develop your taste for jazz?  
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: It had something to do with just being exposed to the  
music a lot around the house when I was a kid. My parents were both 
listening to a lot of jazz. My earliest memories of music are of 
jazz: Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and Stan Kenton. Something always 
intrigued me about watching musicians play their instruments. I 
used to watch my father just play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
	I grew up in the Monterey (Calif.) area, so my parents would  
take me to the jazz festival every year. I got to see a lot of the 
great musicians play, and I got to go backstage with my father and 
meet quite a few of them: Buddy Rich, Sarah Vaughan, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Stan Getz. It definitely had an impact. I 
went through a lot of phases listening to other kinds of music. 
Probably the reason I always came back to jazz has to do with the 
freedom of expression you have as a musician playing jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Did you ever consider following your father by becoming an  
actor or director? 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: Acting was never really like a passion for me. I was  
interested in maybe directing and making films, but that was about 
the same time I started getting more serious about playing music. 
When I was about 18, I went to the USC film school and then 
transferred to UCLA. I was taking some music courses on the side. I 
decided to take a year off to study music intensively, and after 
that year, I decided that music was what I like more. I still love 
films very much. If something came along like scoring an entire 
film, that's definitely something I'd like to do. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How did your father react to your decision to quit film  
school and become a jazz musician? 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: He's always been very supportive of what I'm doing as  
long as I was doing it wholeheartedly and seriously and not just 
goofing around. My parents have both been very supportive of 
whatever I decided to do. It doesn't hurt that it's a kind of music 
that they like. 
</P>
<P>
	4 1/2. Are there any important lessons that your father taught you?  
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: Probably just to stay focused on what you're doing and  
do it to the best of your abilities. I think that's one thing that 
we probably have in common. Definitely his main thing is his work. 
I've sort of been that way also. ... Stay true to what you're 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	5. What have you found to be the biggest advantages and  
disadvantages of being Clint Eastwood's son? 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood: It's something that I've always lived with. So I take  
the good parts with the bad. It has its balance. I guess it can 
open doors and generate interest whether in the press or whatever. 
... But sometimes it also may make people more skeptical or give 
them a preconceived idea of what I'm doing or who I am personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing is the pressure of the name to live up to. I  
practically don't think about that too much. If my name generates 
an interest and somebody buys the record or comes down to hear my 
band play, then that's fine with me. I just do what I do, and 
hopefully people will listen and judge it on its own merits and 
value.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign Guard Wiegert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars on Wednesday  
signed free agent guard Zack Wiegert, a four-year NFL veteran who 
started 45 games for the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms and length of the contract were not made public.  
</P>
<P>
	Wiegert, 26, was a second-round draft choice for the Rams in  
1995, playing in five games as a rookie, including two starts. He 
missed 11 games that same year with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Wiegert moved permanently into the Rams' starting  
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegert, 6-foot-4 and 310 pounds, can play guard and tackle on  
either side of the line. He has one pass reception for a first 
down, and has scored a touchdown on a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Wiegert committed the fewest penalties of any Rams  
starting offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	At Nebraska, Wiegert started 37 consecutive games at right  
tackle and was a first-team All-American as a senior in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Winston Cup Awaits Earnhardt Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. had plenty of company  
Wednesday when he strolled into the garage area of Lowe's Motor 
Speedway to begin his Winston Cup career. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen television cameras and almost 50 journalists were  
waiting to chronicle every move of the 24-year-old marvel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel like everybody's looking at you. You feel like all  
eyes are on you,'' said Earnhardt, who came to the track for a 
two-day test session in advance of the Coca-Cola 600. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt has selected the May 30 event at the suburban  
Charlotte track to make his debut in stock car racing's premier 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Already elevated to celebrity status in the racing world for  
being the son of seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, 
the younger Earnhardt is quickly forging his own identity as a 
talented driver. He won NASCAR's Busch Grand National title last 
year as a rookie, and he's leading the points chase again in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of success has created high hopes for Earnhardt to  
become one of the next superstars of Winston Cup racing, even 
though he has yet to run a single race on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt isn't exactly doing anything to discourage the hype.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win. That's what we came here for,'' said Earnhardt,  
who showed up for his coming-out party sporting a freshly bleached 
crop of blond hair. ``Do I think we're capable of winning? We've 
probably got a long way to go and a lot of things to figure out 
before we're at the level that Jeff Gordon and a lot of these other 
guys are at. And I understand that. That's why we're here, to 
figure out how big of a gap we have to bridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That gap may not be as big as he thinks, at least according to  
three-time Winston Cup champion Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all respect him,'' Gordon said. ``He's got a lot of  
talent. I think just gaining the experience in the heavier Winston 
Cup cars is the only thing I see he's lacking in. But from what 
he's done in the Busch Grand National cars, that's not going to 
take him long to do in the Winston Cup cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was evidence of that Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's team brought two cars, and one developed a  
malfunction that led to a carburetor fire before it ever made it 
out to the 1.5-mile, high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt got only three laps of practice in the other car  
before afternoon showers ended the opening practice session after 
only about 50 minutes. The best of his laps, however, was good 
enough to place him sixth among those drivers who got on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Earnhardt can't get a provisional starting spot, he will  
have to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600 field strictly on speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to fall back on, no catch net at all, and for  
that reason we're going to put all of our concentration into it,'' 
Earnhardt said. ``But if you sit there and think about it, you can 
psyche yourself out. It's all a mind game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to defending his Busch series title this year and  
running in the Coca-Cola 600, Earnhardt plans to race in four more 
Winston Cup races this summer and fall before moving up to the main 
circuit on a full-time basis in 2000.

<HEADLINE> `Shoeless Joe' Author Sues Driver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- W.P. Kinsella, whose novel  
``Shoeless Joe'' was the basis for the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' 
says in a lawsuit that injuries from a car accident damaged his 
writing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinsella said he was struck by a car backing out of a driveway  
as he walked on a sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he suffered head, knee, back and dental injuries, a loss  
of taste, smell and appetite, and has concentration difficulties, 
depression, dizziness and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinsella is suing driver Rupert Sasseville and the owners of the  
vehicle, Edith Sasseville and Ford Credit Canada Ltd., for 
unspecified damages. The defendants deny negligence and blame 
Kinsella for not watching closely while he was walking.

<HEADLINE> NATO Moves Ahead After Apache Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- The U.S. Army won't disrupt its plans to  
send Apache helicopters into combat against Serb forces, despite a 
crash in Albania's mountains Wednesday that killed two American 
aviators and brought NATO's first fatalities in its campaign 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash, during nighttime training in rugged northeastern  
Albania, was the second in nine days involving one of the two-dozen 
heavily armed anti-tank Apaches deployed in Albania. They are 
preparing for combat missions against Yugoslav forces, accused of 
driving nearly 700,000 ethnic Albanians out of neighboring Kosovo 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Training will proceed, and the Army will stick to its  
still-secret schedule for deploying the helicopters in combat, said 
Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, a spokesman for the task force that 
includes the Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not hinder the timeline -- there's no delay, no  
aircraft grounded,'' he told reporters Wednesday at Tirana's 
airport, the Apaches' temporary base. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military identified the two Army aviators as Chief  
Warrant Officer 3 David A. Gibbs, 38, of Ohio, and Chief Warrant 
Officer 2 Kevin L. Reichert, 28, of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the remaining pilots was ``mournful, but still  
resolved,'' said Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash was under investigation, but the Army  
said there were no indications of hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Dornan said the helicopter crashed in ``remote, rugged,  
mountainous terrain'' at 1:30 a.m. local time, 45 miles northeast 
of Tirana's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a ``fireball'' was spotted by crews of other aircraft as  
the Apache went down. Some of the ammunition on the chopper 
exploded, and an explosives disposal team was dispatched to aid in 
the recovery effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot and co-pilot/gunner were dead when the first rescue  
team arrived within 15 minutes of the crash, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichert's mother-in-law told a Wisconsin newspaper that he  
switched to the Army after three years with the Air Force in 
Germany just so he could pilot an Apache. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what he wanted to do was fly those helicopters,'' Judy  
Green told The Chippewa Herald of Chippewa Falls, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichert, who grew up in northwestern Wisconsin, had been living  
in Germany with his wife, their daughter and two sons, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs' hometown was not identified by the military.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, speaking to American troops at a base in  
Germany, lamented the loss of ``two brave Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve with their families and pray for them,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tirana airport, an Apache pilot said it was a day for  
``reflection and sympathy with the families of our fallen 
brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's different from peacetime because there is not a stop or a  
pause,'' said Capt. Mark Arden. ``All the same, we are out to honor 
these fine pilots by completing the mission they started. They died 
serving their country and they died doing what they loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony at Tirana airport, pall bearers from the dead  
aviators' unit carried the two caskets past about 300 soldiers and 
honor guards onto a C-17 transport plane, the hum of the engine 
drowning out the strains of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their bodies were to be flown to Ramstein Air Base in Germany on  
Wednesday night, and transferred to a nearby U.S. military hospital 
before being returned to the United States, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache training has been deliberately rigorous in order to  
prepare the pilots for combat in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are flying under total blackout conditions, we are flying  
in difficult terrain,'' Dornan said. ``You cannot eliminate risk 
from this business. ... We are preparing for a combat operation, 
not a peacekeeping operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, another Apache crashed in flames, also during a  
nighttime training mission in Albania. Its crewmen escaped with 
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, when the Army began using the Apache, there have  
been 50 severe crashes and 14 fatalities, including the two latest 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The $14.5 million Apaches, renowned for their tank-attacking  
abilities, carry a 30 mm gun, 76 2.75-inch rockets and 16 Hellfire 
missiles. They have sighting and night-vision equipment that permit 
operations in the dark or in bad weather, but are vulnerable to 
ground fire because they stay low and fly relatively slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache is about 58 feet long and 18 feet wide and weighs  
more than 17,000 pounds. It was first used in 1989 in Panama, and 
flew in Iraq for the Desert Storm conflict as well as in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Oil Leases Sold in Alaska Wilds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Despite protests and a lawsuit by  
environmentalists, the government on Wednesday sold commercial oil 
drilling leases in a vast wilderness reserve set aside by President 
Warren G. Harding in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids totaling about $105 million were accepted for 134 tracts in  
the northeast corner of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, 
which was established on 23 million acres to ensure that the Navy 
would always have enough fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield Co. and a partner, Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,  
were the most prolific bidders in the first sale of drilling leases 
in 15 years on the land 75 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Arco and 
Anadarko won exploration and production rights to 93 tracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lease sales in the 1980s were a flop, with only one dry well  
drilled, in part because exploration techniques were relatively 
primitive and the means to get oil to market underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, high-tech seismic exploration using powerful computers to  
locate underground reserves has companies interested again, and 
branches of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline now are closer to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to environmental concerns, Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt set a number of stipulations on the sale to protect key 
areas. He placed 600,000 acres off-limits to leasing, and 
restricted surface activity on another 900,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, The Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups that  
fought to block the lease sale, contends the Interior Department 
didn't put permanent protections in place to keep oil activities 
away from wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen temporary protections fall by the wayside before,''  
said Sara Callaghan, a Sierra Club spokeswoman. ``In less than 30 
years of North Slope development we have hundreds of miles of 
roads, pipelines and toxic waste sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The land that attracted the highest bids, up to $3.6 million for  
some parcels, is adjacent to Arco's 365-million barrel Alpine 
field, discovered in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 1996 announcement of Alpine's discovery that prompted  
Gov. Tony Knowles and the industry to begin lobbying the Interior 
Department for another shot at finding oil in the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Babbitt agreed, opening the reserve's northeast  
corner to leasing. The decision sparked a lawsuit and protests from 
environmentalists who argued the reserve's wetlands are important 
waterfowl breeding grounds that can't withstand oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco joined Chevron Corp. and Phillips Petroleum on some of  
its 25 winning bids and with Phillips alone on others. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and the federal government will split the money from  
the lease sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning bidders now head to the field for exploratory  
drilling they hope will confirm their suspicions about the 
potential for oil. It likely will take at least five years before 
any commercial production begin, said Kevin Meyers, Arco Alaska's 
president.

<HEADLINE> Track Reopens With NASCAR Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- With flags at half staff, Lowe's Motor  
Speedway returned to the business of racing Wednesday, holding a 
test for Winston Cup cars on the track where three spectators died 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen teams from stock car racing's top circuit  
showed up for the start of the two-day test session, which had been 
scheduled well in advance of Saturday night's Indy Racing League 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-car crash in that race at speeds near 215 mph sent a  
tire and suspension parts flying into the stands, killing three and 
injuring eight, including one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident prompted speedway officials to consider canceling  
the Winston Cup test, but they elected to proceed mainly because 
the session, booked by General Motors for its teams, was closed to 
the public. No spectators were allowed in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was in everybody's best interests to move on,''  
track spokesman Jerry Gappens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the test began, there were other reminders of the  
accident in addition to the lowered flags outside the track's main 
entrance. A sign advised tourists that daily speedway tours had 
been canceled this week. And yellow police-line tape still dangled 
from the center-aisle railing in the fourth-turn grandstand where 
the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes into the practice session, Michael Waltrip's  
Chevrolet spun violently through the third turn and slammed off the 
fourth-turn retaining wall, about 200 yards from where Saturday 
night's wreck occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip wasn't injured, but the crash served as an eerie  
reminder of recent events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to the folks who lost their lives and their  
families and the people who were injured,'' three-time Winston Cup 
champion Jeff Gordon said as he prepared to go out for his first 
test run. ``But we know that Charlotte Motor Speedway, the IRL and 
really everybody in motorsports is going to come together and do 
whatever they can to improve the situation to make sure that 
doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's accident was the second in nine months  
involving multiple fan fatalities in U.S. racing. Both crashes 
occurred during Indy-car races when wheels and suspension parts 
snapped off cars and flew into stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty fortunate in Winston Cup,'' Gordon said. ``With  
NASCAR rules, the way our cars are built, things like that are a 
little less likely to happen. But still we want to prevent anything 
like that. We want to keep the fans safe, we want to keep the 
drivers safe and make it a fun event for everybody to enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, N.C., remained in critical condition at 
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with brain and lung injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day in a row, speedway president H.A. ``Humpy''  
Wheeler attended a funeral for one of the victims, this time going 
to a service for Randy Pyatte, 21, of Connelly Springs, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the track, engineers and architects moved closer to  
finalizing plans to modify the catch fence that surrounds the 
1.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway. The fence now rises 15 feet 
above the track and is topped by a 35-inch-long canopy positioned 
at a 45-degree angle. Gappens said the speedway is looking at 
adding to both the height of the fence and the length of the 
canopy.

<HEADLINE> Small Firm Bookseller Finds Niche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUTTON, W.Va. (AP) -- When PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York  
needs the latest annual guidebook for its army of accountants, it 
doesn't turn to the publisher down the street or across the river 
in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Sandler calls Corporate Book Resources, a shop nestled on  
the main street of this small central West Virginia town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier for me to pick up the phone and call Corporate  
Books than to order direct,'' says Sandler, who is in charge of 
procurement for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cut through all the complicated billing,'' he says, ``...  
and even when you're not sure of the exact title, they can still 
find it immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate Book Resources -- with all of seven employees -- has  
found a niche in the literary world, providing businesses and 
colleges around the globe with scientific, medical and technical 
reference books. 
</P>
<P>
	The family business operates out of the second floor of a  
bookstore sandwiched between the Braxton County Magistrate Court 
and an optometrist's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Weigen, who runs the company his father founded, likens  
Corporate Book Resources to a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're purchasing agents,'' he says. ``With 14,000 publishers  
out there, customers don't want to deal with 14,000 different 
people. It's easier to place one order and be done with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Weigen started the business in 1982 to supplement his  
struggling bookstore in Syracuse, N.Y. The bookstore soon closed 
and Weigen returned to his former job of locating retail sites for 
a Kentucky oil company, all the while running his book business 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
	He began with the idea of shipping books to customers straight  
from the publisher. Without the costs of maintaining a warehouse, 
he was able to offer a discount and still turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate Book Resources now offers up to 20 percent off list  
price, plus free UPS ground shipping. For overnight service, 
customers pay shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very expensive to store books,'' Richard Weigen says.  
``We think it is a carefully thought-out scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 1989, Inc. magazine had named the company one of its 500  
fastest growing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Weigen, 65, spends his time traveling, visiting  
customers and selling his service to new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric, 28, runs the day-to-day operations in Sutton, while his  
brother, John, 31, maintains the company's Internet site and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Corporate Book's first big accounts was Richard's former  
employer, Ashland Oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first order was over $1,000,'' the elder Weigen says. ``A  
week later there was another $1,000 order and it just grew from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He never thought of moving the book business to West Virginia  
until he left Ashland to work for Go-Mart, a competitor based in 
Braxton County. 
</P>
<P>
	``After living in 13 different houses, my wife said she wasn't  
moving anymore,'' Richard Weigen says. ``Now it doesn't really make 
a difference were we are because everything is electronic. Plus, 
property is inexpensive here and the taxes are low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Hoffman, publication buyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., for  
research and development of Warner-Lambert's Parke-Davis division, 
found Corporate Book Resources by chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their customer service is excellent,'' she says. ``They work  
with you to meet your needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the bookseller says it will never turn down any order --  
not even requests for the latest John Grisham novel -- most requests 
are more obscure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The schools really keep us on our toes,'' Eric Weigen says.  
``They order everything from computer and nursing books to picture 
books with the works of Van Gogh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is the Weigen family's personal touch that keeps Darlene  
Buchannan coming back for more books for Bluefield State College. 
</P>
<P>
	``When UPS was on strike, they loaded up a car and delivered the  
books themselves to make sure we got our deliveries on time,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	With the growth of the Internet, Corporate Book Resources has  
been joined by other companies who sell books online. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandler has tried many of them, but found that most don't offer  
discounts on professional titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a longer lead time to process the order and you don't  
get an immediate response,'' Sandler says. ``And shipping is very 
risky. A good third of the orders are never processed or they are 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens, Sandler has to start the process anew. A book  
that would have arrived in seven to 10 days is now bogged down in 
the order process by more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't operate a business like that,'' he says.

<HEADLINE>  Ethnic Albanians Headed to New Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- The first group of Kosovo refugees were  
flying to the United States today, leaving behind a crowded camp 
and a homeland ravaged by war for a New Jersey military base 
transformed into a sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 453 refugees left the Balkans this morning, some of the  
ethnic Albanians were reluctant to board the Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I would love to come back, but I'm afraid that we'll  
end up staying in America because of my children,'' said Mehmet 
Selimaj as he hugged his three daughters, a 16-year-old and 
11-year-old twins. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees were expected to arrive at nearby McGuire Air Force  
Base late this afternoon before heading to Fort Dix. 
Albanian-speaking mental health and trauma counselors will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very traumatic in some cases,'' said Immigration and  
Refugee Services of America spokeswoman Gabrielle Bushman. ``And 
some of these people may not really be wanting to come to 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 20,000 refugees the United States has agreed to  
accept will be directly placed with sponsoring families or 
relatives upon arrival. The group arriving at Fort Dix today from a 
camp in Macedonia were deemed at special risk. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected to welcome them.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be arriving from a long plane ride and  
they'll be exhausted,'' said Toby Graff, a spokeswoman for the 
first lady. ``It will be a short welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 to 3,000 refugees are expected here in the coming  
weeks. On Saturday, another group of refugees is to arrive in New 
York to await sponsor families or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees will spend three to six weeks at the base,  
undergoing background checks and securing sponsor families who will 
help them prepare to live in America. Ms. Bushman said most will be 
assigned a city where they can receive one month's apartment rent, 
job training, English as a second language classes and a sponsor 
family's support. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials have attempted to make the area at Fort Dix  
where the refugees will be staying warm, enjoyable and familiar. 
The area has come to be known as the ``Village.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to call it a camp,'' said Sgt. Major James  
Larocco. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign hanging over the base's gym-turned-processing center  
reads: ``Mirsevini Ne Amerike'' (Welcome to America). Dormitories 
hold playrooms bursting with board games, baseball bats, indoor 
basketball nets and plastic kitchen sets. There is a big-screen 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be reminders of home, too. An empty room serves as a  
place of prayer for Muslims. All signs inside the dormitories and 
dining hall have been translated into Albanian. And the Fort Dix 
cooks are being instructed on preparing Albanian foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole operation has been likened to a modern-day Ellis  
Island. Laptop computers have been set up in the processing center 
to input biographical information about families, issue 
identification cards and record fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief officials say America's response to the Kosovo crisis has  
been unprecedented. Phone lines are jammed with people seeking to 
give money, clothing and food. Children have sent plastic bags 
filled with small change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, based in New York,  
said its priority will be relocating refugees in communities with 
large ethnic Albanian populations, such as New York, Boston, 
Chicago, Dallas, and Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's president, Ralston Deffenbaugh, and other  
relief officials are discouraging outright adoption of children 
displaced by the war. In many cases, there is no way to confirm 
whether missing parents are alive or dead, and relief agencies seek 
to place orphans with relatives.

<HEADLINE> Willey Says Clinton Made Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Kathleen Willey testified today that  
President Clinton's lawyers wanted her to sign an affidavit 
swearing she was not sexually harassed by the president, but she 
refused because it was ``a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying in the obstruction-of-justice trial of her former  
friend, Julie Hiatt Steele, Mrs. Willey described how the 
president's legal team tried to help her avoid testifying in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid came after Mrs. Willey's allegation of an unwanted  
sexual advance by the president was published in Newsweek magazine 
and she was subpoenaed by Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied under oath making a sexual advance on Mrs.  
Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett's law firm drafted an affidavit and an  
accompanying press release for Mrs. Willey. But she said using 
those documents ``would have been a lie. ... The affidavit sent to 
us by the president said there was no sexual harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she signed a more general affidavit saying she had no  
information for the Jones case. She was called for a deposition 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's defense attorneys seized on that deposition to cast  
doubts on Mrs. Willey's testimony. They noted her vague answers and 
frequent failure to recall details and conversations that she now 
claims to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's testimony is crucial in the trial of Ms. Steele,  
who is charged with obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation by 
repeatedly denying under oath that Mrs. Willey told her about the 
alleged sexual advance before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified today that she discussed the alleged  
sexual advance by Clinton with Ms. Steele ``many, many times'' 
after first telling her about it within hours of the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not give her all the gory details, but I told her what  
happened in the Oval Office,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey said during the years between the alleged incident  
in November 1993 and 1997, when the story was first published in 
Newsweek, ``I more or less kept her apprised of what was going on 
because I felt she was a friend I could trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, however, told investigators and two grand juries  
that she never heard the allegation until 1997, when Mrs. Willey 
called and asked her to corroborate the story she had told a 
Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempting to undermine Mrs. Willey's credibility, defense  
lawyer Eric Dubelier pointed out that in her January 1998 
deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Mrs. Willey said she couldn't 
recall exactly where Clinton touched her. But she provided a 
detailed description of the alleged incident during this trial and 
in a ``60 Minutes'' TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	During the deposition, Mrs. Willey also said she couldn't  
remember her off-the-record meeting with Newsweek reporter Michael 
Isikoff in March 1997, which led to the first disclosure of her 
story. ``If I said I didn't recall at the time, I didn't recall,'' 
Mrs. Willey told Dubelier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubelier also noted that Mrs. Willey said 63 times during her  
deposition for the Jones lawsuit that she could not recall what she 
said to others about the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified today in detail about several  
conversations with Ms. Steele about the incident. She said Ms. 
Steele ``wanted to be very much into this story'' and ``wanted to 
make money off of it,'' at one point suggesting the money could 
help pay for her son's schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey said her former friend even suggested they sell the  
story to a tabloid but ``I told her I had no intention of going to 
a tabloid for any amount of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele sold a photograph of the president and Mrs. Willey  
together to three media outlets, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	When she first took the stand Tuesday, Mrs. Willey said she was  
sure she had told her friend about the president's advance the day 
it happened because Ms. Steele later reminded her of that fact. 
</P>
<P>
	She also described the day in which Clinton allegedly made a  
``very forceful'' sexual advance that she says she rebuffed. ``His 
hands were all over me,'' she said, as he kissed her and grabbed 
her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to her home near Richmond, Va., that same day in 1993,  
she searched frantically and unsuccessfully for hours for her 
husband, winding up at Ms. Steele's home. His body was found the 
next day, a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recall being there (at Ms. Steele's house) because Julie  
told me I was there,'' Mrs. Willey testified. ``She reminded me 
that I was there, that I had told her briefly what happened with 
the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said, Clinton called her and said, ``You need to come  
back to work. And when you do, let me know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to her volunteer work at the White House around  
Christmas and met with the president seeking a paying job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him what had happened in the Oval Office had been a  
mistake. It was over, and I didn't want to talk about it anymore. 
And I just needed a job,'' she said. She was given a job in the 
White House counsel's office.

<HEADLINE> Robinson Regaining Form for Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As San Antonio Spurs teammate Mario Elie put it, David Robinson  
looked like the Admiral of old. 
</P>
<P>
	The salty 33-year-old, playing his best basketball of the  
season, scored 29 points Tuesday night in an 87-81 victory over the 
Portland Trail Blazers, a win that pushed the Spurs to the brink of 
the Western Conference regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory at Golden State to end the season Wednesday night  
would give the Spurs (36-13) homecourt advantage through the 
playoffs. The Utah Jazz (37-13), after losing the season series to 
the Spurs 2-1, would be seeded No. 3 in the Western Conference 
behind No. 2 Portland (35-14). 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's resurgence has helped San Antonio win 30 of its last  
35, erasing memory of the team's dismal 6-8 start. It was back on 
Feb. 28 when the Spurs hit that low point, as home fans booed the 
team after a 14-point loss to the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were 6-8, everybody was throwing stones at us. Now,  
everybody's patting us on the back,'' Robinson said. ``We believed 
in ourselves when we were 6-8. So I said, `Don't get too high on 
what people are saying now, and don't get too low when people don't 
believe in you.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	There are few nonbelievers left regarding the Spurs, who have  
beaten the best in the West in the last few weeks on their march 
toward tying Utah for the league's best record. Since losing at 
Dallas on April 14, San Antonio has won 11 of 12, defeating 
Minnesota, Houston, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz twice and the 
Blazers three times. 
</P>
<P>
	During that stretch, Robinson has averaged 18 points after  
averaging 14.8 his first 36 games. At 15.7 a game, he'll still 
finish with a career low in points, but his rebounding and defense 
have remained consistently strong. And he's gracefully given up a 
large slice of the spotlight to second-year forward Tim Duncan, an 
MVP candidate who's seventh in the league in scoring at 21.6 a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, signed as a free agent after five seasons and two titles  
in Houston, has given the team a fiery emotional leader, and he's 
also the best 3-point shooter in an offense dominated by the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Avery Johnson has also played well. In the Spurs'  
last two wins over Portland, he scored 24 and 18 points, outplaying 
Blazers counterpart Damon Stoudamire. A couple years back, when he 
was with Toronto, Stoudamire said the Spurs would never win an NBA 
title with Johnson leading the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire, who scored eight points on 4-of-14 shooting Tuesday  
night, said his remark stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it then; I'm not backing away from the comment,'' he  
said. ``They still haven't won it, either. Until they win it, the 
comment can stay as it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't respond to Stoudamire's latest comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just think our confidence right now is really high,''  
Johnson said. ``It's not so high that we're going to believe all of 
the print and radio and TV media about ourselves, but it's high 
enough that we have a confidence level in what we're doing 
offensively and defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs may get a chance to make Stoudamire eat his words.  
Along with the Jazz, San Antonio has to be considered a contender 
to make the Finals. It's the completion of a remarkable turnaround 
for a team that went 56-26 last season, a 36-win improvement over 
the 1996-97 lottery season that made the drafting of Duncan 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come a long way since last year,'' Duncan said. ``Last  
year around this time, we were losing games ... to the better teams 
in the West. We've grown up, got more experience and know how to 
finish games.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although Richard Holbrooke has been cleared of  
alleged ethics violations, his nomination to be U.N. representative 
remains on hold in the Senate. Democratic supporters suggested 
Wednesday the outspoken diplomat had become a target of Republicans 
frustrated with President Clinton's Kosovo policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after Clinton announced his choice of the Balkans  
troubleshooter for the United Nations post, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee has yet to schedule a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there are any ethical problems with Holbrooke. I  
don't think there ever were,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, 
the committee's senior Democrat. ``There clearly is delay on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he has asked committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.  
for a ``straight answer'' on when hearings might be held. But 
Republicans suggested further study is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and other Senate Republicans note that even though Clinton  
announced the nomination in June 1998, he did not submit it until 
February -- after completion of a joint ethics investigations by the 
Justice and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms spokesman Mark Thiessen denied the committee was  
intentionally stalling and said getting the administration to share 
material from those internal investigations was ``like pulling 
teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a hearing until they share documents with this  
committee,'' Thiessen said. 
</P>
<P>
	One committee official said it seemed unlikely the review would  
be done before Memorial Day, meaning a hearing and Senate vote 
couldn't happen before June. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Helms came under pressure from Republican members of  
his own panel. ``I believe the ball is now in our court and we 
should act expeditiously on Mr. Holbrooke's nomination,'' Sen. Rod 
Grams, R-Minn., told Helms in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams, chairman of the subcommittee on international operations,  
said the UN post has long been vacant ``at a time we badly need 
U.S. leadership on many sensitive foreign policy matters, including 
Kosovo.'' Grams called Holbrooke ``highly qualified'' for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke is expected to receive wide bipartisan support if the  
nomination ever makes it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The State and Justice inquiries largely cleared Holbrooke of  
earlier allegations of conflict of interest violations, although 
Holbrooke paid $5,000 to settle civil charges that he broke 
lobbying laws in his private-sector contacts with former State 
Department colleagues. Holbrooke maintained he did nothing wrong 
and was paying the charges simply to end the matter quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Wednesday announced a subsequent  
internal investigation had cleared Holbrooke of allegations that he 
improperly accepted private speaking fees last fall while trying to 
broker a peace deal on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had been accused of improperly accepting private  
speaking fees while serving as a U.S. envoy to the Balkans, 
including a $16,000 fee for a speech on Kosovo last November at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department Inspector General Jacquelyn L.  
Williams-Bridgers said in a statement that the investigation ``did 
not find evidence of a clear violation'' of any federal rules and 
that she had ended the inquiry on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state and ambassador  
to Germany, negotiated the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the 
war in Bosnia. He is currently a vice president at the investment 
banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senate aides, and some Republicans as well, suggested  
privately that Holbrooke's role in the Balkans had become a 
political liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Holbrooke's name is often mentioned as a potential  
secretary of state in a Gore administration also doesn't help, the 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he didn't know ``whether the Republicans' political  
leadership has decided that (Holbrooke) is a scalp. ... It's 
obvious that he's in trouble,'' but he added, ``I still believe he 
will be confirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has sat on nominations before. In 1997, the North Carolina  
conservative blocked the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. 
William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be ambassador to Mexico by 
refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Holbrooke associates said Wednesday he was determined to  
continue seeking Senate approval -- and was not considering 
withdrawing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the key U.N. post has been vacant since former  
representative Bill Richardson left last September to assume his 
present job as energy secretary.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline Wins Ear Medicine Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham's popular antibiotic  
Augmentin was much more effective than Pfizer's Zithromax in 
treating children with ear infections, according to results of a 
head-to-head study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, paid for by SmithKline, Augmentin alleviated  
symptoms such as ear pain in 90 percent of patients, while 
Zithromax reduced symptoms in 63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a shocking development,'' said Dr. Michael  
Poole, a professor of pediatric surgery at University of Texas 
Medical School. The results were also disappointing because 
Zithromax is much easier to administer, requiring five days of 
dosages instead of 10, said Poole. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which included 238 children between the ages of six  
months and four years, also found that Augmentin killed one the 
most common bacteria causing ear infection in 87 percent of 
patients, compared to 39 percent for Zithromax. 
</P>
<P>
	The study results were presented at the Pediatric Academic  
Societies annual meeting in San Francisco Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Childhood ear infections, also called otitis media, result in  
more than 24 million doctor visits each year. In many cases, the 
infections vanish without treatment, though doctors have 
increasingly prescribed antibiotics in response to parental 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Most doctors usually administer a generic antibiotic called  
amoxicillin first, then switch to a brand-name drug if it doesn't 
work -- an increasingly common development with up to 20 percent of 
ear infections failing to respond to amoxicillin. 
</P>
<P>
	Augmentin and Zithromax are the two most widely prescribed  
brand-name antibiotics for childhood ear infections. Augmentin, 
which had $1.6 billion in worldwide sales in 1998, outsells 
Zithromax, which had $1 billion in worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zithromax has gained market shares the past few years  
largely because doctors and parents like that the drug is only 
given once a day for five days. In comparison, Augmentin is taken 
twice a day for 10 days. Some doctors also believe Zithromax has a 
more pleasant taste than Augmentin. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Candice Johnson, one of the study's investigators and a  
pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Denver, said the study 
indicates that Augmentin should be the drug of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efficacy should be the end point, not convenience or taste,''  
said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer officials maintain that their own head-to-head studies  
have shown that Zithromax is as effective as Augmentin. They also 
note that 14 million children have received the drug since 1996, 
which they say is proof that doctors find it effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``In widespread clinical usage, Zithromax has proven to be an  
effective drug for ear infections,'' said Chuck Knirsch, a medical 
director at Pfizer.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To End Nextel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc., the nation's No. 2  
long-distance telephone company, is expected to announce today that 
it has called off talks to acquire Nextel Communications Inc. after 
weeks of fruitless negotiations to buy the wireless phone company, 
according to a person familiar with MCI's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the only major long-distance company without a  
stake in the $33 billion U.S. wireless business. The Jackson, 
Miss.-based company started discussions with Nextel after it lost a 
bidding war to buy AirTouch Communications Inc. earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
breakdown of the talks was amicable. 
</P>
<P>
	While negotiations stumbled over price, that wasn't the only  
reason they failed, investors and analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom was faced with assuming Nextel's $7 billion in  
debt, plus having to borrow more money to expand Nextel's network 
nationwide. Nextel's system relies on Motorola equipment, and isn't 
compatible with other wireless carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's positive news,'' said Catherine Jackson, a managing  
director for Trainer Wortham Co., a money management firm that owns 
600,000 shares of MCI WorldCom. ``It came down to price. The thing 
the Street has been most concerned about is that MCI WorldCom would 
overpay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI's shares were off 18 3/4 cents at $82.75 in early afternoon  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where Nextel's shares were down 
$1.87 1/2 to $35.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said she thought the two companies may still reach an  
agreement at a future date. Nextel, based in McLean, Va., is the 
last independent wireless company, and controls about 4 percent of 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI is ``doing it at their own pace, and I don't think the  
opportunities are going to disappear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the wireless market is growing quickly. The number of  
wireless customers in the United States jumped 25 percent last year 
to 69.2 million, according to the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cop Abuse Monitoring May Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Civil Rights Commission plans to  
call for a special prosecutor to replace the district attorney to 
investigate abuse allegations against Los Angeles-area law 
enforcement officers, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission cited the district attorney's record in  
prosecuting rogue sheriff's deputies and police officers, noting 
that while 126 cases of possible abuse were referred to the 
district attorney from the Los Angeles County sheriff's department 
in 1996 and 1997, criminal charges were filed against 11 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's findings were detailed in a report obtained by  
the Times and scheduled to be released next month. The commission 
began its investigation in 1993, a year after the race riots that 
stemmed from police beating of black motorist Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members of the eight-person commission dissented from the  
report, saying replacing the district attorney would be ``an 
overreaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles police officials said the report contained sweeping,  
inaccurate generalizations. ``We have grave concerns about the 
substance of the report,'' Cmdr. David J. Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the sheriff's department nor District Attorney Gil  
Garcetti's office would comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission didn't immediately return a call Wednesday to The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said the public has no faith in the prosecution  
of law enforcement officers and called on the Justice Department to 
investigate ``serious allegations'' that sheriff's deputies have 
formed gangs to brutalize minorities, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the LAPD failed to address problems including use  
of excessive force, gender bias and a code of silence among its 
officers. The commission also suggested that the county appoint a 
civilian board to examine complaints against deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite admirable training programs in both departments, there  
is evidence of increasing intolerance of ethnic and minority 
immigrants among some members of both the LAPD and the Sheriff's 
Department,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcetti's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to comment  
specifically about the report but said Garcetti is ``strongly 
committed to the prosecution of all the residents of this county 
regardless of whether the criminal offenders are law enforcement 
officials or private citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot's Defense Rests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot accused of obstructing  
justice for helping destroy a videotape of a flight that clipped an 
Italian gondola, killing 20 people, testified Wednesday that he 
wished he acted differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we would have left the tape there,'' said Capt. Richard  
Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif. ``If we had taken the tape, we 
should have turned it over to somebody to watch. ... I don't think 
taking a personal videotape is a crime,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get out of the aircraft. I was shaking. I wanted  
out,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense rested its case after Ashby testified for more than  
two hours at his obstruction of justice and conspiracy trial. The 
case could go to the seven-man military jury Thursday. Ashby faces 
10 years in prison or dismissal from the service if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Feb. 3, 1998, training flight, the right wing of  
Ashby's four-man EA-6B Prowler cut a gondola cable at Cavalese, 
Italy. Twenty people plunged 370 feet to their deaths. A separate 
jury acquitted Ashby in March of 20 manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had testified that he handed the videotape to his  
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who then threw the tape into a 
bonfire. Ashby maintains that he did not intend to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer ``wanted it gone. I wanted to look at it. That's all  
I've ever said,'' Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to the same  
obstruction charges Ashby faces and was sentenced to dismissal from 
the service.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Murder, Kidnap Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A former autoworker was convicted of  
murdering a funeral director and raping the man's wife. Jurors 
rejected Donald Flagg's insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagg, 41, who showed no emotion while the verdicts were read  
Tuesday, could face the death penalty for his conviction on murder, 
rape and kidnapping charges. The penalty phase is to begin May 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagg admitted that he shot and killed Anthony Puglisi, abducted  
his wife, Debra, and held her in his home for four days, raping her 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Puglisi managed to escape by loosening ropes and calling  
the police when Flagg went to work. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is The Associated Press' policy not to report the names  
of rape victims, Mrs. Puglisi's name was widely reported while she 
was missing, and she has given media interviews in the past using 
her name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family's extremely happy at this point,'' said Mrs.  
Puglisi's brother, Bob Engel. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagg's lawyers relied on an insanity defense, saying a prison  
psychiatrist diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suggested Flagg may have manufactured his symptoms  
to support his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, when it suits him, he hears voices,'' Ropp told the jury.  
``He knew very well his acts were wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flagg admitted to the police he saw Mrs. Puglisi working in her  
garden and decided to abduct her, slipping into her home to wait 
for her. When her husband surprised him, Flagg shot him in the 
head, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Tired Blues Must Face Rested Stars / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The first two games are on home ice. They've had a  
week's vacation. Their wounded have healed. What more could the 
Dallas Stars ask for going into their Western Conference semifinals 
against St. Louis on Thursday night? 
</P>
<P>
	They'd like to have captain Derian Hatcher but he has one more  
game to serve on his seven-game suspension for breaking Jeremy 
Roenick's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	They'd also like for Brett Hull to score a goal.  
</P>
<P>
	Hull, the former member of the Blues, was signed to provide more  
scoring punch for the Stars particularly in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to score a goal in the Stars' four-game sweep of  
Edmonton and has been the constant source of kidding by his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get one to get them off my back even if it's  
against a girl's team,'' Hull joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has failed in recent playoff years because of a lack of  
scoring punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know that the goals are going to come,'' Hull said.  
``Still it's been a little frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dallas is a different team than St. Louis because he  
doesn't have to carry the load. 
</P>
<P>
	``In St. Louis if I'm not scoring, we're in trouble,'' said  
Hull, who spent 10 seasons with the Blues. ``This team is much more 
balanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis made a remarkable comeback after being down 3-1 to  
beat Phoenix 1-0 early Wednesday morning on an overtime goal by 
Pierre Turgeon in game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The tired Blues will play in Dallas again Saturday night before  
returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has had plenty of time to heal its injured players with  
the week off including right wings Pat Verbeek and Grant Marshall, 
defensemen Shawn Chambers and Richard Matvichuk, and center Tony 
Hrkac. All were expected to be available for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Guy Carbonneau, who scored a game-winning goal against  
Edmonton, was expected to miss more time with sprained knee 
ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock is wary of the Blues even if they are  
worn down from their exhausting series. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. Louis has given us fits for three years,'' Hitchcock said.  
``We've struggled against them and they may be the toughest team 
for us to play. They play a very strong, tight team game. They're 
quick and they've been able to break down our forechecking patterns 
with good puck movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville just hopes his team can somehow  
have lively legs after their draining and physical series against 
the Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dallas is well rested and will have a lot of energy in the  
first game,'' Quenneville said. ``We just have to find a way to 
slow them down and try to win a tight game like we did against 
Phoenix.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Grateful Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALPOLE, Maine (AP) -- She was never a true fan of its music, but  
Carol Brightman seemed destined to write about the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
	How many authors, after all, could claim a younger sister who  
spent 25 years as the band's lighting director and a literary agent 
whose client list included rocker Jerry Garcia, leader of the Dead? 
</P>
<P>
	After overcoming doubts and deciding to write the book,  
Brightman wove in elements of a subject she regarded as more 
compelling than the Grateful Dead: the political radicalism that 
shaped her life during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``Sweet Chaos: The Grateful Dead's American  
Adventure,'' a cultural history that explores the band's roots, its 
tie-dyed and often drugged-out following, and the mystifying way 
the entire scene somehow endured over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Brightman's previous works, including her biography of  
artist Larry Rivers and a scholarly study of author and critic Mary 
McCarthy, signaled an interest in Garcia or his band. 
</P>
<P>
	Brightman won a National Book Critics Circle Award for ``Writing  
Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World.'' She went on to edit 
``Between Friends: The Correspondence of Hannah Arendt and Mary 
McCarthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brightman's literary agent, the late Lucy Kroll, also  
represented Garcia in his literary and film endeavors. She tried to 
interest Brightman in writing a biography of Garcia, an idea whose 
focus quickly shifted to a book about the band. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the catalyst,'' Brightman recalled in an interview in  
the long-abandoned farmhouse that she helped restore after moving 
to Maine from Brooklyn in the 1980s. ``But I was full of 
reservations. I really wanted to write this book about the history 
of the New Left and particularly the relationship with Cuba and 
Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An activist who came of age in the 1960s, Brightman had  
co-founded Viet-Report, an antiwar newspaper, and traveled to North 
Vietnam during the height of the fighting to view the impact of 
U.S. bombing. She also traveled twice to Cuba with the Venceremos 
Brigade to help harvest sugar cane, then edited a book about the 
group's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her musical tastes tended more toward Bob Dylan, Janis  
Joplin and the Doors, Brightman occasionally attended Grateful Dead 
concerts, but only as an excuse to get together with her sister, 
Candace, who ran the lighting booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the linchpin,'' Brightman said, noting that she never  
would have become involved with the band had it not been for her 
sister and the insider access she provided. Their brother, 
Christopher, also worked for the Dead as a set carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Candace Brightman was an important source for the book, along  
with Garcia's ex-wife, Mountain Girl, lyricist Robert Hunter and 
author Ken Kesey, whose acid tests during the Dead's formative 
years fueled the psychedelic drug culture with which the band is so 
closely identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The author never got to interview Garcia, whose health  
deteriorated as his drug dependence increased, culminating in his 
death in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Brightman recognizes there has been no shortage of books about  
the Dead, but she said hers was the only one that attempted to 
present the band in the larger context of the times. 
</P>
<P>
	She said many of the three dozen Deadheads whom she interviewed  
at length appreciated her perspective as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have felt like a fraud if I had written it as some kind of  
expert,'' she said. ``But I was someone from another tradition of 
the '60s who was looking to see where my experiences fit in with 
theirs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they came out of the same era, Brightman's politics  
were at odds with the Dead's insular world view. From their base in 
San Francisco, Garcia and the band had little interest in the 
radicalism that took root across the Bay in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very anti-political. They had no radical bones in  
their bodies at all,'' Brightman said. ``(Garcia) was interested in 
reconciling things. He hated confrontation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that frenetic time, the nomadic followers of the Dead came to  
regard the band as a safe haven from politics, she said. That 
laid-back sense of community endured, helping to explain why the 
Grateful Dead maintained and even increased its popularity while 
the political movement Brightman embraced had all but vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Brightman spent three years researching her book and another  
three years writing it. She attended Grateful Dead concerts around 
the country, sometimes with her two college-age children. Like many 
others of their generation, they preferred the band Phish, whose 
music Brightman agrees is more original. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as she grew more familiar with the Grateful Dead,  
Brightman came to appreciate its talents. In particular, she 
enjoyed the band's ability to improvise, drawing upon elements of 
bluegrass, ragtime and Delta blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as ``Sweet Chaos'' represented a shift from her earlier  
works, Brightman's next project may take her in another direction. 
She is thinking about heading off this summer for southeastern 
Alaska, where she has ancestral ties, to research a book -- perhaps 
a novel -- about the taming of that little-known frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, she may simply return to the '60s and revisit  
her long-delayed plan for a history of the New Left, possibly as a 
memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from ``Sweet Chaos: The Grateful Dead's American  
Adventure,'' by Carol Brightman: 

</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it then, but I was witnessing the genesis of a  
movement whose takeoff was related to the breakdown of my own. If 
the climate of the '60s made you feel things could be changed and 
were worth changing, the climate of the '70s, more like today's, 
counseled retreat from storms over which you had no control. With 
the Grateful Dead's sense of otherness, along with their aura of 
communal ecstasy, they were poised to offer their audiences a 
refuge from a world that seemed harder to understand, much less to 
influence, than it had been only a few years before.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Grateful Dead, the institution, the True Church that  
sleeps and feeds at once, is a haven in a heartless world, Maggie 
Motorcycle's 'safe, loving environment.' It is the still place at 
the center of the storm -- the 'new order,' you might say, that 
emerged from the 'formlessness and chaos' of which Garcia spoke in 
1972. If Jerry was uniquely sensitive to his audience's hungers, to 
its spiritual yearnings, loneliness, fear of conflict and, yes, of 
change -- and he was -- it was because, to a considerable extent, 
they mirrored his own.

<HEADLINE> Senator Targets Baseball Exemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator who wants baseball teams to share  
more of the costs of building new stadiums is threatening to take 
away the sport's cherished antitrust exemption unless owners step 
up to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he also would target  
professional football, which he said has been able to obtain 
lucrative television contracts because it essentially has a limited 
antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he was prepared for battle if team owners oppose  
legislation he introduced Tuesday to require them to set aside 10 
percent of television revenue and use the money to pay up to 50 
percent of stadium construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't want to build stadiums, we have to have a blood  
war,'' Specter said. ``If we are going to go to war, let's make it 
unconditional surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter brought up the issue with Assistant Attorney General  
Joel I. Klein, who heads the Justice Department's antitrust 
division, during a Senate hearing. Specter asked Klein to look into 
the possibility of removing the exemption and plans to pursue that 
course if teams oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, passing his bill would give baseball,  
basketball, football and hockey broader exemptions allowing their 
leagues to deny a team's request to move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he supported reluctantly a recent initiative  
committing $320 million in state money for four new stadiums in his 
state, saying he had ``a gun at my head'' as teams threaten to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned  
in recent years,'' Specter said. ``One would think some of that 
giant revenue windfall might trickle down and be used to help 
finance new ballparks and stadiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter questioned why the public must commit more money for  
stadium construction when schools and housing are in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have long been concerned with the pressure put upon  
communities by baseball and football clubs seeking new playing 
facilities where, responding to a team's overt or tacit threat to 
move to another city, government leaders feel compelled to have 
taxpayers finance the lion's share'' of costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a reference to a recent bidding war in New England over  
the Patriots football team. After threatening to move to Hartford, 
Conn., the Patriots decided to stay in Massachusetts when the state 
came up with a $70 million plan for infrastructure improvements at 
their stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge signed a law that  
allocates $320 million for four new stadiums, two each in 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires team owners to finance one-third of the stadium  
costs. The rest would be split between the state and the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's bill would apply to any stadiums not yet completed, so  
it could affect those in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's antitrust exemption, granted in a 1922 U.S. Supreme  
Court ruling, allows baseball owners to block the sale of 
franchises without violating federal laws that prohibit unnecessary 
restraint on trade. Specter threatened to target that exemption 
previously, when the Pirates considered moving out of Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Boy Charged With Murdering Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HURON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy was charged with  
shooting his father to death at the kitchen table, an act his 
lawyer said was self-defense against an abusive alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Gray was charged with murder Tuesday and could face life in  
prison if convicted as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's lawyer, Marc Hart, said the killing was not murder.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be disrespectful of the dead, but he was a mean  
drunk,'' Hart said of the father. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Glenn Gray was shot in the back of the head with a .357  
magnum on Sunday, Police Chief James Caygill said. Gray fell to the 
ground and Matt shot him twice more, then he called an aunt, 
Caygill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The father owned the gun and a 16-year-old boy witnessed the  
shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Matt told police he killed his father ``after he came  
after me,'' Caygill believed the killing was planned, noting there 
was no sign of struggle in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mind-boggling. You shoot the guy in the back of the head,  
he falls down and you shoot him again. Sounds planned to me,'' 
Caygill said.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs Grew Wings but Why? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The ancestors of birds may have evolved wings not for flying but  
for running faster, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study might answer a key question about the origin of bird  
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe birds descended from two-legged  
dinosaurs like Velociraptor, featured in ``Jurassic Park.'' The 
problem has been explaining how the clawed dinosaur forelimbs 
developed into the wings of the first known bird, Archaeopteryx, 
which lived 140 million to 150 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these dinosaurs must have had limbs that resembled  
wings, but not enough to allow them to fly. If they couldn't fly 
with them, why have wings? 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologist Luis M. Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of  
Los Angeles County and aerodynamic engineer Phillip Burger of the 
San Diego Natural History Museum think they have found the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe the crow-sized Archaeopteryx took off from the  
ground. But it appeared too weak to launch itself from a standing 
start, as most modern birds can, and too slow to gain lift from 
just running. 
</P>
<P>
	So how did it get into the air? In Thursday's issue of the  
journal Nature, Chiappe and Burger calculate that Archaeopteryx 
could almost quadruple its running speed with thrust from flapping 
its wings. 
</P>
<P>
	They estimate that with a runway of 10 to 15 yards, it could  
achieve the 18 mph takeoff speed in about three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Flightless ancestors of Archaeopteryx could have used  
rudimentary wings to speed up when chasing prey or escaping 
predators, Chiappe said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the theory does not fly with paleo-ornithologist Larry  
Martin of the University of Kansas at Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could increase your ground speed by flapping your  
wings, then I suppose birds that run on the ground would do this. 
As far as I know, there is no modern bird that flaps its wings to 
increase its ground speed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up on a farm. I've chased chickens. I know that when  
they get their wings out, it's about when they're ready to fall -- 
they use it as balance. But I've never seen one flap its wings with 
the idea of increasing its speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiappe disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to a chicken farm and chase a chicken very closely,  
the chicken will start flapping its wings and it will run faster,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and some other scientists favor the idea that  
Archaeopteryx and its immediate ancestors lived in trees and 
started flying by jumping off branches. The wings of its 
predecessors, if not good enough for flying, could have helped in 
gliding.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Latin Democracy Imperiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
Tuesday ``gaping inequality'' between haves and have-nots in Latin 
America could produce instability leading to the return of 
authoritarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither democracy nor prosperity can endure unless they are  
broadly based,'' Albright told a gathering of the Council of the 
Americas, a pro-business group. 
</P>
<P>
	She called free markets and open investment the keys to  
sustained growth but said these policies can be open to challenge 
``if too many people feel shut out or left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience in parts of Asia shows that booming economies can  
collapse if the problems of cronyism, corruption and a lack of 
accountability are not addressed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Complacency is the enemy of democracy, and if we do not ensure  
that the process of globalization goes forward with a human face, 
we run a grave and unnecessary risk,'' she said. ``In some 
countries, we may see public confidence in democracy erode, and we 
may see basic institutions of society lose their legitimacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright expressed concern that support might grow for what she  
called the failed remedies of the past, such as protectionism and 
ambitious social programs that cannot be funded without spurring 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may even see instability and turmoil, leading to the return  
of authoritarian leaders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of this needs to happen,'' she said. ``But much of it  
may, unless we address the gaping inequality in our hemisphere 
between those who have and those who have not; between those with 
the skills to make it in the new world economy, or those denied 
access or not yet equipped with those skills.''

<HEADLINE>  New Boeing Rocket Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
malfunctioned shortly after liftoff Tuesday night and placed a 
communication satellite in the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second flight of a Delta III. The inaugural  
flight eight months ago ended in a midair explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a significant disappointment to Boeing and, I  
believe, to Boeing's customers,'' said Gale Schluter, vice 
president and general manager of Boeing's expendable launch 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we rushed into this,'' he said at a somber news  
conference early Wednesday. ``We had a very comprehensive 
return-to-flight program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage used to boost the Orion satellite ignited  
properly the first time, but not the second time. That left the 
satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the Pacific for  
Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high perch. It 
was unclear whether the satellite could be boosted into the right 
orbit using on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third time in less than a month that a satellite has  
ended up in the wrong orbit. The two other satellites were launched 
aboard the Air Force's Titan IV rocket, built by Lockheed Martin 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday night's  
launch. Not only did it mark the Delta III's return to flight, it 
was the fifth launch attempt in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way down to zero, but  
the rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the error and aimed for a 
Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to review data 
from last week's botched Titan IV launch, which stranded a military 
communication satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rockets use similar upper-stage engines.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole industry is having its problems at the moment,''  
Boeing mission director Rich Murphy said Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff. The rocket used up all 
of its hydraulic fluid for steering and broke apart when it 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's debut ended up being a $225 million disaster and  
cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed. 
Tuesday's mission cost $230 million.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Helps Cut Bladder Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Drink more water -- or coffee, milk, soda, fruit juice and beer --  
and you can lower your risk of bladder cancer, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	American men who drank at least 11 8-ounce glasses a day of all  
liquids cut their risk of two common types of bladder cancer in 
half, compared with men who drank five glasses or less, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Water had an independent protective effect. Men who drank at  
least six glasses of water a day cut their risk of bladder cancer 
in half compared with men who had less than one glass, regardless 
of how much they drank in total liquids. 
</P>
<P>
	Bladder cancer strikes an estimated 310,000 people worldwide  
each year and is the fourth most common cancer among American men. 
Smokers are more susceptible than non-smokers, and it afflicts four 
times as many men as women -- possibly because few women smoked 
until recently, and the lag time from when a person starts to smoke 
to when the cancer shows up can be 40 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine is the  
first to demonstrate a clear link between increased liquid intake 
and decreased bladder cancer of the two types most commonly found 
in developed countries: papillary and flat transitional cell 
carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at a third type, squamous cell carcinoma,  
which usually is associated with schistosomiasis, a water-borne 
parasitic disease common in Africa and parts of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain why drinking more liquids helps prevent the  
transitional cell cancers. But some researchers believe the bladder 
lining suffers less exposure to cancer-causing substances in urine 
when the urine is diluted and urination is more frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking greatly increases the quantity of carcinogens in urine,  
and this study, like previous research, found that the risk of 
bladder cancer was nearly four times higher among heavy smokers 
than it was among non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Quitting smoking is the best way to cut your cancer risk,  
according to the study's lead author, Dominique Michaud, a research 
fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. But smokers who 
can't or won't quit can still cut their cancer risk substantially 
by drinking more, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the eating, drinking, exercise and smoking  
habits of 47,909 American men from 1986 to early 1996. A similar 
large-scale study of women does not include enough cases of bladder 
cancer yet to yield statistically significant results, Michaud 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's study, 252 developed bladder cancer. The risk  
increased with age and was higher in the Northeast than in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides water, none of the other beverages had an independent  
beneficial or harmful effect. Although previous, smaller studies 
had suggested drinking large quantities of coffee or alcohol might 
be harmful, this study found no increased bladder cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jones, director of the University of Southern California's  
Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an accompanying 
editorial that the study was not sensitive enough to answer 
questions about whether water quality -- especially chlorination -- 
play a role in cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of what you drink may ... be as important as how  
much (or little) you imbibe,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE>  New Boeing Rocket Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing's new Delta III rocket  
malfunctioned shortly after liftoff Tuesday night and placed a 
communication satellite in the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second flight of a Delta III. The inaugural  
flight eight months ago ended in a midair explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a significant disappointment to Boeing and, I  
believe, to Boeing's customers,'' said Gale Schluter, vice 
president and general manager of Boeing's expendable launch 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think we rushed into this,'' he said at a somber news  
conference early Wednesday. ``We had a very comprehensive 
return-to-flight program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage used to boost the Orion satellite ignited  
properly the first time, but not the second time. That left the 
satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was supposed to serve Asia and the Pacific for  
Loral Space and Communications from a 22,300-mile-high perch. It 
was unclear whether the satellite could be boosted into the right 
orbit using on-board fuel and thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third time in less than a month that a satellite has  
ended up in the wrong orbit. The two other satellites were launched 
aboard the Air Force's Titan IV rocket, built by Lockheed Martin 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood was tenser than usual going into Tuesday night's  
launch. Not only did it mark the Delta III's return to flight, it 
was the fifth launch attempt in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the countdown went all the way down to zero, but  
the rocket never ignited. Boeing fixed the error and aimed for a 
Sunday liftoff, then delayed the mission two days to review data 
from last week's botched Titan IV launch, which stranded a military 
communication satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rockets use similar upper-stage engines.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole industry is having its problems at the moment,''  
Boeing mission director Rich Murphy said Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff. The rocket used up all 
of its hydraulic fluid for steering and broke apart when it 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's debut ended up being a $225 million disaster and  
cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed. 
Tuesday's mission cost $230 million.

<HEADLINE> Legal Services Corp. May Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans want congressional auditors  
to investigate case-load reporting problems at a program that 
provides free legal assistance for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and four other GOP  
House members want the General Accounting Office to determine the 
extent of inaccurate case reporting at Legal Services Corp.'s 
regional programs and whether the agency is doing enough to fix the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported on April 7 that Legal Services  
overstated to Congress the number of cases it handled in 1997 by 
tens of thousands. One office reported eight times as many new 
cases as it should have. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services reported serving 1.93 million clients in 1997. An  
Associated Press review of just five of the agency's 269 regional 
programs found officials had overstated their caseloads by 90,000. 
Agency officials said new policies have been put in place to 
correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Services handed out $283 million in taxpayer money to  
about 260 local programs last year. Funding was increased to $300 
million for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Monday, Republicans asked David Walker,  
comptroller general at GAO, to ``determine the extent of inaccurate 
case reporting among grantees'' so Congress can ``make a more 
informed decision'' about Legal Services' funding request. The 
members asked for a response by June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Armey, a longtime critic of Legal Services, the  
letter also was signed by Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, Rep. Charles 
Taylor, R-N.C., Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., and Rep. Dan Miller, 
R-Fla.

<HEADLINE> `Kinetic' Kasich Seeks Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOW, N.H. (AP) -- Kirby Hall is leaning against her neighbor's  
kitchen sink, chatting with a fellow guest over sips of coffee. 
``I'm here to meet John Kasich,'' she tells the man, who replies 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's me! That's me!'' he says. ``I'm John Kasich.'' Swinging  
his arms above his head in mock horror, Kasich topples an empty cup 
into the sink. ``Who'd you think you were talking to, for crying 
out loud? The paperboy? The yardboy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As high on energy as he is low on name recognition, the boyish  
looking House Budget Committee chairman is the Republican Party's 
kinetic kid -- a dynamic campaigner blitzing the early primary 
states with a unique bottom-up, values-driven message. Kasich 
believes he has outgrown Congress and sums up his presidential 
mission in just six words: ``I want to change the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First, the 46-year-old Ohio lawmaker must change the dynamics of  
the GOP field and position himself as the alternative to the early 
favorite, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not me?'' Kasich asks during an interview in the back seat  
of a car zipping between campaign stops. He answers his own 
question, listing the hurdles in his way: 
</P>
<P>
	--Too many people know too little about him.  
</P>
<P>
	--No sitting House member has won the presidency in more than a  
century. 
</P>
<P>
	--He has a limited political base.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said the Kosovo crisis  
and dissatisfaction with the Clinton presidency will make it tough 
for a young, untested politician to break through. ``If you just 
have a cold, any doctor will do,'' he said. ``But if you need brain 
surgery, you want the doctor to have a little experience poking 
around in the gray matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich says cable TV and 24-hour news cycles make it easier than  
ever for an unknown candidate to prove himself. The only thing that 
can stop him, he says, is the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that raising money for me and staying alive in this  
campaign will be hand-to-mouth,'' Kasich says. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say he raised $1.3 million in the first quarter of 1999.  
The figure, which cannot be confirmed because he has not reported 
to the Federal Election Commission, puts Kasich in the middle of 
the fund-raising pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Some supporters have doubts about his chances. ``I think the  
campaign has to get a lot stronger,'' said longtime backer Karen 
Cervantes, who invited friends to her Lebanon, N.H., office to meet 
Kasich. ``We got to get more involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she broached a subject Kasich refuses to touch: Losing. ``I  
would happy if we got the vice presidential nomination out of this 
thing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In these early stages, the campaign is still intimate enough to  
give Kasich and other candidates the illusion that they can meet 
every voter and win the primary one Republican at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of beer and pizza still clings to the air of a  
Dartmouth University fraternity house. Kasich is leaning against a 
pool table, unconsciously toying with the cue ball as he talks to a 
small group of students. The topic: School regulations of the Greek 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think it's right, man. All these rules,'' he  
says. The young men nod their heads in agreement; one elbows 
another and flash a he's-one-of-us grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Kasich courts voters in a supporter's kitchen. With a  
caffeinated cadence, Kasich talks about tax cuts, ``the power of 
the American people,'' a poll about lying, health care, abortion, 
his parents and ``having the courage to use the gifts God gave 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As often happens with Kasich, the final six words meld into one,  
``Usethegiftsgodgaveyou.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his message is clear. The government must give more power to  
Americans, especially the working class, by lowering taxes, 
protecting their pensions and providing more choice in schools. And 
a president must inspire Americans to be better citizens and set 
the tone with his own conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign book, ``Courage is Contagious,'' is a collection of  
stories about regular-Joe American heroes such as the Pittsburgh 
man who shines shoes at $2 a pair, donating his tips to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fostering values like those are the most important moral  
challenges of the day, he says, even though his party has made 
abortion a defining issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not running away from (the abortion) issue, ... but I  
think the single biggest moral issue is whether we can get our 
power back and whether we can get rid of our cynicism as a people 
and learn to govern again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He can be surprisingly frank. He won't budge, for example, in  
his opposition to ethanol subsidies ``just because I'm campaigning 
in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a breath of fresh air,'' said Valerie Lynn, who hosted a  
coffee for Kasich. ``He's brutally honest. You may not like his 
answers but he has an honest way about giving it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He makes no bones about his ambition. Frustrated by the limits  
of Congress, he says, ``I don't want to be a voice in the chorus 
anymore. I want to be a soloist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's frustrated, too, by the slow pace of getting himself known.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've balanced the budget, helped reform welfare, got all these  
things done,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, I have to tell people 
these things. I wish they knew enough about me that I didn't need 
to tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a proper introduction, he told Hall all about himself. A  
Democrat, Hall says she won't vote for Kasich but at least she now 
knows what he's about. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get votes for enthusiasm,'' she said, ``he wins.''

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although Richard Holbrooke has been cleared of  
alleged ethics violations, his nomination to be U.N. representative 
remains on hold in the Senate. Democratic supporters suggested 
Wednesday the outspoken diplomat had become a target of Republicans 
frustrated with President Clinton's Kosovo policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year after Clinton announced his choice of the Balkans  
troubleshooter for the United Nations post, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee has yet to schedule a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there are any ethical problems with Holbrooke. I  
don't think there ever were,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, 
the committee's senior Democrat. ``There clearly is delay on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he has asked committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.  
for a ``straight answer'' on when hearings might be held. But 
Republicans suggested further study is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and other Senate Republicans note that even though Clinton  
announced the nomination in June 1998, he did not submit it until 
February -- after completion of a joint ethics investigations by the 
Justice and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	A Helms spokesman did not return phone calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Those inquiries largely cleared Holbrooke of earlier allegations  
of conflict of interest violations, although Holbrooke paid $5,000 
to settle civil charges that he broke lobbying laws in his 
private-sector contacts with former State Department colleagues. 
Holbrooke maintained he did nothing wrong and was paying the 
charges simply to end the matter quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Wednesday announced a subsequent  
internal investigation had cleared Holbrooke of allegations that he 
improperly accepted private speaking fees last fall while trying to 
broker a peace deal on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had been accused of improperly accepting private  
speaking fees while serving as a U.S. envoy to the Balkans, 
including a $16,000 fee for a speech on Kosovo last November at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department Inspector General Jacquelyn L.  
Williams-Bridgers said in a statement that the investigation ``did 
not find evidence of a clear violation'' of any federal rules and 
that she had ended the inquiry on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate is  
not to blame for the delay. ``It's been the administration and all 
these investigations,'' he said, adding he hasn't decided whether 
to support Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state and ambassador  
to Germany, negotiated the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the 
war in Bosnia. He is currently a vice president at the investment 
banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Senate aides, and some Republican ones as well,  
suggested privately that Holbrooke's role in the Balkans had become 
a political liability. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Holbrooke's name is often mentioned as a potential  
secretary of state in a Gore administration also doesn't help, the 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said in an interview he didn't know ``whether the  
Republicans' political leadership has decided that (Holbrooke) is a 
scalp. ... It's obvious that he's in trouble,'' but he added, ``I 
still believe he will be confirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke is expected to receive wide bipartisan support if the  
nomination ever makes it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has sat on nominations before. In 1997, the North Carolina  
conservative blocked the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. 
William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be ambassador to Mexico by 
refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Holbrooke associates said Wednesday he was determined to  
continue seeking Senate approval -- and was not considering 
withdrawing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has never signaled opposition to Holbrooke -- nor even any  
intention to stall the nomination. The official explanation has 
been that the committee staff needs more time to review details of 
the ethics investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Republican and Democratic committee sources, speaking  
on the condition of anonymity, said Helms had requested voluminous 
new material from Holbrooke as well as from the State and Justice 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
	One committee official said it seemed unlikely the review would  
be done before Memorial Day, meaning a hearing and Senate vote 
couldn't happen before June. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the key U.N. post has been vacant since former  
representative Bill Richardson left last September to assume his 
present job as energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was Holbrooke, I'd be thinking about getting another  
job,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the 
Brookings Institution. ``He was the guy who got peace in Bosnia. We 
propped up Milosevic. Now, the whole logic by which he proceeded 
has been brought into major doubt. The logic that made him look 
brilliant at one moment now is working against him.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Expected on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After 15 years of U.N.-sponsored talks,  
the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal went over final 
details today of an agreement paving the way for an Aug. 8 ballot 
that will determine whether East Timor remains part of Indonesia or 
becomes independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing ceremony was scheduled late this afternoon in the  
office of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia and Portugal had been expected to wrap up the accord  
for the former Portuguese colony during the last round of 
U.N.-sponsored talks that ended April 23. But Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said he needed government approval on how the 
U.N.-supervised referendum will be conducted and on security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Indonesia's Cabinet announced its approval and when  
Alatas arrived at U.N. headquarters this morning he told reporters: 
``I've come here now with the authorization to sign the text.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said he not only hoped  
that Indonesia was prepared to sign ``but also that Indonesia is 
prepared from now on to abide by an international agreement -- 
that's crucial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has escalated in the half-island territory since the  
Indonesian government -- in a surprise policy reversal -- announced 
in January that it would offer the East Timorese independence if 
they reject wide-ranging autonomy. Indonesia invaded the former 
Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of pro-independence and pro-integration groups signed a  
peace pledge on April 21, along with top Indonesian military 
leaders, but the violence has continued -- and disarming the 
militias remains a key issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian government will be in charge of security in the  
run-up to voting, which has angered pro-independence groups who 
wanted a U.N. peacekeeping force. An undetermined number of U.N. 
police advisers will assist the Indonesian military and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesian militia leaders oppose the U.N. operation and  
have warned that they will fight for their cause. The military has 
provided some weapons and training to the militias, saying they are 
supposed to act as backup for the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Gama has warned that without disarmament of the militias, there  
won't be proper conditions for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas told reporters there is a reference in the text ``that we  
will endeavor to disarm all the factions.'' But he said Indonesia 
could not pledge to the immediate disarmament of the militias, as 
Portugal reportedly demanded, because of ``some difficulties'' -- 
including getting the pro-independence rebels down from the 
mountains and talking to them.

<HEADLINE> Humana Reports Lower Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc. reported Wednesday it had  
sharply lower first-quarter earnings due to higher medical care 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The managed health care company had warned last month that its  
results would come in below expectations. It also announced 
Wednesday a $15 million tentative agreement to settle federal 
government claims that Humana benefited from Medicare premium 
overpayments earlier this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana reported operating earnings of $33 million, or 20 cents  
per share, down from $50 million, or 30 cents per share, in the 
same period a year ago. That was below analyst estimates of 22 
cents per share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results do not include a number of one-time items,  
including a $12 million gain from an asset sale and $90 million to 
cover the previously-announced additional medical care expenses. 
When those items are included, Humana had a net loss of $16 million 
or 10 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock closed down 37 1/2 cents a share at $13.18 3/4 in  
New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting the $90 million extra expense for medical care,  
Humana attributed $50 million of that sum to the higher cost of 
care for Humana members at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. hospitals 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana also set aside $35 million to strengthen its medical  
claim reserve and made a $5 million payment to resolve disputes 
over a previous contract with Columbia/HCA. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium revenues for the recent first quarter totaled $2.4  
billion, up 3 percent from the same period last year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Medicare membership declined 21,300 during the  
quarter, caused primarily by its withdrawal from two Florida 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative settlement of the Medicare premium  
overpayment case, Humana would pay $15 million to the U.S. Justice 
Department and Department of Health and Humana Services. Humana 
said some Medicare enrollees were mistakenly designated as eligible 
for Medicaid, resulting in higher payments to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's largest managed health care companies,  
Humana has about 6.1 million members in 15 states and Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Rider Antics Have Him Riding Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Once again, Portland Trail Blazers guard  
Isaiah Rider strolled in late for work. Again, he was benched for 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	And as he has done on so many occasions during his brief  
Portland career, Rider zoned out on the court after getting into 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And his coach is getting tired of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't start because he was a few minutes late; that's the  
rule,'' Mike Dunleavy said after Tuesday night's 87-81 loss to the 
San Antonio Spurs. Asked if Rider's chronic lateness bothered him, 
Dunleavy said, ``It's always an issue. I'm never happy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Dunleavy and the Blazers' staff deflect questions  
about Rider's perplexing inability to get to the arena on time. But 
when Rider showed up late for the Tuesday's 4 p.m. shootaround, it 
caused a stronger reaction. Not only was it his fifth such 
tardiness this season -- not counting the three games he missed 
because of suspensions -- but it came before one of Portland's most 
important games of the season: against the Spurs, with the No. 1 
seed in the Western Conference on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy told local TV broadcasters before the game that Rider  
wouldn't start. Then after the game, Dunleavy dropped a minor 
bombshell when asked how much longer he'd tolerate the player's 
nonchalance about the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how long we'll continue this way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If this all sounds like the Dennis Rodman sideshow revisited,  
there's more. Rider, after scoring just three points in a 
season-low 16 minutes, left with 6:09 to play complaining of a 
bruised elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's last game in a Lakers uniform came in Portland, when he  
sat out the second half with what he told coaches was a sore left 
elbow. Two days later, Rodman was released after he showed up late 
for practice and said he couldn't find his shoes and socks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's three-year career with the Blazers has been marred by  
brushes with the law over marijuana, unregistered cell phones and 
moving violations -- he has been cited three times for having no 
Oregon driver's license -- as well as a three-game league suspension 
for spitting on a Detroit fan last season. Missed practice times 
and team flights have been less serious offenses, but more 
frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he has been suspended three times, each for one  
game. The suspensions were for leaving the bench in a brawl at 
Charlotte on Feb. 26; going into the stands to settle a dispute 
involving security and Rider's brother at Golden State on March 30; 
and kneeing and shoving Sacramento's Jon Barry on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Rider said he arrived at the shootaround only five  
minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't miss nothing,'' he said. ``I guess people are making  
a point. I mean, five minutes is nothing. Just a matter of putting 
on a uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After entering Tuesday night's game, at the start of the second  
quarter, Rider hit a 3-pointer and made a couple of nice passes. 
But generally he appeared lethargic. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Rider seemed disinterested, Dunleavy said, ``I  
can't say he was disinterested, but he didn't play very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's replacement at shooting guard, Jim Jackson, scored 15  
points. The Blazers are 8-1 when Jackson starts, and 27-13 when 
Rider starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, sounding subdued in the locker room, was asked whether  
Dunleavy's decision to bench him was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nah. It don't matter. We've got another game,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Against the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaurs Grew Wings but Why? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The ancestors of birds may have evolved wings not for flying but  
for running faster, researchers reported today in the journal 
Nature in a study that may answer a key question about the origin 
of flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe birds descended from two-legged  
dinosaurs like Velociraptor, featured in ``Jurassic Park.'' The 
problem has been explaining how the clawed dinosaur forelimbs 
developed into the wings of the first known bird, Archaeopteryx, 
which lived 140 million to 150 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these dinosaurs must have had limbs that resembled  
wings, but not enough to allow them to fly. If they couldn't fly 
with them, why have wings? 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologist Luis Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of Los  
Angeles County and aerodynamic engineer Phillip Burger of the San 
Diego Natural History Museum think they have found the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe the crow-sized Archaeopteryx took off from the  
ground. But it appeared too weak to launch itself from a standing 
start, as most modern birds can, and too slow to gain lift from 
just running. 
</P>
<P>
	So how did it get into the air? In their study, Chiappe and  
Burger calculate that Archaeopteryx could almost quadruple its 
running speed with thrust from flapping its wings. 
</P>
<P>
	They estimate that with a runway of 10 to 15 yards, it could  
achieve the 18 mph takeoff speed in about three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Flightless ancestors of Archaeopteryx could have used  
rudimentary wings to speed up when chasing prey or escaping 
predators, Chiappe said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the theory does not fly with paleo-ornithologist Larry  
Martin of the University of Kansas at Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could increase your ground speed by flapping your  
wings, then I suppose birds that run on the ground would do this. 
As far as I know, there is no modern bird that flaps its wings to 
increase its ground speed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up on a farm. I've chased chickens. I know that when  
they get their wings out, it's about when they're ready to fall -- 
they use it as balance. But I've never seen one flap its wings with 
the idea of increasing its speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiappe disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you go to a chicken farm and chase a chicken very closely,  
the chicken will start flapping its wings and it will run faster,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and some other scientists favor the idea that  
Archaeopteryx and its immediate ancestors lived in trees and 
started flying by jumping off branches. The wings of its 
predecessors, if not good enough for flying, could have helped in 
gliding.

<HEADLINE> NHL May Dissolve Penguins Franchise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins could be out of the  
NHL before they're out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL, though still supportive of Hall of Famer Mario  
Lemieux's takeover bid, plans to fold the franchise and sell it out 
of town if U.S. Bankruptcy Court does not approve Lemieux's 
reorganization plan by May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In paperwork filed Wednesday with Judge Bernard Markovitz, the  
NHL notified the court that the league would move next month to 
disband the Penguins franchise if new ownership isn't in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing was mostly a formality, since the league signaled its  
intentions several weeks ago. But Wednesday's action confirms the 
NHL is worried that the cumbersome pace of the bankruptcy 
proceedings threatens the Penguins' very existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's action came less than 24 hours after the Penguins  
pulled off the biggest upset in their 32-year history, ousting the 
top-seeded New Jersey Devils in Game 7 of their first-round playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Penguins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second  
round, they could still be playing past May 31, the NHL's so-called 
drop dead date for the franchise's fate to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no new revelation in this, but (the NHL) had to ...  
signal its position. We felt it was something we were compelled to 
do,'' said William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fallback plan, as our primary goal and objective is  
to keep the Penguins in Pittsburgh as a viable franchise. But it 
must be done on an appropriate timetable,'' he said. ``The only 
reason it was filed today was to keep it on the right timeline to 
parallel Mario's plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NHL plan, the Penguins' franchise would be terminated  
and would be relocated elsewhere by next season if the Lemieux 
group does not take control this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Penguins can't operate in Pittsburgh next year unless (the  
Lemieux plan goes through),'' Daly said. ``There's no money there 
to operate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Markovitz already has said that cannot occur by May 31.  
Creditors will not have voted on Lemieux's plan by then, and the 
next hearing on the matter isn't scheduled until June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said the league is ``very concerned'' about the June 24  
date. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope we can get this moved up, and whatever necessary must  
be done to get it moved up is done,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major hangups is the so-far unsuccessful effort to  
renegotiate the Penguins' estimated $6 million a year lease with 
the Civic Arena's management firm, Spectacor Management. Spectacor 
acquired the arena rights from former owner Howard Baldwin for $24 
million in 1991 and so far has been unwilling to alter its 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials sat in last week's talks with SMG and the  
Lemieux group and, Daly said, ``Negotiations continue.'' The league 
also is talking daily with the Lemieux group. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL wants the Penguins' situation settled soon so it can  
begin formulating the 1999-2000 schedule and, if a reorganization 
plan is accepted, the Penguins can make payroll decisions and begin 
selling tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have real deadlines here,'' Daly said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux has raised about $50 million to operate the team and pay  
off creditors -- some of them, including former teammates such as 
Luc Robitaille, with only pennies on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say his revenue projections are overly optimistic,  
especially those foreseeing an $8 million profit in the first year 
of operation. The Penguins expect to lose $10 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Lemieux group met Wednesday with prospective  
investor Mark Cuban, a Penguins fan and the founder of 
Broadcast.com, the Internet site sold recently to Yahoo! for $6.08 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban's group, which includes brother Brian Cuban, a Dallas  
lawyer, has proposed buying some or all of the Penguins and wants 
to keep the team in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very enjoyable discussions,'' said Chuck Greenberg,  
one of Lemieux's lawyers. ``They were good meetings and we will 
talk again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a group of creditors sued the Penguins' owners on Tuesday,  
seeking about $16 million they allege the owners took from the team 
during the year before the franchise declared bankruptcy. Named in 
the suit are Roger Marino, Baldwin and Morris Belzberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for bankruptcy in October.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to money the three owners received, the lawsuit is  
seeking the rights to a minor league hockey team signed over to 
Baldwin in 1996 that is now worth $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Walker, an attorney for the unsecured creditors in the  
case, said the plaintiffs would try to unearth documentation 
showing that the owners misused team money. He said the group has 
informally investigated enough to sue, and their probe will 
continue in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsecured creditors are owed $77 million but have fewer rights  
than the Internal Revenue Service and creditors, such as banks, 
that hold Penguins collateral.

<HEADLINE> BYU Volleyball Hit With Illnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All-Americans Ossie Antonetti and Ryan  
Millar's are ill and that could derail top-seeded Brigham Young's 
hopes for its first NCAA men's volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonetti and Millar missed Wednesday's practice as the Cougars  
(28-1) prepared for fourth-seeded Penn State (22-12) Thursday in 
the NCAA tournament's opening semifinal at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. 
Second-seeded Long Beach State will face third-seeded 
Indiana-Purdue of Fort Wayne (23-3) in the other semifinal. The 
winners will play for the championship Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Millar was suffering from ``intense intestinal distress,''  
before Saturday's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament 
championship match against Southern California. Millar received an 
injection from a team physician before the match and had 14 block 
assists in a 14-16, 15-9, 15-8, 15-11 victory over the Trojans that 
gave the Cougars an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonetti had similar symptoms Wednesday, coach Carl McGown  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of overcoming the bug, we think Ryan's ahead, but it  
doesn't matter really how sick they are (Thursday), they're going 
to have to get in the match,'' McGown said. ``We don't have 
contingencies for those two guys. Play is the contingency plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-7 senior middle blocker from Lancaster, Calif., Millar  
was selected Wednesday a first-team All-American for the third time 
by the American Volleyball Coaches Association. He is the national 
leader in hitting percentage and blocking average. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonetti is a 6-1 outside hitter from Puerto Rico and was also  
selected a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Antonetti and Millar's illnesses, Brigham Young was  
expected to mount one of the strongest challenges to California's 
men's volleyball dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three schools outside Los Angeles County have won the  
tournament, which has been held since 1970. In 1994, Penn State 
became the only non-California school to win the title. San Diego 
State (1973) and Stanford (1997) were the other non-Los Angeles 
County champions. 
</P>
<P>
	A relative latecomer to Division I competition, Brigham Young is  
making its first appearance in the final four. The Cougars began 
play on the Division I level in 1990 after winning three national 
club titles and finishing second once from 1986-89. However, they 
had a difficult transition to the Division I level, with 5-22 and 
2-26 records in their first two seasons. Brigham Young had a 
winning record in its fourth season and finished in the final Top 
10 five of the next six seasons.

<HEADLINE> Bill Might Change Business of Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proponents of a bill that would reform the  
business side of boxing are looking for victory in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act was approved  
Wednesday by the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation 
Committee. Last year, the full Senate passed virtually the same 
bill, but the House never took up the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield fight will provide  
some additional pressure,'' said committee chairman Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., referring to the disputed draw at the heavyweight 
unification title bout at Madison Square Garden in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would help protect boxers from exploitation by  
promoters and managers by requiring disclosure of the complex money 
trail that often accompanies big-time fights. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also set specific guidelines for contracts between  
fighters and their promoters or managers and require sanctioning 
bodies, such as the WBA, WBC and IBF, to establish ``objective and 
consistent written criteria'' for ranking boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is a passionate supporter of boxing and a longtime voice  
of reform in the Senate, but no one in the House comes close to 
matching his enthusiasm. Last year, the measure never made it out 
of the House's Commerce Committee, headed by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked to Chairman Bliley, and we're hopeful that he  
will take up the legislation,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action by the Senate committee came on the same day New York  
Gov. George Pataki introduced a series of reforms aimed at 
improving the officiating of fights in New York, site of the 
Lewis-Holyfield bout. 
</P>
<P>
	One reform, effective immediately, requires judges to submit  
disclosures in sworn applications. They include a credit check, 
notification of pending litigation, such as bankruptcy or criminal 
proceedings, and any financial ties to the boxers, promoter, venue 
or television company. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a 2000 presidential aspirant, co-authored legislation in  
1996 that strengthened health and safety measures of state boxing 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	He has since been pushing for reforms on the business side of  
the sport. He's held hearings in which he's berated officials of 
various sanctioning bodies for their ratings systems and cited what 
he called ``offensive'' contracts between promoters and fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters Don King and Bob Arum declined to appear before  
McCain. Several fighters testified in support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, ailing from Parkinson's syndrome, appeared before McCain's  
committee last week, but did not speak. The boxing great earlier 
wrote a letter to McCain in which he called the Lewis-Holyfield 
bout ``the biggest fix in fight history.''

<HEADLINE>  Woman Dies As Twisters Hit Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- People who fled neighborhoods that suffered  
the worst damage in Oklahoma's deadliest tornadoes in five decades 
started returning today, many of them finding only rubble where 
their homes had stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of homes had been destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
	Police had kept the hardest-hit areas of southwestern Oklahoma  
City off limits until today. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, hundreds of cars lined up bumper to bumper at a  
police checkpoint, where they had to show identification and prove 
that they lived in the neighborhood before they could be allowed 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned residents of some other areas had been allowed in  
Tuesday to search for precious mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornadoes killed at least 43 people in Oklahoma and Kansas  
on Monday. More twisters swarmed across parts of Texas and Arkansas 
on Tuesday, killing one more person. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds more were injured as entire communities were reduced to  
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Destruction was most severe in Oklahoma County, which includes  
Oklahoma City and half a dozen other communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's strictly just a guess but we are thinking between 2,000  
and 3,000 houses (demolished). I don't have any estimates on 
businesses,'' David Van Nostrand, director of the Oklahoma County 
Emergency Management Office, said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,500 businesses and homes in Kansas were destroyed or  
heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those with major losses from Monday's storm was Jon  
Hansen, the assistant Oklahoma City fire chief who also was the 
fire department spokesman during the downtown federal building 
bombing. He lost most of his house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably have to destroyed. I can't live there again.  
But it is not as bad as some of the others guys around here,'' 
Hansen said. ``I am really fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the wreckage on Tuesday, Hansen said, he was able to rescue  
his daughter's gold fish and gerbil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said the search for victims continued, and acknowledged  
that there was only an outside chance anyone else would be found 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were listed as still missing in Bridge Creek, a  
small community near the city of Chickasha, 45 miles southwest of 
Oklahoma City, where 11 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of Monday's outbreak of 76 twisters, one that was at least a  
half-mile wide struck parts of Oklahoma City with wind estimated at 
more than 260 mph, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration said. The tornado was classified an F5, the most 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	It carved a 19-mile gash through the area, killing at least 38  
people. Tornadoes in Kansas killed five people, including a 
month-old baby in Haysville. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary estimate from the Southwestern Insurance  
Information Service, an industry trade group, said insured losses 
in Oklahoma City could reach $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But Van Nostrand disputed that. ``We probably will never give  
you a dollar figure simply because we can't be sure it's 
accurate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem with locating and assessing the damage, Van Nostrand  
said, is that the tornado destroyed virtually all of the street 
signs and addresses in the affected neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeastern Texas late Tuesday, a tornado damaged about 150  
buildings and injured at least 14 people in the town of DeKalb. A 
woman was killed in neighboring Titus County. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I remember is that the lights went off and the  
roof came off,'' said James Sckittone, 18. ``Everybody started 
crying and praying. It looked like an atomic bomb fell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Arkansas, thunderstorms also spawned tornadoes,  
large hail and heavy rain Tuesday, leaving thousands of people 
without electricity. Several houses and a church were damaged. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's tornado outbreak was the nation's deadliest since 90  
people were killed in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario on May 31, 
1985. It was the deadliest to hit Oklahoma since 1947, when 113 
people were killed in Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and James Lee Witt, head of the  
Federal Emergency Management Agency, surveyed the damage Tuesday. 
President Clinton, who has declared 11 Oklahoma counties disaster 
areas, is expected to visit the stricken area Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Midwest City senior center, Belinda Bentley of the  
Heartland Rescue Care Team loaded up cases of bottled water. She 
said many of the businesses that have donated food and supplies 
also helped out after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again it's Oklahoma, and we're all working together,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Universal Music Plans Online Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the music industry's latest, and biggest,  
step into the digital world, Universal Music Group is developing 
technology that would allow it to sell and distribute recordings on 
the Internet ahead of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal, the world's largest music company, entered into a  
partnership with a California-based software company, InterTrust 
Technologies Corp., to develop a system that would allow customers 
to download music to their computers in a secure format that 
prevents mass copying. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the deal, Universal hopes to begin distributing music  
over the Internet by the Christmas shopping season. That could move 
it ahead of the music industry's Secure Digital Music Initiative, 
an effort to establish a technological standard for portable 
Walkman-like devices that record and play copyright-protected 
digital music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to try and find out what the consumers want and what  
they're willing to pay for,'' Larry Kenswil, head of electronic 
commerce at Universal, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing for sure is people want to download music,'' he  
said. ``It is a thriving legitimate market with some small 
independents and there's a big illegitimate market that is 
thriving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pact with InterTrust was announced on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Universal's announcement is significant because it marks the  
first attempt by a major music company to go digital. Universal can 
offer music by some of the world's biggest stars. The company's 
roster of artists includes Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Boyz II Men, 
Nine Inch Nails and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's move underscores the music industry's difficult  
search for a way to take advantage of the Internet and, at the same 
time, curb piracy that, Kenswil said, costs companies about $5 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The legitimate music market is worth about $40 billion a year  
and a report by Forrester Research said digital distribution of 
music will be worth $1.1 billion by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Piracy thrived before the Internet, but the development of an  
audio format called MP3 has posed an especially vexing problem. MP3 
technology allows for the creation of near CD-quality music that 
can be easily downloaded from the Web. Anyone with the right 
equipment can record music from a CD onto a computer and then give 
it away to millions of people by posting it on a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another challenge comes from Web sites like MP3.Com, which use  
MP3 technology legally to allow unknown artists to sell their music 
via the Web, thus bypassing the control of music companies. Songs 
by most major artists have not been legally available for digital 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology companies, including Sony, Microsoft and IBM  
are competing to develop secure systems for digital transmission of 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Universal-InterTrust system won't rely on MP3, but will use  
a different technology that will include safeguards to deter 
pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can expect to see more and more of companies making these  
kinds of announcements as the industry turns from emotion to 
action,'' said Ron Rappaport, an analyst with Zona Research. 
``There's been a lot of whining and screaming over MP3, but if the 
music industry had moved faster three years ago, they wouldn't be 
in this position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Universal is not breaking ranks with the Digital Music  
Initiative, Kenswil said. Universal will continue to participate in 
the project and will comply with whatever standard the group 
approves. Participants hope to announce that standard sometime next 
month, but the timetable for development of the technology into a 
commercial product is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Another analyst, Mark Hardie with Forrester Research Inc., said  
companies such as Universal are eager to start doing business on 
the Internet and aren't willing to wait for the initiative to 
complete its work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a break from their stance last December when all of the  
companies got up on a stage and said MP3 is bad and people are 
pirating our music and we're going to launch an initiative to study 
it a year,'' Hardie said. ``I said in December they're not going to 
wait, they're going to break ranks, and they are.''

<HEADLINE> Don't Bury the Penguins Just Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins aren't extinct yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins were supposed to be gone by now, not just from the  
NHL playoffs but possibly the league itself, a bankrupt franchise 
with a wealth of scorers but no money to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins defied the odds -- and their creditors -- with a  
remarkable first-round upset of the New Jersey Devils achieved 
mostly by their resolve to win amid the organization's own 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at least until their conference semifinal series begins  
Friday in Toronto, the Penguins can forget their off-ice troubles 
and the memories of past playoff failures and enjoy the biggest 
upset in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	And they can celebrate life. After all, the NHL can't fold a  
franchise while it still is playing, can it? 
</P>
<P>
	``I had great moments with Ronnie (Francis) and Mario (Lemieux),  
but this is my biggest moment as a player,'' said Jaromir Jagr, who 
succeeded the two as captain and thrived in the role. ``People will 
judge you by how you do as a captain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone in the NHL questioned Jagr's leadership ability and  
courage -- and many did -- they no longer can after he got off the 
trainer's table to lead the Penguins to victories in Games 6 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one day after he could barely skate because of a painful  
groin injury that kept him out of four games, Jagr scored the tying 
and winning goals in the Penguins' win-or-be-gone 3-2 victory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in pain again Tuesday, but set up the final two goals as  
the Penguins won 4-2 to advance into the second round of the 
playoffs for the first time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins became the fourth No. 8 seed to oust a No. 1 seed  
since the NHL adopted its current playoff format in 1994. They also 
will be underdogs in the next round against Toronto, but not as 
overwhelmingly so as in the Jersey series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a high-scoring series,'' the  
Penguins' Matthew Barnaby said. ``It's going to be a lot of 
up-and-down hockey. I don't think there will be that much 
hitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a scenario, though not likely -- has there ever been an NHL  
playoff series without much hitting? -- might favor the Penguins' 
stable of scorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as many teams do, the Devils often seemed to forget that  
Jagr isn't the Penguins' only threat. Martin Straka had six goals 
in the series, the most of any NHL player in the first round, and 
Alexei Kovalev had 10 points despite missing the first game with an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Penguins wouldn't be here without Jagr, and they know  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir wouldn't let us lose,'' Kovalev said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is credited as the man who saved hockey in Pittsburgh,  
and he is trying to do so again by extracting the franchise from 
bankruptcy proceedings. But give Jagr a save, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I didn't think we could win the series without him, and  
that was pretty prophetic,'' said coach Kevin Constantine, who was 
holed up Wednesday pouring over video of the Maple Leafs. ``We were 
playing good (without Jagr) but not that good. We won two games 
before he returned, and that's a testimony to the other players. 
But we were two minutes away from elimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr tied Game 6 by scoring with just 2:12 left -- not just in  
the game, but maybe in the Penguins' very existence -- and then won 
it in overtime. The breathless comeback clearly swung the momentum 
the Penguins' way, and the Devils subsequently were a desperate, 
unconfident team in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But no desperate than the Penguins. Even as the playoffs  
continue, the NHL is filing documents in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
outlining plans for the dissolution of the franchise should 
Lemieux's reorganization plan fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants the situation resolved by May 31, when the  
Penguins might still be playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is awful special, based on some of the adversity our team  
went through,'' Constantine said. ``We're still hanging in there.''

	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	April 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on gun control:  
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence or calculation, Americans may finally have the  
opportunity to engage in a meaningful debate about guns. It's about 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has unveiled another package of gun control  
proposals. In Congress, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has 
introduced legislation to further regulate gun sales via the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative to undertaking a politically dicey debate on  
gun control, Republican leaders in Congress said they want to lead 
a ``national conversation'' on youth and culture. This shouldn't be 
an either/or situation. Both debates are needed -- on the 
president's package of gun control measures and on social factors 
(the American culture of violence, the Internet, the media, 
parent/child relationships, gangs, etc.) that have some bearing on 
the juvenile killings. ...

</P>
<P>
	The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., on Colorado shootings:  
</P>
<P>
	The number of students making direct threats or implied threats  
of violence has increased tremendously since two students went on a 
rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton. Or, at least, people 
are more sensitized to the threats. ... The problem for school 
officials and law enforcement is, they have no magic formula that 
allows them to sort out which children are really dangerous and 
which ones are just mouthing off. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We can't know for sure, and even if it is a prank, it can create  
quite a panic. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Lots of people blame video games and movies for desensitizing  
our young people. Maybe they're right. ... Since firearms seem to 
be the instrument of choice for the violence, the availability of 
guns takes much of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students have made bombs, and the easy access to plans  
for bombs, especially over the Internet, has been cited as a 
contributing factor. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We strive to find simplistic answers so we can adopt them and  
move on. The fact is, these murderous youth are not the norm, not 
by a wide margin, and we must not forget that. But the youths who 
want to use threats against others, even as a prank, need to 
recognize that we can't tell the difference.

	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on mandated checks on gun show  
sales: 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the people milling around an Albuquerque  
gun show recently had no more interest in committing violent crime 
than do collectors of model trains. But the merchandise on the 
tables is from Smith &AMP; Wesson, not Lionel, and the table talk is 
likely to be about controls that may be imposed on gun show 
transactions in the wake of the Littleton, Colo., bloodbath. 
</P>
<P>
	The stated goal behind the creeping incrementalism of gun  
regulation is to close off avenues for criminals or the mentally 
ill to obtain guns. Each tightening of the rules seems to create a 
loophole for every opportunity eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Clinton administration, increases in fees and the  
requirement to maintain a place of business have raised the 
overhead of licensed gun dealers who travel the gun show circuit. 
As a result, many have stepped across the line separating the 
categories of licensed dealer selling from his inventory and 
collector selling from his collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The unintended consequence of tighter regulation of sellers is  
less scrutiny of buyers. Licensed dealers must by federal law 
conduct background checks; collectors may sell without the 
``Brady'' check. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Instant checks can be done on all sales at gun shows and would  
be no more onerous than what currently is required of licensed 
dealers. ... 
</P>
<P>
	And no gun-control measure will hit what ideally should be the  
target. People who plan to break the law and want a gun to use in 
the crime will have few compunctions about ignoring any gun-control 
laws that stand in their way.

	The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, on the flag amendment:  
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives keep telling us that the only way to protect the  
U.S. flag is to amend the Bill of Rights to criminalize flag 
desecration. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag, they say, is such a potent symbol that it cannot be  
allowed to be burnt or trampled or otherwise disrespected. 
</P>
<P>
	Many proponents of this amendment are well-intentioned -- members  
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars or other former soldiers who 
learned their reverence for the flag under hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, though, are cynical politicians eager to paint their  
opponents as unpatriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	But it matters not whether the motives behind this movement are  
noble or crass. The idea of protecting this symbol of liberty by 
curtailing liberty is simply wrong.

	The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun, on embargo sanctions:  
</P>
<P>
	As a tool of foreign policy, economic and trade sanctions only  
rarely work. Nonetheless, according to one study, the United States 
has sanctions in one form or another against 26 countries that 
contain about half the world's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely, the United States has no more grievances with the rest  
of the world than other countries, but the United States is by far 
the greatest user of unilateral sanctions, the least effective kind 
of restriction on trade and investment. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a low-key voice of common  
sense on foreign policy, proposed a comprehensive review of 
sanctions. His bill, co-authored with Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill, would 
lift those that are outdated, counterproductive or simply 
ineffectual. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions are a vital and necessary tool of both foreign policy  
and moral outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the present structure ... has become hopelessly unwieldy.  
Nobody designed it that way. It just happened. The Lugar-Crane 
sanctions reform bill will make it unhappen.

	The Seattle Times, on Kosovo debate:  
</P>
<P>
	Votes in the House of Representatives reflect the broad  
ambivalence across America about U.S. involvement in NATO's Kosovo 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is doing its job when it challenges the Clinton  
administration with vigorous debate on the U.S. role in allied 
bombing campaigns and the prospects for sending in ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages from Congress to the nation and the Clinton  
administration are not crystal clear, which makes continued 
discussion all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
	House members voted to bar use of U.S. ground troops. Forty-five  
Democrats joined Republicans to approve the prohibition. Sixteen 
GOP representatives voted with Democrats to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution in support of allied bombing failed on a tie.  
Thirty-one Republicans and 26 Democrats abandoned the party-line 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	On one level, the Republicans are trying to draw distinctions  
between themselves, the Democrats and the commander in chief. But 
it is the ambiguous nature of this conflict that convictions are 
not yet set in stone. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In the earliest moments of NATO's emergency response to the  
bloodshed and ethnic cleansing of Albanian Kosovars, Congress 
wisely followed Clinton's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the prospects loom for a wider conflict, especially one  
involving ground troops, it is just as appropriate for Congress to 
demand more information and more consultation from the White House.

	The Greenville (S.C.) News, on curbing obscenity in e-mail:  
</P>
<P>
	Finally the U.S. Supreme Court has settled an Internet smut case  
with both clarity and common sense. It ruled that obscenity in 
electronic mail is the same as obscenity by postal carrier, and it 
upheld the constitutionality of a congressional ban on sending 
obscene material by e-mail with the intent to ``annoy, abuse, 
threaten or harass another person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a difficult area of law because of First Amendment  
implications for free speech, and because much of the public is 
appalled at pornography and wants harsh steps taken against it as 
well as its more obnoxious form that's legally proscribed obscene. 
</P>
<P>
	One would think there are only isolated electronic assaults of  
obscenity going on, but the extraordinary expansion of e-mail 
traffic in the unregulated world of cyberspace has given birth to a 
niche of commercial trafficking in abuse by obscene e-mail. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Given the wondrously explosive and innovative use of personal  
computer communications and its seemingly limitless potential for 
learning and commerce, no regulation is preferred. But the high 
court ruling that applies the obscenity standard to (make criminal) 
abusive and obscene e-mail seems plainly a justified exception.

	Ohio lawmakers now say taxpayers ... may get a tax cut next

<P>
	House Republicans submitted a state budget plan that doesn't  
devote the entire budget surplus to school construction and

	That plan defies Gov. Bob Taft, who early this year announced  
that he wanted the whole surplus to go to schools, in an effort to 
satisfy court orders on public education funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Their challenge is good news for Ohio taxpayers, who seem  
overtaxed compared to other states.

craft a plan to fund schools, even though the state still imposes

<P>
	According to a new survey of supermarket buying habits by the

percent of the national average in canned vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Happily, healthily, the San Francisco Bay Area was at the bottom  
of the list, consuming only 68 percent of the national average.

Pittsburgh also finished near the bottom in consumption of salads.

</P>
<P>
	We will toast our culinary good judgment with a fine cabernet.  
San Francisco was at 324 percent of the national average in 
supermarket wine purchases, No. 1 by far. This region's edge in

	The Independent, London, on Tony Blair and Kosovo war:  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Blair has grown into this war. After a hesitant start, he  
now positively relishes the role of the hard man of the Balkans 
campaign, the philosopher of a new concept to world peace and, now, 
the commander-in-chief reviewing the troops in the field and the 
refugees on the border. 
</P>
<P>
	War gets modern politicians that way. It inspired Maggie  
Thatcher in the Falklands and it enthused George Bush in the Gulf. 
But politicians should beware of the pleasures of the heady moral 
fervor that goes with war. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... The British prime minister has a way with fine words. But  
too often in this war -- over the refugees, the cost and the 
ultimate likelihood of a ground war -- he is using them not to 
clarify intentions but to skate over the differences between 
reality and emotion.

	Le Temps, Geneva, Switzerland, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The war is imperceptibly changing its nature. After six weeks of  
bombings the allies, dismayed by the resistance of their adversary, 
are thinking less and less about total war. A conquest of Kosovo by 
NATO troops no longer appears to be the order of the day. 
Discussions with Belgrade have started again and will no doubt 
intensify. Attention is focused on the carousel of diplomats and 
emissaries from all sides, rather than on the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	This evolution demonstrates that the negotiated solution, which  
was put aside in the hope of the Yugoslav side capitulating, 
appears to be possible again. For many westerners however ... just 
the idea of negotiating with Slobodan Milosevic appears politically 
dangerous. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But even if Milosevic claims victory (and he will), we must  
remember that this is Kosovo's war. It began because of Kosovo, it 
can only end for Kosovo. Peace cannot be conceded, but it must be 
possible once the refugees can return to a Kosovo with real 
autonomy guaranteed by the presence of international military 
forces. ...

<P>
	Il Giornale, Milan, Italy, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The objective of NATO's mission in Yugoslavia was not defined at  
the beginning, but has evolved with the development of events. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to the Rambouillet talks, the scope of the military  
dissuasion was to stop violence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic was not a  
target, but one of the parties invited to reach a compromise. He 
still was not a target during the first month of the war, as the 
military pressure was aimed at his surrender, not necessarily at 
destroying his regime. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently NATO has been wondering whether they should make a  
third step, aiming at the fall of Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	First of all, punishing Milosevic is necessary to dissuade  
others from following the same path of violent nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this strictly political point would be a motive. ... Onto  
that political foundation, can be added good economic motivations. 
</P>
<P>
	The future development of the area would be jeopardized if  
Milosevic was to stay in power, after the conflict ends. Fearing 
new instability, investors wouldn't spend money to rebuild Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Balkans have an enormous growth potential. But the essential  
condition to achieve a positive outcome is to remove Milosevic.

border supposed to return to, once the war ends? ... There's not 
only a moral imperative to offer the fleeing Kosovars a generous 
acceptance in Europe, but also a social duty to care for the people 
for whom one is waging war. What happens to the Kosovo refugees 
will show how seriously the West believes its ideals.

	The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, on Jesse Jackson in  
Yugoslavia: 
</P>
<P>
	The release of three American soldiers captured by Serb forces  
five weeks ago is wonderful news for those immediately concerned, 
but has hardly any greater meaning without a wider peace in 
Yugoslavia. Of that, there is no clear sign yet, and what small 
hopeful indications there are have little or nothing to do with the 
extraordinary diplomacy of the Rev. Jesse Jackson that secured the 
release of the three U.S. soldiers. Without a wider peace, it is 
unlikely that any similar good news can be expected about the two 
Australian aid workers, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, arrested by 
the Serb authorities as spies and detained for more than a month. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the uneasiness of the American people at the deepening  
U.S. involvement in a war in which air power has so far failed in 
its first objective, there is no quick exit for the United States. 
For one thing, the commitment of its European allies to seeing the 
war through makes it very difficult now for the Untied States to 
retreat into isolationism. Whatever the domestic opposition to a 
prolonged war, the Clinton administration is right to warn -- not 
only President Milosevic but also the American people -- that the 
war will continue for a long time to come, if necessary. ...

demanded.

open hatred. And of a perverse kind that targets people and 
communities for the color of their skin, and the way they choose to

this heinous crime lets right-wing radicals off the hook. ...

it was the things that they stand for that have evidently inspired

</P>
<P>
	During a ceremony in Hanoi on April 30, Cambodia formally joined  
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as its 10th 
member. ... Membership in ASEAN is an important step in Cambodia's 
efforts to rejoin the international community. But the organization 
as a whole is in no mood to celebrate the occasion. Since the onset 
of the Asian currency crisis in 1997, ASEAN members have been 
preoccupied with their own problems and have shown less enthusiasm 
for expanding the grouping. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapid economic growth created the conditions that enabled ASEAN  
to open up to new members, but it also exacerbated economic 
inequalities in the region and focused more attention on the wide 
disparities in political development, democratization and human 
rights records. Since the growth of the economies of Southeast Asia 
has ground to a halt, these disparities have become a burden for 
ASEAN as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency crisis struck just as ASEAN was beginning to assert  
its leadership, forcing its members to concentrate on economic 
recovery. ASEAN may now have to postpone its plans to inaugurate 
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) until beyond the year 2002. Since 
increasing its membership to 10 states will not guarantee a larger 
voice for ASEAN, it is imperative that the organization concentrate 
on narrowing the political and economic disparities between its 
member states.

<HEADLINE> Oil Leases Sold in Alaska Wilds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Despite protests and a lawsuit by  
environmentalists, the government on Wednesday sold commercial oil 
drilling leases in a vast wilderness reserve set aside by President 
Warren G. Harding in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids totaling about $105 million were accepted for 134 tracts in  
the northeast corner of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, 
which was established on 23 million acres to ensure that the Navy 
would always have enough fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Richfield Co. and a partner, Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,  
were the most prolific bidders in the first sale of drilling leases 
in 15 years on the land 75 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Arco and 
Anadarko won exploration and production rights to 93 tracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lease sales in the 1980s were a flop, with only one dry well  
drilled, in part because exploration techniques were relatively 
primitive and the means to get oil to market underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, high-tech seismic exploration using powerful computers to  
locate underground reserves has companies interested again, and 
branches of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline now are closer to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to environmental concerns, Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt set a number of stipulations on the sale to protect key 
areas. He placed 600,000 acres off-limits to leasing, and 
restricted surface activity on another 900,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, The Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups that  
fought to block the lease sale, contends the Interior Department 
didn't put permanent protections in place to keep oil activities 
away from wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen temporary protections fall by the wayside before,''  
said Sara Callaghan, a Sierra Club spokeswoman. ``In less than 30 
years of North Slope development we have hundreds of miles of 
roads, pipelines and toxic waste sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The land that attracted the highest bids, up to $3.6 million for  
some parcels, is adjacent to Arco's 365-million barrel Alpine 
field, discovered in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 1996 announcement of Alpine's discovery that prompted  
Gov. Tony Knowles and the industry to begin lobbying the Interior 
Department for another shot at finding oil in the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Babbitt agreed, opening the reserve's northeast  
corner to leasing. The decision sparked a lawsuit and protests from 
environmentalists who argued the reserve's wetlands are important 
waterfowl breeding grounds that can't withstand oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco joined Chevron Corp. and Phillips Petroleum on some of  
its 25 winning bids and with Phillips alone on others. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and the federal government will split the money from  
the lease sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning bidders now head to the field for exploratory  
drilling they hope will confirm their suspicions about the 
potential for oil. It likely will take at least five years before 
any commercial production begin, said Kevin Meyers, Arco Alaska's 
president.

<HEADLINE> IOC Clears Kim, but Not Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic leaders are extending their  
investigation of one high-ranking official and closing the case 
against another caught in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee's executive board said it  
had ``no new element'' of evidence to justify further action 
against Kim Un-yong, a board member and international sports 
power-broker. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board said there was enough new information to extend  
its investigation of a second leading member, Australia's Phil 
Coles, who like Kim received a severe warning from an earlier 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles could face expulsion from the IOC if the investigation  
finds he violated more rules. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel was appointed to report its latest findings  
by June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think and I hope this case will be settled'' by the IOC's  
June session in Seoul, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an executive board member from Australia, said a  
decision could come sooner than that, adding that Coles might be 
called to appear before the new panel, made up of board members 
Keba Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz and Marc Hodler. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim risked expulsion if it was proved he knew that Salt Lake  
City bidders helped pay for his son's salary at a 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board appointed Mbaye, Anita DeFrantz of the  
United States and Switzerland's Marc Hodler to conduct further 
investigations of the Coles case. 
</P>
<P>
	But after receiving new information on Kim, the IOC's top  
officials decided that ``no new element at present justifies going 
beyond the severe warning,'' IOC vice president Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was cited originally for accepting travel and  
accommodation perks from Salt Lake City. He was put under renewed 
scrutiny after his ex-wife claimed representatives of Athens' 
unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics gave the couple jewelry 
worth $6,000. He consistently denied the claims and refused to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence emerged Tuesday, when Australian media said Salt  
Lake City had obtained confidential briefing notes by Coles on how 
other IOC members could be trusted to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said this all along, there are certain people out to  
get me and I am going to fight them,'' said Coles, who said he had 
made weekly and sometimes daily reports on IOC members during 
Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent that back to the Sydney office and that is the last I  
heard of it,'' he said. Up to 40 people would have had access to 
the documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Salt Lake Olympic leader Tom Welch told The Salt Lake  
Tribune that Salt Lake and Sydney were ``pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sydney was really helpful to us,'' he said. ``When they'd have  
events (to entertain IOC members), Sydney would invite us. What 
people don't realize is that Salt Lake had become part of the 
Olympic family. We had been around so long, we weren't just a bid 
city any more. We cooperated with a lot of cities and talked 
process, including Beijing,'' which lost to Sydney by two votes in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coles never gave me any information that was inappropriate,''  
Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the allegations will be subject to ``a single investigation  
and a single decision,'' Mbaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had profiles done on IOC members before, ad nauseam,''  
Gosper said. ``I think the real issue here is how these files ended 
up in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to comment on what fate might await Coles.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act with facts, not with information,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As well as completion of the Coles investigation, June will see  
the first meeting of the IOC 2000 commission, whose 80 members were 
unveiled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform panel, which Samaranch originally said would have  
20-24 members, was set up in March to help the committee rebuild 
after the biggest scandal in its 105-year history. Ten IOC members 
have resigned or been expelled.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Holds Up Sydney Games Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The Sydney Olympics schedule will not be  
finalized until officials clear up problems with delegates 
implicated in the bribery scandal, the president of the 
International Amateur Athletics Federation said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without our approval, the schedule does not exist,'' Primo  
Nebiolo said. ``The problem is with the technical delegates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delegate Charles Mukora of Kenya has been implicated in the IOC  
scandal involving cities' bids to hold the games. He could be 
replaced at the Federation's council meeting in Seville just before 
the world championships, Aug. 20-29. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said  
that economic benefits guaranteed to cities staging the Olympics 
had encouraged ``very aggressive promotional campaigns that have 
surpassed normal ethnical limits,'' the Spanish news agency Efe 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Madrid, Samaranch said the IOC ``has grown old and  
needs to be renovated,'' but insisted that this year's corruption 
scandal had been exaggerated and would be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch later joined Nebiolo and King Juan Carlos at the  
exhibition soccer game between Spain and Croatia to mark the 
inauguration of the Seville stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo denied reports that the IAAF's refusal to approve the  
Sydney Olympic schedule was because of concern over the 1,500 
meters swimming final and the 100 meter track final being run at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we be concerned when 10,000 people will go to see  
the swimming and 110,000 will go to see the 100 meters?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A man arrested for selling a handgun  
used by the Columbine High School killers is trying to work out a 
deal with prosecutors as investigators pursue a potential third 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Columbine students at the school during the April 20 attack  
have identified a potential third suspect, Sheriff John Stone said 
in today's Denver Post. He did not identify that person. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was quite possibly one other person shooting,'' Stone  
said. ``We do have witness statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a lawyer for Mark Manes said his client sold the  
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and joined 
them on shooting excursions in the Colorado mountains in the month 
before the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Manes -- a former Columbine student who was booked this week  
on suspicion of providing a handgun to a minor -- knew nothing of 
the impending massacre, lawyer Robert Ransome said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said he is trying to negotiate a deal with prosecutors.  
The charge against Manes carries a maximum six-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, stormed the school with bombs and  
guns, killing 12 students and a teacher and wounding 23 others 
before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's remarks about a possible third attacker marked the  
latest turn in a case which has seen authorities appear at odds 
with each other over developments in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dave Thomas said the sheriff has not told him of any  
witness statements from students who named a third gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Stone's office is conducting the investigation. Maybe  
they've come up with something I don't know about,'' Thomas told 
the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the same sheriff's deputy  
who investigated a van break-in by the two gunmen last year also 
received a complaint not long afterward that they were setting off 
pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the deputy, Mark Miller, wrote a report on the pipe  
bomb complaint, a juvenile court magistrate gave the two a form of 
probation for the break-in. 
</P>
<P>
	The magistrate, John DeVita, told the Times he would not have  
allowed probation had he known of the complaint, which also 
included information that Harris had posted three death threats 
against a classmate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment by the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	The arrest of Manes, 22, was the first connected to the attack.  
Although he joined Harris and Klebold on three shooting excursions 
in the month prior to April 20, Manes knew nothing about their 
plot, Ransome said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got to that point, thinking what they might do with  
it,'' he said. ``It just never crossed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome would not say whether Manes had sold the two teen-agers  
ammunition, how much he charged for the gun, where they went 
shooting, who else accompanied them or what Manes may have known 
about the law involving gun sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the attack, the student gunmen used the TEC DC-9 purchased  
from Manes in late February and three guns -- two shotguns and a 
rifle -- that had been legally purchased by Klebold's girlfriend, 
Robyn Anderson, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Colorado law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can  
furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. Investigators have 
characterized Miss Anderson as a witness, not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are also performing ballistics tests to determine  
which weapons fired the fatal shots; Manes could face more serious 
charges if the TEC DC-9 was used to kill someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes bought the pistol at a gun show last fall, Ransome said.  
</P>
<P>
	``A third party knew Mark had this certain weapon and also knew  
Eric and Dylan were looking for weapons. He put them together,'' 
the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the middleman was a pizza shop employee who  
worked with Harris and Klebold.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Entertainment Teaches Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators chastised the entertainment industry  
Tuesday for selling violence to children in the form of video 
games, movies and music. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Commerce Committee had scheduled a hearing on the  
issue weeks before the deadly school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
But the tragedy took center stage when the hearing finally took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Propped against the dais were more than half a dozen poster-size  
advertisements for video games, including this one: ``Get in touch 
with your gun-toting, testosterone pumping, cold-blooded murdering 
side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, held up the simulated  
shooting game ``Doom,'' noting that the two Littleton, Colo., 
shooters linked their home computers with modems to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern video games allow kids to ``rip out hearts or spinal  
cords and then wave the bloody debris over their heads,'' Hutchison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Grossman, an Arkansas State University professor who  
reviewed statements and psychiatric evaluations in the 1997 
Paducah, Ky., school shootings, said confessed shooter Michael 
Carneal had rarely shot a rifle and never shot a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carneal had plenty of experience playing arcade-quality  
point-and-shoot games at home, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hundred things can convince someone to want to take a gun  
and go kill,'' Carneal said in prepared testimony. ``But only one 
thing makes them able to kill: practice, practice, practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jack Valenti, president and CEO of the Motion Picture  
Association of America, warned against quick remedies and easy 
targets for such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the moral shield erected by parents, church and school,  
``no abolition of constitutional rights, no executive order, no 
congressional law, no fiery rhetoric will ever salvage a child's 
conduct or locate a missing moral code,'' Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenti offered the television and film industries' help to  
produce videos for courses on right and wrong through the fifth 
grade and in distributing the federal ``Guide to Safe Schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said he found himself at a strange  
intersection, ``between freedom of expression and the damage that 
can be done when freedom is abused.''

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Buys Donatos Pizza Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's is taking another stab at the pizza  
business -- though this time the fast-food chain is buying its way 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company announced Wednesday it has  
purchased the privately owned Donatos Pizza chain of 143 
restaurants for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of the Columbus, Ohio-based chain comes years  
after McDonald's own pizza offerings failed to catch on with 
American consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about adding Donatos to our McDonald's  
family,'' said company chief executive Jack M. Greenberg. ``It 
represents a great opportunity over the long term to learn more 
about another quick service restaurant segment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's in recent years has been cautiously looking at other  
restaurant concepts as it faces stiffer competition in its core 
hamburger business. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain early last year purchased a stake in fast-growing  
Mexican food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill and last month purchased 
Aroma Ltd., a British chain of 23 shops that sell coffee and 
sandwiches in a lively atmosphere of recorded Caribbean music and 
bright yellow and orange decor. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals are an unspoken acknowledgment that growth in  
McDonald's domestic market has slowed considerably as the hamburger 
business becomes virtually saturated with such major competitors as 
Wendy's and Burger King as well as thousands of minor players, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Donatos, founded by Jim Grote in 1963, began franchising in 1991  
as customers took to its ``Edge to Edge'' pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our family is excited to become involved with McDonald's, the  
premiere restaurant company, where we can reach out for expertise 
and other synergies to further expand the Donatos business,'' Grote 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's executives have taken pains to note their new  
acquisitions will not distract from their core business after being 
criticized over the years for attempting to expand their dinner 
menu into chicken offerings, a home-cooking concept and pizza.

<HEADLINE> What Tae-Bo Does for a Soul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Pitching in Wrigley Field is tough enough without  
a 15-mph wind blowing out and half the Cubs lineup fueled by 
weightlifting programs, vitamin therapies and muscle-building 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was this extra worry Tuesday for the Colorado Rockies  
staff: Tae-Bo fitness guru Billy Blanks, the seven-time world 
karate champion and infomercial star was in the house. And he was 
pulling for the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I did the workouts two, three times a week during  
the offseason, because I've had leg problems,'' Chicago second 
baseman Mickey Morandini said. ``And let me tell you, you don't 
want to be on the wrong side of that guy. He could kick your butt 
in half a second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not all.  
</P>
<P>
	In just nine months, Blanks' exercise routine has made him a  
$100 million man and the trainer to the stars. Anybody with cable 
has seen him more times than Wolf Blitzer. And knows only too well 
that the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, just-retired hockey great Wayne 
Gretzky, comedian Sinbad, singer Paula Abdul and what seems like 
half of L.A. swears by him. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Pistons star Grant Hill. Ditto for Indy 500 drivers  
Johnny Unser and Buddy Lazier. Recently, the NFL's Saints and NBA 
Hawks inquired about getting the full set of videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe because baseball is less demanding and more hidebound than  
most sports, Morandini was the only ballplayer to admit owning a 
Tae-Bo tape. But for one day, anyway, Blanks' inspiration worked up 
and down the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	After eight games without a homer -- the Cubs' worst power outage  
in nearly two years -- five hitters connected in Chicago's 13-12 
win. Included was a grand slam by Mark Grace, whose 6,136 
consecutive at-bats without one was the longest string among active 
players. Sammy Sosa gave Blanks a bat -- and hit one out. And in a 
fitting conclusion, Morandini, who met and then hugged Blanks 
before the game, ended it with a bloop single over a drawn-in 
infield in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	With prompting, Blanks will tick off what Tae-Bo can do --  
``develop agility, stamina, reflexes, coordination and awareness'' 
-- but game-winning hits does not make the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The videos have made him a celebrity. Blanks was at Wrigley to  
sing ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning 
stretch, but he knows life is not an infomercial. The only thing he 
claims credit for is a workout that's easy to dance to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that's happened has been a blessing,'' he said. ``I  
don't make it out to be anything but what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, it's a wonderful story, a movie Hollywood is bidding  
for, an overnight success 20 years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanks, 43, was born in Erie, Pa., one of 15 kids who worked  
weekends alongside his father scavenging scrap metal when he should 
have been out playing. He was shy, not athletic like his brothers, 
and -- though he wouldn't find out for another two decades -- 
dyslexic to boot. 
</P>
<P>
	One day, at age 12, he wandered past the Martin Luther King  
Center and saw two men practicing karate. Blanks grew up idolizing 
Bruce Lee; a heartbeat later, he knew he'd glimpsed the one thing 
he could do better than anyone else. He made up for lost time with 
a fierce determination. By 16, he was competing in regional 
tournaments. By 25, Blanks was heavyweight champion of the 
taekwondo world. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in 1983, he was running a martial arts studio  
above a hair salon in Boston. One night, some women from downstairs 
wanted to learn a few self-defense moves. By this time, Blanks had 
been tinkering with an exercise routine for seven years; ever since 
he bought the theme from ``Rocky'' and tried to synchronize his 
workouts with the music. He had already incorporated elements of 
ballet and boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	His first break, though, didn't materialize until a half-dozen  
years later, when actress Catherine Bach hired Blanks as a 
bodyguard and he wound up with a part in a movie. He liked acting, 
relocated to California and made rent money by teaching fitness 
classes in his garage. Blanks moved into one studio, then another, 
and kept filling them up. The sweaty faces became more 
recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen months ago, a producer convinced Blanks to put the show  
on videotape. Supply has struggled to satisfy demand ever since. In 
most places, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Cubs' full-figured closer, Rod Beck, sat at his  
locker and listened to Morandini, alternating pulls on a cigarette 
and the cup of beer at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sounds good,'' Beck said, rubbing his chin. ``But I'd have to  
start at the beginning, wouldn't I?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Signs East Timor Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 23 years after Indonesia invaded  
the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, the two countries 
signed a historic agreement Wednesday allowing the Timorese to vote 
on whether to remain part of Indonesia or seek independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed by the Indonesian and Portuguese foreign  
ministers, outlines Indonesia's proposal for autonomy for East 
Timor and provisions for the U.N.-supervised Aug. 8 referendum. If 
the 800,000 Timorese reject autonomy, Indonesia has pledged to put 
the half-island territory on the road to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who played a key role in  
bringing 15 years of U.N.-sponsored talks between the two countries 
to a successful conclusion, said he hoped the agreement would 
``open a new and more peaceful chapter in the history of this 
troubled territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged an end to the recent upsurge in violence between pro-  
and anti-independence militias in East Timor -- an issue that 
dominated the signing ceremony and threatens the U.N.-supervised 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has escalated since the Indonesian government in a  
surprise policy reversal announced in January that it would offer 
the East Timorese independence if they reject autonomy. Indonesia 
invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan met earlier Wednesday with foreign ministers Ali Alatas of  
Indonesia and Jaime Gama of Portugal over the security issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats said both sides agreed that Annan will set out minimum  
security requirements for the ballot to take place, including 
disarmament of rival militias and a reduction of Indonesia's 
military forces in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without security, there is no real capacity for the people to  
choose in peace and freedom,'' Gama said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence groups, which accuse the Indonesian military of  
backing Timorese anti-independence militias to disrupt the peace 
process, had hoped for a U.N. force to keep security. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Indonesian government will be in charge of security  
in the run-up to voting -- assisted by an undetermined number of 
U.N. peacekeeping advisers, according to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-strong U.N. mission will oversee the ballot, a U.N.  
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas told reporters the agreement provides that Indonesia  
``will endeavor to disarm all the factions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Indonesia could not promise to disarm the militias  
immediately because of ``some difficulties'' -- including getting 
the pro-independence rebels down from the mountains and talking to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gama said the agreement marks ``a dramatic shift'' in  
Indonesia's position because it recognizes for the first time 
self-determination for the Timorese and gives the United Nations a 
role in security and organizing the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	From now on, he said, Indonesia's actions in East Timor will be  
watched on the ground by the international community. The 
Indonesian military has been accused of human rights abuses in the 
territory.

<HEADLINE> Track Reopens With NASCAR Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- With flags at half staff, Lowe's Motor  
Speedway returned to the business of racing, this time without any 
spectators in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen Winston Cup teams showed up for a test  
session Wednesday, four days after three spectators were killed and 
eight injured when struck by debris from a crash in an Indy Racing 
League event at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	The track had remained silent following Saturday night's  
accident, and speedway officials said they discussed calling off 
the two-day Winston Cup test booked by General Motors for its 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We considered a variety of factors and decided to go ahead  
with the test, primarily because it is a non-spectator event,'' 
track spokesman Jerry Gappens said. ``We felt it was in everybody's 
best interests to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no fans sitting in the seats during the private test  
session, the Winston Cup drivers went out on the track early in the 
afternoon and began turning laps at about 180 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL drivers were going about 35 mph faster than that  
Saturday night when a three-car crash sent a tire and suspension 
parts flying into the stands above the 1.5-mile, high-banked 
trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatal wreck occurred near the exit of the fourth turn, and  
20 minutes into Wednesday's practice, Michael Waltrip crashed in 
almost the same spot. His Chevrolet spun violently through the 
third turn and slammed off the fourth-turn retaining wall, about 
200 yards from the site of the deadly crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip wasn't injured, but it served as an eerie reminder of  
recent events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to the folks who lost their lives and their  
families and the people who were injured,'' three-time Winston Cup 
champion Jeff Gordon said as he prepared to go out for his first 
test run. ``But we know that Charlotte Motor Speedway, the IRL and 
really everybody in motorsports is going to come together and do 
whatever they can to improve the situation to make sure that 
doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's accident was the second in nine months  
involving multiple fan fatalities in U.S. racing. Both crashes 
occurred during Indy-car races when wheels and suspension parts 
snapped off cars and flew into stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty fortunate in Winston Cup,'' Gordon said. ``With  
NASCAR rules, the way our cars are built, things like that are a 
little less likely to happen. But still we want to prevent anything 
like that. We want to keep the fans safe, we want to keep the 
drivers safe and make it a fun event for everybody to enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only one of the eight injured people still hospitalized,  
Haley McGee, 9, of Conover, N.C., remained in critical condition at 
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte with brain and lung injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day in a row, speedway president H.A. ``Humpy''  
Wheeler attended a funeral for one of the victims, this time going 
to a service for Randy Pyatte, 21, of Connelly Springs, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the track, engineers and architects moved closer to  
finalizing plans to modify the catch fence that surrounds the 
speedway. The fence now rises 15 feet above the track and is topped 
by a 35-inch-long canopy positioned at a 45-degree angle. Gappens 
said the speedway is looking at adding to both the height of the 
fence and the length of the canopy.

the half-island territory on the road to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who played a key role in  
bringing 15 years of U.N.-sponsored talks between the two countries 
to a successful conclusion, said he hoped the agreement would 
``open a new and more peaceful chapter in the history of this 
troubled territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged an end to the recent upsurge in violence between pro-  
and anti-independence militias in East Timor -- an issue that 
dominated the signing ceremony and threatens the U.N.-supervised 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has escalated since the Indonesian government in a  
surprise policy reversal announced in January that it would offer 
the East Timorese independence if they reject autonomy. Indonesia 
invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan met earlier Wednesday with foreign ministers Ali Alatas of  
Indonesia and Jaime Gama of Portugal over the security issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats said both sides agreed that Annan will set out minimum  
security requirements for the ballot to take place, including 
disarmament of rival militias and a reduction of Indonesia's 
military forces in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without security, there is no real capacity for the people to  
choose in peace and freedom,'' Gama said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence groups, which accuse the Indonesian military of  
backing Timorese anti-independence militias to disrupt the peace 
process, had hoped for a U.N. force to keep security. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Indonesian government will be in charge of security  
in the run-up to voting -- assisted by an undetermined number of 
U.N. peacekeeping advisers, according to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 600-strong U.N. mission will oversee the ballot, a U.N.  
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas told reporters the agreement provides that Indonesia  
``will endeavor to disarm all the factions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Indonesia could not promise to disarm the militias  
immediately because of ``some difficulties'' -- including getting 
the pro-independence rebels down from the mountains and talking to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gama said the agreement marks ``a dramatic shift'' in  
Indonesia's position because it recognizes for the first time 
self-determination for the Timorese and gives the United Nations a 
role in security and organizing the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	From now on, he said, Indonesia's actions in East Timor will be  
watched on the ground by the international community. The 
Indonesian military has been accused of human rights abuses in the 
territory.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Stations Gave Advance Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Anyone with a television or radio had  
plenty of advance warning before tornadoes struck the Oklahoma City 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's four network affiliates went live with the developing  
tornado system around 4:30 p.m. Monday, giving people in Oklahoma 
City up to two hour's notice before the tornado struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Most TV stations stayed on the air with nonstop information for  
nearly 30 hours, losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
advertising, station officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using helicopters, ground spotters and in-house radar equipment,  
TV weathermen tracked the storm system from the time it developed 
until it dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some viewers don't like their entertainment programming  
interrupted by weather warnings, said Gary England, chief 
meteorologist for CBS affiliate KWTV. 
</P>
<P>
	England says that shortly before Monday's tornado he received a  
nasty e-mail from someone grousing about program interruptions a 
week beforehand due to storm coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	England said the writer asked ``where's the big tornadoes and  
where's the big hail?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we get all these fatalities. I wanted to write the person  
back and say, 'Is this big enough for you?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief M.T. Berry praised the local stations at a news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``People had great warning. People took heed to what you said,  
and I think that's why we had so many survivors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weathermen seemed stunned by the size and strength of Monday's  
storms. England said scientists usually determine a storm's 
intensity after viewing its debris path, but he said this storm 
immediately seemed different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching it from the helicopter and watching it from the  
ground shots and listening to the descriptions from our storm 
chases, it was just obvious,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the weathermen predicted accurately that the storm was  
an F-5, the strongest of tornadoes, with winds of at least 261 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morgan, chief meteorologist for NBC affiliate KFOR, said  
the ultimate challenge was trying to warn people of the gravity of 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to understand that it wasn't just a normal bad  
tornado.''

<HEADLINE> Sportswriter's Lawsuit Is Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A gender discrimination lawsuit brought by a  
former Seattle Post-Intelligencer sports reporter who was passed 
over for a columnist job has been settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, in which the Hearst-owned morning daily agreed to  
pay Lawrence ``Bud'' Withers an undisclosed sum, was reached 
Tuesday following about four hours of negotiations, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ``was certainly settled to our satisfaction,'' Withers  
told The Seattle Times, the afternoon daily where he went to work 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope,'' he added, ``that (the settlement) would open  
some eyes down there and add an increased measure of fairness to 
hiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Bunting, managing editor of the P-I, said Wednesday the  
paper admitted no guilt and maintained that Withers' claims were 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
	The mediated agreement followed a mistrial because of a jury  
deadlock last month in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the six jurors rejected a complete vindication of the  
P-I, but four rejected Withers' claim that the paper violated a 
state ban on the use of gender as a ``substantial factor'' in 
employment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	All six voted to dismiss his federal claim that gender was a  
``motivating factor'' when the P-I hired Laura Vecsey as a sports 
columnist in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached because, ``more than anything else, I  
think, the case was aired and aired adequately'' in the trial, 
Bunting said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gratifying to have it behind us,'' he said. ``It affected  
staff morale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Withers' lawyers said that while Vecsey was being courted for  
the position, he was being told the paper had no intention of 
hiring a new columnist anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher J.D. Alexander testified that gender may have been a  
factor in Vecsey's hiring but was not the deciding issue. The 
paper's sports staff was all male at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors testified that Withers was rejected because his writing  
was wordy, he didn't show enough interest in the job and he was 
resisting changes at the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> F&AMP;W Publications Goes Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- F&AMP;W Publications, the company that puts out  
the annual ``Writer's Market'' guide, is looking for a buyer. The 
New York investment bank Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates has been 
hired to help with the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Rosenthal, F&AMP;W's president, said business is good, but  
he wants to devote time to supporting community arts and expanding 
a reading program he and his wife started in the Cincinnati public 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1913, F&AMP;W produces specialized multimedia products  
aimed at writing, art, graphic design, sewing, quilting, and 
woodworking. Its operations include a dozen special-interest 
magazines, book publishing, book clubs, and study courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which wants to find a buyer by summer's end, also  
has built Internet sites for many of its brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal, 66, said he hopes any buyer would retain the F&AMP;W's  
personnel and operations. The company employs about 300, most in 
Cincinnati and about 15 at an office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a key objective,'' he said. ``With the unique and  
special nature of what we do and the complexity of our company, I 
don't know why anyone would want to change that.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes Long-Time Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona's longest-serving death row  
inmate was executed by injection Wednesday for killing a fellow 
inmate by setting a deadly blaze after the man had made a vulgar 
comment about his niece 
</P>
<P>
	Robert ``Bonzai Bob'' Wayne Vickers, 41, had spent 20 years on  
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers lifted his head from the gurney, smiled and nodded at  
relatives, including his aunt and cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, everybody,'' he said. ``See you later.'' Moments later  
he mouthed ``time to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers was sentenced to prison at 18 for grand theft then in  
1979 strangled his cellmate, Frank Ponciano, with a bedsheet 
because he didn't wake him for lunch and because he drank Vickers' 
Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers carved ``Bonzai,'' a misspelling of a Japanese war cry,  
in the victim's back with a sharpened toothbrush, earning him his 
nickname. He received the death penalty, but the verdict was 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to death again, this time for killing fellow  
death row inmate Wilmar ``Buster'' Holsinger in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers became enraged after Holsinger made a vulgar remark  
about his niece, and tossed a flaming cup of hair tonic and toilet 
paper into Holsinger's cell, igniting a flash fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, Texas executed a man who beat a woman with a  
hammer, then strangled her during a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Clydell Coleman, 62, was the oldest person executed in Texas  
since the state resumed the death penalty in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who worked as a janitor, was condemned for the 1989  
slaying of 87-year-old Leetisha Joe. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial testimony showed Coleman found Ms. Joe at home, Coleman  
covered her head with a blanket, hit her repeatedly with a hammer 
and then strangled her with her own stocking. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to make a final statement.

<HEADLINE> Westwood Is Hot As Duval in Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- David Duval isn't the only golfer to win 11  
titles in the last 35 starts. Lee Westwood has matched Duval's 
victory total, and this week he looks to defend the only PGA title 
in that fabulous string. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood, however, withdrew from Wednesday's pro am with what a  
tournament official described as ``problems with his right 
shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood experienced a ``twinge'' in that shoulder last November  
during the Hong Kong Open. He had a similar twinge Wednesday on the 
driving range and, after a visit to the medical trailer, decided to 
rest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Duval, Westwood won three tournaments at the end of 1997,  
seven in 1998, and one this year. He had 13 top-10 finishes around 
the world in 1998, including four victories in Europe. He's also 
won in Asia and Australia, and two weeks ago won a title in Macao. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all the great players,'' Westwood said. ``Most have  
won all over the world. Against different fields. On different golf 
courses. Under different conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, shoulder permitting, Westwood has a chance to see how  
his game stacks up with Duval's in the $2.6 million Compaq Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the world's top-ranked player, has won four of the 10  
tournaments he's entered this year. He started with victories in 
the Mercedes and the Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost in the second round of the Match Play  
Championship, Duval took three weeks off and returned to win The 
Players Championship and BellSouth Classic in consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Westwood, who turned 26 last week, has matched Duval in  
victories, he's not well known in the United States, where his only 
title was last year in New Orleans. And Westwood said, his game is 
still not on a par with Duval's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say I'd lose out around the greens,'' Westwood said. ``I'm  
not as good as David Duval at chipping or probably putting. But 
there might be something I do better than him. That's the way it's 
always going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if there are things about his game that Westwood would like  
to improve, the 1998 European PGA player of the year has no doubt 
he can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't envy anybody,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ranked sixth in the World Golf Rankings, Westwood is still the  
down-to-earth kid from blue collar Worksop, England, a mining and 
farming community. He married in January and bought a farmhouse and 
50 acres just outside his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	An intense competitor on the course, Westwood doesn't let his  
killer instinct interfere with his life off the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody bothers me too much,'' he said. ``What's not to handle?  
You either do or you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood won the tournament in New Orleans last year with four  
consecutive rounds in the 60s (69, 68, 67, 69), finishing 
15-under-par on the tough 7,106 yards, par-72 English Turn course. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his ability to drive the ball and his accuracy,  
Westwood's composure on the course is what most of his peers 
comment on. Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal said that's 
Westwood's edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his attitude, his ability to relax that sets him apart,''  
Olazabal said. ``He is long and straight, yes. But, when I look at 
Lee Westwood, I think of his composure. That impresses me most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood would like to add more U.S. titles to his collection.  
Duval and Westwood were tied for sixth in the Masters. That was 
Westwood's best finish in a major, bettering the seventh he had in 
the 1998 U.S. Open. He believes the U.S. victories will come as he 
refines his game. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing he isn't worrying about is his mental game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid of winning. I'm not afraid of losing,''  
Westwood said. ``It's only a game at the end of the day. It's not 
like war or anything like that. Some people treat it like that, 
which is the wrong attitude to have.''

<HEADLINE> Patty Schnyder Reunites With Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Patty Schnyder's rift with her mother has eased, and  
the Swiss star hopes that will also get her tennis game going 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she began a relationship with a new coach who has been  
described as a faith healer, Schnyder had broken relations with her 
parents, boyfriend and coach. However, her mother joined her in 
Rome for the Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	After a second-round win over Italy's Adriana Serra Zanetti on  
Wednesday, Schnyder said the strain of family problems has hurt her 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to stay concentrated. At the moment I don't  
feel really confident on the court,'' Schnyder, seeded fifth, said 
after beating Zanetti 6-2, 7-5. ``I have a lot of thoughts on my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old player said she saw her mother on Saturday for  
the first time in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her I would like to have her here and she came,''  
Schnyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnyder's new coach is Rainer Harnecker, a 42-year-old German  
trainer with little tennis experience. He has urged Schnyder to 
drink several quarts of orange juice each day, telling a Zurich 
newspaper it is ``almost identical to mother's milk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harnecker is under investigation in Germany for practicing  
medicine without a proper license. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnyder has played erratically since opening the year by  
winning the Gold Coast tournament in Australia. Since then, she has 
reached the semis only once. She skipped the Federation Cup last 
month and has fallen out of the WTA's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ranking is dropping, I know, and that's pressure I put on  
myself,'' she said. ``It's my tennis I have to get back, and I 
don't know how long it will take.''

<HEADLINE> FCC To Mull SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is  
gathering information on what conditions, if any, should be placed 
on SBC Communications' planned takeover of Ameritech, which would 
create the nation's largest local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC staff members involved in reviewing the $57 billion deal are  
holding a public meeting today and Friday to give the merger's 
supporters, opponents and other interested parties an opportunity 
to weigh in. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission hopes to make a decision this summer on the  
merger, which has been approved by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of this is to listen to comments from interested  
members of the public,'' said the FCC's Thomas Krattenmaker, one of 
the key staff people reviewing the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission staff members don't plan to present any new  
information on the merger at the meeting or offer any new 
recommendations on what possible conditions should be, he said. 
Krattenmaker declined to comment on what final course of action he 
would advise the FCC to take. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys general of Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and  
Wisconsin have recommended that the FCC force SBC and Ameritech to 
open their local phone markets to rivals in the majority of the 13 
states the combined company would serve before being allowed to 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC has said it wouldn't accept such a condition.  
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America and the Consumers Union,  
meanwhile, don't believe that, or any other condition, would 
adequately protect consumers. ``Sometimes the commission just has 
to say no,'' said the CFA's Mark Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and others want the  
FCC to block the merger, contending it would thwart local phone 
competition and the prospect of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech, supported  
by major telephone unions, say the merger would be good for 
consumers and competition. They say it will spur local phone 
competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate the roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access and data services, and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states involved in the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Pornography Prosecutions Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gene McConnell said he started looking at  
pornography at age 12, and although it wasn't something he was 
proud of, he didn't think he was hurting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he gradually became obsessed with it, McConnell told  
reporters outside the Capitol on Wednesday. And he thinks that 
played a role in his impulsive decision to jump into a woman's car 
and try to rape her years later. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell, now vice president of victim assistance for the  
National Coalition for the Protection of Children &AMP; Families, and 
other conservative activists asked the Clinton administration to 
step up prosecution of pornography-related offenses on Wednesday. 
They said hard-core sexual imagery has been linked with 
molestation, rape and other violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Research has shown that pornography contributes to sexual  
assault, including rape and molestation of children,'' Rep. Joe 
Pitts, R-Pa., said at a news conference called to observe May as 
Victims of Pornography Month. He said that of child molesters 
studied, 87 percent of those who molested girls and 77 percent of 
those who molested boys admitted using hard-core pornography 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws are already in place. We need the Justice Department  
to enforce the law,'' said Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell said he broke away from pornography for a while at age  
16 after becoming overwhelmed with shame for having molested a 
14-year-old girl. But he returned to it years later after he began 
having trouble in his marriage. Soon afterwards, he began 
frequenting strip clubs and massage parlors and paying prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17 years ago, he forced his way into the woman's car  
and grabbed her by the throat. But then he realized he was about to 
damage another person's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear in her eyes was like being hit with a baseball bat,''  
McConnell said. ``I said, `I'm sorry, I've made a serious mistake,' 
got out of the car and walked away.'' She wrote down his license 
plate number and turned him in to police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard thousands of stories from men ... who have similar  
stories to my own,'' he said. ``They may not have taken it to the 
extent that I did, but pornography played a significant role in 
their dysfunctional relationships.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks' Robinson on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Milwaukee Bucks leading scorer  
Glenn Robinson was placed on the injured list Wednesday because of 
a deep bone bruise to his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who was averaging 18.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.1  
assists, was hurt in the first period of the Bucks' game with 
Detroit on April 30. The fifth-year forward who scored in double 
figures in all 47 games this season missed the final three games of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Placing Robinson on the injured list will not affect his  
eligibility for the playoffs, because the list expires at the end 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Jerome Allen, who averaged 13 points playing in France  
this season, was signed by the Bucks to a balance-of-the-season 
contract.

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Tops Vegas Mayor's Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar Goodman waited anxiously as the returns  
came in, just as he once sweated out jury deliberations with the 
likes of Tony ``the Ant'' Spilotro and other wiseguy clients. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, the jurors were the voters of Las Vegas, and  
they nearly made him the city's new mayor in his political debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman came within 277 votes of winning the job outright  
Tuesday in a field of nine candidates, settling instead for one of 
two spots in a June 8 runoff with veteran City Councilman Arnie 
Adamsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb rode his city's strong  
economy to a third term, and three Midwestern cities where 
incumbents are not running also held mayoral races. 
</P>
<P>
	In Las Vegas, Goodman, 59, pumped his fist, led cheers from his  
supporters and predicted victory in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of this election is a foregone conclusion. I will  
become your mayor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer who played himself in Martin Scorsese's ``Casino''  
has defended the likes of Meyer Lansky and Spilotro, the gangster 
who legend has it put a rival's head in a vise and squeezed his 
eyeballs out. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman campaigned as a populist and defender of the defenseless  
who would break up the city's good-old-boy network. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen said electing Goodman would set the city's reputation  
back 50 years. But Adamsen and developer Mark Fine, another leading 
candidate, also spent much of their time attacking each other, to 
Goodman's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts reporting, Goodman had 24,267 votes, or 49  
percent of the total; he needed a simple majority to be elected 
outright. Adamsen had 14,395 votes, or 29 percent, and Fine was 
third with 7,968 votes, or 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1979, there won't be a runoff in Denver  
where Webb picked up 81 percent of the vote. His three opponents 
had struggled to raise money, and two-thirds of voters polled three 
weeks ago could not name one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, president-elect of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said he  
hoped to use his third term to continue increasing public safety, 
protecting parks and open space and creating economic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most expensive mayoral race ever in Lincoln, Neb.,  
former state Sen. Don Wesely, a Democrat, defeated Republican City 
Councilwoman Cindy Johnson 56 percent to 44 percent. Wesely 
succeeds Republican Mike Johanns, who was elected governor last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Wesely and Ms. Johnson spent a combined $420,000 on the  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates made crime-fighting a major issue in Indianapolis,  
which has seen record-breaking numbers of homicides the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are trying to take over the mayor's post for the first  
time in 30 years, and on Tuesday they nominated Bart Peterson, a 
developer who was former Gov. Evan Bayh's chief of staff. Indiana 
Secretary of State Sue Anne Gilroy was selected as the GOP nominee 
to succeed Stephen Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, Ohio, will have its first female mayor or first black  
mayor after the November election. Republican Dorothy Teater and 
Democrat Michael Coleman, who is black, were the top two finishers 
in a three-way nonpartisan primary on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cincinnati, voters approved a proposal that will allow for  
the direct election of a mayor with greater powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, the City Council member with the most  
votes assumes the largely ceremonial role of mayor. Under the new 
system, the mayor would have authority to veto council actions.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To End Nextel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After weeks of fruitless negotiations, MCI  
WorldCom Inc. is about drop its effort to buy the wireless phone 
company Nextel Communications Inc., a source familiar with MCI's 
plans said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
breakdown of the talks was amicable and that an announcement was 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Gibson, an MCI WorldCom spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.,  
said she could not confirm that an announcement was in the works. 
She declined further comment. Nextel officials did not immediately 
return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone company  
behind AT&AMP;T Corp., is the only major long-distance provider without 
a stake in the $33 billion U.S. wireless phone business. AT&AMP;T Corp. 
bought McCaw Cellular Communications for $11.5 billion in 1994 and 
is spending billions more expanding its wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean, Va.-based Nextel is the last independent major wireless  
company and controls about 4 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., started negotiations with  
Nextel after losing a bidding war to buy another mobile phone 
company, AirTouch Communications Inc., earlier this year. Britain's 
Vodafone Group is acquiring Airtouch for $56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported suspension of talks with Nextel is positive news,  
said Catherine Jackson, a managing director for Trainer Wortham 
Co., a money management firm that owns 600,000 shares of MCI 
WorldCom. ``It came down to price. The thing the Street has been 
most concerned about is that MCI WorldCom would overpay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom was faced with assuming Nextel's $7 billion in  
debt, plus having to borrow more money to expand Nextel's network 
nationwide. Nextel's system relies on Motorola equipment and isn't 
compatible with other wireless carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson said the two companies may still reach an agreement  
at a future date. MCI is ``doing it at their own pace, and I don't 
think the opportunities are going to disappear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	F. Drake Johnstone, a telecommunications analyst with Davenport  
&AMP; Company in Richmond, Va., said MCI WorldCom eventually needs to 
enter the wireless market for competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that WorldCom over the next few quarters may see  
its competitors, especially AT&AMP;T and Sprint, experiencing 
considerable success with wireless, and that may pressure them to 
step up to the plate and buy Nextel,'' Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wireless market is expected to become too lucrative for a  
major player like MCI to resist, he said. Cellular telephones 
already account for half of all voice traffic in some countries, 
but only 17 percent in the United States, so the growth potential 
is enormous, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry  
Association, the number of wireless customers in the U.S. jumped 25 
percent last year to 69.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnstone said another attractive feature of Nextel is that it  
plans to become the first company to offer cellular phones with 
Internet access.

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Police have detained three suspects in  
the March 24 assassination of Vice President Luis Argana, 
Paraguay's interior minister said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were an army colonel, Wladimior Woroniecki, and two  
civilians, Walter Gamarra and Maximo Osioro. The interior minister 
did not elaborate, Interior Minister Walter Bower told journalists. 
He gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying of Argana plunged this South American country into  
days of turmoil culminating in the resignation of President Raul 
Cubas. 
</P>
<P>
	All three men were linked to Gen. Lino Oviedo, the former  
president's controversial political mentor, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamarra had already been in detention for allegedly firing into  
a crowd of demonstrators demanding Cubas' departure after Argana's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Woroniecki is an Oviedo supporter, and Osiro was once a  
bodyguard for the general, who has fled to Argentina.

	PUEBLA, Mexico (AP) -- Trumpets blared and cheerleaders twirled  
batons as Mexicans celebrated Cinco de Mayo on Wednesday, a holiday 
marking one of the country's most celebrated military victories. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo attended the Cinco de Mayo parade in  
the central city of Puebla, where 5,500 soldiers and about 24,000 
students marched downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cinco de Mayo -- Fifth of May -- holiday marks the Mexican  
army's 1862 defeat of French invaders in Puebla. Although the 
French went on to occupy most of Mexico, Cinco de Mayo remains one 
of the proudest days in the country's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the parade greatly outnumbered the 3,000 to  
4,000 people who watched the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people weren't that lively -- there probably was too much  
security,'' said cheerleader Adriana Perez, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Mexico City, Zedillo attended a ceremony honoring the  
military in the capital's main plaza. Also, residents of a 
working-class neighborhood of the city reenacted the battle, a 
68-year-old tradition.

	PANAMA CITY (AP) -- The United States shut down one of its main  
anti-drug operations in Latin America on Wednesday as part of the 
process of turning over the Canal Zone to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Interagency Task Force-South, located at Howard Air  
Force Base, was an important part of U.S. efforts to work with 
regional governments to fight drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is one of five military bases that the United States is  
relinquishing under a 1979 treaty that surrenders the Panama Canal 
to Panama by Dec. 31. Howard ended flights on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force, formed in June 1997, is credited with  
contributing to the capture of 145 tons of cocaine and the arrests 
of hundreds of drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the task force's responsibilities will be handled by  
other facilities under the Miami-based Southern Command.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Transportation workers have ended a  
violent six-day strike that disrupted traffic throughout the 
country, after the government agreed to lower diesel fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Coordinator of Transport signed an agreement  
Tuesday night ending the strike after the government agreed to 
lower diesel prices by 13 cents to $1.29 per gallon. The 
organization, representing 10,000 transportation workers, had 
sought 65 cent reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Buses and taxis were back in service Wednesday and the  
government cleared obstacles placed in streets by strikers and 
their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10 people were injured and dozens of people were  
arrested during the strike. Protesters were stopping vehicles 
believed to be carrying paying passengers, forcing the passengers 
off and smashing windows.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The slaying of a prominent professor is

	Four young masked assailants burst into Hernan Henao's office at  
the University of Antioquia on Tuesday, singled out the 54-year-old 
professor from his coworkers and shot him with silencer-equipped 
pistols. 
</P>
<P>
	Henao, an anthropologist, had specialized in regional  
development in Medellin, capital of Antioquia province and one of 
the country's most violent areas. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have been killed for his research into the uprooting of  
tens of thousands of civilians in recent years during right-wing 
paramilitary groups' campaign against leftist rebels in Antioquia, 
friends and colleagues said.

	Either the paramilitaries or the rebels could have ordered his  
killing, they said.

	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Washington Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson  
is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, performed 
after he experienced swelling following minicamp.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise Slightly / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose slightly Wednesday after  
several days of sharp losses, but market sentiment remained 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond nudged up 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, dipped to 5.70 percent from 5.71 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the decline, yields are up sharply in the past two  
weeks. As recently as April 20, the rate on the long-term Treasury 
was 5.50 percent, and it began this year at 5.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to up 1/32 point and intermediate maturities were up 
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slight recovery in Treasury prices Wednesday,  
concerns persist that the Federal Reserve may have to raise 
interest rates in order to slow down economic growth and forestall 
inflation. Higher rates would hurt the value of bonds and other 
investments that pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Tuesday showing that a key gauge of future economic  
activity rose for the sixth straight month in March fanned fears 
that the U.S. economy may be growing too fast. The government 
reported Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories rose 2.0 percent 
in March, bouncing back from a drop in February. But a separate Fed 
assessment of business activity around the nation found no evidence 
of increasing inflation even as the economy continued its 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.48 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.65 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 percentage 
point to 4.48 percent. One-year yields were 4.74 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.03 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.51 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from 4.69 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 123 3/32 from 123 Tuesday. The 
average yield to maturity fell to 5.31 percent from 5.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> Children's Reye's Syndrome Now Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Reye's syndrome, a rare but deadly disorder usually caused by  
giving aspirin to children with flu or chicken pox, has almost 
disappeared, researchers reported today in the New England Journal 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	From a high of 555 cases among American children in 1980,  
doctors have reported no more than 36 cases per year since 1987, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers credited a public education campaign and changes in  
treatment for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, when the connection between aspirin and Reye's syndrome  
was discovered, the CDC began warning doctors and parents not to 
give aspirin to children with viral infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon general issued a warning in 1982 and aspirin began  
carrying warning labels in 1986. Since then, acetaminophen, the 
ingredient in pain relievers such as Tylenol, has replaced aspirin 
in most medications for treating fever and aches in children. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Reye's syndrome has become so rare that children  
with typical symptoms -- vomiting, confusion, delirium and other 
mental symptoms -- should be tested for various rare, inherited 
enzyme deficiencies, the researchers said. The lack of critical 
enzymes can cause imbalances in metabolism that lead to symptoms 
mimicking Reye's syndrome.

Wednesday, after a Federal Reserve assessment of the economy eased 
fears about higher interest rates and inflation. 
</P>

	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.30 to 10,955.41. The  
Dow changed direction several times during the course of the day,

</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended higher after erasing early  
losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 15.31 to 1,347.31, 
while the Nasdaq composite index advanced 49.33 to 2,534.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors fretted through most of the session about the  
general upward trend in interest rates. The yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond, while it dipped Wednesday to 5.7 percent, still is 
up from 5.5 percent on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a noticeable and important rise in yields,'' said  
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities, ``and people are worried about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates are worrisome for the stock market for several  
reasons. First, stocks are trading at very high prices on the 
premise that rates will remain low. If they rise, the lofty stock 
prices cannot be justified and will have to come down. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, although first-quarter earnings reports proved  
surprisingly strong, they're pretty much over with. That leaves 
interest rates as the one thing that investors -- especially 
short-term traders -- have to focus on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can't think of anything else to worry about, you  
worry about Federal Reserve policy and interest rates,'' said 
Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday afternoon, the Fed released its ``Beige Book'' of  
economic analysis. Normally, the Beige Book wouldn't grab much 
attention in the stock market, but it did this time because there 
was little else to focus on. 
</P>
<P>
	The report told investors what they wanted to hear: The domestic  
economy continued to expand moderately in March and April, but 
prices held steady and consumer spending -- also a key support for 
higher stock prices -- remained strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion that inflation is under control helped cool  
concerns, at least for now, that the Fed would have to raise 
short-term rates in a bid to slow down the economy. Higher rates 
are the market's nemesis because they can quickly eat into 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Beige Book came in exactly what we were hoping for,'' said  
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``It 
showed moderate growth with no wage pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merger activity also helped buoy stock prices. AT&AMP;T advanced 5 3/8  
to 56 15/16 after the telecommunications company won a bidding war 
for MediaOne, the cable TV company. The deal will make AT&AMP;T the 
nation's largest cable provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks rose as interest rates fell. The Dow  
was led higher by Dow component J.P. Morgan, which added 5 1/2 to 139. 
</P>
<P>
	And General Electric shares climbed 4 1/16 to 109, after its  
chairman, John F. Welch, addressed analysts in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Even technology shares recovered from an early bout of  
profit-taking. IBM, which had been down most of the day, closed up 
1/8 at 212 1/8 after falling as low as 207 5/16. Microsoft shares ended 
up 1 1/16 at 79 1/8 after regaining lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds had fallen in early trading after two other  
reports of strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Purchasing Management Association said its index of  
business activity among non-manufacturing companies rose to 64.0 in 
April from 62.5 in March. And the Commerce Department reported new 
orders to American factories rose 2 percent in March, more than 
wiping out a 1.8-percent February decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,565 to 1,444 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 1.11 
billion shares, down slightly from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.44 to 640.54, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.21 to 785.49. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.68 to 434.27. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Japanese stock market was closed for  
the third of three consecutive holidays and is set to resume 
trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks fell in sympathy with Wall Street's losses  
Tuesday. The CAC 40 in Paris ended 1.5 percent lower, London's FTSE 
100 index closed down 2 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt dropped 
1.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Flavors for Jif Peanut Butter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Coming to a store near you: peanut butter that  
could be available in fruit or chocolate flavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is getting ready to roll out new flavors of  
its traditional Jif peanut butter. Those could include 
Apple-Cinnamon, Berry Blend and Chocolate Silk versions. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G's management said the new Jif Smooth Sensations flavored  
peanut butter was well received in test markets in Midland, Texas, 
and Grand Junction, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The new products are to be introduced nationally during the next  
few months, P&AMP;G spokeswoman Christina Jacob-Schneider said 
Wednesday. She declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	An article in this week's issue of Brandweek magazine said P&AMP;G  
plans to begin marketing the new flavored peanut butter line made 
with chunks of real fruit or chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jacob-Schneider declined comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Jif is the top seller in the $810 million peanut butter  
category, according to market tracker Information Resources Inc. of 
Chicago. For the 52-week period ended March 28, Jif had sales of 
$271.9 million, compared with $158.6 million for Heinz's Skippy 
brand and $153.5 million for private-label brands.

<HEADLINE> Condemned Man May Have Called Juror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Three days before a jury recommended  
that serial killer Charles Ng should die, a female juror received a 
call from a man who said he was ``Charles,'' according to a 
transcript of a secret hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to tell you, you are very nice,'' the caller  
told her. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, who released the transcript  
of the court session Tuesday, allowed the juror to remain on the 
panel after she said she was ``nervous'' but would not be 
prejudiced by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan made no ruling on whether the caller was Ng but told  
lawyers, ``a defendant cannot be allowed to get jurors kicked off 
the case during the deliberation process. ... He can't force a 
mistrial through his misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's case has been one of California's longest murder  
prosecutions, taking 14 years to go to trial. He fought extradition 
from Canada, hired and fired attorneys and for a time represented 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng was convicted Feb. 24 of murdering six men, three women and  
two baby boys in a Northern California crime spree during 1984 and 
1985. The jury was on an extended weekend break in penalty phase 
deliberations when the juror got the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney William G. Kelley said it was possible that the  
call came from a ``crackpot'' and not from Ng. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng is scheduled to be sentenced June 29. The judge may accept  
the jury's recommendation that he be executed or reduce the penalty 
to life in prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Refugee Camps May Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Refugee camps in and around the northern  
Albanian town of Kukes may be closed or moved, a top U.N. spokesman 
said today, a day after more than 7,000 new refugees from Kosovo 
flooded across the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said talks with Albanian officials have started on 
possibly shutting down the camps that are providing temporary 
shelter to an estimated 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still an idea, but it was on the backburner and now it's  
on the front burner,'' Wilkinson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling the debate are security concerns in the tense border  
region just a few miles from Kosovo and the meager resources of an 
underdeveloped region in Europe's poorest country. 
</P>
<P>
	The population of Kukes was less than 30,000 before the refugee  
crisis began in late March. Now officials estimate more than 
100,000 refugees are living in local housing, in fields and other 
open areas, or in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials from Kukes and relief agencies fear an  
escalation of border violence, such as Serb shelling of Kukes, 
which could cause large numbers of casualties in the refugee camps 
and pandemonium in the overcrowded town. The local water supply is 
also under severe strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson said it would take at least two to three weeks shut  
down the refugee camps or move them further from the border region. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Manuel, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, said  
her agency refused to enhance its basic food relief -- fruit, high 
energy cookies and other emergency rations -- with a broader package 
that would include meat, jam and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We turned it down because we don't want to seduce them or  
increase the comfort level,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson said the UNHCR and city officials were starting a new  
campaign to persuade refugees who have refused to leave the Kukes 
area that they must move further south. He said the main objections 
to moving come from people who are waiting for relatives to cross 
over from Kosovo, those who don't want to leave their tractors, or 
others who simply don't want to have to travel again. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees who came to Kukes on Tuesday told of a new wave of  
killings, robbery and men being separated from women and children 
in several regions of Kosovo in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Some spoke of scores of killings Sunday night in the village of  
Studime, 18 miles northwest of Pristina, the Kosovo capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Izet Krasniqi, his left shoulder heavily bandaged due to a  
bullet wound, said he saw 20 to 30 people shot to death in Studime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police shot me,'' he said as he went for medical  
treatment. Masked Serb fighters demanded money and opened fire when 
he said he had none, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wagon hauled by a tractor, Zylfie Gerxhali and her  
12-year-old daughter wept as they told how four men -- including 
Zylfie's husband -- were killed before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Zylfie Gerxhali said the masked Serb fighters stopped the wagon  
Sunday night in Studime and demanded money from her husband, Avdyl. 
When he said he had none, the Serbs took him and three others, 
including his brother, and shot them to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard him shout when they shot him,'' she said. When the  
soldiers returned to the wagon, she gave them $55 in German marks 
and a necklace because ``they said they would kill everyone if I 
didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in a different wagon, Selvie Goguri, said she saw bodies  
lying along the roadside, in cars and in a river in Studime. She 
and others said at least 100 people died along a half-mile stretch 
of road. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovapress, the Kosovo Liberation Army's news agency, said  
about 100 civilians were killed by Serb soldiers in the attack. The 
bodies were reportedly hauled away by soldiers driving tractors and 
dumped in a mass grave, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new arrivals Tuesday had been on the move for weeks,  
staying in the mountains or in different villages until forced to 
move on by Serbs. Some people said Serb forces also separated men 
from other refugees in Vranica, in southern Kosovo, and in the 
Djakovica area, in the southwest.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche, Bankers Trust Clear Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A city official who sought to block a proposed  
$10.2 billion merger of two banks in a bid to force a settlement of 
Holocaust claims dropped his opposition to the bank deal on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi made the announcement  
two weeks after a State Department official warned that opposition 
to the merger of Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust for ``political 
reasons'' could chill the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hevesi said in a statement that he had written to the Federal  
Reserve and the Banking Department, suggesting they consider the 
proposed merger entirely on its merits. If approved by state and 
federal regulators, the merger would create the largest financial 
institution in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's chief financial officer said negotiations concerning  
Holocaust-related issues among the German government, German 
financial institutions and groups representing Holocaust survivors 
had made significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is appropriate at this time to acknowledge the efforts and  
good will of German companies and the German government,'' said 
Hevesi, who is chairman of the Executive Monitoring Committee. The 
committee represents a network of about 900 state and local 
government finance officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Holocaust survivors and heirs are seeking justice for the  
millions in Jewish property and financial holdings stolen by the 
Nazis in the World War II era and hidden in various European banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hevesi in December threatened to try to block the proposed  
merger unless the banks settled billions of dollars of claims by 
Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was motivated to drop his opposition after listening  
to reports on the progress of the negotiations over the Holocaust 
claims at an April 15 meeting of the Executive Monitoring 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	During that meeting, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat  
warned that Germany must be free of threats and intimidation as it 
progressed with its historic initiative to settle the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Applying political criteria to the mergers of banks could  
chill investment to the detriment of the U.S. economy as a whole,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hevesi said he also based his decision on letters received from  
Deutsche Bank chairman Rolf Breuer and World Jewish Congress 
Secretary General Israel Singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill McBride, a spokesman for Bankers Trust, said the bank had  
no comment. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank did not immediately 
return a telephone message.

<HEADLINE> AOL Details Netscape Deal Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior executive with America Online confirmed  
today that early discussions with Netscape over a nearly $10 
billion merger were taking place in the months before the Microsoft 
trial began, and that AOL considered the impact of the deal on the 
trial's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dismissed as an issue not having an impact on our  
decision either way'', said Barry Schuler, president of AOL's 
interactive services division. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler said that AOL senior vice president George Vradenburg  
brought up the issue during an internal meeting late in November. 
The trial began October 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler said that the earliest discussion with Netscape started  
late in the summer, and acknowledged that by the middle of October, 
AOL had completed a 71 page analysis of the deal code-named 
``Project Odyssey''. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, reporters were allowed to attend at least  
part of Schuler's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler, 45, is the leader of the transition team charged with  
merging Netscape's operations into AOL's. He also oversees the 
company's plans to offer its service on a variety of computer 
devices, its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson previously decided  
to allow Microsoft -- in the middle of its antitrust trial -- to 
begin gathering evidence about the implications of AOL's recent 
$9.9 billion purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, with nearly 17 million subscribers, is the world's largest  
Internet provider. Netscape produces successful Web browsing 
software and owns Netcenter, one of the most popular sites on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft believes that AOL's purchase of Netscape undermines  
that government's antitrust charges, by showing that competition is 
thriving in the high tech industry and that federal intervention is 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler also acknowledged today that AOL was concerned about the  
perception of its deal by Microsoft and the public, and tried to 
present the purchase as focusing primarily on the business 
involving Netscape's internet site and its business software, not 
its web browser. But Schuler said that it was driven by AOL's 
belief that too much emphasis on the browser would affect the 
deal's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want the valuation of the deal to be based on  
browser market share,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler said earlier that he was originally lukewarm about  
purchasing Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt there was a part of their business, compatible with  
ours and another part outside our core competency. And I thought 
the browser as a business was dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the sale was announced last November, the judge  
suggested that there ``might be a very significant change in the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is currently in a lengthy recess and not expected to  
resume until later this month.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened slightly higher. The  
Dow Jones industrial average is up 16 points in today's early 
going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 4-3 lead 
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up twelve points and the S&AMP;P 500

</P>
<P>
	It looks to be an important session for the market, after  
yesterday's sharp declines. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one mildly positive development for stocks today -- a  
modest decline in bond market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	A steep rise in rates yesterday provided the impetus for Wall

</P>
<P>
	There is talk among market-watchers that Monday's Dow close  
above 11,000 could prove to be a market top for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one economic report to watch for today, the  
government's March report on factory orders.

<P>
	And on Friday, the Labor Department releases its April  
unemployment report.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Wonder, Worry About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The regular season ends tonight, and for the  
first time in a long while, the Chicago Bulls don't have much to 
show for it. Nothing they'd like to brag about, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no Central Division crown, no home-court advantage, not  
even a spot in the playoffs. Nope, it's lottery time for the 
defending champs. 
</P>
<P>
	But what if the Bulls hadn't demolished their team after Michael  
Jordan retired? Say Scottie Pippen and the rest of the gang had 
stuck around for one more year, what then? Could Chicago have won 
the East and, possibly, a seventh title? 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just by looking at what's been going on, it's been kind of a  
neck-and-neck run with all of the other teams trying to position 
themselves. No question if we'd kept the team together we'd be 
defending our title again,'' said Dickey Simpkins, one of the few 
Bulls left over from last year's title team. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael was such a big part in the locker room. He made  
everyone around him better, and filling that hole would have been 
near impossible,'' general manager Jerry Krause said. ``We thought 
we could win a bunch of games, but winning a championship, we did 
not think we had the ability to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause isn't just defending himself. Remember the first time  
Jordan retired? The Bulls had Pippen, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, B.J. 
Armstrong, Horace Grant, John Paxson and Bill Cartwright, and they 
still got bounced in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now add five years to those legs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would have been probably the oldest team in the league.  
Older teams are more susceptible to injuries than younger teams,'' 
Krause said. ``Not only that, if we had given the contracts it 
would have taken to sign these guys, for the next several years we 
would have then been capped with the oldest team in the league and 
no way to get younger. 
</P>
<P>
	``And one of the worst things I think you can do is come fairly  
close and be old and capped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Jordan, the Bulls were showing signs of wear and tear.  
They barely got by Indiana in last year's Eastern Conference 
finals. Not even ``Judge Judy'' could have reconciled coach Phil 
Jackson and Krause. Dennis Rodman was getting weirder -- and that's 
tough to do. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bulls weren't exactly young, either, with Longley the  
only starter under 30. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Jordan hung up his sneakers in January, the Bulls  
decided it was best to gut the team and start over. The first to go 
was Pippen, who -- feeling underappreciated and underpaid -- was 
looking to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to come out west, so I don't know what would  
have happened,'' said Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
deal with the Rockets. ``I was looking to move on, and that's what 
I did. Whether or not we could have stayed together as a team and 
been successful is difficult to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not as if any team is lighting up the league. Indiana,  
anointed the favorite before the lockout even ended, has struggled. 
Miami lost to the Bulls over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other conference, the Utah Jazz appear vulnerable, the  
Rockets have yet to live up to their hype and the Los Angeles 
Lakers seem to need therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would have brought everyone back, who knows?'' said  
former Bull Jud Buechler, now with the Detroit Pistons. ``If there 
weren't any injuries to our team, I think we could have been in the 
mix for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the what-ifs don't really matter now. What's done is done,  
said Ron Harper, the only starter left in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look around and sit back and say, `I'd hoped we had  
our same team here,' '' he said. ``If we would have kept half our 
team here, I think we would have been there. But it didn't happen, 
so life goes on.''

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp., the media empire controlled by  
Rupert Murdoch, reported a sharp drop in net income compared to a 
year ago, when results got a big boost from the success of the 
movie ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney, Australia-based company earned $97 million in the  
three months ending in March, compared to $268 million in the same 
period a year ago. The net income worked out to 9 cents per 
U.S.-listed share, compared to 27 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues declined 3.8 percent to $3.10 billion from $3.22  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest factor behind the drop was the huge lift to the  
company's movie division a year ago thanks to the success of 
``Titanic,'' the biggest box-office hit ever. Earnings at News 
Corp.'s filmed entertainment division dropped to $38 million 
compared to $145 million a year go. 
</P>
<P>
	The net earnings were also affected by a one-time loss of $71  
million, much of which the company attributed to foreign exchange 
losses at its satellite television business in Brazil, which 
devalued its currency earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Twentieth Century Fox Television group had several  
new hits, including ``Futurama'' and ``Family Guy.'' That division 
also produces ``The Simpsons,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Ally 
McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox network also posted gains, as strong advertising gains  
from the Super Bowl offset lower ratings from National Hockey 
League games and higher costs for football broadcasting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. also publishes books under the HarperCollins label  
and runs several newspapers and magazines, includined the Times of 
London, The Sun and The Weekly Standard.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Protection for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The hundreds of thousands of ethnic  
Albanians who have fled Kosovo won't return home unless an armed 
international force is deployed to protect them, the head of the 
U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, a good number of the refugees won't ever want to  
return home, and the countries that are currently housing them must 
be prepared to keep them, said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
Sadako Ogata. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major issues dividing Yugoslavia and NATO on Kosovo  
is the type of international force that would be dispatched to the 
Serb province once a settlement is reached on ending the NATO 
airstrikes and allowing for the return of the nearly 695,000 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has said that its members must form the core of such a  
force, and that troops must be well-armed. Belgrade has indicated 
it would only accept a U.N.-controlled, non-NATO international 
force, armed only with personal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata, briefing the Security Council on requirements for the  
refugees' return, said an unarmed force would ``prove inadequate,'' 
in Kosovo because it hadn't been enough before. 
</P>
<P>
	She was referring to the unarmed monitors from the Organization  
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who oversaw the October 
cease-fire between ethnic Albanians and Serb military forces in 
Kosovo but could do little as it fell to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that it is very unlikely that any refugee  
will return to Kosovo unless Serbian forces withdraw, and 
international armed forces are deployed in the province to keep 
peace,'' said Ogata. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees will also only return if the world launches a major  
reconstruction program to rebuild Kosovo as soon as a political 
settlement is reached, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some refugees will never opt to return. ``I foresee a  
mixed scenario eventually prevailing, with some refugees returning 
and others remaining in host countries,'' Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge numbers of refugees have overwhelmed neighboring  
Albania and Macedonia. The Macedonian government has said it wants 
all the refugees to return home eventually, since it fears the 
influx of ethnic Albanians will disrupt the country's ethnic 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Several countries are taking in refugees on a temporary basis,  
with the United States agreeing to house 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata stressed the need to protect refugees in surrounding  
countries, saying there were already instances of ethnic Albanians 
being smuggled out of camps into Italy and other European Union 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Young women are being forced into prostitution and there is a  
risk of forced recruitment of refugees by the Kosovo Liberation 
Army, which is fighting for independence for Kosovo, Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogata briefed the council a day after U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan announced his intention to send a U.N. team to 
Yugoslavia to assess what needs to be done to allow the refugees to 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, Yugoslavia hadn't responded to Annan's request  
that the team be allowed entry and be given security guarantees, 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Urged To Replace DA in Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued an  
unprecedented call Wednesday to replace the county district 
attorney with a special prosecutor in abuse cases involving Los 
Angeles police and sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	After a six-year review, commissioners said that because police  
and the district attorney work closely in other criminal 
prosecutions, the DA's work in officer-involved cases can create 
the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you separate those functions ... you can try to institute  
more fairness,'' said Mary Frances Berry, commission chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the eight board members dissented in the report,  
calling the recommendation an ``overreaction.'' Police officials 
also disagreed with the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's 233-page report pointed to the district  
attorney's track record in prosecuting accused police officers and 
sheriff's deputies. Criminal charges were filed against 11 deputies 
in 126 cases of alleged abuse in the Sheriff's Department in 1996 
and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations are not binding, but departments usually  
implement them, Ms. Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a Los Angeles police spokesman, said his  
department has serious concerns about the report. ``The conclusions 
are simply not based on fact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also included sweeping generalizations, outdated  
information and inaccurate findings, he said. Kalish criticized the 
heavy reliance on newspaper accounts and witnesses with ``an 
agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's use-of-force incidents have dropped, its  
diversity has increased and an ombudsman has been added to the 
staff to handle internal disputes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sheriff's Department spokesman and a spokeswoman for the  
district attorney had not seen the report and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil Rights Commission began its investigation into the  
LAPD and the Sheriff's Department in 1993, as part of a nationwide 
project on racial and ethnic tensions.

	Relief Convoy Said Hit in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A relief convoy from the Greek  
branch of Doctors of the World was hit by a bomb today while en 
route from Macedonia to Kosovo's capital, the humanitarian group 
said. No injuries were reported. The three trucks and a jeep 
carrying medicine to a Pristina hospital were traveling near 
Djeneral Jankovic at about noon when the relief convoy was 
attacked. A NATO military spokesman denied allied forces had hit 
the aid convoy. Yugoslavian media, however, said NATO attacked the 
convoy.

don't they?'' Clinton said of Spc. Steven Gonzales, Staff Sgt.

captured March 31 while on patrol in Macedonia. The men were 
released Saturday after Jesse Jackson met with Yugoslav President

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- School officials say it could cost $50  
million to repair damage to Columbine High School and help students 
and staff deal with the shooting attack's aftermath. The costs 
would include building repairs, replacement of supplies, victims'

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of wiretaps authorized by state  
courts rose by 24 percent last year, while the number of federally 
authorized wiretaps held steady, the government reported today. 
Buggings in New York made up almost half of the state-authorized 
wiretaps, with 373. Seventy-two percent of all wiretaps were aimed 
at catching narcotics offenders, while 12 percent were aimed at 
racketeering and 7 percent at gambling. Telephone wiretaps made up 
40 percent of all devices installed, while 46 percent were 
electronic wiretaps of digital display pagers, voice pagers, 
cellular phones and e-mail.

	Dinosaurs Grew Wings but Why?  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new study suggests that the ancestors of  
birds may have evolved wings not for flying but for running faster. 
Many scientists believe birds descended from two-legged dinosaurs. 
The problem has been explaining how the clawed dinosaur forelimbs 
developed into the wings of the first known bird, Archaeopteryx, 
which lived 140 million to 150 million years ago. But two 
paleontologists believe the crow-sized Archaeopteryx took off from 
the ground. They calculate that the small dinosaur could almost 
quadruple its running speed with thrust from flapping its wings.

second wife in a hot tub. Timothy Boczkowski was found guilty of 
murder in the 1994 death of Maryann Boczkowski at their home. He 
could get the death penalty. Prosecutors said he killed his wife 
because he did not want children and she was about to leave him.

	Fed Reports Economy at Strong Level

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve says the U.S. economy is  
continuing to expand, but inflation does not appear to be a major 
threat. The Beige Book economic survey found growth in March and 
April, while prices were generally holding steady. The report finds 
wages were not rising, despite tight job markets in many areas of 
the country. U.S. central bankers use the report to set interest 
rates. They are scheduled to meet May 18, but no change is

<HEADLINE> Hugh Downs Is Retiring From '20/20' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Genial broadcaster Hugh Downs, who has been a  
host of ABC's ``20/20'' since its second week in 1978, said 
Wednesday he's leaving the show in September. 
</P>
<P>
	True to form for someone who studied gerontology and launched a  
side business on keeping active in the later years, the 78-year-old 
Downs didn't mention retirement. Rather, he said he wants to pursue 
opportunities in new media. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fast-moving cybernetic age holds such challenge and  
opportunity that I now find it irresistible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs, who splits his time between homes in Arizona and New  
York, has been cutting back his time on ``20/20.'' The newsmagazine 
airs five times a week. He is co-host of the Friday broadcast with 
Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akron, Ohio, native began working at NBC after serving in  
the Army during World War II. He was host of NBC's ``Caesar's 
Hour'' with Sid Caesar and helped launch the ``Tonight'' show with 
Jack Paar in 1957. Downs was also host of the daytime game show, 
``Concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downs began a nine-year hitch on the ``Today'' show in 1962 and  
he narrated many NBC nature documentaries. He was lured back into 
network news in 1978. Ms. Walters joined as co-anchor of 20/20 in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guinness Book of Records certified him in 1985 as having  
logged the greatest number of hours on network commercial 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a reason for that,'' said ABC News Chairman Roone  
Arledge. ``His warmth, intelligence and his common sense have 
endeared him to generations of viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anchor lineup for next season's ``20/20'' will be announced  
later this month.

<HEADLINE>  Jazz Reject Is Clippers Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Troy Hudson's name is not familiar but NBA  
fans are seeing a lot of him lately. He's the guy darting into the 
paint and making spectacular plays that show up on the late-night 
NBA highlights of another Los Angeles Clippers loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson was getting noticed even as the Clippers slid through  
another miserable season. ``I'm still just grateful I'm getting a 
shot,'' he said. ``Fortunately, I'm getting some minutes here, and 
I'm showing what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, Hudson was hoping the Sioux Falls Skyforce would  
make a long run through the CBA playoffs, the better to collect 
playoff money and gain exposure for an NBA shot next season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he played all 48 minutes of the Clippers' 99-82 loss  
to the Utah Jazz, recording 15 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all happened really fast,'' Hudson said. ``Sometimes I  
don't know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During another disastrous season for the Clippers, Hudson  
emerged as a dependable, sometimes brilliant point guard. In the 
last two weeks, he became LA's starter at the point, averaging more 
than 14 points, nine assists and five rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	After originally signing him to a 10-day contract as a temporary  
injury replacement, the Clippers, who ended their season Wednesday 
against Seattle, now have him locked up through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very thankful that we picked him up,'' Clippers coach  
Chris Ford said. ``I'm glad everybody else made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were perhaps the only team in the league that knew  
Hudson's potential. Utah had him on its roster early last season, 
but the rookie was the fourth point guard on the depth chart and 
was cut when John Stockton returned from an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson returned to the Delta Center Tuesday, bearing little  
resemblance to the timid rookie the Jazz remembered. He wears his 
hair in Allen Iverson-style cornrows now, and he ran the Clippers' 
offense with a confidence belying his 33 games of NBA experience. 
</P>
<P>
	As the season wound down, Hudson treated every night in the big  
leagues as an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can match up blow-for-blow with the best point guards  
in the world, that's what you dream about when you're down in the 
CBA,'' Hudson said. ``That's what every young point guard wants to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson left Southern Illinois after two seasons and entered the  
1997 NBA draft, but wasn't selected. He was invited to play with a 
Jazz summer-league entry, and he surprised almost everyone by 
making the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy was one of those guys who has trouble getting a shot in  
this league for whatever reason,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. 
``We liked him a lot, but we didn't need another player at his 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finished last year in the CBA. The Timberwolves cut him in  
January, and he was still in Sioux Falls when the Clippers, 
desperate for a point guard, gave him a call. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hudson arrived, the Clippers' guards began falling like  
dominoes. Darrick Martin, Pooh Richardson and Sherman Douglas were 
out with a variety of injuries during the last two weeks, leaving 
Hudson as the team's only healthy point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy has been asked to do a monumental task in the last few  
days ... and he's done a very good job,'' Ford said. ``He's gifted 
with tremendous quickness and a good shooting touch, and his 
decision-making is getting better all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Plans Stock Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Calling it ``the first real European  
stock,'' Deutsche Telekom said it will offer identical incentives 
to private investors in the 11 countries using Europe's new single 
currency when it sells shares in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned share offering will be the second for the former  
telephone monopoly since the government began privatizing it in 
November 1996. The government still holds about 72 percent of the 
phone company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Ron Sommer said the company would decide in late May  
the exact number of new shares being issued. The offering is 
expected to boost Telekom's capital by up to 10 percent. Trading of 
the new shares will start June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail investors who subscribe during the early order period  
from June 7-15 will get a discount of around 2 percent to 5 percent 
of the price to be paid by institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail investors will also be offered bonus shares in the early  
subscription period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer said the same conditions would be available to investors  
in any of the 11 euro-zone countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom's initial public offering in 1996 brought the company  
about 20 billion marks, or $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer also reaffirmed his company's planned merger with Telecom  
Italia SpA, saying ``size will be a decisive success factor'' in 
the highly competitive and lucrative global telecommunications 
market.

<HEADLINE> Universal Developing Music Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Universal, the world's largest music company,  
is investing in technology for selling and distributing music over 
the Internet, independently of an industry-wide effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The music industry as a whole has been scrambling to find an  
alternative to the popular MP3 format. That format allows near-CD 
quality recordings to be transmitted over the Internet and stored 
on computers, but has led to widespread piracy as people trade 
unauthorized copies for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's announcement on Tuesday signals its impatience with  
the industry's initiative, led by the Secure Digital Music 
Initiative, an ad hoc committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of the Seagram Co.,  
said it was working with Intertrust Technologies Corp. of 
Sunnyvale, Calif., to develop the necessary software. 
</P>
<P>
	Intertrust's technology, dubbed Digibox, is designed to embed a  
code within recorded music that would prevent consumers from 
listening to it without paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal decided to move ahead because it wants to be able to  
sell music online by Christmas, said Larry Kenswil, the company's 
head of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand is there, and demand is being filled now by  
independent labels and illegal content,'' he said. ``It's crazy for 
us not to recognize demand and move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenswil said the Digibox software is flexible enough to comply  
with whatever standard the ad hoc committee comes up with. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts said Universal is the first major record label  
to announce plans publicly to distribute music over the Internet. 
Several smaller independent labels and artists, such as Public 
Enemy, already distribute music online, some using the MP3 format.

	Mark Hardie, a digital music analyst with Forrester Research in  
Cambridge, Mass., said Universal is breaking ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that the major record companies have moved from their  
original position that everything via the Internet is bad and 
pirated to saying this is the time to begin testing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Secure Digital Music Initiative, Leonardo  
Chiariglione, said he wasn't bothered by Universal's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``S.D.M.I. is about a framework,'' he said. ``It's not about  
telling them how to do a particular thing.''

<HEADLINE> Apache Helicopter Crash Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- An U.S. Apache helicopter crashed  
Wednesday while on a training mission near the Albanian capital, 
killing two crew members, U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths were the first NATO casualties in the air operation  
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The AH-64 helicopter went down at 1:30 a.m. local time 47 miles  
northeast of the Tirana airport, the command said in a statement 
issued in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen at the NATO military office south of Brussels said the  
crash site was within Albania's borders, near Macedonia and 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Command statement said there were no initial  
indications of hostile fire and the cause of the crash was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The identification of the crewmen was withheld pending  
notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aircraft was conducting a training mission in support of  
Operation Allied Force,'' the command said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second crash of an Apache in two weeks. Last week,  
another helicopter gunship went down in flames, also while on a 
training mission in Albania. Its crewmen escaped with cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, two U.S. warplanes operating over and around  
Yugoslavia went down. A U.S. Marine Corps AV8B Harrier plane 
crashed in the Adriatic Sea while on a training mission for 
operations in the Balkans. The pilot was reported safely rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, a U.S. F-16 fighter plane had gone down over  
western Serbia. NATO said the crash was caused by engine failure, 
but Yugoslav authorities claimed the jet was shot down. The pilot 
was rescued by NATO.

<HEADLINE> The Making of 'The Castle' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The story behind the making of ``The Castle'' is  
as fascinating as the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the movie.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Castle'' is the story of a shockingly sweet Australian  
family who fights big government's plans to evict them from their 
modest home. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the film so endearing is the family: dad, mom, one  
daughter and three sons (one in jail). The Kerrigans have a 
motorboat in their front yard and some pet greyhounds in the back. 
They love each other as much as they love their home at 3 High View 
Crescent. 
</P>
<P>
	And who wouldn't love their home? Built on a toxic landfill, the  
house is located next to the airport runway and towering 
high-voltage power lines. There's a huge TV antenna and a fake 
chimney on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Tow-truck driver Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) is the family  
patriarch. He constantly praises his wife's cooking, couldn't be 
more proud of his children, and always marvels at the beauty around 
him -- like those power lines and the smell of diesel fuel in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	When his house is ``compulsorily acquired'' for expansion of the  
airport, Kerrigan puts up a fight. ``I'm not interested in 
compensation,'' he says. ``I don't want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the story behind the story: How a group of filmmakers used  
their own money to shoot a 16 mm film about a happy family; a film 
wildly successful in Australia, a hit at the 1998 Sundance Film 
Festival, and picked up by Miramax for release in the United States 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Castle'' was shot on location in Melbourne and Canberra in  
11 days with a Super 16 mm camera and on a budget of less than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case of life imitating art, the family was named Kerrigan  
so filmmakers could borrow trucks from an actual tow-truck company, 
Kerrigans Towing. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers also cut the shooting schedule from 20 days to 11  
-- the number of days they could afford to feed the cast and crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Castle'' is the first feature film for Working Dog Ltd.,  
which has produced award-winning radio and television programs in 
Australia. A four-person creative team conceived and wrote the 
script, and took on several other tasks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Sitch directed. Jane Kennedy did the casting. Santo Cilauro  
was a camera operator -- ``the guys sort of realized I was handy 
with the old wedding camera.'' Michael Hirsh, according to the 
production notes, ``just hung around criticizing the caterers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome met in the mid-1980s while attending the same  
university, where they formed a student comedy revue. A talent 
scout spotted ``The D Generation'' and asked the group to write a 
sketch comedy pilot for television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We planned a lot,'' Sitch explained during an interview at  
Miramax. ``Every word that was on the script ended up on the film. 
There was no improvisation. None. We used multiple cameras. We 
said, 'Light it as bland as you can, don't move the camera and 
people will get used to its real simplicity after a short period of 
time.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the budget was so tight, every scene was shot in two  
takes. ``Good actors can respond to that,'' Sitch said. ``I think 
everyone liked it because we weren't shooting with multiple 
cameras, so they knew if it was a good take, it was all there. And 
we were never going to do much coverage, you know, superclose-ups 
or dollies. The day was quick. We were shooting nine, 10 minutes a 
day, which for movies, I'm ashamed to say, is fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How could a family be so blissfully ignorant that their house is  
not a castle, but an eyesore? 
</P>
<P>
	``Reality is what you believe it to be,'' Sitch said, explaining  
that the Kerrigans value the idea of a home that holds their 
memories; a place that can't be taken away with an offer of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the other central truth that we put at the heart of the  
film ... is that our world is set up to believe that the dollar 
value is everything. But in the end, it keeps coming back that you 
have to value it personally. You have to decide its value. And the 
dollar doesn't do the best job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it was the Kerrigans' lovely innocence that the  
filmmakers hoped would shine through -- even on 16 mm film. ``What 
we aimed towards is for people to leave the movie theater with a 
big smile on their face,'' Sitch said.

<HEADLINE> Ammaccapane Making LPGA Comeback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Danielle Ammaccapane is glad to be  
defending her title in the LPGA Titleholders Championship. Everyone 
else is simply happy to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammaccapane developed tendinitis in both wrists and in her left  
shoulder after the Dinah Shore at the end of March and hasn't 
played since. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't have to defend my title, I might not have come,''  
she said. ``It hurt a lot and it hurts now. If I miss a shot, it 
lets me know that I didn't do very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been worse. Ammaccapane could have been in perfect  
health and had nothing to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	Once one of the most storied tournaments in LPGA history, the  
Titleholders has fallen on lean times since its tradition was 
resurrected in 1996 and the event was moved to the LPGA 
International course at tour headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	One of only seven women's events on national television this  
year, the Titleholders ran into sponsorship problems early in the 
year and was bailed out only when the tour decided to subsidize the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury, the official car of the LPGA Tour, wanted to be a  
presenting sponsor, but agreed to take on the role of title sponsor 
for one more year. The purse dropped from $1 million to $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little scary there for a second,'' Ammaccapane said.  
``I don't think it would have looked very good -- this is our 
headquarters and we lose our tournament. I knew they would do 
something. We're happy that we're here, and it's not like we're 
playing for $500,000. It's still a pretty big tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many respects, it still is.  
</P>
<P>
	The Titleholders dates to 1937, when it was played at Augusta  
Country Club on the course adjacent to where the men play the 
Masters. A green jacket is awarded to the winner, although being 
seen in one is not as big of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clashes with everything I have,'' Ammaccapane said.  
</P>
<P>
	The roll call of champions includes Patty Berg, Babe Zaharias,  
Louise Suggs, Mickey Wright and Kathy Whitworth. Like Augusta 
National, the Titleholders invites select amateur champions -- five 
of them will tee it up this week with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuing the Titleholders was a top priority when Ty Votaw took  
over as commissioner, and he sees nothing wrong with having to 
inject some of the tour's money -- which he described only as ``five 
figures'' -- into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw said the investment was no different than the PGA Tour  
adding money to the Tucson Open purse when it staged the Match Play 
Championship the same week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different reason for the investment, but it's still  
an investment,'' Votaw said. ``That's what businesses do every day 
-- reinvest their dividends to make their business better. That's 
what we're doing here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of providing economic opportunity for  
our members,'' he said. ``Certainly to have them play for $900,000 
... the players have responded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-three of the top 100 on the money list are in the field.  
Among the defectors are Liselotte Neumann and Se Ri Pak, who 
decided to play in the Gunze Cup in Japan this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that they might have made a difference.  
</P>
<P>
	Pak, coming off two major championships her rookie season, has  
yet to record a top 10 this year. Karrie Webb, who won a 
Titleholders green jacket in 1996, is at the other end of the 
spectrum -- she has yet to finish out of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb's worst tournament was in Tucson, where she had her worst  
score of the year -- a 74 -- and wound up in a tie for eighth. She 
has won three times, setting the LPGA scoring record of 26-under 
262 in the Australian Masters, and has finished in the top three in 
seven of nine events. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference between her and David Duval is one victory,  
one 59 and a whole lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
	With LPGA purses being one-fourth of what they are on the PGA  
Tour, Webb has earned $578,724 this year compared to nearly $2.5 
million for Duval. Forty-seven golfers on the PGA Tour have made 
more than Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, her lead is so substantial that Juli Inkster could win  
the next two tournaments and still be No. 2 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love where I am right now,'' Webb said. ``I don't really  
look at anyone chasing me. But we've got a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titleholders event, on the other hand, has come a long way  
in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to lose tournaments sometimes, and hopefully, we  
won't lose this one,'' Nancy Lopez said. ``I don't know what's been 
talked about behind closed doors. I'm just glad we're here this 
year.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Warned Gov't of Netscape Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America Online Inc. revealed Wednesday that a  
senior executive privately warned a top government lawyer weeks 
before the start of the Microsoft trial that AOL was actively 
involved in sensitive negotiations with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Those talks culminated months later in AOL's nearly $10 billion  
purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer 
whose Web browsing software is a focal point of the government's 
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has maintained that it didn't know about the plans by  
two of its chief software rivals until news reports of the deal 
surfaced late in November, and that it wasn't able to explore the 
implications of the new alliance on its antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to use the information during the next phase of the  
case, expected to resume later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Oct. 19. The government's first witnesses  
included senior executives from Netscape and AOL, who never 
disclosed their merger plans to the judge or to Microsoft lawyers 
in open court. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends the deal undermines the government's  
antitrust allegations by showing that competition is thriving in 
the high-tech industry and that federal intervention is 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's dramatic disclosure came in a deposition by Barry  
Schuler, 45, the AOL executive assigned to coordinate the merger 
with Netscape and also the company's president of interactive 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, reporters were allowed to attend part of  
Schuler's questioning because of an obscure 1913 law covering 
antitrust depositions, which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler denied that America Online, the world's largest Internet  
provider, gave to the Justice Department in advance full details of 
its plans to buy Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said previously that it didn't know about the  
merger until November. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schuler acknowledged that AOL Senior Vice President George  
Vradenburg talked privately with Justice lawyer David Boies before 
the Oct. 3 pretrial deposition of AOL executive David Colburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding was that, prior to Mr. Colburn's deposition,  
there was a communication where DOJ was given a heads-up that very 
preliminary discussions were going on of a sensitive business 
nature,'' Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler added that AOL did not want the information disclosed  
publicly and that the company feared Microsoft would try to find 
ways to publicize the negotiations during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said he believed Microsoft eventually learned the information that 
AOL had provided to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official said Microsoft never was told that a $9.9  
billion AOL-Netscape merger might be imminent because of the 
ambiguity of the information from Vradenburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding was that this related to specific browser  
technology,'' this official said. Microsoft ``was aware of what we 
took to be at issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler said the companies first began talking about a merger in  
late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the intrigue surrounding AOL's disclosure, Schuler  
said Vradenburg told him about his private conversation with Boies 
only hours before Wednesday's deposition -- despite Schuler's 
testimony that he spent 30 hours over the last four days with his 
own lawyers preparing to be questioned by Microsoft. Vradenburg 
worked at the same law firm as Boies years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuler also acknowledged that AOL had considered but dismissed  
the possible impact of its deal with Netscape on the outcome of the 
Microsoft trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dismissed as an issue not having an impact on our  
decision either way,'' Schuler said, adding that Vradenburg raised 
the question during a meeting of AOL executives late in November.

<HEADLINE> Children's Reye's Syndrome Now Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Reye's syndrome, a rare but deadly disorder usually caused by  
giving aspirin to children with flu or chickenpox, has almost 
disappeared, thanks to a public education campaign and changes in 
treatment, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	From a high of 555 cases among American children in 1980,  
doctors have reported no more than 36 cases per year since 1987, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, when the connection between aspirin and Reye's syndrome  
was discovered, the CDC began warning doctors and parents not to 
give aspirin to children with viral infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon general issued a warning in 1982 and aspirin began  
carrying warning labels in 1986. Since then, acetaminophen, the 
ingredient in pain relievers such as Tylenol, has replaced aspirin 
in most medications for treating fever and aches in children. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Reye's syndrome has become so rare that children  
with typical symptoms -- vomiting, confusion, delirium and other 
mental symptoms -- should be tested for various rare, inherited 
enzyme deficiencies, the researchers said. The lack of critical 
enzymes can cause imbalances in metabolism that lead to symptoms 
mimicking Reye's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The study appears in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.

<HEADLINE> DirecTV Vows To Show Local Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite TV  
company, said Wednesday that it will eventually provide some of its 
customers with local broadcast television programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's plans depend on the Federal Communications  
Commission approving additional satellite capacity and whether 
Congress enacts legislation that would give satellite companies, 
for the first time, the right to carry local TV signals on their 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has passed a satellite TV bill that would do this. The  
Senate could vote on its version of the bill later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV plans to provide local signals via satellite that could  
reach 50 million people -- or half of the nation's TV households. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's announcement also gives the satellite TV industry  
a more unified lobbying front on Capitol Hill -- something that 
should help the industry obtain a final satellite TV bill that it 
would like, said Charlie Ergen, CEO of EchoStar, a big satellite TV 
provider.

<HEADLINE> New World of Parsley Blooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- In my long-ago youth, parsley to me was  
a mossy-looking green that garnished a dish. Then I took up 
gardening and a whole new parsley world bloomed. 
</P>
<P>
	The curled, garnish variety I encounter occasionally now only in  
restaurants. What I cultivate is the much tastier variety known as 
plainleaf or Italian parsley. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever kind you like, this herb is easy to grow in North  
and South and enjoys a colorful history. Beloved of Greeks and 
Romans, the ancients believed it kept you from getting drunk. 
Supposedly, its pleasant smell absorbed the inebriating fumes of 
wine. It also kept your breath sweet after heavily seasoned meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The herb was used in festive garlands and for the victor's crown  
in some sports. 
</P>
<P>
	I grow plainleaf parsley the year around, in the garden in  
season and indoors under lights in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The variety I get from Shepherd's Garden Seeds (30 Irene Street,  
Torrington, Conn. 06790-6658, telephone 860-482-3638, www. 
shepherdseeds.com) is marketed as ``Gigante d'Italia'' and it lives 
up to the name. 
</P>
<P>
	With a spread of up to two inches, the leaves are truly big, as  
herb leaves go. They are deep green and shiny and they mix easily 
with lettuce for a flavorful salad. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaves are large enough for me to debauch occasionally on a  
salad of parsley alone. Besides its attractive flavor, I'm thinking 
it's good for me. Parsley contains an astonishing assortment of 
vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	The herb also is linked to medicinal uses. Because of its  
estrogen content, it is sometimes recommended for women in 
menopause. A good diuretic, it also is said to help out with gas 
and with coughs and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its role in salads, plainleaf parsley is often added to  
the basil base of pesto to give this popular pasta condiment a 
slightly different tang. And parsley itself forms the main herb 
ingredient of salsa verde (green sauce), another much-used 
condiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another parsley variety is Neapolitan, whose leaf stalks are  
eaten like celery. And there is Hamburg parsley with fine white 
roots that are cultivated like parsnips. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant in fact belongs to the celery family, which includes  
carrots, parsnips, caraway, dill, the wildflower Queen Anne's lace 
and the very poisonous water hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsley's lovely trident leaves and deep green color are easy on  
the eyes and play a role in a flower bed. And the curled variety 
can give a mossy effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Another plus for this herb is its seasonal longevity. Where  
basil expires at the slightest touch of frost, parsley thrives 
right into freezes of early winter in my southern New York climate. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is actually a biennial that in the North can survive  
winter under a protective mulch and put out new leaves in early 
spring. In the South, a winter crop may be planted in early fall 
that keeps producing as long as the temperature stays above 20 
degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	I've found the best way to grow parsley is to start the tiny  
seeds indoors under lights. They take their time to germinate, as 
long as four weeks, making seed loss high if sowed outdoors where 
it's difficult to control conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Once started, the plant is so adaptable that I've followed  
various courses. One way was to start the seeds indoors in 
September, transplant one or two plants into pots, and keep them 
producing on the shelf all winter. When spring came, I would 
transplant them into the garden, where they would keep going until 
early winter, 
</P>
<P>
	Another way was to start seeds indoors in March and move the  
seedlings into the garden in late April or early May after they 
acquired some girth. They'd produce all summer and then I would dig 
up a plant or two in October and move them indoors for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	They also can be kept in pots outdoors without needing to  
transplant them into the ground. They prosper in partial shade as 
well as full sun. 
</P>
<P>
	One important thing about starting seeds indoors: Be sure to  
keep the flat close to the lights, about an inch or so away, 
otherwise the seedlings will elongate and fail. Lights are much 
weaker than the sun, so plants need to get close. 
</P>

you play? What are your hobbies? What do you do differently on the 
weekend than on a school day? Is anybody home when you return from 
school? How do you feel about your parents? Your brothers or 
sisters? 
</P>
<P>
	``My sister annoys me,'' one boy, Will, confides. ``She's a  
teen-ager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras mounted on the wall record the answers, and Nickelodeon  
executives watch from behind a one-way mirror. The network's 
success depends on knowing as much as possible about boys like 
these. No detail is too arcane. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is serious business at Nick and its cable cousins, MTV  
and VHI. Most networks just want to know what you think about their 
shows, but here they want to know YOU. They're developing a 
portrait of a new generation, and using it to guide virtually 
everything that goes on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy has served the networks well; they're among the  
most profitable in television. But it raises questions about the 
use of innocents for commercial gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really important for Nickelodeon to look at the world  
from a kid's point of view,'' said Herb Scannell, the network's 
president. ``And if you want to look at the world from a kid's 
point of view, the most important thing is to get a kid's point of 
view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful research arm of MTV Networks was built out of  
corporate necessity. When they were born, cable networks were 
barely on the radar screen of Nielsen Media Research, the company 
that measures viewership. The people who ran MTV and Nick needed 
some way to prove to cable operators and advertisers that people 
were interested in what they offered. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why MTV's first major ad campaigns brought in rock stars  
to demand, ``I want my MTV.'' It was a plea to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off competitors, the networks also needed to make  
themselves indispensable -- not just something to watch, but a 
friend. To keep friends, you'd better know what they like and don't 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the MTV Networks, research is not a back-room operation,''  
said Betsy Frank, head of the department. ``It is integrated 
completely with the programming department, the scheduling 
department and the marketing department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MTV thrives on being hip, and nothing is more stale than last  
year's style. The network sends teams of researchers onto the 
streets of the trendiest neighborhoods in the country, like Soho in 
New York City, to ask passersby why they're wearing what they're 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The network even hires ``cultural anthropologists'' to visit  
teen-agers' rooms and pick through their closets. What kind of 
socks are they wearing? What posters are on the wall? 
</P>
<P>
	But some research tools strike critics as being too intrusive.  
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon's spin-off network, Noggin, arranged to pay  
thousands of dollars to a school in Montclair, N.J. in exchange for 
allowing it to conduct weekly focus groups. Children were given 
disposable cameras and asked to record their activities in photos 
and words. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon also has a long-standing relationship with an  
``adopted'' day-care center in Harlem, which is paid $100 a month 
to enable the network to test some of its ideas on children. ``It's 
simply wrong to use public schools for snooping into the lives of 
impressionable children,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial 
Alert, a watchdog group on television advertising. ``Schools exist 
to teach kids to learn to reason, not to do market research that 
has no educational value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank said researchers aren't identified as working for  
Nickelodeon when they are in schools or day-care centers. She 
argued that there's a big difference between what Nick is doing and 
corporations that sell products in schools or beam TV shows with 
commercials into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we are bringing something good to the schools and we  
use it to develop programs that are more in tune with what kids 
want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During her ``zoom room'' session, Nickelodeon's Brandt wrote a  
list of topics on an easel: family, grandparents, TV, computers, 
music, friends, clothes. She asked each boy to walk to a corner of 
the room to signify how important each item was in their lives. All 
six moved into the ``very important'' corner when asked about the 
environment, as they did for family. But only one kid ran to the 
very important corner for TV; four went to important and one to not 
very important at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are in the midst of a wide-ranging leisure-time  
study about how young people spend their time, and have probed 
whether their use of computers has cut into TV viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Through such constant questioning, Nick knows that many young  
people feel stressed because of busy schedules and the need to 
pitch in with chores like cleaning and laundry. The networks also 
know that many teen-agers respect their parents -- no generation gap 
here -- and value family activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings guide decisions big and small. The title  
character of Nick's ``Hey Arnold!'' lives with his grandparents, 
and Chucky in ``Rugrats'' doesn't have a mom, because research 
showed so many young people in nontraditional families. Nick wants 
these youngsters to feel they're not unusual, said Cyma Zarghami, 
Nick's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers at MTV's spring break flashed fewer designer labels on  
clothes this year after researchers found many teen-agers resented 
``in your face'' marketing. The rooms on ``Real World'' were 
redecorated because viewers found them too idealized; not many kids 
would have the latest, most expensive computers that MTV had 
supplied cast members with, said top researcher Todd Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	VH1 set up a charity to fund music education in schools after  
surveys of parents indicated how important music was to them, said 
VH1's Colleen Fahey Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Tommy Lynch, creator of Nick's ``The Secret  
World of Alex Mack,'' wrote an episode about a parent-teacher 
conference at school that made the parents the butt of jokes about 
how clueless they were about their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with research showing how kids are liking their parents a  
lot more these days, Lynch made the adult characters much more 
sympathetic when he wrote a similar story for his new show, ``The 
Journey of Allen Strange.'' Parents offer to help their kids with 
homework, and take privileges away as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The research showed us at this time that kids wanted to hang  
out with their parents,'' he said. ``That tells me to make the 
parents a little more real and make the parents involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of research-driven television is that it can stifle  
creativity, placing a premium on giving an audience what it wants 
to see rather than risking innovation. Lynch said he has not been 
dictated to, but admits it's a delicate situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot for ``Alex Mack'' was written with a boy as the lead  
character. Nickelodeon executives suggested making it a girl. He 
agreed, figuring there was a better chance the network would buy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I have a problem is when I have a pilot and it  
doesn't test well,'' he said. ``Then I tend to blame the research 
process. But maybe that's my myopic view of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon's Christine Heye said giving research to producers  
is ``about helping to keep them informed, not necessarily to 
force-feed visions into a creator's mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another measure of the influence of the networks' research  
department, one of its former employees is co-creator of a popular 
Nickelodeon show. Angela Santomero has a master's degree in child 
development psychology. She used it to create ``Blue's Clues,'' an 
interactive show in which preschoolers solve mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm so much smarter about my material when I know what  
the audience is thinking,'' she said. ``I know why a show works or 
doesn't work.''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Rescuers Also Lose Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- As spokesman for the city's fire  
department, Jon Hansen has had to talk about tragedies on a daily 
basis, from the Oklahoma City bombing aftermath to the smallest of 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he had to deal with his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be able to live in it anymore,'' Hansen said of his  
house, which was lost to a tornado Monday. ``But like the majority 
of public safety workers, we're focused on those who lost their 
lives. We didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assistant fire chief was left with little more than his  
daughter's pets -- a guinea pig and fish --and some clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's tornadoes killed at least 38 people in Oklahoma. At  
least 3,000 homes were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the small unincorporated town of Bridge Creek, two  
firefighters who lost their homes helped search for five people who 
were still missing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure these guys would appreciate any help, but they don't  
want any glory or recognition. They just want to get out there and 
find those people,'' a dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 38 Oklahoma City firefighters or police officers had  
homes that were damaged or destroyed, police Sgt. Nate Tarver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Homes of three Midwest City police officers and one firefighter  
were destroyed. Two police officers in Del City kept working even 
though they were homeless. The rescue workers didn't want their 
names given. 
</P>
<P>
	``They searched 12 to 15 hours a day just like anybody else even  
when offered a chance to go home,'' said Del City police spokesman 
Jody Suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said it's in the Oklahoma spirit to bury individual  
matters and work as a whole. It's a spirit that survived the 1995 
Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's ever gone,'' he said. ``It's just out  
there and it surfaces when Oklahomans face adversities.''

<HEADLINE> Drinking Helps Cut Bladder Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Drink more water -- or coffee, milk, soda, fruit juice and beer --  
and you can lower your risk of bladder cancer, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	American men who drank at least 11 8-ounce glasses a day of all  
liquids cut their risk of two common types of bladder cancer in 
half, compared with men who drank five glasses or less, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Water had an independent protective effect. Men who drank at  
least six glasses of water a day cut their risk of bladder cancer 
in half compared with men who had less than one glass, regardless 
of how much they drank in total liquids. 
</P>
<P>
	Bladder cancer strikes an estimated 310,000 people worldwide  
each year and is the fourth most common cancer among American men. 
Smokers are more susceptible than non-smokers, and it afflicts four 
times as many men as women -- possibly because few women smoked 
until recently, and the lag time from when a person starts to smoke 
to when the cancer shows up can be 40 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine is the  
first to demonstrate a clear link between increased liquid intake 
and decreased bladder cancer of the two types most commonly found 
in developed countries: papillary and flat transitional cell 
carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not look at a third type, squamous cell carcinoma,  
which usually is associated with schistosomiasis, a water-borne 
parasitic disease common in Africa and parts of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain why drinking more liquids helps prevent the  
transitional cell cancers. But some researchers believe the bladder 
lining suffers less exposure to cancer-causing substances in urine 
when the urine is diluted and urination is more frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking greatly increases the quantity of carcinogens in urine,  
and this study, like previous research, found that the risk of 
bladder cancer was nearly four times higher among heavy smokers 
than it was among non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Quitting smoking is the best way to cut your cancer risk,  
according to the study's lead author, Dominique Michaud, a research 
fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health. But smokers who 
can't or won't quit can still cut their cancer risk substantially 
by drinking more, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the eating, drinking, exercise and smoking  
habits of 47,909 American men from 1986 to early 1996. A similar 
large-scale study of women does not include enough cases of bladder 
cancer yet to yield statistically significant results, Michaud 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's study, 252 developed bladder cancer. The risk  
increased with age and was higher in the Northeast than in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides water, none of the other beverages had an independent  
beneficial or harmful effect. Although previous, smaller studies 
had suggested drinking large quantities of coffee or alcohol might 
be harmful, this study found no increased bladder cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jones, director of the University of Southern California's  
Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in an accompanying 
editorial that the study was not sensitive enough to answer 
questions about whether water quality -- especially chlorination -- 
play a role in cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of what you drink may ... be as important as how  
much (or little) you imbibe,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Mixed; Dow Down 18.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with blue chip  
stocks fluctuating sharply amid renewed concerns about interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 18.04 at 10,868.07. The Dow was up in early trading, but gave 
up its gains and tumbled to a loss of 110 points before climbing 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower amid aggressive selling of  
technology shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.17 at 
1,328.83, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 19.11 at 
2,466.01. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest concern among stock investors was an upward trend in  
interest rates, particularly because the market has depended for a 
long time on rates remaining low. Even though the yield on the 
30-year Treasury bond was flat today at about 5.71 percent, that is 
up from 5.5 percent just two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a noticeable and important rise in yields,'' said  
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen 
Securities, ``and poeple are worried about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concern about higher rates was fed by two new economic  
reports indicating that the economy continues to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Purchasing Management Association said its index of  
business activity among non-manufacturing companies rose to 64.0 in 
April from 62.5 in March. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Commerce Department reported new orders to American  
factories rose 2 percent in March, more than wiping out a 
1.8-percent February decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong data fed concerns about inflation, which in turn fed  
into nervousness that the Federal Reserve would raise interest 
rates in a bid to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing shares were especially hard hit. The Dow was led  
lower by General Motors, down 1 15/16 at 87 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were also hit hard by aggressive  
profit-taking. Dow member IBM was down 1 3/8 at 210 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, another Dow stock, was up 5 3/9 at 56 15/16, after the  
company won a lively bidding contest for the cable TV company 
MediaOne. The deal will make AT&AMP;T the nation's largest cable 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	And GE shares were up 4 3/8 at 109 5/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 5 4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 706.03 million shares, down from 
Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Groups Deride New Insurance Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to shift the health care debate, Aetna  
Inc. plans to offer a set of bare-bones insurance policies aimed at 
workers who have no insurance at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates complained that the new plans would leave  
anyone with a serious illness a stack of bills, but Aetna officials 
said some coverage is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a modest first step, but it's something,'' said Aetna  
President and CEO Richard L. Huber. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, announced Wednesday, comes as the insurance and  
business communities try to shift attention away from popular 
proposals that seek to protect those with insurance from 
cost-cutting strategies sometimes employed by health maintenance 
organizations and other managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Their rallying cry has been the uninsured as they argue new  
regulations will drive up the cost of insurance and force employers 
to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said its basic coverage is meant to draw attention to the  
larger problem: 43 million Americans who are uninsured, most of 
whom live in working families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far less vital to continue to add additional benefits for  
those who already have coverage than providing access to basic 
coverage for the uninsured,'' said Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna also said it would donate $100,000 to put on a national  
conference and facilitate a dialogue between the government and 
private sector about the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is considered a supplementary plan, meaning  
customers are reimbursed directly after they go to the doctor or 
the hospital. By labeling it a supplement, Aetna can avoid state 
mandates for minimum benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has approval to sell these plans in three  
states -- Connecticut, Maine and Texas -- and intends to begin this 
summer. It has applications pending in 25 other states. It will 
sell to companies with at least two employees, but not directly to 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans are much less expensive than most on the market, with  
monthly premiums ranging from $46 to $91 for an individual and $156 
to $275 for a family. As with all insurance, an employer could pick 
up part of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But these plans provide much less than typical insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, a patient would get $50 toward a doctor's visit no  
matter how much the doctor charged. But since many visits cost 
considerably more than $50, the patient would have to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for a hospital stay. The middle plan would pay  
$750 a day for the first three days, $350 a day for the next seven 
days and $100 a day for the rest of the stay. That's not likely to 
cover most hospital bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates said the plans won't do consumers much good  
if they get sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what it offers, that's not very cheap,'' said Pat Schoeni  
of the National Coalition on Health Care, which released its own 
report Wednesday predicting that the number of uninsured Americans 
will continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Families USA, a consumer group that focuses on health, said  
these policies were offered in the early 1990s and were not popular 
because the benefits were so minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pollack, the group's executive director, said these plans  
might tempt some businesses to cut back on more generous coverage 
offered now. 
</P>
<P>
	``These plans provide insurance that doesn't insure,'' he said.  
``They don't cover you when you are sick and they leave you with 
massive bills to pay.''

<HEADLINE> Cali Cartel Lawyers Denied New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge has refused to grant a new trial  
for two lawyers convicted of funneling hush money, delivering 
threats and preparing false affidavits for Colombian drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Michael Abbell and William Moran sought a new  
trial because a judge dismissed a juror last summer after other 
jurors said she was prejudiced. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 11 convicted Moran and Abbell of two conspiracy  
charges that each could bring them 20 years in prison. The jurors 
deadlocked on two other conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Hoeveler said he would hold a hearing on whether  
Moran and Abbell's racketeering conspiracy conviction should stand. 
He also acquitted them of conspiracy to import cocaine and 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the charges on which the jury 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbell's attorney, William Moffitt, said he found Wednesday's  
opinion ``puzzling, to say the least'' and would appeal once his 
client is sentenced. Moran's attorney did not return a message 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Moran and Abbell, a former extradition  
expert with the Justice Department, went beyond just zealously 
representing their clients, members of the Cali drug cartel, and 
actually took part in their crimes.

<HEADLINE> Kimberly Mays Loses Custody of Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Kimberly Mays, who was switched at birth  
and became embroiled in a bitter custody battle with two sets of 
parents, has lost custody of her own son. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Daniel Dawson refused to release details of the custody  
change to the public. The Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale first 
reported Tuesday that Ms. Mays' son had been placed in foster care 
by the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Children and Families last week placed Ms.  
Mays' son, Devin Weeks, in foster care, the newspaper reported, 
citing unidentified sources close to the family. Devin turns 2 in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mays, now 20, married Jeremy Weeks in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The state agency would not release details, citing  
confidentiality laws. The state has authority to remove children 
from parental custody because of abuse, neglect or abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mays was switched at birth in 1978 at a Wauchula hospital  
with another baby raised by Regina and Ernest Twigg. The mixup was 
discovered in 1988, when tests showed the girl the Twiggs raised 
was not their biological daughter. That child, Arlena Twigg, died 
of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Mays, who had raised Ms. Mays from birth, battled for  
five years with the Twiggs over visitation rights before a judge 
eventually ruled the Twiggs had no legal right to act as her 
parents or even to visit her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mays later ran away from Mays and wound up moving in with  
the Twiggs, though she also ran away from them several times.

<HEADLINE> Town Deals With Tornado Aftermath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULHALL, Okla. (AP) -- The grocery is gone. The Christian Church  
is nothing but a sign. The school is a mound of rubble. The water 
tower is a twisted hunk of metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulhall, population 260, has been a speck on the map for 110  
years. Now it's even less. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's twister ripped the bark off trees, pulled tombstones  
from the earth, sucked people out of their living rooms and 
destroyed or severely damaged more than 90 percent of the town's 
houses and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	And now Mulhall faces the daunting task of rebuilding. But  
rebuild it will. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say this town has died, but a bunch of us just won't  
let that happen,'' says a weary-looking Willis Doggett, the fire 
chief. ``We'll survive this. It's like a death in the family. You 
have to go on. What else can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down the streets of Mulhall on Wednesday, folks already  
were starting over: Chain saws buzzed, homeowners picked up broken 
dishes and mud-caked clothes, teachers and students searched 
knee-deep for buried treasures -- books, computers, lockers, even 
sinks -- anything salvageable from the remains of their school.

	``When you think of a small town like this, the school is the  
hub of the community,'' says Kelli Kindschi, standing in 
dirt-encrusted cowboy boots, clutching ``We the People'' 
Constitution books plucked from under a mountain of bricks.

	``I did have to sit down and cry,'' admits the fifth-grade  
history teacher, whose entire 18-year career has been at 
Mulhall-Orlando Elementary School. ``You think of the last time you 
were in your room with all your little kiddos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That won't happen again soon.  
</P>
<P>
	Mulhall still doesn't have water, gas or electric service. The  
storm's 260-mph winds hurled the silver water tower off its stand, 
knocking a house off its foundation; inside, an elderly woman 
huddled in bed, swathed in blankets, remarkably escaping injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more amazing, only one person was hurt in this town 40  
miles north of the Oklahoma City area, where the storm claimed most 
of its 38 victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Ritter, a 65-year-old retiree, rode out the tornado with  
17 people in his cellar. His back porch blew away, his windows 
shattered, and strips of metal now hang on barren trees like dirty 
laundry. But when he looks around, he still sees home, sweet home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was my folks' place,'' he says, his eyes bleary behind  
smudged glasses, his face grizzled with a two-day beard. ``I have a 
lot of memories here. I feel my daddy's with me when I'm out here 
walking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town won't be the same as it was,'' he adds. ``But I'll  
stay, even if I have to live in a tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homes can be replaced. But history can't in this town, named  
after Zack Mulhall, a rancher and Wild West promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some red-brick buildings have been standing since the 1890s; a  
few old-timers remember when horses hauled slabs of stone in 
wagons, where there was a Model T showroom, when a bank cashier 
killed himself in 1923 after being accused of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Oklahoma's oldest churches, a Methodist congregation,  
lost its steeple, but survived. The Christian Church wasn't as 
lucky; sheets of music, wooden pews and a sign are all that remain. 
</P>
<P>
	But most folks are determined to look for the silver lining.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to 'doze it all in the basement,'' says Freddy  
Pitts, whose home was destroyed. ``I don't have any plans for 
leaving. I'm tickled to death to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Pfeiffer lost her Farm Store, the grocery, cafe and  
gathering spot for Mulhall. Standing amid crushed cookies, olive 
jars and biscuit packages, with the sky as her roof, she confesses 
she has wondered about rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go home, you feel a little sorry for yourself,'' she says.  
``Then you come here, you see the rallying of the community. And 
you know you've got to come back.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 19.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher in early trading today,  
responding to a a drop in interest rates in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 19.76 at 10,905.87. On Tuesday, the Dow average fell 128.58 to 
10,886.11 after interest rates in the bond market rose sharply on 
inflation concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well today. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.38 at 1,334.38, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 2.85 at 2,487.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/32 point today, pushing its  
yield down to 5.70 percent from 5.71 percent late Tuesday. 
Investors maintained a keen eye on interest rates, which they said 
would be the key influence on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in yet another demonstration that the economy  
continues to be strong, the National Purchasing Management 
Association said its index of business activity among 
non-manufacturing companies rose to 64.0 in April from 62.5 in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	That gain could be good news for stocks if it doesn't send  
interest rates higher, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at 
Josephthal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy continues just to perform magnificantly,'' Rice  
said, ``stronger than anybody thought possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newbridge Networks were down sharply after the  
Canadian networking concern warned late Tuesday that its fiscal 
fourth-quarter profits will come in significantly below analysts' 
forecasts. Newbridge tumbled 8 5/8 to 18 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other networkers were lower in early trading in sympathy with  
Newbridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 6 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 109.38 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.44 at 636.54, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.82 at 787.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's stock market was closed for the last of three  
days of holidays and will resume trading Thursday. In midday 
trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 1.19 percent, as 
banking and telecommunications shares took big hits. Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was up 0.08 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.9 
percent.
