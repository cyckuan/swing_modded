<HEADLINE> Angola's Infant Death Rate Ranks Second in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Angola is suffering the second
highest infant death rate in the world as 29 percent of its
children die under the age of five, official sources said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eufrazina Maiato, director of the National Institute of
Children (INAC), quoted a report of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) as saying that only 36 percent of the Angolan babies
were immuned from tetanus and poliomyelitis and 71 percent from
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the education situation in the southwest African
country is also critical. About 2.3 million children aged between
5 and 18, accounting for 20 percent of the country's population,
have no chance to receive education.
</P>
<P>
Maiato said that the UNICEF report is a reflection of the grave
 humanitarian situation in Angola, adding that the international
community and the society should do more for these children.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Efforts for Third Proximity Talks on Cyprus Intensify by Liu Xingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- International diplomats have come
to Cyprus one after another since the outset of this month to
prepare ground for the third round of proximity talks aimed at
achieving a reunification of the divided Mediterranean island, but
it came out not easy.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hill, British Foreign Office director of the South
European desk, and U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser on
Cyprus Alvaro de Soto started the diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by U.S. Presidential envoy for Cyprus Alfred
Moses, State Department coordinator Thomas Weston and British
special envoy on Cyprus Sir David Hannay. More foreign diplomats
are expected.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have had two rounds since
December last year, aimed at paying the way for substantive talks
leading to a solution for Cyprus, which has been divided into Greek
and Turkish communities since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The third round is scheduled to start in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that most envoys during their visits expressed
the view that conditions for a comprehensive solution to Cyprus are
ever more favorable.
</P>
<P>
"Circumstances are in place not only for progress, but for
actual movement toward the long elusive goal of a comprehensive
settlement," de Soto told a news conference shortly before the end
of his visit.
</P>
<P>
"There is a better chance for a solution now than there has been
for many, many years, and there is a better chance of a solution
now than there will be for many years ahead," said Hannay.
</P>
<P>
The favorable signs which they referred to for Cyprus at the
moment included improved Greek-Turkish relations, serious
involvement of the international community and European Union
accession for all parties concerned. Greece and Turkey take sides
on the island along ethnic line.
</P>
<P>
Reports also suggest the U.S. is trying to work out some
practical "goodwill moves" that would help improve the atmosphere
and restore some confidence between the sides to facilitate the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Figuring high during the talks between the foreign envoys and
Cypriot leadership are believed to be the Turkish demands for
lifting the international embargo on the self-proclaimed Turkish
Cypriot republic in the north, improving residents' living
conditions there and ways of encouraging more contacts between the
two communities.
</P>
<P>
But the Greek Cypriot side took a wary attitude due to what it
described the "intransigence" expressed by the Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides said during his recent visit to Paris
that he was not optimistic about a quick breakthrough in proximity
talks, criticizing the Turkish Cypriots for setting preconditions
for the talks on the reunification of the island.
</P>
<P>
He said that "new complications arises" because Denktash is now
bringing up preconditions for the talks, demanding they be met
before any discussion on the core issues on Cyprus take place.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has insisted that the Cyprus issue must
be resolved on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation
formula in line with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with foreign diplomats, President Clerides
has reportedly asked for the talks to be "upgraded" and become more
substantive and result-oriented, so that they could lead to face-
to-face negotiations as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides had earlier said that he
does not rule out a face-to-face meeting between Clerides and
Denktash during the third round of proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to their expectations, however, the Turkish Cypriot
leadership refused to have face-to-face talks with Greek Cypriot
side, insisting international recognition of their breakaway
republic as a prelude to reunification in the form of a two-state
confederation.
</P>
<P>
Echoing de Soto and Hannay, Moses also ruled out the possibility
for direct talks between the two communties in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Hannay warned that face-to-face negotiations were not on the
cards, although he noted the need for a "gear change" during the
next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"Face-to-face talks are not the only way. The important thing is
that when the negotiations begin they are meaningful and lead to a
comprehensive settlement," stressed de Soto on his part.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful negotiations can be conducted face-to-face, but they
can also take place in the present format without the two leaders
meeting face-to-face. The fact that they are not meeting directly
does not mean that negotiations cannot be carried out," according
to de Soto.

<HEADLINE> Two British Soldiers Killed in Traffic Accident in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Two British soldiers based in
Cyprus were killed and two others injured on Sunday when their car
collided with a truck and burst into flames, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Sunday afternoon on the Limassol-Paphos
highway in southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Police said the burnt bodies of the two soldiers were found in
the car and the two injured soldiers were lying near the scene of
the accident and were sent to Limassol General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
One of the injured soldiers underwent surgery and is currently
under intensive care and the other one had broken tibia. The two
bodies have not yet been formally identified.
</P>
<P>
All the four British soldiers were based in the Dhekelia base,
on the southeast, and were on leave at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Britain retained two military bases in Cyprus after it granted
the island independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Condemns Mass Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Sunday expressed deep shock at the mass suicide which took place
in Kanungu in the southwestern district of Rukungiri two days ago
and condemned the cult activities leading to such a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The president assured the whole country that the government
would carry out a thorough investigation into the incident in
order to sound a timely warning to the others.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Sunday evening
said: " The president condemned in the strongest this horrific,
senseless and tragic act and was deeply saddened to learn that the
adults who carried out the barbarity had taken children with them
and subjected them to such cruelty."
</P>
<P>
Museveni expressed tremendous grief at the massive loss of life
of innocent people who were misled into carrying out this
horrendous act. He also criticized leaders of some religious
cults for increasingly luring unsuspecting people into beliefs
that endanger their lives.
</P>
<P>
He called on religious and community leaders to be vigilant
about what religious sects are doing with the people and to guide
their communities from being misled into this type of cult
conduct.
</P>
<P>
All Ugandans must ensure that such a tragedy never takes place
again. While the government believes in freedom of worship, it
also has a duty to protect the lives of the people of Uganda from
religious practices which destroy their lives, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 members of a cult named Movement of Restoration of Ten
 Commandments of God gathered in a simple church on Thursday and
burned themselves after reportedly hours of merrymaking. Many
adult cult members took their kids to the church.
</P>
<P>
They spread fuel on themselves and sealed all the possible
exits of the church before sparking off the fire which quickly
engulfed the church structure. Police sources said that the
bodies were burnt beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive investigation is still under way. Police
Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told Xinhua Sunday that the sect was set
up in 1989. It has connections in France, Italy and Australia. The
sect has branches in 10 districts in Uganda and is estimated to
have hundreds of followers across the country.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Seeks Coordinated Stance With Iraq at OPEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Minister of Energy and
Mines Ali Rodriguez Araque paid a short visit to Iraq Sunday for
talks with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid to coordinate
stances ahead of a meeting of world major oil producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan minister has left Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Iraq, members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), will attend the OPEC oil ministerial
meeting on March 27 in Vienna, which is to decide whether to raise
oil production to offset a oil supply shortage that now stands at
more than 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Rashid has said that he is making contacts with his OPEC
counterparts to coordinate their stands at the meeting, expressing
the hope that the OPEC will not loosen its reins in oil output.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is trying to quench the attempts of the United States,
the biggest oil consumer, to raise oil output to cut down oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports of Iraq, which has been under sweeping U.N.
sanctions since 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait, are monitored by
the United Nations, not by the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said he believed that OPEC countries will press for a
rollover of the current oil output ceiling of some 26 million
barrels a day until the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
However, Saudi Arabia and Iran, two heavy-weight producers of
OPEC, have agreed that world oil producing countries should
guarantee adequate and timely supplies for the good of the world's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Such a move was seen as a signal that major oil producers will
ease their present production curb which was agreed upon by OPEC
and non-OPEC countries last March to uplift oil prices which
dropped to an all-time low in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, due to expire by the end of this month,
OPEC members slashed their output by 1.7 million barrels per day
from April 1, 1999, while non-OPEC producers cut their daily
production by 400,000 barrels. The move has over the period
drastically boosted oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including President Bill Clinton, have
been lobbying for a rise in oil production to cool off the surging
oil prices, which had jumped over 34 U.S. dollars per barrel, the
highest since November, 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said the oil prices were "proper" and "acceptable"
taking into consideration the 25-30 percent inflation rate from
1990 to now.

<HEADLINE> Moslim Pilgrims Leaving Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Moslim pilgrims began leaving
Saudi Arabia for home on Sunday after finishing the annual
pilgrimage, or Haj, in the holy city of Mecca.
</P>
<P>
King Abdul Aziz Airport in the western Saudi city of Jeddah,
near which Mecca is located, was overcrowded with departing
pilgrims, according to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Over 210 flights were scheduled to leave Jeddah by midnight
Sunday, heading for various corners of the Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
All concerned authorities in Saudi Arabia are fully prepared for
simplifying departing procedures for the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
This year's pilgrimage began on March 14, with more than 1.2
million foreign pilgrims and some 800,000 Saudis taking part in the
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
An 11-kilometer journey covered by all the pilgrims on foot, by
car or by bus on Tuesday from Mecca to Mina, a ritual site, marked
the beginning of the Haj.
</P>
<P>
The Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be
performed at least once by every able Moslim in his or her life.
</P>
<P>
In Mina, the pilgrims climbed Mount Arafat, where Prophet
Mohammad delivered his final sermon 14 centuries ago. They spent
their day on the hill "praying for forgiveness and seeking the
blessings of God."
</P>
<P>
During a sermon on Mount Arafat, the pilgrims were told they
would be free of sin after the religious service. They were also
urged to stand united and to cooperate with each other against
Islam's enemies.
</P>
<P>
The climbing of Mount Arafat is considered as the most difficult
stage, and the rituals on the hill mark the climax of the annual
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the pilgrims performed prayers of Eid Al-Adha, the
most important Islamic festival to slain and sacrifice sheep,
cattle and camels to mark Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son
for God.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims started a three-day performance of the symbolic "
stoning of the devil" ritual on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Each pilgrim threw seven pebbles at each of the three different
pillars symbolizing the devil as a sign of the human being
overcoming the devil.
</P>
<P>
The last part of the Haj journey was the circumvolution around
the holy Kaaba in Mecca, which according to Koran is the oldest
house of worship in the world.
</P>
<P>
With sufficient preparations and precautions, this year's Haj
has ended in a success. No security incidents and epidemics have
been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Ibn AbdulAziz said Sunday
that previous experience had paved the way for careful study,
planning and research to make this season a great success.
</P>
<P>
Tent fires or stampedes happened during some of the past Haj
seasons, causing heavy human casualties and material losses. A tent
fire caused by using gas cylinders during the 1997 pilgrimage
season killed more than 350 pilgrims and injured over 1,600 others.

<HEADLINE> Operations on Injured Iranian Reformist Successful, Doctor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Two surgical operations on Saeed
Hajjarian, the Iranian reformist who was injured in an
assassination attempt, have been successful, the spokesman of the
physician team treating him announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mohammad Qodsi said that in the first operation, part of his
windpipe had been cut open in aid of his respiration and
additionally his stomach had been partly cut open for direct intake
of food, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Qodsi did not give details about the operations. But IRNA said
earlier Sunday that the operations took about 20 minutes and was
aimed at helping feed Hajjarian via his digestion organ.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice chairman of Tehran Municipal Council and
publisher of reformist daily Sobh-e Emruz (This Morning), was shot
and badly wounded on March 12 by two unidentified gunmen in front
of the municipal council building.
</P>
<P>
He has been in a coma since then and a team of physicians,
including experts from the United States, have been trying to save
his life.
</P>
<P>
His condition is now better than before in terms of his
consciousness and he repeatedly opens his eyes and responds to
stimuli, Qodsi said.
</P>
<P>
For the past 24 hours, Hajjarian has been in a stable condition
in terms of his vital signs and blood pressure and has had no
problem with his lungs, heart and stomach, he said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that under the present conditions an operation
for removing the bullet lodged in his neck is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, close ally of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami
and former deputy intelligence minister, was believed to have
played an important role in the landslide victory of the
reformists, supporters of Khatami, in the key parliamentary
elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that the assassination was carried out by
hard-line elements in the conservative camp.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Tries to Make Aviation Industry Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has finished the overhaul
of its aviation sector and wants to make it efficient and
profitable, a senior Nigerian official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted the most populous African
country's Minister of Aviation Olusegun Agagu as saying that his
ministry now may try to raise some of its charges and rates, in
order to get enough money to execute some of the long-delayed
projects necessary for the healthy development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
But he said in the country's capital Abuja that the rise will
not be too high to discourage operators in the industry. ''We want
to make them look like what we have in other parts of the world.
Those that are too high, we bring them down to encourage
investors," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Agagu said that his priority was to have an aviation industry
that was not only efficient, but one that could meet with
international standards, in terms of service, equipment and
safety.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the minister said Nigeria must have good,
clean and customer friendly airports because these are the step
for anybody coming into Nigeria. "The kind of reception you get
there will do a lot to determine whether you will think of staying
in Nigeria, and what you want to put into Nigeria,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
intends to create a level of local administrations in its current
one-level government structure by giving more authority,
responsibilities and resources to existing Community Development
Councils (CDCs).
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told a CDC seminar
Sunday that the government wants to evolve CDCs into local
authorities that deliver a wide range of community and public
services, not just welfare services.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will delegate to CDCs more
government functions which can better be discharged at local level.
</P>
<P>
"I see CDCs evolving into a system of local administration,
where each community is empowered to look after its own local
concerns," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nine CDCs have been set up in Singapore to promote community
bonding and induct successful Singaporeans to serve and help the
less successful to level up. Each CDC is like a localized form of
participative government through which Singaporeans will have more
say in managing their community and rendering community self-help.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the CDC will be more than a grassroots organization
and as a form of community governance, it will functions under an
appointed mayor and be run by MPs, or constituency advisers and
councilors, comprising both grassroots leaders and administrators,
professionals and other able people from outside.
</P>
<P>
There is only one level of government in Singapore and its
current constitution provides that the cabinet is directly
responsible for all government policies and day-to-day
administration of the state affairs.
</P>
<P>
On advantages of such a reform, Goh said it will enable
ministers to focus on their core business of policy development,
master planning and regulation, have specific needs of respective
communities more attuned and better met by CDCs which is closer to
the ground, and have bodies that can cut across the functional
boundaries of ministries and become a focal point for residents to
access a whole range of related services.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Green Party Congress Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The closure of the nuclear power stations, which was the main
theme of the three-day congress, reportedly gained the support of
most congress participants. "The historical chance" should not be
missed, sources quoted participants at the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Greens attending the meeting, were said to be deeply
disappointed at the party's interior reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Greens Party was founded in 1980. It is now the ruling
partner of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which defeated the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in general elections in September
1998.

<HEADLINE> NATO Forces En Route to Kosovo Via Northern Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 U.S.-led NATO troops
are passing through northern Greece early Sunday on their way to
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo following their landing in two
different locations in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 amphibious vehicles and tanks Saturday landed at the
northern Greek port of Litohoro at around 22:30 local time and a
contingent of between 1,100 and 1,200 men at the Thessaloniki port
at approximately midnight, the semi-official Athens News Agency (
ANA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NATO troops, including some from Argentina, the
Netherlands and Poland, are moving to Kosovo to participate in a
planned military exercise, code-named the Dynamic Response 2000.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) gathered
outside the central gate of the Thessaloniki port to protest
against the force's landing in the country.
</P>
<P>
The last time when a large number of NATO soldiers passed
through Thessaloniki occurred in June, and the KKE and other
leftist parties also organized similar actions to show their
opposition to the NATO-triggered war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Closely watching the worsening situation in Kosovo, Greece has
raised a series of proposals and strengthened its diplomatic
efforts for a just and vital solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou will leave for Moscow
Monday for talks with his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov and the
Kosovo issue is expected to be one of the key topics.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Strengthen Protection of Historic Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cooperation and
Development Agency (TIKA) has decided to finalize a project to
protect the 8th century Orkhon inscriptions, Turkish historic site
in Mongolia, reported Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The inscriptions, located close to the Orkhon River northwest of
the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, are the first in which the
word "Turk" and the first signs of Turkish culture and language
appear.
</P>
<P>
The lace-like inscriptions, carved on stone and marble, are
considered to be the beginning of the Turkish family tree.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the project, TIKA plans to sponsor a
working meeting in Istanbul in April. More than 70 scientists from
all over the world, particularly from Turkey and Mongolia, will
participate on invitation.
</P>
<P>
Oner Kabasakal, president of TUKA, told the paper that they
would start the restoration works following the Istanbul meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is known that there are three inscriptions in different
places in the area, namely the Kul Tegin, Bilge Khagan and Tonyukuk
monuments.
</P>
<P>
The Kul Tegin inscription was erected in Kul Tegin's memory in
732 A.D. by his brother, Bilge Khagan. There are 66 lines and
columns on one face of the 375-centimeter-high monument in the
Gokturk alphabet and a Chinese translation on another.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to establish a tent city around the monuments
in which the scientists will be able to stay and work efficiently.
Before that we want to construct a road in order to reach the
monuments easily," said Kabasakal.
</P>

"Our objective is firstly to protect the monuments against
elements," he said. "If we are able to realize this project then we
will start to excavate around the monuments. We believe that we
will make many new historical discoveries that can shed new light
on Turkish history."
</P>
<P>
After the discovery of the Kul Tegin and Bilge Khagan monuments
in July 1889, the inscriptions came to prominence thanks to the
simultaneous work on deciphering them by Wilhelm Radloff, a member
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Wilhelm Ludwig Thomson, of
the Danish Royal Academy.
</P>
<P>
Since then there have been radical changes in the theories of
the origins of the Turkish language.
</P>
<P>
Kabasakal said that TIKA's intention is to restore and protect
them from partial breakup and cracking in Mongolia's vast local
temperature variations, rain and icy climate.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 when President Suleyman Demirel paid a visit to
Mongolia, an unwritten agreement was reached between the two
countries with the aim of protecting the Orkhon inscriptions,
restoring them, exhibiting them in a museum and opening them up to
tourism.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Turkish Monuments in Mogolia Project (MOTAP)
was set up to protect the inscriptions and TIKA was given the
mandate to restore the inscriptions. To this end, a technical
protocol was signed between the Turkish and Mogolian authorities
concerned.
</P>
<P>
According to established historical records, ancient Turks
migrated from the Altai Mountains in the border areas of China,
Mongolia and Russia, to the Anatolia in west Asia, in the eighth
century, and modern Turkey was established after they settled down
there for several centuries.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Soften Attitude Toward Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The German Greens Party, a junior
partner in the coalition government, has softened its attitude
toward the country's nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
After a five-hour debate at the party's congress held in the
southern city of Karlsruhe, the Greens voted Saturday to support a
compromise motion on nuclear power put forward by the party's
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, which forms a coalition government with the German
Social Democratic Party (SPD), started its current congress on
Friday. Despite some differences with the SPD, the Greens still
backed German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin's softer stance
on nuclear power to avoid clashes with the SPD.
</P>
<P>
But the debate about the reform of the party's structure didn't
come to a result.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton announced a series of steps that he
said would make the nation less vulnerable to wide swings in the
petroleum market, including a proposed home heating oil reserve in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, Indians
are far more ambivalent than the frenzied preparations suggest.
They are still smarting under American criticism and sanctions for
conducting nuclear tests in 1998 and many of them suspect the
United States still favors its Cold War ally and India's arch
rival, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Acting President Vladimir Putin sought to reassure Russian
voters, saying on a state-owned radio station that the war in
Chechen was drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
-- Iran's government welcomed a new American diplomatic
initiative lifting some economic sanctions, but cautioned that the
change in United States policy was not enough to warrant an
immediate restoration of long-broken ties.

<HEADLINE> Luneng, Fushun Stunned in Season-opening Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Luneng and Liaoning
Fushun, last season's champion and runners-up respectively, both
suffered surprise defeats in the opening round of the Chinese
first division soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were both beaten by two teams just promoted from
the second division league, with Luneng losing to Yunnan Hongta 1-
0 and Fushun to Xiamen Xiaxin 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Luneng, also champion of the Chinese Football Association Cup,
launched all-out attacks after the start but left their defensive
line vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Hongta had quite a few golden chances but scored the winner
only five minutes before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
Luneng's Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said: "Our players
were pressed too hard mentally at home. We should pay more
attention to our defense."
</P>
<P>
Hongta's coach Qi Wusheng, a former head coach of Chinese
national team, said the victory was precious enough to boost their
confidence.
</P>
<P>
"We have made full preparation for the game and the result
proved our tactics very successful," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese national coach Bora Milutinovic made a special trip to
Luneng's home Ji'nan to watch the game. But he made no comment
about the defeat of his fellow Yugoslav Santrac.
</P>
<P>
Fushun, who surrendered the league champion to Luneng after a
tight competition last season, was left astonished with the result
in Xiamen, which was some 2,000 kilometers away from their home.
</P>
<P>
Xiaxin's captain Gao Yuyong opened the scoring in the 52nd
minute, former Luneng striker Tang Xiaocheng made it 2-0 in the
67th and Zhuang Guanghui anchored the win in the 88th.
</P>
<P>
"Fushun is stronger than us, but I told the players that we had
no choice but to try our best," said Xiaxin's head coach Chi
Shangbin, who had coach Dalian Wanda to four league champions
before moving to Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Shenzhen Ping'an played to a
goalless draw with Sichuan Quanxing, Qingdao Hainiu tied Shanghai
Shenhua 1-1, Dalian Shide routed Beijing Guo'an 2-0, Tianjin Taida
defeated Jilin Aodong 2-0 and Shenyang Haishi was held 0-0 by
Chongqing Longxin.

<P>
LISBON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Mohammed Mourhit and
Ethiopia's Kutre Dulecha became the surprising winners at the
World Cross Country Championship in Vilamoura, Portugal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mourhit timed in 35 minutes exactly for the men's 12-km title,
while Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu finished second in 35:01, and
Kenya's Paul Tergat, who was strongly favored to clinch his sixth
consecutive gold, finished another second behind.
</P>
<P>
"I put all my speed in the last 400 meters and didn't believe I
could do it," said Mourhit, a Moroccan-born Belgian who holds the
European 10,000-meter record but had never claimed a world title.
</P>
<P>
The women's 4-kilometer race featured a spectacular finish as
Dulecha shot out from behind in the final stretch as the top three
finishers were given the same time.
</P>
<P>
Stunned by her gold medal, Dulecha said she'd only been going
for third, saying "when I was going for number three, somebody
slowed down and I just went on."
</P>
<P>
Dulecha won the 1,500-meter bronze in last year's world
championships and was the last person to beat Romanian track star
Gabriela Szabo in February 1999.
</P>

Some 1,000 athletes from a record 81 countries and regions took

KHARTOUM, March 19 ( Xinhua ) -- Sudanese armed rebels launched
an attack Saturday on some military posts in the eastern region of
the country, but had been repulsed.
</P>
<P>
An informed source from the Sudanese News Agency told Xinhua
Sunday morning that the rebels attacked a local station in
Hamshkurib and some border posts in Kasala province before they
were repulsed and inflicted heavy losses by the government forces.
</P>
<P>
The source did not elaborate on the battle between the
government forces and rebels, apparently referring to the Sudan
People's Liberation Army led by John Garang who has been seeking
more autonomy of the Christian South from the Islamic rule of the
North since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The source termed as "baseless fabrications" the reports that
the government forces has launched military operations against the
rebels in all regions controlled by the rebels, saying that the
government is fully confined itself to the cease-fire agreement
reached between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Hamshkurib is the regional capital of Kasala province which is
not far away from the borders with Eriteria.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government had to pay back almost 5 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign debts plus interests by the end of last
year, according to a government report.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's foreign debts are estimated at 2.5 to three billion
dollars based on standard currency value, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if the country's economic reform programs are not
implemented, Yemen will not get access to foreign debt reduction
and support from financial institutions and international donors.
This may also lead to freezing of loans and soft facilities,
notably from the World Bank's International Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The U.N. International Union of Telecommunications will
hold its first regional conference on the third generation of
mobile phones in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Hurghada on March 22-31.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to be attended by experts specialized in
telecommunications and a large group of representatives from
international mobile phone companies, including Ericson, Nokia,
Nortel, Samsung and Siemens. It will also be attended by a number
of officials and experts from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt posted a foreign trade volume of 50.043 billion
U.S. dollars in the first nine months of last year, with a deficit
of some 32.884 billion dollars, said a report issued by the Society
of Egyptian Businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's foreign trade deficit with the U.S., the biggest trading
partner of Egypt, stood at around 4.828 billion dollars while trade
volume between the two countries was estimated at 7.014 billion
dollars. Germany and Italy came in the second and third places
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's foreign trade deficit with Arab countries was about 328.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish officials said that the Southeastern Anatolia
Project (GAP) in the country was "one of the most important
sustainable development projects based on water," the Anatolia News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Olcay Unver, general director of the GAP Administration, made
the remarks at a meeting held on Saturday to introduce the
ambitious development blueprint of Turkey, during the ongoing
Second World Water Forum in The Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting on "Water and Life in 21st Century,"
Unver said that the GAP targeted not only energy production,
irrigation and economic development, but also was a huge integrated
project which aimed at social, cultural and environmental
development.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Turkey launched the GAP to develop its backward chaos-
plagued southeastern region, where Islamic extremist activities
flourished and the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) carried out armed
struggle for an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of the project, which is planned to be
completed in 2010, has been concluded so far, Unver said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Celebrities Comment on New Leader of Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- After the election in Taiwan, some
celebrities here said today that only when the new leader of
Taiwan comes back to the "One China" principle can the cross-
Straits relations be improved.
</P>
<P>
The new leader of Taiwan should return to the One China
principle, and if he clings obstinately to his line for the "
independence of Taiwan", he would surely be opposed by all Chinese
people and certainly come to no good end, said Ma Man Kei,
chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Ieong Wan Chong, a scholar in Macao, said Taiwan is part of
China, and if the new leader of Taiwan continues his "Taiwan
independence" advocacy, the cross-Straits relations will be
worsened.
</P>
<P>
The scholar expressed his hope that the compatriots in Taiwan
agree to the 'One China' principle and promote the reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Charles C. Y. Chen, director of the Association of Returned
Overseas Chinese in Macao, said that the new leader of Taiwan
should abandon his stance for "Taiwan independence" and respect
the interests of the people in Taiwan and the common will of the
entire Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Increase Anti-Poverty Aid for Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank Deputy
President Jemal-ud-din Kassum said here today that infrastructure
construction projects will be given priority when considering loan
arrangements for poverty-reduction projects in southwest China's
Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed vice president for Asia and Pacific Region
said his bank will give higher priority to infrastructure projects,
particularly highway projects in the province, one of the poorest
areas in China.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day inspection tour of anti-poverty projects
using World Bank loans in Guizhou, he said the bank will do more
to help the province raise more money from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has used 172 million U.S. dollars out of the contracted
278 million U.S. dollars in loans from the bank in the past seven
years for projects to reduce poverty and improve education and
public health services.
</P>
<P>
Mo Shiren, deputy governor of Guizhou, said that the per capita
net income of about 800,000 families in 13 poor counties has
increased by 42 percent from about 700 yuan (85 U.S. dollars) in
1995 to last year's 1,000 yuan (121 U.S. dollars), thanks to the
comprehensive anti-poverty program.
</P>
<P>
With an expenditure of one billion yuan (about 121 million U.S.
dollars), including 62 million U.S. dollars in loans from the bank,
the program covers education, public health, labor export,
infrastructure facilities and land development.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 schools have been renovated or built in 40 counties,
and 98,000 ha of land has been planted with trees during the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor said the projects involving World Bank
loans have played an important role in promoting local social and
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Barak Blames Ruling Partner for Irresponsible Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's
remarks about Education Minister Yossi Sarid are "unacceptable and
must be corrected."
</P>
<P>
Barak told the weekly cabinet meeting that "the Rabbi is a
spiritual leader whose words have great effect and we have seen the
effect of unwarranted hatred, not only in previous eras but in
recent times."
</P>
<P>
Yosef, during a radio address to Shas followers Saturday night,
compared Sarid as an "evil character" for his hatred for Torah
study. He went even further by calling for "uprooting the evil
man who hates the students of the wise," adding that the God will
erase Sarid's name from the world.
</P>
<P>
Sarid has long been at odds with Shas, an important partner of
Barak's ruling coalition. Shas has run into serious financial
problems in its school system and Sarid refused to allocate
additional millions of shekels to cover the financial deficits as
required by Shas.
</P>
<P>
Yosef's words against Sarid touched off big worries among
Israeli politicians and some of them said that this incitement
could, if not properly resolved, lead to unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday, Bar-Ilan University President
Moshe Kaven strongly condemned Yosef's harsh words against Sarid,
saying "no such remarks should be made against any Jew."
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein said Sunday that he will
study the case and decide soon whether to take legal actions
against Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin on Saturday night also sounded a
similar tone and urged to investigate whether Yosef had violated
the law against incitement.
</P>
<P>
"The Rabbi should immediately erase these incendiary remarks,
which place a big question mark over attempts to cooperate with his
movement," Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995,
and Rabin's family blamed the killing as incited by the leader of
the then opposition party Shas.

<HEADLINE> Wounded Iranian Reformist Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Saeed Hajjarian, a prominent
Iranian reformist who survived an assassination attempt on his
life, underwent a surgical operation in a Tehran hospital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Physicians at the Sina hospital said the operation, which took
about 20 minutes, was aimed at helping feed gravely-wounded
Hajjarian via his digestion organ, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice-chairman of Tehran Municipal Council and
publisher of the reformist daily Sobh-e Emruz (This Morning), was
shot and badly wounded by two yet unidentified gunmen in front of
the municipal council building last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since then Hajjarian has been in a coma. But doctors said his
conditions are improving and he had opened his eyes several times.
</P>
<P>
They said an operation was only possible when the patient
regained his consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, also a close adviser to reform-minded President
Mohammed Khatami, played an important role in reformers' landslide
victory in last month's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that the assassination was carried out by
hard-line elements in the conservative camp of the Islamic
republic.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Palestinian Security Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Sunday freed three
Palestinian security prisoners from a jail in northern Israel and
two others will be released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel Prison Authority (IPA) said all the three Palestinians
are East Jerusalem residents and belong to the Palestinian main
political faction of Fatah headed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, and their release is a goodwill gesture to the Palestinians
to mark the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been discussing the
release of more Palestinians from Israeli jails, but no final
agreement has been reached so far. The two sides agreed to meet
again in the near future to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet discussed this issue on Wednesday, but no
exact figure slated for release has been finalized. The cabinet did
agree to release a number of Palestinians as a goodwill gesture for
the Muslim feast.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel will release another 11 Palestinians
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September,
Israel has freed 383 Palestinians in total by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that around 1,600 Palestinians are
being jailed in israel, waiting for release.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Overdue West Bank Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet Sunday gave the
final go-ahead to an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank, paving the way for the resumption of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved the map of the long-delayed withdrawal by a
vote of 16-6 with one abstention, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the map to reporters here, Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said the land transfer will be carried out "in the
next few days."
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the hand-over will take place on Tuesday,
coinciding with the renewal of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the expected withdrawal, 5.1 percent of the West Bank will be
turned to full Palestinian control from areas currently under
Palestinian civilian control and Israeli security control, and 1
percent will be handed over to full Palestinian control from total
Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal, the last stage of the Second Further
Redeployments in the West Bank stipulated by interim agreements,
the Palestinians will get full or partial control over 40 percent
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the map, the withdrawal will mostly focus on areas
around the southern West Bank towns of Hebron and Bethlehem. No
areas immediately close to Jerusalem were included.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to right-wing pressure inside and outside his government,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave up a plan last week to hand
over the Palestinian village of Anata near Jerusalem in the
upcoming withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Sneh said the fate of areas near Jerusalem would be dealt with
in the negotiations on the final-status talks, which are supposed
to resolve the hardest disputes over issues such as Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister dismissed charges made by Jewish settlers
that the upcoming withdrawal would leave them living "under
(Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser) Arafat's gun,"
saying the PNA has turned its gun to militant Palestinian groups
like Hamas.
</P>
<P>
"The last gun Arafat aimed at was on Thursday night on Hamas,
the common enemy of Israel and the Palestinians," he said,
referring to the capture by Palestinian security forces of three
Hamas members involving in a terror attack attempt in the northern
Israeli town of Taibeh on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The 6.1 percent transfer was originally scheduled for January 20
according to the timetable of the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed
last September, but a dispute over the areas involved has delayed
its implementation.
</P>
<P>
In their coming talks in Washington, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will focus their efforts to reach a framework agreement
on final-status issues by May and a final peace treaty by
September, Sneh said.

into it, said the Russian Foreign Ministry Saturday in the wake of
reports about presidential election results in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed in a statement to the Interfax news
agency that Moscow builds relations with Taipei on "two basic
principles", of which the most important is "the four-no principle
" -- no to Taiwan's independence; no to the recognition of the
concept of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"; no to Taiwan's
membership in international organizations, whose participants can
be only sovereign states; and no "to arms and military hardware
shipments to Taipei."
</P>
<P>
The second principle, it reiterated, is that Russia "maintains
with Taiwan only trade, economic, scientific, technical, cultural,
and sports contacts and only on an informal footing."

<HEADLINE> Feature: E-Commerce in Thailand Has Long Way to Go  By Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- When Nattawan Angkanarugdee, the
owner of Sahara Gold and Silver Co. logged on to the Internet, she
was surprised by some of her mails -- orders from as far away as
Spain and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
It was in the middle of 1999 shortly after the company listed
on www.thaitradefair.com, a website developed by Thailand's
Commerce Ministry to encourage Thai exporters to use the
electronic way to do business.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the website, Nattawan is taking e-mail orders from
buyers in many more countries, including the United States, a
market she had never dreamed she is able to penetrate with the
help of the internet.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is still of no big size in
Thailand. But it is growing so rapidly that no one can afford to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has been aware of the importance of e-
commerce a few years before and has taken measures to promote it.
</P>
<P>
The National Electronic and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
was assigned by the government in 1998 to draft six bills related
to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, two of the six draft bills, E-Commerce Bill
and Digital Signature Bill, were approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Thailand, the status of on-line trading
activities would be legitimized and on-line transactions between
local traders and either local or foreign parties are expected to
be boosted.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four bills, covering electronic fund transfers,
data protection, computer crime and universal access, are expected
to get the nod from the cabinet soon.
</P>
<P>
All the six bills are expected to be passed into law within
this year after parliament consideration, Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi told Xinhua during a
National E-Commerce Conference held here last week.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said a legal framework in order is what the country is
lacking in further developing e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the two bills was a first step of the
government's efforts to "bring legal support to the internet
trading system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somkiat Tangkivanich, a specialist at the Thailand Development
and Research Institute (TDRI), told Xinhua at the same conference
that the Thai government as a whole has been rather "active" in
developing e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
In addition to drafting the six bills, NECTEC organized several
working groups to set up smart card standard and electronic
certificate authority in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Several conferences, training programs and exhibitions have
also been organized to enhance the public's awareness of the
modernest way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
As back as three years ago, the Commerce Ministry began setting
up websites like the one jeweler Nattawan joined to list Thai
exporters especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
helping them to boost their sales.
</P>
<P>
The government's involvement in e-commerce has been a great
help to the Thai exporters, according to Somkiat, because with the
Thai government as an intermediate, trust was more easily created
between foreign buyers and local exporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand is still lagging behind and needs to do more
to jump on the bandwagon of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Among the top priority is to lower the prices of internet
access, said TDRI's Somkiat.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is one of the countries that have the most expensive
leased lines for businessmen who want to sell their goods on-line,
Somkiat said.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's price is five times as expensive as that of
Hong Kong, four times as Japan, three times as Singapore and two
times as Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"The high price has become one of the major obstacles that
hinder the development of e-commerce in Thailand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high prices resulted from a monopoly of state-run
Communication Authority of Thailand (CAT) of the telecom industry.
</P>
<P>
"The telecom industry should be liberalized to bring down the
internet access prices," Somkiat said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister Supachai said the country has set up a
national regulatory body for the telecom sector and the
liberalization process may possibly begin next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are underway," Supachai said. "We are converting old
concessions so that there will be new competition."
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles include irrational taxation and insufficient
qualified engineers and businessmen, according to Somkiat.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the government lower or even exempt tax on
information technological (IT) goods, which are being charged with
seven percent value-added tax if exported.
</P>
<P>
As for the security of on-line trading, Somkiat said the
government should set up a security emergency task force which
could issue warnings against or make rapid responses to viruses or
hacker attacks.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should also shift the way the government conducts its
procurement from manually to electronically so that a new
incentive can be created for the growth of e-commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
The value of e-commerce transaction in Thailand is expected to
reach 25 billion baht (661 million U.S. dollars) annually in the
next two years up from 22 billion baht (582 million dollars) in
1998, according to a Commerce Ministry survey.
</P>
<P>
However, Somkiat said the 1998 figure was too high to be
reliable.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-two billion baht means 0.47 percent of the total gross
domestic product (GDP), while in the same year, e-commerce
transaction accounted for 0.59 percent of the United States' GDP,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"That means e-commerce was as much important to the Thai
economy as it was to the U.S. economy, which is untrue," he
explained.

Although newspaper reports said Thailand's internet users are
expected to reach one million this year, Somkiat said there had
been no reliable statistics.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the development of e-commerce, maybe the
government should first conduct an accurate survey on the industry
which will be crucial not only for e-commerce but also for other
IT policies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian FUNCINPEC Congress Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's FUNCINPEC party
opened a congress Sunday at its headquarters in Phnom Penh, with
the aim to strengthen party unity.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 party representatives from all over the country are
attending the three-day session chaired by party President Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, who is also president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Participants will focus their discussions on such key issues as
drafting law for the party's commune election, enhancing the
internal structure of the party, developing the country's economy
and eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The main purposes, according to a FUNCINPEC press release, are
to strengthen the party's unity and maintain better cooperation
with other parties so as to serve the interests of the nation and
the people.
</P>
<P>
Asked about if and when the ex-members who left the FUNCINPEC
party during the violent times in July 1997 would return, Prince
Ranariddh said his party was prepared to hold a special meeting to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also disclosed that the first group of people who
were possibly returning to the party would be several top members
of Reastr Niyum Party (Populist Party) (RNP), including party
President Ung Hout, vice president and current Council of
Ministers secretary general Nady Tan and vice president and former
agriculture minister Tao Seng Hour, as well as the party's
secretary general Pou Sothirak.
</P>
<P>
Ung Hout, who replaced Ranariddh as first prime minister after
July 1997, formed the party before the 1998 general election. Most
of his party members are from FUNCINPEC as the royalist party was
split into many factions due to the event that took place in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Ung Hout is prepared to dissolve his party and
bring all the members back to FUNCINPEC. Ung Hout has insisted
that his party's merger with FUNCINPEC would send a positive
signal of national reconciliation while bolstering the party
before the commune election.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said here Sunday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit on Monday would mark a milestone in bilateral, political and
economic cooperation between Dhaka and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"You may consider it as the new millenium gift to the people of
Bangladesh in recognition of our persistent efforts for peace and
development," Azad told newsmen.
</P>
<P>
He described Clinton's visit as "very positive" and said it
would bring about a new dimension in the existing excellent
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question regarding the apprehension that the
present government would forgo national interest to appease
Clinton, the foreign minister said that in the new millennium
foreign policy making and implementation of the policies are
changing at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
"When our prime need is to develop the country, we must help
our people to emerge from the vicious cycle of poverty. For this
we must strive to garner all available international opportunities,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Azad hoped the would will ensure increased economic cooperation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Forensic Experts to Conduct Post-Mortem Operations on Burnt Cult Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Police Spokesman Asuman
Mugenyi told Xinhua Sunday afternoon that the forensic experts
would conduct post- mortem operations on some of the burnt cult
members and a report on the results would come out in a couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
"We sent a team of forensic experts there and they would
cooperate with government chemists to investigate the causes for
the death of the cult members," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents have dug a mass grave for the over 200 cult
members who burnt themselves in a makeshift church. Most of the
victims were burnt beyond recognition because they spread fuel on
themselves before sparking off the fire," he added.
</P>
<P>
The members of the cult named Restoration of Ten Commandments
of God burnt themselves in the southwestern district of Rukungiri
on Friday, believing that the year 2000 is the end of the world
and they could go to heaven in this way of ending their own lives.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting reports of the figure and the government
has not yet issued any statement on the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu said on Saturday that "
We will be number one country of Europe in tourism next year.
Earthquake disasters and Ocalan affair affected tourism negatively
last year. But the year 2000 will be a perfect year for Turkish
tourism."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Three mild tremors measuring 2.1 to 3.9 degrees on the
Richter scale, on Saturday rocked Senkaya town of Turkey's eastern
Erzurum province.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ataturk University Seismology Institute said
that the three quakes, centered on Senkaya, were recorded between
06:10 a.m. and 07:40 a.m. local time in the day. However, no

<HEADLINE> Israeli Public Hospital Doctors Resume Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at Israel's public
hospitals resumed their nationwide strike Sunday morning to force
the Finance Ministry to solve their wage problems.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Medical Association (IMA), on behalf of the doctors,
failed to reach a wage agreement with the ministry on Friday. The
IMA called on the doctors, who held strikes on a daily basis
earlier this week, to strike again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 14,000 administrative and maintenance
personnel at government hospitals are continuing their sanctions in
29 state hospitals and medical research institutions. They have
been on strike since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IMA's workers' union claims it has lacked a wage agreement
with the ministry since 1999, and that the doctors and medical
workers want terms equal to those of employees paid by manpower
companies, research funds and hospital friends' organizations.
</P>
<P>
They also want compensation for what they claim the lack of 1,
800 job slots that put a heavy burden on staffers.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, reception at outpatient clinics has been
canceled, nurses weren't bused to hospitals, patients were not
wheeled by aides from one department to another, mail was not
handled, equipment was not supplied, and the test results were not
distributed.
</P>
<P>
The IMA is also demanding that all doctors in the public sector
get 20 percent wage increases, no matter what their current pay, to
compensate them for "erosion" since their 1994 wage contract was
signed.
</P>
<P>
IMA chairman Yoram Blachar wrote a letter earlier this week to
Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee Chairman Elie Goldschmidt,
saying that the "low pay" for doctors in public institutions forces
many of them to moonlight in private institutions.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry officials said that they will not accept the
IMA demands for too much wage hike for doctors and hospital
workers, because such demands will impose a burden that will be too
heavy for tax payers to shoulder.

</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet Wednesday narrowly approved a heavily
revised withdrawal map that did not include the Arab village of
Anata on the fringe of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who rejected previous Israeli
pullback proposals and insisted he be given more populated areas
near Jerusalem, has accepted the new map.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from 6.1 percent more land of the West Bank under
the terms of a peace deal signed last September in Egypt's Red Sea
resort Sharm el Sheikh should have taken place on January 20. It
was put on hold due to differences between the two sides over
which areas should be handed over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute also led to the month-long deadlock in Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks and caused the two sides to miss a February
13 deadline for a framework agreement on a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
The areas to be handed over to the Palestinians include villages
near the towns of Jenin, Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem, Tulkarm and
Qalqilia, said Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on
Wednesday, adding that they are relatively close to Jerusalem, but
do not border on the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the redeployment, which also needs to be endorsed by
Arafat, will increase the areas under full Palestinian control to
810.2 square kilometers and the areas under Palestinian civil
control to 24.7 square kilometers, said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due to meet at Bolling
Air Force base in Washington on Tuesday in an effort to reach a
framework agreement as soon as possible so that all permanent
status issues can be resolved by September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will also address interim issues, including the
third phase of further redeployment.

LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 400 people, including women and children, were
feared dead Saturday night after members of a doomsday cult set
fire to themselves in a ritual mass suicide in a Ugandan church.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

growing public anger at the abuse of the refugee laws.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>

1997 election.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Putin Looks Set to Win Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- With the Russian presidential
elections one week away, few now doubt that Vladimir Putin, the
acting president, would become the official master of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
When he took over as acting head of state on December 31
following Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation, commentators listed
Chechnya, the economy and heightened expectations as the three
factors that could wreck his chances of winning the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
Putin has fared well in all three fronts.
</P>
<P>
Despite major casualties suffered by federal troops, the
military campaign in Chechnya remains popular among Russian
citizens. The joint federal force in the breakaway republic
reported 1,628 men killed and 4,308 wounded between October 1,
1999, and March 17, according to Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Putin's
spokesman on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, the rising toll appeared to reinforce, rather than
erode, public support for the assaults. A March 13 poll by the All-
Russia Public Opinion Survey Center (VTsIOM) found 73 percent of
the 1,600 adult respondents believed the federal troops should
continue the military campaign, 3 percentage points higher than a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched last September following two waves of
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of
apartment bombings, also blamed on the Chechen militants, that
left some 300 people dead in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
The Russian economy is also moving in Putin's favor. A devalued
ruble and higher oil prices on the world market have helped
domestic producers and brought windfalls to the state coffer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expectations remain high among the Russians, partly
due to Putin's strategy of a "constructive ambiguity" on his
policy orientations, which appeals to a wide-ranging public and
avoids risks of alienating some of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The military actions in Chechnya have undoubtedly boosted
Putin's popularity from relative obscurity, but his public support
has other deep-rooted reasons.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Russians have grown tired of economic
shambles, lower standards of living and waning influence in the
international arena. Putin's image as a incorruptible, steel-
willed no-nonsense type, as displayed in Chechnya, and his slogan
of a stronger motherland, give them a shimmering hope that here
comes at last a strongman who may rejuvenate the Russian nation.
</P>
<P>
Actually, many of the other 11 presidential hopefuls have
publicly conceded that they stand no chance of winning the
elections, prompting local commentators to wonder why on earth
they still want to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions are Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
and liberal Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky. Zyuganov said he
would defeat Putin in the first round while Yavlinsky said he
would beat Zyuganov in the first round and face Putin in the run-
off.
</P>
<P>
As acting president and prime minister, Putin enjoys broad
media coverage and is confident enough to decline free campaign
advertisements allowed under the election law.
</P>
<P>
"People in the executive must prove their worth by their
concrete deeds, not advertising," he said. "I will not be trying
to find out in the course of my election campaign which is more
important, Tampax or Snickers."
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed Putin would get 60 percent of the votes,
well above the 50 percent needed for outright victory in the first
round, said Yuri Levada, director of VTsIOM.
</P>
<P>
"The main sensation is that no sensations are expected," he
told reporters last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The people have made their choice. The main curiosity is what
will happen next and what kind of policy we will have," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to VTsIOM, even if Putin cannot make it in the first
round, he will in he run-off. He is expected to receive support
from two thirds of the voters if his rival is Gennady Zyuganov,
and three fourths of the voters if the opponent is Grigory
Yavlinsky, said Alexei Grazhdankin, deputy director of VTsIOM.

JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After a more than six-week hiatus, the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks will resume at Bolling Air Force Base in
Washington on Tuesday and are expected to last between a week and
10 days.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin on Friday said the primary focus of the negotiations will be
to reach a framework agreement as soon as possible so that all
permanent status issues can be resolved by September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
It added that the negotiations will also address interim issues,
including the third phase of further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has not given his
unqualified endorsement to an Israel Defense Forces plan to
maintain several bases in Lebanon after a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Top IDF officers presented Barak with "Morning Twilight," the
army's plan for unilateral pullout, on Friday. At the meeting's
conclusion, Barak ordered the officers to flesh out certain details
of the plan, particularly around the issue of the army bases.
</P>
<P>
Morning Twilight suggests that even after a withdrawal, the IDF
maintain some military outposts in Lebanon, a few hundred meters
from the international border.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The ultra-orthodox religious Shas party's spiritual leader
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef drew an analogy between Haman, the villain in
this week's upcoming Jewish Purim holiday and Minister of Education
Yossi Sarid in his weekly Saturday night address carried over local
radio.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yosef stated that Sarid, of the left-wing Meretz Party,
should be cursed and the wicked Sarid's name should be wiped out of
the world forever because of Sarid's constant attacks on the
Orthodox way of life.
</P>
<P>
Meretz officials have called upon the prime minister to take
immediate action and police to launch an investigation into what
they called "incitement to murder."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Doctors nationwide at public general, psychiatric, and
geriatric hospitals will resume sanctions Sunday morning, meaning
that operating rooms will only handle emergencies and diagnostic
institutes run by the health funds will not have physicians on
staff.
</P>
<P>
The worker's union claims it has lacked a wage agreement since
1999, and that the workers want terms equal to those of employees
paid by manpower companies, research funds, and hospital friends'
organizations.
</P>
<P>
They also want compensation for what they claim is the "lack of
1,800 job slots that put a heave burden on staffs."

<HEADLINE> Hotel Prices in Phnom Penh drop By 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Hotel prices in Phnom Penh
have dropped by as much as 50 percent from their levels in
September 1998 as more and more hotels are opened and direct
flights to Siem Reap started.
</P>
<P>
Prices for tour groups and corporate representatives at some of
the city's top hotels have dipped to as low as 40 to 60 U.S.
dollars per night, less than half of their promotional prices of
early 1997, Cambodia Daily reported quoting tourism ministry
sources.
</P>
<P>
Hoteliers and ministry officials attributed the drop in rates
to fierce competition caused by continued hotel development in the
capital and the government's "open-skies" policy that allows
airlines to fly direct to Siem Reap, bypassing Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, hotel prices in Siem Reap are reportedly going up
because of increased business.
</P>
<P>
Three new hotels totaling more than 750 rooms are expected to
open in Phnom Penh this year. Adding the other two renovated
hotels totaling 165 rooms, the five hotels would increase the room
capacity of the city by roughly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
With more and more new hotels opened, many hotels were forced
to charge about 30 percent less than official prices. For example,
Sofitel Cambodaiana Hotel has reduced its per night price from
late last year's 180 U.S.dollars to 90 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some fear the heated competition could lead to a "price war"
that would jeopardize the health of the industry But others say
the trend is healthy because it is a result of free market forces,
and prices are getting closer to rates in Bangkok and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Washington Urged to Hold Talks With Manila on Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Washington should initiate talks
with Manila for a "reasonable settlement" of the cleanup of toxic
waste in two former U.S. military bases in the northern
Philippines, a Philippine senator said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the environmental cleanup of the former U.S.
military bases in Clark and Subic could reach 1 billion U.S.
dollars, Senator Loren Legarda told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government should act now while the cleanup is less
complicated and less costly, and before the problem becomes a full-
blown foreign policy, environmental and public health disaster,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The senator said that the U.S. government has a moral and legal
obligation under international law to accept responsibility, begin
the cleanup and protect the health of communities in and around
the former bases.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, over 70 people in Clark alone
have died of cancer and heart failure believed to have been caused
by toxic waste dumped or abandoned by American troops.
</P>
<P>
"The longer the U.S. government acts irresponsibly, the bigger
the problem will get. The toxic contamination won't go away. It
will only get worse," Legarda said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Philippine government estimated that at least 1
billion pesos (25 million dollars) would be needed just to map,
verify and quantify the extent of toxic and hazardous waste
contamination in the two bases.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said the Philippines is entitled to demand the cleanup
at the U.S. government's expense.

<HEADLINE> Number of Burnt Cult Members Could Be 600: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of the cult members
who burnt themselves in a church Uganda's southwestern district
of Rukungiri Friday evening could be as high as 600, a New Vision
report said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one of its reporters at the scene as saying
that he counted at least 400 bodies charred beyond recognition
before he could not stand the terrible smell.
</P>
<P>
A local security officer said that there were 240 male
tax-payers living in the camp and these men had families there.
He was quoted as putting the number at over 600.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, the cult members burnt themselves in the
church after hours of celebration. The report said that the cult
members sealed the doors and windows before sparking off the
fire.
</P>
<P>
It has not been established when the five leaders of the cult
named Restoration of Ten Commandments of God took part in the
mass suicide. The cult believed in the year 2000 being the end of
the world and they were advised to go to heaven to see god.
</P>
<P>
So after the tragedy, police investigators were sent to the
scene to look into the event. Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi
told Xinhua late Saturday night that the government would come up
with a series of measures to curb cult activities very soon. He
declined to say if any arrests had been made.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Claims of Australian Athletes Drug Use Erupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Fresh allegations erupted on
Sunday about widespread drug use among the Australia's top
athletes, including those at the Australian Institute of Sport (
AIS).
</P>
<P>
Under the spotlight is synthetic insulin growth factor, or IGF-
1, which is indistinguishable from that produced naturally by the
body.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Nine Network's Sunday program revealed Australian
Federal Police had investigated illegal distribution of IGF-1,
including allegations it had been bought and used by individual
athletes and coaches associated with the AIS.
</P>
<P>
Steve Howells, head of the federal government's Therapeutic
Goods Administration in Canberra, told the program that
intelligence indicated unlawful supply of the IGF was going to the
elite sports market.
</P>
<P>
It was also claimed on the program that up to 80 percent of
Australia's elite athletes took performance enhancing drugs, some
using IGF-1, which is undetectable and has similar effects to
insulin in stimulating muscle growth.
</P>
<P>
Grant Ellison, introduced on the program as sports performance
consultant, said athletes using the drugs were performing at
national and international level.
</P>
<P>
Among other revelations on the program, a former Australian
national athletics champion and Commonwealth Games and Olympic
representative admit using the banned drug and revealed that up to
80 percent of his teammates used it.
</P>
<P>
The former national sprint champion and 1996 Olympic competitor,
who was not identified, also gave first-hand knowledge of IGF-1 in
elite sports.
</P>
<P>
"Just the fact that it was undetectable was like a godsend to
everybody, it was a real buzz around the community," said the
sprinter who has never tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I was just worried about improving my performance," he said
adding that he never feared the potential harms of taking the drug,
" the sprinter said.
</P>
<P>
"Leading into the Olympics of 96, almost everyone I knew was
involved at some stage with IGF-1," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd be looking at 70 - 80 per cent of people, maybe
more, certainly within the power/strength disciplines," he said.
</P>
<P>
A former Australian champion shot-putter, Craig Watson, now a
trainer, revealed that one black marketeer bought IGF from GroPep,
an Adelaide-based company in the South Australia state, which is
the only significant manufacturer of IGF-1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
IGF-1 was the latest drug of choice, along with the more
popular human Growth Hormone and erythropoetin, known as EPO, the
program reported.
</P>
<P>
GroPep managing director John Ballard said he had heard that up
to 1,000 athletes may be using IGF1, possibly paying up to 1,000
Australian dollars (660 U.S. dollars) for a small vial.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sports Minister Orders Report into Drug Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian federal Sports
Minister Jackie Kelly Sunday ordered a report into claims that up
to 80 percent of Australia's elite athletes were taking
performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Sports performance consultant Grant Ellison told the Nine
Network's Sunday program that athletes using the drugs were
performing at national and international level.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Kelly said she was surprised by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
She said the program impugned the integrity of the majority of
Australia's Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The Sunday program failed to produce anything more than
hearsay evidence to support its claim that 80 percent of
Australian athletes are using performance enhancing drugs," Ms
Kelly said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless I have asked for a full report into the claims,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Kelly said the government's goal for the Sydney Olympics
was for athletes to turn in pure performances.
</P>
<P>
"The Commonwealth Government will continue to be vigilant in
order to meet the challenges presented by drug cheats," she said.
</P>
<P>
"My message to those engaged in tracksuit fraud is don't do it.
We will catch you," she added.

<HEADLINE> Ice Cream Proves to Be Hot Item </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ice cream should be the object of
a sweet industry in China considering the size of the market, but
cut-throat competition and an economic slowdown have brought
bitter days to some manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The industry has developed at an annual growth rate of about
105 percent since 1987, said an article carried in today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 ice cream enterprises, including world famous
brands, are introducing numerous new products in the country.
Total annual production exceeds one million tons, said the article.
</P>
<P>
As a result , production has exceeded demand for many
manufacturers, said Yang Jian, a brand manager with Wall's (China)
Co. Ltd, the No.1 ice cream producer in China, which is affiliated
to Unilever.
</P>
<P>
That has given rise to fierce competition, which has resulted
in price cutting.
</P>
<P>
Price cuts have ousted some small producers, which had been
selling shoddy products at extremely low prices,, but the whole
industry also suffered a decline in profit because of price-
cutting.
</P>
<P>
Wall's slashed its prices by 25 percent to 30 percent last year,
to make its ice cream "more affordable to more Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
Despite a sluggish market, Wall's doubled its sales volume last
year, and enhanced its position as China's No. 1 ice cream
producer.
</P>
<P>
Maarten Fontein, general manager with Wall's China, said
profitability of his company has been increasing annually.
However, other producers which are inferior in strength to Wall's
have not been so lucky. Last year, overall sales volume of ice
cream in China dropped by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the overall sales in China's ice cream market to
drop further this year because consumer purchasing power will
suffer a decline because of unemployment problems," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
But he said there will be no price cut this time. Wall's will
maintain prices of all its products, including five new products
to be launched in April, at the same level as last year's.
</P>
<P>
"The moment you lower prices at the expense of quality, you
lose your customers," said Fontein adding, "it is not a good way
to go."
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in nine major cities showed that Chinese
consumers now consider taste and quality first when buying ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
Fontein said he expects price competition may continue into
this year, but at a lower level because more producers will
realize the importance of quality.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate the annual consumption of ice cream is one
liter per capita in China, seven liters in Europe and 25 liters in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In China, ice cream consumers are mostly urbanites while vast
rural markets have been untouched. As China's economic conditions

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.60 jump in the
annual rate of inflation to 2.74 percent from 2.14 percent in the
previous week was due to an across-the-board rise in indices of
constituents of Wholesale Price Index.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, however, was way higher at 5.26 percent
during the corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate had recorded steady decline after touching a 32-
week high of 3.31 percent for the week ended January 22.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the upward trend of the inflation rate is
likely to continue in the coming weeks due to the five percent
increase in freight charges and other budgetary measures including
raising of excise duty on a number of items of mass consumption to
be effective from April 1.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, U.S. Discuss Easing Electricity Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Unites States discussed ways to
ease the DPRK's severe electricity shortage during their recent
talks in New York, newspaper reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The energy shortage, which, Pyongyang said, has affected its
already weak industries, was caused by delays in the construction
of two 1,000-megawatt light water nuclear reactors Washington
promised in a 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
The United States had committed itself to completing the first
project by 2003, but now a delay of several years seems likely.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side admitted the just demand of the DPRK for making
up for the electricity and the two sides had discussions on the
ways of meeting the demand," a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman
was quoted as telling the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During the March 8-15 talks between DPRK Vice Foreign Minister
Kim Gye Gwan and U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman, they also
discussed the Pyongyang demand that the DPRK be removed from the U.
S. list of countries sponsoring terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had a general and adequate discussion of pending
issues between them and agreed to continue the talks on these
issues through various channels, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Claims of Australian Elete Athletes Illicit Drug Use Emerge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Up to 80 percent of Australia's
elite athletes are taking performance enhancing drugs, an
Australian sports consultant claimed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Athletes using the drugs were performing at national and
international level, sports performance consultant Grant Ellison
told Australia's Nine Network's Sunday program.
</P>
<P>
Under the spotlight is synthetic insulin growth factor, or IGF-
1, which is undetectable from that produced naturally by the body.
</P>
<P>
Ellison, an analytical chemist and former user of performing
enhancing drugs, said he had advised about 20 athletes heading for
the Sydney Olympics about their drug use.
</P>
<P>
He had helped the athletes, who compete in cycling,
weightlifting, track and field and rowing, to use drugs safely
while passing drug tests.
</P>
<P>
GroPep, the company that supplies IGF-1, is concerned about
alleged illicit use of the drug.
</P>
<P>
Managing director John Ballard said he had heard that up to 1,
000 athletes may be using the drug, possibly paying up to 1,000
Australian dollars (660 U.S. dollars) for a small vial.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Institute of Sport said it was not aware of any
evidence linking its athletes to performance enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities in Canberra said matters related to IGF-1
had been referred to the Australian Federal Police, the Nine
Network reported.

QUITO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government on
Saturday hailed a WTO panel decision allowing it to impose 201.6 U.
S. dollars in annual sanctions against the European Union (EU) in
their banana dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador hoped that EU member states would comply with this "

bulletin.
</P>
<P>
It added that the decision made negotiations with the EU
possible. Sources said Ecuador prefers negotiating with the EU
for compensations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, the world's largest banana producer, had initially
requested WTO permission to impose 450 million dollars in
sanctions to cover losses due to the EU's banana import policy
favoring those from its former colonies in Africa and the
Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The EU practice, which an earlier WTO ruling regards as
discriminatory, has also been complained about by the United
States and other Latin American countries.
</P>

The panel decision has yet to be formally considered by a full

<HEADLINE> Spain's Grain Yield Drops to 20-Year Low for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Grain yield in Spain dropped
sharply to 13 million tons in 1999, the lowest level in 20 years,
as a result of a devastating drought across the country, according
to local media reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The drought, the worst to hit the country in 53 years and
starting in the second half of 1999, also caused great losses in
the production of other farm goods. Sunflower produce decreased
to 500,000 tons, down 50 percent from 1998. Wine output was
reduced to less than 3.3 billion liters.
</P>
<P>
Animal husbandry was also severely affected with an estimated
loss of more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' income substantially dropped in 1999, resulting from
the decrease in the outpute of meat and dairy products. This year
will witness a further 8 percent income drop, reports said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attacks on Yugoslavia Meant Aggression Against Europe: Yugoslav FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jovanovic made the remarks in an interview with the Belgrade-
based Evening News. On March 24 last year, U.S.-led NATO forces
started bombing Yugoslavia and the air strikes lasted 79 days.
</P>
<P>
The United Stated launched the war of aggression against
Yugoslavia in order to destroy peace and stability in Europe,
European material civilization and its strategic interests,
Jovanovic charged.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intention of aggression was clearly demonstrated when
NATO bombed and destroyed some bridges over the Danube. The
bridges not only belong to Serbia and Yugoslavia, but also to the
whole of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The barbaric aggression itself was only a test. If it worked,
it would be tried on in other parts of the world, the Yugoslav
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately NATO did not succeed in its attempt and the heroic
resistance of the Yugoslav people has encouraged all other peace-
loving people to unite and fight U.S. hegemony and "neo-
imperialistic" policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the restoration of diplomatic relations with the
United States, Britain, France and Germany, Jovanovic said that
only when these nations call off sanctions against Yugoslavia,
stop interfering in its internal affairs and compensate for the
war damages, could any relations be re-established with them.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Workers' Income Dropped to Record Low: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak workers' real income
dropped to a record low last year, according to figures released
by the Slovak State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The workers received an average monthly wage of 10,728 Koruna (
about 255 U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 7.3 percent over 1998, but
their real income decreased as the inflation rate soared up 14.2
percent. The workers' real income was down 20 percent compared
with 1989.
</P>
<P>
The drop is attributed to economic slides, stagnant enterprises
and high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in 1999,
much lower than the 4.4 percent in 1998. About two-thirds of the
total enterprises in the country are running in the red while the
unemployment rate reached 20.1 percent, the highest among European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Guerrillas Attacks Kill Three in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed, six
injured and two others kidnapped Saturday when Colombian rebel
guerrillas tried to occupy Santa Cecilia in the western state of
Risarlda.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels
occupied Santa Cecilia for 10 hours and left in the first hours of
Saturday, police regional commander Colonel Mario Davila told the
press.
</P>
<P>
The dead were a policeman, a soldier and a civilian. They were
killed when the rebels ambushed the patrols near the entrance to
Santa Cecilia, said Davila.
</P>
<P>
The rebels destroyed a police post and damaged a
telecommunications office building, a church and several houses,
he added.
</P>
<P>
FARC, Latin America's largest surviving 1960s rebel army with
some 17,000 combatants, now dominates about 40 percent of the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian authorities and the United States have always
accused the rebels of making huge profits from the drug trade in
areas under its control, a charge FARC denied.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Colombian government and the National
Liberation Army, the second largest rebel group in Colombia,
started peace talks. In March, the government and FARC also
started contacting each other.
</P>
<P>
However, last Wednesday FARC warned that if the government does
not commit itself to stopping paramilitary activities in the
country, it would "definitively" halt peace talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The protracted civil conflict in Colombia has taken 35,000
lives and forced more than 1 million people to flee their homes in
the last decade.

<HEADLINE> More China-Made Plane Exports Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Aviation Industry
Corporation II plans to turn to exports to increase its sales and
development, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Cui Degang, director of the company's
international cooperation and trade department, as saying that no
aircraft manufacturing company could survive competition by
depending solely on its domestic market.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the corporation expects to sell 200 aircraft
overseas within five years.
</P>
<P>
China Aviation Industry Corporation II, one of China's top ten
military industry enterprises, has 54 large and medium-sized firms
and 210,000 employees and 31.5 billion yuan (3.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in total assets.
</P>
<P>
It mainly produces helicopters, aircraft, mini-vans and
motorcycles. The aircraft produced by the corporation's factories
have a price advantage as they are medium-sized or small, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft manufacturing firms in western countries rely on
exports for 60 percent to 80 percent of their production. But
exports of China Aviation Industry Corporation II account for less
than ten percent, said Cui.
</P>
<P>
"We have to actively explore the international market, while
keeping a close eye on the domestic market," he said, "we should
focus on improving our technical level to increase our
competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
China's possible accession to the World Trade Organization this
year will bring both challenges and opportunities. Cui disclosed
that his company planned to cooperate with China National Aero-
Technology Import and Export Corporation to develop new aircraft
models which can meet the needs of international market.
</P>
<P>
Cui believed that the state's decision to develop the western
areas of China provides enormous chances for them to expand the
aircraft sector and will in turn help boost plane exports.
</P>
<P>
Further cooperation with foreign aircraft company will also be
expanded, said Cui. The EC-120 helicopters, which were jointly
developed by China, Singapore and several European countries, have
proved to be popular. The first group of 110 EC-120s have been
delivered. Another 120 EC-120s are expected to be delivered this
year.
</P>
<P>
China Aviation Industry Corporation II has exported more than
360 aircraft to 22 countries including Sudan, Pakistan, Canada and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Reduce Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will reduce fuel imports in
the second half of this year and the first half of 2001 because of
increases in the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Carlos Lage was quoted Saturday by the local
media as saying that the present volume of fuels is not enough,
but that alternate measures will be implemented to reduce the
imports of hydrocarbons without affecting "vital activities."
</P>
<P>
Lage said that oil prices soared to an average of 31 U.S.
dollars per barrel this month from the level of 11 dollars per
barrel in May 1999, while the prices of sugar, one of the main
export products of Cuba, dropped to 0.05 dollar per pound over the
past few weeks from 0.14 dollar per pound in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said that
Cuba lost 38 million dollars in the first two months of 2000
because of the prices for which it sold its sugar and what it had
to pay for crude.

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Second seed American Lindsay
Davenport came from behind to overwhelm top seeded Martina Hingis
of Switzerland 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 in the final of the Tennis Masters
Series event in Indian Wells, California on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, playing in her sixth consecutive final, looked well
on the way to defeat after dropping her serve in the third game of
the second set as top seed Hingis took a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
But Davenport tightened up her game, sharpened her movement
around the court and began capitalizing on her greater power,
winning the next 10 games and handing Hingis her first 6-0 set
loss since her first-round defeat by Jelena Dokic at last year's
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Davenport spent one hour 34 minutes to beat her old rival and
has won her last five meetings against Hingis.

ATHENS -- About 2,000 NATO troops, most of them Americans,
would pass through northern Greece in the coming days on their way
to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to participate in the planned
military exercise, codenamed "Dynamic Response 2000," Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the passage of the NATO force through the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki would take place in compliance
with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Describing the NATO troops movements as "a provocation of the
Greek people," the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) leader Aleka
Papriga said they would protest against NATO troops transit
through northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Being extremely concerned over the worsening situation in
Kosovo, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou Friday had a
telephone conversation with his Yugoslav counterpart on the latest
developments in the region.
</P>

Refusing to participate in the forthcoming NATO military
exercise, Greece has urged parties concerned to step up their
efforts for a quicker and viable solution to the Kosovo issue. (

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton left Washington on
Saturday for a week-long visit to three countries in South Asia.
</P>

It is the first visit by a U.S. president to India in 22 years
and to Pakistan since 1969. And Clinton will be the first U.S.
president who embarked on Bangladesh ever since.
</P>
<P>
His visit represents a strategic shift in U.S. policies toward
the Indian subcontinent, a shift from its alliance with Pakistan
in the era of the Cold War to its cooperative partnership with
India.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will spend five days of his week-long trip in India,
showing U.S. intention to enter this potential great market.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton must first focus his attention on the security in
the region as the situation there has deteriorated since India
first conducted nuclear tests and Pakistan followed suit to
counter-balance its influence, in May 1998. Conflicts in Kashmir
in October 1999 put the two rivals on the verge of a war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Friday that he hoped to use his trip to reduce
tension between India and Pakistan. (US-Clinton-South Asia)

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Shocked at Cult Mass Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government was
shocked at the mass suicide committed by more than 200 cult
members and vowed to uproot the increasing cult activities in the
country, a police spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government would surely intervene, but the most important
thing is education," Asuman Mugenyi said in a telephone interview
with Xinhua from Mbarara, 250 kilometers southwest of the capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda said that 235 members of the doomsday cult
"Restoration of Ten Commandments of God" attended an hour-long
belief service and sang and danced before setting themselves
ablaze on Friday in a church in Rukungiri district, 320 kilometers
southwest of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Mugenyi said that the police are still investigating the
incident and have not yet established the death toll because most
of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that most of the kids were brought there by their
parents who wanted to see God.
</P>
<P>
Mugenyi said that high illiteracy rate in Uganda is to blame
for the existence and rapid development of these cults.

JERUSALEM -- Israel on Sunday freed three Palestinian security

released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel Prison Authority (IPA) said all the three Palestinians
are East Jerusalem residents and belong to the Palestinian main
political faction of Fatah headed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, and their release is a goodwill gesture to the Palestinians
to mark the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been discussing the
release of more Palestinians from Israeli jails, but no final
agreement has been reached so far. The two sides agreed to meet

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Expelling Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on Sunday
strongly rejected allegations that Iran had expelled Afghan
refugees legally residing in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran did not deport any legal Afghan refugees, said Mohammad-
Reza Rostami, deputy director general of the Foreign Nationals and
Expatriates Department at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the eve of the Iranian new year to start on
Monday, a series of security measures had been adopted against
seasoned thieves, culprits and wandering addicts.
</P>
<P>
Rostami said the security measures also applied to a limited
number of Afghan refugees, who lack any legal residential permits
and have a black record, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rostami's denial echoed Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi, who Saturday called the allegations "baseless rumors."
</P>
<P>
According to Rostami, spokesman of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Jacques Franquin has alleged
recently that Iran had expelled Afghans without any coordination
with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Iran reserves the right to deal with those disturbing its
national security and order, while adhering to the joint protocol
for voluntary return of Afghan refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UNHCR have signed a protocol of cooperation to
facilitate and help repatriation of Afghan refugees residing in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rostami said the protocol envisages preparation of necessary
facilities for return of those holding valid residential cards and
giving a six-month period to the Afghans residing without any legal
permits to leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
He put the number of Afghans holding valid residence permits in
Iran at more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Afghan refugees comprise the bulk of refugees residing in Iran
and for more than two decades Iran has been hosting them with
little aid from international organizations, noted the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghan refugees have badly depleted Iran's economic and
social resources, which Iranians themselves needed.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the wide-scale adverse effects of the
Afghans' presence on culture and social services in Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Refugees reside mainly in the provinces of Tehran, Khorasan,
Sistan-Baluchestan and Isfahan, and in some regions they even
outnumber locals, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Eid Al-Adha Ends With 100 People Killed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day holiday for this
year's Islamic Feast of the Sacrifice, or Eid Al-Adha, concluded in
Turkey on Sunday with 100 people killed and 200 injured in traffic
accidents across the country during the period, the Anatolia News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Feast of the Sacrifice, one of the two major Islamic
holidays, is marked by four days off work -- and when combined
with weekends usually it is added up to at least a week of time
off. This year the Feast of the Sacrifice gave the Turkish
population a big nine-day break.
</P>
<P>
With the chance to visit relatives for an extended period of
time or go on vacation in tourist resorts, many traveled to other
cities, causing a heavy traffic in the country's highways.
</P>
<P>
The traffic situation became from bad to worse as a result of
the sudden change in weather conditions near the holiday end. The
coastal regions of the Aegean, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea
areas experienced rain, while the interior parts of Turkey and the
Marmara region had heavy snowfall. Temperatures ranged from -20 C
in the east to 6 C in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, four people died and 42 were injured in a traffic
accident on the Ankara-Istanbul Highway when a tourism bus crossed
over barriers on slippery road.

<HEADLINE> New Iranian Year Important for Iran-U.S. Ties, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of Iran's powerful State
Expediency Council (SEC) Mohsen Rezaei said on Sunday the coming
Iranian year, which starts on Monday, is important for Iran-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Rezaei said Washington's explicit acknowledgment of past
mistakes in its policy toward Tehran and its decision to ease
sanctions on Iran signaled a new era in the United States' attitude
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The introductory measures (by Washington) indicate inauguration
of a new chapter in the U.S. policies toward Iran," he told the
Islamic Republic News Agency in a reaction to the Friday speech of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the American-Iranian Council, Albright
announced the lifting of ban on imports of Iranian luxury goods and
invited Tehran to enter a "new relationship" with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Terming Albright's speech as "important," the SEC secretary said
the new Iranian year would be an important year for relations
between Iran and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The SEC headed by former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
serves as an arbitrator between the (Majlis) parliament and the
conservative Guardians Council and an advisory body to the supreme
leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ease of sanctions on Iran came after Iranian
reformists, who support better ties with the U.S., took over the
country's powerful parliament from the conservatives in last
month's elections.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday
also welcomed the U.S. move as "positive," and said that Iran would
respond by allowing imports of grains and medicine from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
However, Rezaei, who was formerly commander of the elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), said that Washington's new
strategy could lead to restoration of relations with Iran only
after it successfully removed "contradictions in its foreign
policy."
</P>
<P>
He also called Washington's ties with Israel "the biggest
obstacle on the way of resumption of Washington-Tehran ties."
</P>
<P>
Rezaei, who softened his hard-line stance during the February
parliamentary polling, warned that any hasty or indiscreet response
to Albright's statement might be against Iran's national interests.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Hassan
Rowhani and the IRGC on Saturday slammed Albright's speech, which
repeated the U.S.' accusations against the IRGC and Iranian
Intelligence Ministry, as "a clear interference in Iranian
affairs."
</P>
<P>
Albright renewed Washington's concern on Iran's stance on key
issues of the weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and the Middle
Ease peace process. The political developments in Iran had not
caused the IRGC or the Intelligence Ministry to get out of the
terrorism business, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks angered the powerful IRGC, which has its
ground, air and naval forces independent of the Iranian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The calculated remarks made by Albright about the Islamic
Republic of Iran and the revolutionary bodies indicated an
intensified conspiracy of the White House to stir up waves of
crises in Iran, the IRGC said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Tanzanian Prime Minister on China Visit by Pang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Fredrick Sumaye on Sunday described his forthcoming visit to China
as "a gesture of friendship" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that bilateral cooperation will be
cemented even more closer through his trip starting from next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua a few hours before his
departure from Dar es Salaam Sunday afternoon for an official
visit to China, Sumaye talked about a number of issues ranging
from the purpose of his China visit to bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is now doing very well in its economic
development, he said he wants to see how the Chinese people have
managed so successfully to bring the economy to where it is.
</P>
<P>
"I will also want to visit agricultural development sites. Our
country has a lot of potential. But we are not yet even
self-sufficient in food production," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he wants to learn from China what
it has done to make it feed 1.2 billion people, while Tanzania is
still not able to comfortably and sustainedly feed its 30 million
people.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania hopes that China can offer more investment and
 expertise to it to help develop its economy and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese companies and Chinese business community should open
up their road to Tanzania. More of them should come," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, this is the best way to cooperate. Our economy
will obviously pick up if we have investment from countries like
China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the Chinese people are more expert in agriculture,
textile manufacturing, tourism management and mining, therefore
they can offer Tanzania more technological assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said: "China is a great friend of Tanzania for a very long
time. It is a country that we value the relationship. It has
assisted Tanzania in many ways. My trip therefore is a gesture of
this friendship and to cement our cooperation even more."
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister noted that the two countries are
not moving fast enough on joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"This is also an area which I would want to discuss when we are
in China, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is China's largest aid-recipient country in Africa.
Since 1964, China has rendered various kinds of aid to Tanzania.
The mutually beneficial co-operation between the two countries,
which began in the 1960s, has been developing rapidly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are eight Sino-Tanzanian joint ventures and
eight Chinese companies running contract business in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the total volume of trade between China and Tanzania
reached 79. 67 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> It's favorable for Merkel to be Nominated as new German CDU leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, March 19 (Xinhua) --Angela Merkel, 45-year-old
secretary-general of Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) ,
is now no doubt to be nominated as candidate for the new
chairwoman of the party according to the sources on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Merkel comes from the former German Democratic Republic and
first ever woman at the helm of one of the Germany's two main
political parties. She would face the arduous task of improving
the CDU's image badly suffered from the finance scandal since the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
There is a bitter struggle within the CDU for the leadership
of the party. According to sources of the party the CDU executive
board would back her as candidate for the new chairwoman during a
meeting in Berlin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a trained eastern German physician and protege of former
chancellor and CDU chairman Helmut Kohl, she has big hope of
victory.
</P>
<P>
Her top opponent was Volker Ruehe, the CDU leader in the
northern state Schleswig-Holstein, who had been defeated in the
state election last month by the Prime Ministeress of the state
from the SPD, Heide Simonis.Now a former environment minister
managed to take part in the competition for the new leadership.
</P>
<P>
The new party chairman will be elected at a party congress in
Essen planned April 9-11.
</P>
<P>
Besides Ruehe and the former environment minister there are
other possible contenders, for example Bernhard Vogel, the Prime
Minister of the state of Thuringia, Kurt Biedenkopf, the Prime
Minister of the state of Saxony and the Saarland's Prime Minister
Peter Mueller.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Merkel would announce her candidature at
meeting of the CDU presidium and the board in Berlin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting on Monday will make no decision on who will be
named as new secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect Fires Bursts of Shots in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, the suspect, Joseph Palczynski, broke off his
telephone contact with negotiators in Baltimore County of Maryland
, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when he kidnapped
his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the couple she was
staying with and a neighbor. A fourth person was killed and a boy
was wounded when Palczynski allegedly carjacked a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Whitehead escaped unharmed and Palczynski later fled to
Virginia, where he stole guns and forced a man to drive him back
to Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
The five bursts of gunfire Sunday morning were the first signs
of activity since Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two
others hostage Friday night.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported and police did not return his fire.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski stopped talking with negotiators for about an hour
and a half Sunday morning, and police moved in with an armored
vehicle and a bullhorn to urge him to resume communications.
</P>
<P>
Police refused to characterize their negotiations with
Palczynski but confirmed that a psychiatrist was helping
negotiations. Police said Palczynski has bipolar disorder, often
called manic-depression, which causes extreme mood swings.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old unemployed electrician also has a history of
convictions for assault and battery. Days before the killings, he
was charged with assaulting Whitehead but was released on 7,500 U.
S. dollars bail.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski has said that he would shoot himself or make police
shoot him rather than go back to prison.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski has been in a similar situation before. In 1992, he
kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a domestic
violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced out with
tear gas.
