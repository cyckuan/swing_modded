Fewer Japanese to go abroad this summer for first time since 1980
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation, ADDS comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting Japan's weak economy, the number of
Japanese traveling overseas this summer is likely to fall for the
first time in 18 years, a top travel agency said Wednesday.
	   About 3.17 million people are expected to go abroad for their
summer vacation, 2.4 percent less than last year, according to a
survey by the Japan Travel Bureau.
	   Besides Japan's slumping economy, a weaker Japanese currency and
the Asian economic crisis will also keep people at home, JTB said.
	   ``The declining trend in the number of Japanese visiting Hong
Kong remains unchanged since its return to China,'' said JTB
spokeswoman Jun Watanabe. ``People are also shunning away from
choosing Indonesia as a destination because of the lingering
effects from the financial turmoil,'' she added.
	   The drop would be the first since 1980 when Japan's economy was
reeling from the second oil shock, the travel agency said. The only
other year-on-year decline was recorded in 1974, following the
first oil shock.
	   But the survey also showed that the number of Japanese planning
to take vacations inside the country this summer was set to
increase to 84.7 million people, up 1.4 percent from last year.

Merrill Lynch opens first Tokyo branch of new retail brokerage

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. securities company Merrill Lynch opened the
first Tokyo branch of its brokerage business in Japan on Wednesday,
its biggest step yet to cash in on the deregulation of the
country's financial markets.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of New York-based
Merrill Lynch and Co., plans to open 28 more branches around Japan
by the end of July and to eventually operate 33 here.
	   The company will offer mutual-fund-like accounts and brokerage
services to individual investors. Merrill Lynch opened its first
branch in Japan in Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, on
July 1.
	   Foreign financial companies are expanding rapidly in Japan amid
sweeping deregulation, known as the ``big bang,'' which is opening
financial markets to new competition.
	   Merrill Lynch executives said they are optimistic those reforms
will create a more vibrant economy.
	   The deregulation ``will advance the cause of an open,
transparent, liquid and well-regulated financial system, which is
essential to Japan's efforts to emerge from its current recession,
and resume healthy economic growth,'' Merrill Lynch Chairman and
CEO David Komansky said. ``Merrill Lynch is bullish on Japan.''
	   Foreign companies are hoping to get a piece of Japan's dlrs 9
trillion pool of individual savings.
	   Merrill Lynch set up the retail brokerage unit in February,
hiring some 2,000 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities Co.,
Japan's fourth-largest brokerage. Yamaichi folded late last year
after revealing more than 250 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in hidden
losses.

Officials say airport getting on track, but criticism grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Airport managers said Wednesday that they had
worked through two days of start-up problems at Hong Kong's huge
new airport that left passengers stuck on planes, lost in the
terminal or waiting for bags. Critics were unimpressed.
	   After giving the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport mixed
reviews for its first day of operation, Hong Kong's press turned up
the heat.
	   Editorials questioned whether they had rushed the opening of the
airport, and in the process damaged Hong Kong's reputation instead
of giving the territory a much-needed morale boost.
	   Since the airport opened on Monday morning, passengers
experienced delays in baggage handling and flight information. Some
complained that they had to wait an hour or more to get off their
planes after arriving, and many said that the vast airport's signs
were poor.
	   One of the most damaging developments was the decision Tuesday
of a major cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to move
some import and export clearance operations back to its facilities
at the old airport until computer bugs could be straightened out at
the new airport.
	   Airport officials said Wednesday that things were getting
better.
	   ``Yesterday, we worked through many of our own problems,'' said
corporate development director Clinton Leeks on Hong Kong radio.
``The flight information system is now working well. We now have
our baggage handlers working much better.
	   ``Now, we believe we essentially have our own act together,'' he
said. Airport authorities were turning their attention to making
sure companies that provided essential services at the airport also
were up to speed.
	   Editorialists were having none of it. As Hong Kong slips into
recession, the South China Morning Post said Chek Lap Kok might
turn into another in a series of nightmares.
	   ``Everyone was thirsting for a confidence-building event;
instead the airport's first days may join economic downturn, avian
flu, red tides on the register of depressive events of the past
year,'' it said.
	   ``The troubling impression is of a management which pleads that
things were, in effect, bound to go wrong, but which had worked on
the basis that everything would be all right,'' it said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard cited what it said was a ``lack of
foresight, preparation, practical training and testing of
facilities.'' It questioned why senior officials made such a
spectacle of welcoming the first passengers to arrive at the new
airport Monday morning.
	   ``Alas,'' the Standard said, ``it was a case of overdoing and
under achieving.''
	   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Airport Authority officials
denied that the airport was pushed into operation before it was
ready.
	   ``No matter how much longer we waited, you still would have the
same kind of problems,'' said Hank Townsend, chief of the Airport
Authority. ``We feel this is mostly under control, and we don't
expect to see it coming up continuously.''
	   The new airport, built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island, replaced old and overcrowded Kai Tak, famous for its
roof-skimming approaches over congested urban areas.
	   The old airport, one of the busiest in the world, closed just
after midnight Monday and eventually will be redeveloped for
housing estates.

AL 13, NL 8
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Coors Field lived up to its billing as a hitter's
haven and a pitcher's house of horrors Tuesday night as solo homers
by MVP Roberto Alomar and Alex Rodriguez helped the American League
beat the Nationals 13-8 in the highest-scoring All-Star game ever.
	   A crowd of 51,267 and a national TV audience that tuned in to
see a run-fest got exactly what it wanted. Barry Bonds' three-run
homer was among the record-tying 31 hits.
	   Tom Glavine, Roger Clemens and most of baseball's best pitchers
were powerless to prevent Ken Griffey, Cal Ripken, Tony Gwynn and
the rest of the majors' top hitters.
	   The runs came in all sorts of ways. While three balls flew over
the fences, several others carried a long way in the Mile High air.
At one point, Clemens pointed skyward when he thought Bonds had hit
a popup _ the ball wound up on the warning track.
	   Sometimes, outfielders playing deep had no chance to rush in and
catch bloopers. Other times, batters took advantage of curve balls
that don't curve well in Denver to hit wicked grounders past
helpless fielders.
	   Alomar got three hits and won the Most Valuable Player award a
year after his brother, Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar, earned the
honor. Rodriguez also had three hits for the AL and Devon White, a
substitute, had three for the NL.
	   Walt Weiss got two hits and the cheers of his 3-year-old son,
Brody, recently out of the hospital after fighting off a
life-threatening strain of E. coli bacteria.
	   Rafael Palmeiro's RBI single in AL ninth accounted for the 21st
run, breaking the record set in the AL's 11-9 win in 1954.
	   All that, and still a couple of defensive plays enabled the AL
to cut the National League's overall lead to 40-28-1.
	   Left fielder Paul O'Neill threw out Fernando Vina at the plate
to preserve a 10-8 lead in the eighth, and shortstop Omar Vizquel
followed by turning a nifty double play on the next batter.
	   In a fitting twist, Cleveland's Bartolo Colon got the win
despite giving up Bonds' homer in the fifth, the only inning he
pitched. Montreal's Ugueth Urbina was the loser.
	   In an odd twist, sluggers Mark McGwire and Juan Gonzalez did
little. McGwire, leading the majors with 37 homers, was 0-for-2.
Gonzalez, leading the majors with 101 RBIs, got up with nine
runners on base and drove in just one.
	   The AL bounced back quickly after Bonds' homer, scoring three
times in the sixth for an 8-6 edge. A couple of infield hits, a
wild pitch by Urbina and a passed ball by Javy Lopez did most of
the damage.
	   Ripken broke Willie Mays' record with his 15th straight start,
then hit a two-run double that keyed a four-run fourth off Glavine
for a 4-2 lead. The Iron Man didn't exactly drive the ball, but his
opposite-field fly had no problem riding the light air and reaching
the top of the right-field wall.
	   Weiss' second single off the game closed the NL to 4-3 in the
bottom half and earned him another ovation from his family and
fans.
	   Gwynn, playing in his 13th All-Star game, put the NL ahead 2-0
in the third against Roger Clemens by grounding a two-run single
off Alomar's glove at second base.
	   The AL put runners on first and third to begin the game, but
Greg Maddux expertly escaped. He got Griffey on a foul pop to
McGwire _ those two guys are bound to be linked all season _ in
getting out of trouble.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Maddux and Glavine are tied for the NL lead with 12 wins.
The last time an All-Star starter was relieved by a pitcher from
the same team was 1973 when Oakland's Catfish Hunter started and
Ken Holtzman followed. The last time it happened in the NL was 1969
when St. Louis' Steve Carlton started and Bob Gibson relieved. ...
NL reliever Jeff Shaw, celebrating his 32nd birthday, pitched the
eighth. He was traded from Cincinnati to Los Angeles on Saturday,
making him the first All-Star ever to be dealt between the time he
was selected and the game itself. He wore a Dodgers uniform for the
first time. ... David Wells was the first Yankees pitcher to start
the All-Star game since Mel Stottlemyre in 1969. ... Urbina is the
only All-Star ever with a last name beginning with ``U.'' ... At
the seventh-inning stretch, the scoreboard showed a tape of the
late Harry Caray singing ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' ...
Rodriguez became the first catcher to get three hits in an All-Star
game. ... Gwynn left the game following the fourth after
aggravating a strained left hamstring. The injury is not considered
serious. ... The AL stole a record five bases.

South Korea further delays bullet train project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Wednesday it will run
its first bullet trains by 2004, but only about half as far as
originally planned.
	   The country had planned to build a 430-kilometer (270-mile) high
speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan, a port city on the
southeast coast, by 2004.
	   But the government said Wednesday the country's financial crisis
has dried up funds and it will be able to build only 250 kilometers
(155 miles) of line over the next six years.
	   The Construction and Transportation Ministry put the cost of the
250-kilometer line at 12.7 trillion won (dlrs 9 billion). It said
construction of the remainder of the line will begin in 2006 and be
completed six years later.
	   In the interim, an existing railroad will be electrified to let
the bullet trains keep running from Taegu, a city in central South
Korea, to Pusan at a much reduced speed, the ministry said.
	   In March, the government audit agency recommended that
cash-strapped South Korea reconsider building the railroad, saying
it ``cannot afford the unprofitable, reckless project.''
	   The bullet train, which would be Asia's second after Japan's
Shinkansen, is by far the largest among hundreds of half-finished
projects South Korea launched during its boom years in the 1980s
and early 90s.
	   The rail plan was developed to ease chronic traffic congestion
along the Seoul-Pusan corridor, where travel time rises to 20 hours
during major holidays.
	   But frequent route and design changes and sloppy engineering
work have forced delays and pushed up the cost.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to rescue its economy. It has since slashed spending as
part of an austerity program imposed by the IMF in exchange for a
record dlrs 58 billion bailout.
	   GEC-Alsthom of France delivered its first shipment of a train
engine and 20 passenger cars in April.

Beijing inspectors target auto emissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's capital has turned to spot checks on cars
in the battle to clean up Beijing's air, among the world's most
polluted, the official China Daily reported Wednesday.
	   Four teams of environmental inspectors examined 17,000 vehicles
in the first three months since the spot checks started April 1 and
more than half those cars needed emission-reducing catalytic
converters, the newspaper said.
	   Auto exhaust accounts for 80 percent of the lead and 63 percent
of the carbon monoxide in the city's air, the China Daily said.
	   Beijing banned the sale of leaded gas throughout the city and
suburbs starting Jan. 1. But the move, and wider use of catalytic
converters, will likely have only limited effect.
	   Foreign auto industry executives have said that many places
still mix leaded and unleaded gas, making the fuel unfit for
catalytic converters.
	   China Daily said cars need to be better made in order to improve
significantly auto emissions. Only three of ten different new car
models surveyed by Beijing's environmental protection bureau met
government standards for auto emissions, the newspaper said.

Report: Israelis gathering arms to oppose retreat from Golan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Two Israelis are being questioned on suspicion
of plotting armed resistance to a possible Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights, Israel radio and army radio reported Wednesday.
	   Civilian police found Kalachnikov automatic rifles, large
quantities of ammunition, night vision equipment, flares and other
military equipment at the homes of the two suspects, the radio
said.
	   A police source said there was enough equipment to outfit half a
company of troops, the radio reported.
	   One of the suspects is an army paratrooper whose home is at a
kibbutz (communal village) in the Golan. The other lives at Kibbutz
Dan in nearby Upper Galilee.
	   The army spokesman confirmed that the military police are
``investigating the circumstances of the theft of the military
equipment, and when the investigation is complete, the findings
will be passed on to the military prosecutor.''
	   The civilian police suspect that the two may be part of a plot
to oppose Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights by force,
Israel radio said.
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Peace negotiations between the two countries broke down in March
1996. Syria claims that the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
promised to return the entire Golan Heights, but Israel denies
this.

Howard promises rural constituents communications after Telstra
</HEADLINE>
sale

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Facing a revolt by the rural
conservative party in his governing coalition, Prime Minister John
Howard promised outback Australians they won't be abandoned by the
telephone company when the government sells it off.
	   Howard's government sold off a third of Telstra, the national
carrier, in 1997 and has built the expected proceeds from the sale
of the remaining two-thirds into its budget assumptions for the
next year.
	   Legislation to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra will
come before the Senate this week.
	   The first sale raised U.S. dlrs 943 million (Australian dlrs
14.3 billion) and cut the public debt interest bill by about U.S.
dlrs 600 million (Australian dollars 900 million) a year.
	   The sale attracted many first-time share buyers to the stock
market, with government guarantees ensuring a significant
proportion of shares went to small investors rather than big
institutions.
	   But rural Australians, whose phone connections are heavily
subsidized by Telstra, fear they will be hit with huge charges for
connections or repairs if they have to pay the actual cost of
services under a privatized Telstra.
	   Many members of Parliament from the junior partner in the
governing conservative coalition, the rural-based National Party,
fear they will be voted out of office if the Telstra sale goes
ahead.
	   They are facing a new threat from the right-wing populist One
Nation party founded by independent member of Parliament Pauline
Hanson, which opposes privatization and defends the interests of
people in ``the bush,'' even if that requires subsidies or
protectionism.
	   Howard said the government would ensure rural communities would
not lose out from the sale of Telstra, with the bush to benefit
from the social bonus funded from the proceeds of the sale.
	   ``I've indicated that one of the things that we would spend it
on is obviously communications in regional Australia because that's
something that's high on our list,'' Howard said.
	   ``And it's been high on our list for months and months and
months.''
	   National Party members have been demanding details of the
package before they will commit themselves to the Telstra sale, but
Howard refused to release details Wednesday.

Chinese farmers block traffic with tractors to protest taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Farmers upset over high government taxes drove
their tractors into an eastern Chinese city to block traffic in
protest, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported Wednesday.
	   The demonstration Tuesday in Bengbu marked the latest outburst
of discontent by farmers and workers who feel harmed by China's
capitalist-style reforms and neglected by an indifferent or corrupt
officialdom.
	   About 100 farmers from Mopanzhang village outside Bengbu pulled
their tractors in front of the city's government office building
Tuesday morning, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   One unidentified demonstrator told the rights group that the
government had raised taxes and fees despite an appeal by China's
legislature in March ``to reduce the peasants' burdens.''
	   Large numbers of police were sent to the scene and the farmers
agreed to leave peacefully around noontime after meeting with a
city official to discuss their grievances, the rights group said.
	   A spokesman for Bengbu's police department refused to comment on
the demonstration.
	   Farmers and workers were once treated as protected,
revolutionary classes by the ruling Communist Party. Their current
disaffection threatens to further undermine the party's tattered
legitimacy and poses a challenge to its continued rule.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Tensions continued to simmer
over the blocking of a Protestant parade through a Catholic
neighborhood in the town of Portadown.
	   Late Tuesday, angry members of the Orange Order paraded
illegally through Belfast and blocked roads across Northern Ireland
in hopes of forcing British authorities to let them complete their
controvesial route.
	   The confrontation over Sunday's blocked Orange Order march in
Portadown, a fiercely Protestant town 30 miles (50 kms) southwest
of Belfast, has set Northern Ireland alight for the third summer in
a row.
	   After dark, several thousand Orangemen and their supporters
massed peacefully at Drumcree Anglican church outside Portadown,
where the parade ran into British army-erected barricades shortly
before it was due to pass Catholic homes along the town's Garvaghy
Road.
	   The Orangemen _ who have pitched tents and entertained
themselves with barbeques, politicians' orations and traditional
Protestant bands _ say they will stay there until the authorities
relent.
	   In 1996, the last time that police blocked the march at
Drumcree, they had to give up after four nights of intensifying
Protestant violence and force the Orangemen past furious Catholics
down Garvaghy Road.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, chief opponent of April's peace accord
outlining a compromise government for Northern Ireland, said he was
confident that the Orangemen would be allowed down Garvaghy Road
again this year.
	   He said it would be ``far better'' if authorities redeployed
police and troops against the Garvaghy Road Catholics before
Sunday, the eve of the Orangemen's biggest annual celebrations
across Northern Ireland, when they commemorate the 1690 victory of
the Protestant King William of Orange over the Catholic James II.
	   David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, the Protestant and Catholic
politicians jointly heading Northern Ireland's new cross-community
government, worked behind the scenes to inch Portadown's Orange
leaders and members of the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition closer
together.
	   Mallon, deputy leader of the north's moderate Catholic party,
consulted with Garvaghy Road protest leader Breandan MacCionnaith,
who has tried unsuccessfully since 1995 to get the annual parade
barred from the area.
	   And Ulster Unionist leader Trimble, an Orangeman himself, went
inside an Orange Hall to talk with Portadown's Orange leaders, who
refuse to meet MacCionnaith because he's a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner.
	   Before the meetings, Mallon said he and Trimble ``have embarked
upon a seemingly impossible task'' to broker compromise.
	   Police statisticians said in the first 36 hours of rioting up to
Tuesday morning, 42 police officers were injured, 101 vehicles
stolen and burned, and there were 330 separate occasions when mobs
bombarded police and soldiers with gasoline bombs. They arrested 63
rioters over the period.
	   After dark Tuesday sporadic violence resumed and continued
throughout the night. Police were shot at and pelted with gasoline
bombs, and Protestants ambushed passing drivers and forced them to
surrender their cars to join burning road barricades. They also
burned Catholic properties in predominantly Protestant areas.

Indonesian workers protest at labor ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - About 200 workers protested at the
labor ministry on Wednesday to demand higher wages and complain
that military handling of their rallies has been heavy-handed.
	   The protest by workers from several factories in Jakarta was
peaceful.
	   Indonesia is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades, and
millions of people are struggling to find enough money to buy food.
	   President B.J. Habibie has pledged democratic reform in the wake
of the resignation of his predecessor, Suharto.
	   Protests have flourished since the authoritarian Suharto quit,
but last month the military blocked workers from marching to
Parliament to press for labor rights.

Roberto Alomar follows brother as MVP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Alomars need to get a bigger trophy case.
	   First Sandy, now Roberto. The All-Star game's Most Valuable
Player award is becoming the family's personal property.
	   ``This is a special trophy for myself and for my family,''
Roberto said after going 3-for-4 with a home run Tuesday night in
the American League's 13-8 win over the National League.
	   He singled in the first inning, popped out in the third, and
walked to load the bases in the fourth. In the seventh, he
connected off Trevor Hoffman with a 375-foot (114-meter) drive that
put the AL ahead 9-6.
	   ``I'm going to give it to my mom,'' Roberto said. ``I think
she's the one who deserves it. When we were young, she used to take
us to the ballpark. Without her, we wouldn't be here.''
	   Marie Alomar watched the game back home in Puerto Rico along
with Sandy Sr., a major leaguer from 1964-78. Sandy Jr., whose
trophy is sitting near a gift shop in Jacobs Field, wasn't sure
their mom had the space for yet another award.
	   ``She doesn't have a lot of room,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
trophies at my mom's house _ from Little League, from American
Legion, from early in our minor league careers. She doesn't want
them anymore.''
	   Sandy, the older brother, was the star last year before the
hometown fans in Cleveland, hitting a two-run homer off Shawn Estes
to give the AL a 3-1 victory at Jacobs Field.
	   ``It's real nice,'' Roberto said. ``Last year, my grandmother
died and Sandy won it. This year, I won it.''
	   Sandy had felt he had begun to redeem the family name with the
big game in the spotlight last summer.
	   ``They're a very talented duo,'' said AL manager Mike Hargrove,
Sandy's manager in Cleveland. ``I don't think anything they do
should surprise us.''
	   The Alomar reputation had been spotless before Roberto spit on
umpire John Hirschbeck during the final weekend of the 1996 season.
It's an incident the pair don't like to talk about much anymore.
	   It hasn't gotten any easier for Roberto since then. Baltimore,
the favorite in last year's AL playoffs, was eliminated by
Cleveland, then spun to a 38-50 record in the first half of this
season.
	   Baltimore owner Peter Angelos has threatened to trade away his
stars if the Orioles, 26 games out of first and in fourth place,
don't start to turn their season around.
	   ``I don't think anybody on our team is happy with the way we're
playing,'' Roberto Alomar said. ``There's going to be some good
times and some bad times. You have to take the good with the bad.''
	   Sometimes, the pair let their minds wander ahead, wondering what
it would be like to play together. Roberto is eligible for free
agency after this season and there have been rumors the Indians
might trade for him this year.
	   ``Yes, it's a dream for me to play with Sandy on the same
team,'' Roberto said. ``But I don't know if it's going to happen.
... I'm real happy where I am right now.''
	   Sandy wouldn't mind. Especially for his parents' sake. He knows
what they went though when the Indians played the Orioles last
October.
	   ``They wouldn't have to root for two teams,'' he said. ``Last
year, they were going crazy.''

New kiwifruit comes in yellow, not green
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Japan will become the first major
export market for a brand-new kiwifruit variety _ so new it doesn't
yet have a name.
	   The yellow-fleshed, sweeter, tropical-tasting kiwifruit, packed
with more vitamin C than the old green-inside variety, is hairless
on the outside and its skin is only slightly heavier than a pear.
It sports a pointy end.
	   Quietly market-tested in Japan last year, the kiwifruit which
growers are unofficially calling ``early gold'' was such a hit it
sold for almost U.S. dlrs 7 (14 NZ dollars) a tray, three times the
price for the old greens.
	   Seventeen thousand trays are bound for Japan this season.
	   While growers call it `early gold'', the new variety's only
official name to date is ``Hort 16a,'' the label under which it was
registered by research institute Hortresearch.
	   The yellow kiwifruit is the outcome of years of work by plant
breeders and researchers.
	   Researchers also have high hopes for other new kiwifruit
varieties, including a yellow with red-flecked center, and a bright
orange one.
	   Another being developed is a cherry-sized fruit in reds and
greens called the kiwigrape.
	   Many of these are years away from supermarket shelves.

Weiss and son share starry night
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES first item with Weiss getting second hit and adds new
second item on records set. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Two weeks ago, as he lay near death in a hospital,
it would have been unthinkable. But there in the stands at Coors
Field on Tuesday night was Brody Weiss, 3-year-old son of Atlanta
shortstop Walt Weiss.
	   Brody, sitting with his mother, Terri, was there to watch his
father play in the 69th All-Star game, the first time in Weiss'
11-year major-league career that he has been named to play in the
midsummer classic.
	   When dad was introduced with the rest of the NL All-Stars before
the game, Brody, sitting on mom's lap, smiled. Then, after Walt
singled off Toronto's Roger Clemens in the third for the NL's first
hit, Brody clapped with some help from mom.
	   Weiss, who played four seasons with the Rockies, gave the Coors
Field crowd another thrill his next time up with an RBI single in
the fourth inning off Minnesota's Brad Radke.
	   Brody continued to make progress toward what doctors believe
will be a full recovery from a life-threatening strain of E. coli
bacteria, which he contracted from contaminated water at an Atlanta
water park.
	   His kidneys shut down and he was on dialysis, and he appeared
headed for a coma, which was the fate of two other children who
were playing at the park that day.
	   After four sleepless, unbearable nights, the Weisses learned
their son would recover. And instead of spending at least a month
at Atlanta's Scottish Rite Children's Hospital, Brody was released
in about 10 days.
	   In that context, the All-Star game takes on diminished
significance in Weiss' eyes.
	   ``Is there a game tonight?'' Weiss said Tuesday dressing for
batting practice. ``The game has been the last thing on my mind. I
haven't even thought about the game. Sure, it's a special game, but
I look at it with a different perspective.''
	   Asked if it would be difficult to concentrate in the game, Weiss
said, ``Yeah, probably. You just go out there and instinctively
play baseball. You try to react and rely on your instincts.''
	   Asked if his son understood the significance of the game, Weiss
said, ``I don't think he really grasps what is going on. He's
pretty young.''
	   Doctors were concerned about Brody's exposure to bacteria while
flying on a commercial jet from Atlanta to Denver, so Colorado
owner Jerry McMorris offered the Weiss family the use of his
private jet to make the trip easier. Weiss played for the Rockies
from 1994-97.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   In Denver, at hitter-friendly Coors Field, offensive records are
the norm, and the American League's 13-8 victory over the National
League featured a rash of them.
	   The combined 21 runs eclipsed the record 20 in 1954 when the AL
won 11-9 in Cleveland. The AL's 13 runs and 19 hits tied tied team
records and the combined 31 hits also tied a record.
	   It was the longest nine-inning game in All-Star history at 3
hours, 38 minutes, eclipsing the 3:10 in 1954.
	   The five stolen bases by the AL set another record, and Ivan
Rodriguez became the first catcher in All-Star history to get three
hits in the game. All of his hits were singles, tying the record
for singles in an All-Star game.
	   Baltimore's Cal Ripken made his 15th consecutive All-Star start,
topping Willie Mays' mark of 14.
	   Atlanta shortstop Walt Weiss became the oldest position player
to make his All-Star debut as a starter (34 years, 7 months).
	   Craig Biggio struck out three times, tying another All-Star
mark.
	   The crowd of 51,267 was the largest in the four-year history of
Coors Field.

Myanmar dissident returns home after confrontation: Diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
returned home Wednesday from a nearly 24-hour standoff with police
on a road outside the capital, diplomats said. The military regime
said the act of defiance would disrupt peace.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, arrived back
at her lakeside home at 8:45 a.m., diplomats said on condition of
anonymity, following an overnight sit-in in her car after she was
stopped by police some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yangon.
	   The trip flouted on unofficial ban on her traveling outside
Yangon and was viewed by the government in a statement as a bid to
``create unnecessary and unwanted confusion, confrontation and
collision.''
	   Suu Kyi was apparently unharmed. Telephones at her home and
those of other leaders of her National League for Democracy were
out of order. Government officials were not immediately available
for comment.
	   Suu Kyi's activities are tightly restricted. The trip outside
her home without a customary security-forces escort, followed by
her refusal to return when stopped, amounted to a challenge to
government authority amid a wider push to hasten civilian rule.
	   Last month, her party for the first time set a deadline, Aug.
21, demanding the government convene the parliament elected eight
years ago. The NLD overwhelmingly won that vote but the ruling
generals, whose supporters were beaten, never allowed parliament to
meet.
	   Since the demand was issued, the government has required the
members-elect living outside the capital to report twice a day to
local authorities, an apparent attempt to keep them from convening
on their own. Those who refuse have reportedly been detained.
	   The government reported Tuesday that Suu Kyi had been attempting
to reach Min Hla township, 147 kilometers (92 miles) north of
Yangon. Her reason for going was unclear but was believed to be
connected to the recent crackdown on the legislators.
	   Traveling with her was Aung Shwe, the NLD's chairman, an elected
parliament member and their driver.
	   It was the second time since she was released from six years of
formal house arrest in 1995 that Suu Kyi has tried to travel
outside Yangon. In 1996, she tried taking a train north to
Mandalay, but the coach she would have ridden in was removed from
service.
	   Suu Kyi has again been restricted to her home since 1996 but is
occasionally allowed to leave to meet small groups of supporters
and to receive some visitors. She is barred from making speeches or
other public political activities.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi's trip Tuesday coincided with the anniversary of the
demolition that year of the Students' Union building at Yangon
University, a symbol of political militancy.
	   The recent challenges her party has thrown at the government
regime coincide with the anniversary of an anti-military uprising
in 1988 that was crushed when the army killed thousands of
protesters.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was vaulted
into the leadership of the pro-democracy movement by the uprising.
	   A new generation of generals also came to power. They opened the
long-isolated economy to foreign investment in an effort to lift
the country out of poverty, but have allowed little political
dissent.

</HEADLINE>
sale
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Australian dollar sale figure in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Facing a revolt by the rural
conservative party in his governing coalition, Prime Minister John
Howard promised outback Australians they won't be abandoned by the
telephone company when the government sells it off.
	   Howard's government sold off a third of Telstra, the national
carrier, in 1997 and has built the expected proceeds from the sale
of the remaining two-thirds into its budget assumptions for the
next year.
	   Legislation to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra will
come before the Senate this week.
	   The first sale raised U.S. dlrs 943 million (Australian dlrs
1.43 billion) and cut the public debt interest bill by about U.S.
dlrs 600 million (Australian dollars 900 million) a year.
	   The sale attracted many first-time share buyers to the stock
market, with government guarantees ensuring a significant
proportion of shares went to small investors rather than big
institutions.
	   But rural Australians, whose phone connections are heavily
subsidized by Telstra, fear they will be hit with huge charges for
connections or repairs if they have to pay the actual cost of
services under a privatized Telstra.
	   Many members of Parliament from the junior partner in the
governing conservative coalition, the rural-based National Party,
fear they will be voted out of office if the Telstra sale goes
ahead.
	   They are facing a new threat from the right-wing populist One
Nation party founded by independent member of Parliament Pauline
Hanson, which opposes privatization and defends the interests of
people in ``the bush,'' even if that requires subsidies or
protectionism.
	   Howard said the government would ensure rural communities would
not lose out from the sale of Telstra, with the bush to benefit
from the social bonus funded from the proceeds of the sale.
	   ``I've indicated that one of the things that we would spend it
on is obviously communications in regional Australia because that's
something that's high on our list,'' Howard said.
	   ``And it's been high on our list for months and months and
months.''
	   National Party members have been demanding details of the
package before they will commit themselves to the Telstra sale, but
Howard refused to release details Wednesday.

Myanmar dissident returns home after confrontation: Diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
returned home Wednesday from a nearly 24-hour standoff with police
on a road outside the capital, diplomats said. The military regime
said the act of defiance would disrupt peace.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, arrived back
at her lakeside home at 8:45 a.m., diplomats said on condition of
anonymity, following an overnight sit-in in her car after she was
stopped by police some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yangon.
	   The trip flouted an unofficial ban on her traveling outside
Yangon and was viewed by the government in a statement as a bid to
``create unnecessary and unwanted confusion, confrontation and
collision.''
	   Suu Kyi was apparently unharmed. Telephones at her home and
those of other leaders of her National League for Democracy were
out of order. Government officials were not immediately available
for comment.
	   Suu Kyi's activities are tightly restricted. The trip outside
her home without a customary security-forces escort, followed by
her refusal to return when stopped, amounted to a challenge to
government authority amid a wider push to hasten civilian rule.
	   Last month, her party for the first time set a deadline, Aug.
21, demanding the government convene the parliament elected eight
years ago. The NLD overwhelmingly won that vote but the ruling
generals, whose supporters were beaten, never allowed parliament to
meet.
	   Since the demand was issued, the government has required the
members-elect living outside the capital to report twice a day to
local authorities, an apparent attempt to keep them from convening
on their own. Those who refuse have reportedly been detained.
	   The government reported Tuesday that Suu Kyi had been attempting
to reach Min Hla township, 147 kilometers (92 miles) north of
Yangon. Her reason for going was unclear but was believed to be
connected to the recent crackdown on the legislators.
	   Traveling with her was Aung Shwe, the NLD's chairman, an elected
parliament member and their driver.
	   It was the second time since she was released from six years of
formal house arrest in 1995 that Suu Kyi has tried to travel
outside Yangon. In 1996, she tried taking a train north to
Mandalay, but the coach she would have ridden in was removed from
service.
	   Suu Kyi has again been restricted to her home since 1996 but is
occasionally allowed to leave to meet small groups of supporters
and to receive some visitors. She is barred from making speeches or
other public political activities.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi's trip Tuesday coincided with the anniversary of the
demolition that year of the Students' Union building at Yangon
University, a symbol of political militancy.
	   The recent challenges her party has thrown at the government
regime coincide with the anniversary of an anti-military uprising
in 1988 that was crushed when the army killed thousands of
protesters.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was vaulted
into the leadership of the pro-democracy movement by the uprising.
	   A new generation of generals also came to power. They opened the
long-isolated economy to foreign investment in an effort to lift
the country out of poverty, but have allowed little political
dissent.

Thailand a year ago, at least 112 people have committed suicide
because of it, the government's mental health agency reported.
	   The Thai Mental Health Department confirmed Wednesday that
increased stress, lost jobs and unsolvable financial problems have
contributed to the suicides.
	   At least nine people who attempted suicide for reasons related
to the crisis have been saved, the department said. All the figures
were based on a survey of Thai media reports over the past year.
	   A total of 512 people took their lives during the same period,
the department said. Similar figures for the preceding year were
not available.
	   After a decade of booming growth, Thailand became the first of
Asia's economies to fall into financial crisis last year and is now
in deep recession.

Ranariddh brings electoral campaign to Cambodia's northwest
</HEADLINE>

	   BATTAMBANG, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh brought his
election campaign Wednesday to northwestern Cambodia, while party
members reported that an activist had been gunned down in what they
called a political killing.
	   The prince has been crisscrossing Cambodia in campaigning for
the July 26 polls called by strongman Hun Sen, who deposed
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a bloody coup a year ago.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's
Party of rigging the elections by using violence, including murder,
plus stacking electoral bodies in their favor and restricting
access to the media.
	   The prince arrived in Cambodia's second-largest city,
Battambang, as well-wishers lined the runway, wearing caps and
T-shirts bearing the logo of his royalist FUNCINPEC party.
	   They joined a convoy of trucks to the neighboring province of
Banteay Meanchey for a rally. One truck carried bodyguards for the
prince supplied by Hun Sen's government.
	   Party members reported the death of activist Sman Kim over the
weekend in Kompong Thom province, to the east, who was shot on his
way to a rice field. Human-rights workers were still investigating
the motive.
	   ``We believe this is a political killing,'' said May Sam Oeun,
FUNCINPEC's campaign manager. ``Even I am fearful every time I walk
out of my house to go campaign.''
	   The death of Sman Kim would be the 12th killing of an opposition
activist in six weeks, at least half of which are believed to be
politically linked.
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 but was forced to
share power when Hun Sen, who ruled during the 1980s, refused to
surrender power and threatened civil war.
	   Their tense power-sharing arrangement shattered during last
year's coup. As many as 100 of the prince's supporters were killed
in the months that followed.
	   Ranariddh was allowed to return from exile in March to contest
the elections, which Hun Sen hopes will restore international aid
and legitimacy lost after his takeover.

Colombo's latest worry: Crows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Harsh-voiced, shiny crows are plaguing
the Sri Lankan capital. They're pushing other birds out of Colombo,
attacking pets, annoying humans at play, at work and on the road _
and experts aren't sure what to do.
	   ``It is really an alarming situation, believe me,'' Ismeth
Raheem, chief of Colombo's 55-year-old Bird Club, said in an
interview this week.
	   Members of the Bird Club observe birds throughout Sri Lanka and
advise the government on how to protect and manage the hundreds of
bird species on the island.
	   The crux of the problem is that people have encroached on the
crows' home. The birds have found they are not only able to live
with their fellow bipeds, but thrive in their company. Raheem
estimates there are 500,000 crows in Colombo today, compared to
100,000 five years ago.
	   Once upon a time crows were the only dwellers on ``Crow Island''
off Colombo. But in the battle for space over the last 15 years or
so, humans won and the island is now home to tens of thousands of
people.
	   Crows, which are both predators and scavengers, gorge on garbage
thrown out by Colombo's 2.5 million residents and occasionally
snack on a kitten.
	   Drivers are forced to either come to a sudden halt or take sharp
turns to avoid crows on city roads crouched over the carcasses of
cats and other prey.
	   A cricket match in a Colombo suburb was recently interrupted by
hundreds of crows attracted to the field by a half-eaten loaf of
bread.
	   The departure of an Australian ship that had delivered apples to
Colombo had to be delayed after dozens of crows descended on
leftover fruit strewn on the decks. Finally, the crew fired blanks
to scare away the birds.
	   The house crow and bigger jungle crow are two of 425 bird
species _ 26 of them unique to Sri Lanka _ enjoying this Indian
Ocean island's tropical climate, isolation from the Asian mainland
and wide range of habitats.
	   Raheem also said he feared that crows were scaring away other
bird species, including Paradise flycatchers and the Indian Golden
Oriole, by invading their nests.
	   The crow population has grown so large that it would be futile
to try to cull their numbers to restore nature's balance, Raheem
said.
	   ``I don't think we can afford the cost of ammunition,'' he said.
	   At any rate, powerful monks in this largely Buddhist nation who
frown on killing any living being may object to a crow slaughter.
As an alternative, female crows could be caught and sterilized. But
Raheem says that would be very difficult.
	   The crows do provide some benefits _ they do their part to keep
the garbage under control, and squirrels seem to find their nests
comfortable resting places.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock prices gain in afternoon

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen gained against the U.S. dollar Wednesday on
growing expectation Japan will cut taxes to spur economic growth.
Tokyo share prices advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 138.72 yen in afternoon trading, down 1.11 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
138.75 yen overnight.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was scheduled to hold a news
conference in Nagoya, central Japan, at 5:30 p.m. (0830 GMT)
Wednesday, where he was expected to announce tax cuts, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper said.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
114.69 points, or 0.70 percent, to close at 16,530.97 points. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 65.83 points, or 0.40 percent.
	   Markets participants hope tax cuts will bolster consumer demand
and pull Japan out of its deepest recession since World War II.
	   On Tuesday, Hiromu Nonaka, a senior ruling Liberal Democratic
Party official, said the prime minister was definitely going to
call for the cutting of some taxes.
	   A national sales tax increase and tighter fiscal policy by
Hashimoto's party last year have been widely blamed as a source of
Japan's economic troubles.
	   Hashimoto will visit Nagoya to campaign for Sunday's elections
for the upper house of Parliament.
	   According to recent newspaper polls, Hashimoto's party is not
expected to gain a majority of seats in the upper house.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,268.40. The
TOPIX closed up 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.365 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 110.70 yen from 111.15
yen.

Weapons cache found; reports link it to plot of armed resistance to
</HEADLINE>
troop withdrawal in Golan &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with police statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Two Israelis from the Golan Heights and
northern Israel were arrested after large weapons caches were found
in their homes, police said Wednesday.
	   Investigators are looking into the possibility that the two
suspects, including an army paratrooper, plotted armed resistance
to an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, Israel radio said.
However, this could not be confirmed independently.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuchin said two suspects were
arrested after military equipment was found at their homes. She
said the they have not been charged.
	   Israel radio said police found Kalashnikov automatic rifles,
large quantities of ammunition, night vision equipment, flares and
other military equipment at the homes of the two suspects.
	   There was enough equipment to arm several dozen people, the
report said.
	   One of the suspects is an army paratrooper who lives on a
communal farm, or kibbutz, in the Golan, the radio said, and the
other lives at Kibbutz Dan in northern Israel.
	   Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Oded Ben Ami said in a statement:
``Military police are investigating the circumstances of the theft
of the military equipment, and when the investigation is complete,
the findings will be passed on to the military prosecutor.''
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Peace negotiations between the two countries broke down in March
1996. Syria claims that the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
promised to return the entire Golan Heights, but Israel denies
this.

final &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians screamed, embraced and
cried after watching their team squeak by to the World Cup finals
in a penalty kick shoot-out that kept nerves on edge until the last
minute.
	   Two saves by goalkeeper Taffarel in the shoot-out at the end of
a grueling match ensured a 4-2 victory over the Netherlands Tuesday
and gave the green light for Brazilian fans to begin dancing and
singing.
	   ``I am still shaking with nerves but I feel marvelous,''
exclaimed Mariana Ramos, 48, a cook. ``I am going out to celebrate
and the rest of Rio will do the same. There will be parties in
every neighborhood. Not many people will sleep tonight.''
	   The victory was heralded with a volley of fireworks lighting up
the sky over the city's many hillside shanty towns.
	   People who had gathered to watch the game on big screens in city
squares jumped for joy and hugged each other.
	   ``We were very agitated and nervous during the match but when
Brazil won we all embraced. Some of us were crying,'' said
Marinalva Santos, 28. ``Now we are going to win the Penta (a fifth
World Cup championship). Without a doubt.''

Mahathir's new book launched by Thatcher in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
new book on Malaysian politics and economics was launched by former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London, according to
news reports.
	   ``The Way Forward,'' containing five essays, was written before
the current economic downturn that is threatening to push the
Southeast Asian nation into recession.
	   ``Dr. Mahathir's excellent essays contain many of the right
answers, not quite all. You'll have to read my book for those,''
Thatcher quipped at Tuesday's launch in a London hotel, according
to Malaysia's national news agency.
	   Mahathir was not present at the event.
	   Both leaders are known for tough and often controversial
policies. Thatcher, as prime minister, promoted privatization,
while Malaysia under Mahathir has been pushed along a fast,
high-tech track with dazzling projects.
	   Thatcher said the similarities extended to their age.
	   ``Let me share a secret with you _ 1925 was clearly a vintage
year for producing prime ministers.''
	   Mahathir has 10 books to his name, most compilations of his
speeches. His most controversial work was the ``The Malay
Dilemma,'' published in 1972. It argued that the indigenous Malay
race wasn't as tough as the ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities,
so Malays needed government protection under affirmative action
policies.
	   Proposing a toast to Mahathir, Thatcher said: ``I'm not sure Dr.
Mahathir will approve of this, but nevertheless, I'm going to drink
it in champagne.''
	   She, however, said she preferred whiskey.
	   Mahathir leads a nation dominated by Malay Muslims, whose
religion forbids them from drinking alcohol.

Waugh misses eights for charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian limited overs cricket
captain Steve Waugh has stepped down from playing in an
eight-a-side tournament in Kuala Lumpur because of charity
commitments.
	   Waugh is the patron of Udayan, a home for children with leprosy
in India, and will miss the July 17-19 tournament to honor a
commitment at the home.
	   Adam Gilchrist, yet to play a test, was named to replace Waugh
as captain of the Super 8s team.
	   While Gilchrist admitted the tournament is far from the most
important on the increasingly packed cricket calendar, he said the
Australians would be taking it seriously, having won it the past
two years.
	   He also views it as a great chance for a number of players to
tune up for the September Commonwealth Games, which will be held at
the same venue.
	   ``We always take any match seriously,'' Gilchrist said. ``It
will be a very valuable experience. Most of the guys going are in
the Commonwealth Games team and they'll have a chance to become
familiar with the environment there and the wicket and the
conditions, particularly the heat.''
	   Australia will play against India, Pakistan, New Zealand and
South Africa.
	   Test batsman Ricky Ponting has been named vice-captain.
	   Australia: Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Greg Blewett, Michael
Di Venuto, Damien Fleming, Brendon Julian, Damien Martyn, Gavin
Robertson, Andrew Symonds.

Studies: Blacks may be prone to nicotine addiction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CX101 &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Black smokers appear to absorb more nicotine than
whites, which could explain why they have more trouble quitting and
run a higher risk of lung cancer, researchers reported Wednesday.
	   Research has differed over whether blacks get more nicotine from
cigarettes because of biological differences in the way blacks and
whites process nicotine, differences in smoking habits between the
races or both.
	   Two new studies published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association don't put the debate to rest, but they suggest
that genetic differences play an important role.
	   One study, led by Ralph S. Caraballo of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, measured blood levels of a chemical called
cotinine, a byproduct of the breakdown of nicotine in the body, in
a nationally representative sample of U.S. adult smokers from 1988
to 1991.
	   Cotinine was measured instead of nicotine because it stays in
the body much longer and scientists have developed a highly
sensitive test for it.
	   Black smokers had cotinine concentrations substantially higher
at all levels of cigarette smoking than white smokers did, the
researchers said, after taking into account differences that could
skew the results, such as weight, number of other smokers in the
home and smoke exposure at work.
	   Previous research indicates black smokers are more likely to try
quitting and have a lower success rate than white smokers. Also,
black smokers run a higher risk of developing lung cancer and dying
from it.
	   Higher nicotine absorption could help explain the lower quitting
rate among blacks, the researchers said.
	   Also, if blacks have higher cotinine levels because they inhale
more deeply or smoke stronger cigarettes, they also would take in
more cancer-causing substances such as tar. That, in turn, may
explain why black smokers get lung cancer at higher rates than
white smokers, the researchers said.
	   In a related study, a separate team of researchers compared
rates of metabolism _ the body's process of breaking down food to
make energy _ and nicotine intake among 40 black and 39 white
smokers.
	   Cotinine blood levels per cigarette smoked were significantly
higher in black smokers than in white smokers, said the
researchers, led by Dr. Eliseo J. Perez-Stable of the University of
California at San Francisco.
	   Although no significant difference was found in rates of
nicotine metabolism, blacks cleared cotinine from their bodies at
slower rates and took in more nicotine per cigarette.
	   Dr. Edward M. Sellers, a professor of pharmacology and medicine
at the University of Toronto and Women's College Hospital, said
that doesn't mean differences in nicotine metabolism between races
don't exist. Instead, the study may have been too small to show
such differences, said Sellers, who was not involved in either
study.
	   Differences in nicotine metabolism could be important: A person
whose body uses up nicotine relatively fast might, as a result,
crave more cigarettes, inhale more deeply or choose a stronger
brand.
	   Sellers praised both studies as careful and important but agreed
with their authors that more research is needed.
	   He said it is well-established that blacks metabolize some drugs
differently because of genetic differences. And recent studies
suggest a genetic trait linked to protection from nicotine
addiction may be missing in Africans, he said.
	   He said he believes genetic differences will probably account
for differing smoking patterns among the races.
	   ``If you can understand the genetic basis for the addictive
disorder,'' he said, ``then you might be able to actually
individualize treatment, not only by group, but by an individual's
genetic characteristics.''

EU approval of their alliance.

regulatory hurdle to the planned mega-alliance which competitors
have denounced as a menace to fair competition on air routes across
the Atlantic.
	   However the final go-ahead for the BA-American pact could still
be months away and will eventually need approval from national
regulators in Britain and the United States.
	   The EU is also expected to announce a preliminary ruling
Wednesday on a rival alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa,
Scandinavian Air Services and United Airlines.
	   On a visit Tuesday to Lisbon, Portugal, Van Miert said the EU
would call on Lufthansa and its partners in the Star Alliance to
surrender 108 slots at Frankfurt and Copenhagen airports.
	   After the provisional rulings by the Commission, the EU's
20-member executive body, the airlines and their competitors will
be able to submit opinions over the summer.
	   That should lead to a final Commission recommendation in the
Autumn. The BA-American pact would still need approval from
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department
of Transportation.
	   The U.S. authorities are making approval contingent on Britain
negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United States that
would end current restrictions that allow only four airlines - BA,
American, United and Virgin Atlantic to fly to the United States
from London's Heathrow airport.
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines were horrified. They said the alliance
would control 60 percent of the traffic between Britain and United
States, squeeze competitors out of the skies and push up prices for
transatlantic travelers.
	   To prevent that, the EU is expected to order the companies to
scale back frequencies on flights between London and U.S. cities
including hubs such as Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
	   Van Miert said Tuesday BA and American will have to give up 267
of around 700 weekly take off and landing slots at London's Gatwick
and Heathrow airports. Around 220 of those will be at Heathrow, the
main European hub for transatlantic flights.
	   Wednesday's ruling is expected to spark a lobbying campaign from
the airlines concerned to secure fewer slot reductions, while their
rivals press for yet tougher conditions.

South Korea to expel Russian diplomat in retaliation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea ordered the expulsion of a
Russian diplomat Wednesday, four days after one of its own envoys
was kicked out of Moscow on spying charges.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Oleg N. Abramkin, one of six embassy
councilors, was declared persona non grata and given three days to
leave the country.
	   The ministry said Abramkin had engaged in ``activities that go
against his status as a diplomat.'' That's a common diplomatic
euphemism for spying, but the ministry did not elaborate.
	   South Korea had been promising ``retaliatory measures'' ever
since Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at its embassy in Moscow,
was ordered expelled last week.
	   ``Despite our action, we hope that the friendly relations
between South Korea and Russia will be maintained and further
developed,'' ministry spokesman Lee Jo-jin said.
	   The Russian Embassy said it had no comment on the matter.
	   On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said Cho had obtained classified data from a Russian
contact. He urged Seoul not to use Cho's expulsion as a pretext for
retaliation.
	   Cho was detained for about two hours after he met with the
alleged contact last Friday, then ordered to leave Russia for
``unlawful activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
	   South Korea protested the way Russia handled the case,
especially Cho's brief detention by Federal Security officials
despite his diplomatic immunity.
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB,
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy
chief of the Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, which deals
with both North and South Korea as well as China and Mongolia.
	   It planned to charge Moiseyev with turning over classified
information to South Korea.
	   Moiseyev has remained in jail since his arrest.
	   It was the first time a South Korean diplomat had been expelled
by Russia since the two countries opened diplomatic ties in 1990.

Don't write off Lomu says Campese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand wing star Jonah Lomu's
axing from the All Blacks test team might be the tonic he needs to
pep up a flagging career, according to David Campese.
	   Australian Campese, one of the all-time great test wingers,
warned against predicting an end for Lomu, despite his
disappointing start to the season.
	   ``Don't write Jonah off,'' Campese told The Australian
newspaper. ``If he wants to get back again this might be a bit of a
wakeup call.''
	   Lomu became the youngest All Black when he made his debut
against France in 1994. In 1995 he was virtually unstoppable,
dominating the World Cup including a four-try performance against
England.
	   But Lomu spent most of last season sidelined because of a rare
kidney illness. He was unable to play because of the drugs needed
to fight the illness, but made a late comeback on the end-of-year
tour to Britain.
	   ``It was a great effort from Jonah to get back in the side after
the illness he had,'' Campese said.
	   Lomu had a sound start to this season in the first test victory
over England but was disappointing in the second. He was replaced
late in the game and substitute Joeli Viridi crossed for a try and
claimed the position for Saturday's test against Australia, which
will open the tri-nations series.
	   ``Perhaps (coach John) Hart wants to teach him a lesson,'' said
Campese. ``It could be a very good play _ it's as if he wants to
show him he has to keep working at his game.''
	   Lomu has failed to hit the opposition defensive lines with the
same destructiveness as during his heyday and it has been suggested
the medication he still needs for his kidneys leaves him feeling
flat.

Myanmar dissident returns home after confrontation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with party confirming Suu Kyi
return unharmed, reason for trip &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
returned home unharmed Wednesday after a nearly 24-hour standoff
with police on a road outside the capital, an act of defiance the
military regime said could disrupt peace.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, arrived back
at her lakeside home following an overnight sit-in in her car after
she was stopped some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yangon.
	   She rejected police orders to go back until she was allowed to
meet a member of her National League for Democracy, who was brought
to the car Wednesday morning from farther north in Min Hla
township, said NLD sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The trip flouted an unofficial ban on Suu Kyi traveling outside
Yangon. In a statement Tuesday, the government called it a bid to
``create unnecessary and unwanted confusion, confrontation and
collision.''
	   Neither Suu Kyi nor the others in the car, NLD Chairman Aung
Shwe, another party official and the driver, were harmed, the party
sources said.
	   Suu Kyi wanted to tell Hla Hla Moe, a party member elected in
1990 to a parliament that the military never allowed to convene, to
stop meeting demands by local authorities to check in twice a day,
the party sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's activities are tightly restricted. The trip outside
her home without a customary security forces escort, followed by
her refusal to return when stopped, amounted to a challenge to
government authority amid a wider push to hasten civilian rule.
	   Last month, her party for the first time set a deadline, Aug.
21, demanding that the government convene the 1990 parliament. The
NLD overwhelmingly won those elections but the ruling generals,
whose supporters were beaten, never allowed parliament to meet.
	   Since the demand was issued, the government has required the
members-elect living outside the capital to report twice a day to
local authorities, an apparent attempt to keep them from convening
on their own. Those who refuse have reportedly been detained.
	   It was the second time since she was released in 1995 from six
years of formal house arrest that Suu Kyi has tried to leave
Yangon. In 1996, she tried taking a train north to Mandalay, but
the coach she would have ridden in was removed from service.
	   Suu Kyi has again been restricted to her home since 1996 but is
occasionally allowed to leave to meet small groups of supporters
and to receive some visitors. She is barred from making speeches or
other public political activities.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi's trip Tuesday coincided with the anniversary of the
demolition that year of the Students' Union building at Yangon
University, a symbol of political militancy.
	   Recent challenges her party has thrown at the government
coincide with the anniversary of an anti-military uprising in 1988
that was crushed when the army killed thousands of protesters.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was vaulted
into the leadership of the pro-democracy movement by the events.
	   A new generation of generals also came to power. They opened the
long-isolated economy to foreign investment in hopes of lifting the
country out of poverty, but have allowed little dissent.

Britain to sell off 20 percent of nuclear stockpile, newspaper
</HEADLINE>
reports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain plans to slash it's nuclear deterrent in
half and sell off 20 percent of its stocks of missiles, ammunition,
land and other defense assets over the next three years, The Times
said Wednesday.
	   The Times and The Daily Telegraph said the plans for the 2.2
billion pound (dlrs 3.6 billion) sell-off are part of a package of
proposals to reorganize Britain's armed forces that were leaked to
them on the eve of the government's announcement to Parliament on
Wednesday .
	   Leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat
parties condemned the leaks and demanded an investigation. Defense
Secretary George Robertson, who called the leak ``grossly
improper,'' said Wednesday morning that the ``severest action''
would be taken against the person responsible.
	   Under plans designed to make the military more flexible and more
mobile, the army, navy and air force would be more closely
integrated and there would be cuts in the number of warships,
combat aircraft and the Territorial Army, which supplements the
army in wartime. Large numbers of British troops stationed in
Germany will also be brought home, The Times said.
	   Britain will retain its nuclear deterrent, but there will be
fewer than 200 operationally available nuclear warheads _ a cut of
a third from the maximum of 300 announced by the previous
government and a cut of more than 70 percent in the potential
explosive power of the nuclear deterrent since the end of the Cold
War, The Times quoted the proposal as saying.
	   The newspaper said the government will reduce to 48 from 96 the
maximum number of warheads on its fleet of three Trident
submarines, and the fleet will be increased to four at the start of
the century.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the premature disclosure will be a
``major embarassment'' to the government. It was the most serious
breach of confidentiality yet suffered by Tony Blair's Labor
government, rivalling the leaking of sections of the 1996 budget
under the Conservative administration, the newspaper said.
	   The proposals also include the purchase of two new larger
aircraft carriers to project power more flexibly around the world
and new transport aircraft and ships that will move forces and
equipment to trouble spots more quickly, The Daily Telegraph
reported. There are also plans to raise 700 million pounds by
selling military real estate around the country.
	   Under the plan, Britain's defense budget cuts would total 685
million pounds (dlrs 1.1 billion) a year by 2002, The Daily
Telegraph said. Defense spending currently accounts for 2.7 percent
of Britain's Gross Domestic Product, but the changes will trim that
proportion to 2.4 percent.
	   A new Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, ready to be sent to trouble
spots at short notice, would spearhead Britain's modernized front
line and would be operational by 2001. There will be no cuts in the
overall strength of the regular forces.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Young, popular and ambitious, Ricardo Monreal
Avila was just the candidate the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party needed to win its first-ever state gubernatorial election.
	   There's just one problem: Monreal isn't a party member.
	   Monreal, a 38-year-old congressman and rising star in the
long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, quit that
party in February after being passed over for the gubernatorial
nomination in the northern state of Zacatecas.
	   After his exit, PRI leaders said they had rejected him as a
nominee because of ``indirect'' links to drug trafficking. They
later backed away from the allegation.
	   At any rate, the spurned Monreal ran instead as the candidate
for the leftist PRD even though he never formally joined the party.
He wound up winning Sunday's election with about 43 percent of the
vote.
	   It is hardly unusual for Mexican opposition parties to be
populated by PRI defectors. The PRI had single-handed control over
all levels of Mexican government until only recently, so most
politicians were at some point affiliated with the party.
	   As for the PRD, it was founded by PRI defectors following the
1988 presidential election. After winning the mayorship in Mexico
City last year, the party was in a strong position ahead of the
2000 presidential election. Candidates like Monreal offered the PRD
a chance to increase its popularity, especially in areas where it
has been traditionally weak, such as the north.
	   But some PRD members are concerned that the defectors will blur
the differences between it and the PRI _ even though so far that
has not happened; the two parties have clearly distinct agendas.
	   In March, the PRD barred former Attorney General Ignacio Morales
Lechuga of the PRI from seeking its nomination in the Gulf Coast
state of Veracruz. The cost of that decision may be great: A recent
poll shows the PRD running a distant third in that state's race
behind the two other major parties.
	   In news conferences and interviews after winning the election,
Monreal sounded at times more like an independent candidate than a
PRD loyalist. He said he would have a multiparty Cabinet, choosing
the best people available. He also spoke of his respect for
President Ernesto Zedillo and said, ``I broke with the PRI, not
with the president.''
	   But at a news conference in Mexico City, Monreal and PRD put the
emphasis on their close relations and teamwork.
	   Sen. Amalia Garcia, a PRD leader, defended the choice of Monreal
as candidate, saying that many of the most important figures in
Mexican history were dissidents.
	   She said Monreal and the party have the same concerns _ issues
such as justice, equality and democracy. ``That's why we're
together.''
	   Monreal credited the party with his victory, saying that even a
capable and intelligent candidate couldn't win the election without
the backing of a strong, solid party.
	   He also said that if he registers with any party, it will be
with the PRD.
	   ``Without a doubt, my fate and my destiny will be with the
PRD,'' he said.

EU to approve MCI-Worldcom merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after decision, expected around 1100 GMT

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are scheduled
Wednesday to approve the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S.
telecommunications groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom
Inc.
	   Approval from the European Commission is seen as a formality
after the companies accepted its demand they divest overlapping
businesses, primarily the entire MCI Internet business.
	   ``The Commission will announce the green light,'' EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert said Tuesday during a trip to Lisbon,
Portugal. ``There is no problem any more on MCI.''
	   The 20-member EU executive body is also expected to tell MCI and
Worldcom to sign a clause preventing the merged entity for a
certain period from trying to sell Internet services to MCI's
former customers.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States.
	   Their merger needs EU approval because the companies do business
in Europe. Under EU rules, the Commission checks all mergers with a
major impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc. It can demand
changes to, or veto, those it judges to infringe European laws
governing fair competition.
	   The alliance, proposed in November, continues a global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   Van Miert stressed that EU authorities have cooperated closely
with the U.S. Department of Justice, which has yet to give its
approval to the planned merger.

Indonesia's ruling party prepares to hold congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's tarnished ruling party is
expected to try to shed the legacy of its unpopular mentor, former
President Suharto, at a congress this week.
	   Delegates of the Golkar party meet Thursday to recast their role
in the wake of Suharto's resignation in May following student
protests demanding his ouster and riots over price increases.
	   For decades, Golkar was tightly controlled by Suharto, backing
his edicts and steering his largely ceremonial election through a
special assembly for seven, five-year terms.
	   Now that new President B.J. Habibie is pushing an agenda of
political reform and has pledged general elections in 1999, Golkar
officials say they want to make their party more democratic.
	   With its entrenched political machinery, Golkar has easily won
parliamentary elections, collecting more than 70 percent of the
vote last year. Now its political future is uncertain.
	   During the July 9-11 congress, officials say, they will dissolve
a leadership council headed by Suharto.
	   Suharto quit amid turmoil fueled by Indonesia's economic crisis
and ensuing discontent with the once unchallenged leader. He
relinquished power soon after an estimated 1,200 people died in
riots over price increases in Jakarta, the capital.
	   While many Golkar officials agree reform is necessary, some
factions disagree on the pace and scope of change.
	   It is unclear what the party plans to do about the senior
leadership roles held by two of Suharto's children, eldest daughter
Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 200 workers protested at the
labor ministry Wednesday, demanding higher wages and complaining
that military handling of their rallies has been heavy-handed.
	   The protest by workers from several factories in Jakarta was
peaceful.
	   Indonesia is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades, and
millions of people are struggling to find enough money to buy food.
	   President B.J. Habibie has pledged democratic reform in the wake
of the resignation in May of his predecessor, Suharto.
	   Protests have flourished since the authoritarian Suharto quit,
but last month the military blocked workers from marching to
Parliament to press for labor rights.
	   Also Wednesday, several dozen protesters rallied outside a state
bank they accused of illegally giving loans to relatives of Suharto
when he was in power.
	   The demonstrators outside Bank Bumi Daya demanded that Suharto's
family be forced to hand over its wealth to drained state coffers.
Government prosecutors have launched an investigation of charitable
foundations run by Suharto.

	   The deal is the largest acquisition ever of the Dutch bank and
the biggest foreign investment in Brazil, ABN Amro said.
	   The Dutch bank said it planned to finance the transaction partly
through the issuing of dlrs 1 billion in preference shares and the
remainder in cash.
	   ABN Amro had been expected to make an acquisition after it
recently lost a bidding war for Belgium's Generale Bank to
Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis.
	   The Dutch are already active in Brazil where, ABN said, it is
the most profitable foreign bank.
	   In 1997, ABN's operating profit in the country was dlrs 250
million.
	   Banco Real is the fourth largest privately held bank in terms of
deposits and net worth, and had total assets of dlrs 15 billion at
the end of 1997.
	   The Brazilian bank, with headquarters in Sao Paulo, has 1,372
branches, 2.2 million retail clients and over 100,000 corporate
customers and almost 15,000 staff.
	   The agreement ABN Amro has made with the controlling shareholder
also includes the acquisition by the Dutch of 10 related
businesses, and will effectively double ABN's existing network in
the region.

Flood in Central Asia kill 38
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A dam burst touched off a flood that killed at
least 38 people in the Central Asian nations of Kyrgyzstan and
Uzbekistan, a new report said Wednesday.
	   The dam burst occurred on the Kuban-Kel lake, which forms the
border between western Kyrgyzstan and eastern Uzbekistan, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   As a result, the water level in an adjoining river quickly rose
three to four meters (nine to 12 feet) and inundated homes near the
bank of the river, the report said.
	   Many of the deaths were in the mountainous Kadamzhai district in
western Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan district in eastern
Uzbekistan, the report added.
	   Rescue workers were recovering bodies and said the casualty toll
was likely to rise.

Balkan contact group expected to call for Kosovo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ As diplomats from six countries gathered
Wednesday to review options for stopping the violence in Serbia's
Kosovo province, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said a
Western military intervention could not be ruled out.
	   Economic sanctions imposed last month to pressure Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end the conflict with ethnic
Albanian separatists have failed to stop the fighting in Kosovo,
Kinkel told German television.
	   ``We have to apply massive pressure on Milosevic, but also on
the Kosovo Albanians, and we must say that we are also ready to
intervene militarily,'' he said.
	   His comments came as diplomats from the United States, Russia,
Germany, Britain, France and Italy _ the Contact Group for the
Balkans _ convened in Bonn to discuss the situation in Kosovo,
where the ethnic Albanian majority is seeking independence.
	   Hundreds have died in the rebellious province since fighting
escalated in late February.
	   Sanctions imposed last month include air travel restrictions, a
ban on new investment in Serbia and a freeze on funds held abroad
by the Yugoslav and Serbian governments. NATO jets also held
exercises near Kosovo last month in a show of force.
	   But Milosevic has failed to withdraw his special forces from
Kosovo, citing continued attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA).
	   Diplomats were expected to focus on pushing both sides to accept
a cease-fire so that negotiations on Kosovo's future could resume.
	   A single meeting was held in May, but Kosovo Albanian leaders
broke off the talks because of stepped up Serb attacks on Kosovo
villages.
	   Also expected to be debated in Bonn are recent American contacts
with purported Kosovo Liberation Army leaders.
	   Only a few months ago, Washington had denounced them as
``terrorists,'' but their growing popular support in Kosovo has
undermined the position of the Kosovo Albanians' pacifist leader,
Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Both Milosevic and the Russians refuse to include the KLA in
negotiations. U.S. officials have met with KLA members to urge them
to accept Rugova, but they have refused.

Supreme Court rejects appeal of woman jailed for offending Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an
appeal to reduce the two-year prison term of an Israeli woman who
put up posters portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig.
	   Tatiana Suszkin, 26, was convicted after posting drawings
showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors of Arab-owned
shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year. Muslims, as well
as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin supports the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group.
	   She was convicted of committing a racist act, supporting a
terrorist organization, attempting to create religious offense and
attempted vandalism. She was also convicted of endangering life by
throwing rocks at Arab drivers.
	   Her lawyer, Sean Casper, asked that two of the convictions -
support of a terrorist group and attempt to offend religious
feelings _ be struck. He also asked that Suszkin be convicted of
attempting to commit a racist act, rather than the act itself.
	   Casper requested a reduction in sentence, but did not specify by
how much.

Nigeria's top political prisoner dead at 60
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from other Abiola daughter, archbishop of
Lagos &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY187,188 &QL; 
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, came just as the end of his
imprisonment seemed near, causing the latest shockwave in a
turbulent month for Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack Tuesday after suddenly
becoming ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats who came to push
for his freedom.
	   His death came just as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.
	   The news prompted demonstrators Tuesday to vent their fury in
the streets, throwing rocks and burning debris in the roads. A
former backer of Nigeria's military regime who later ran on his own
for president on an anti-poverty platform, Abiola became a hero of
pro-democracy activists.
	   A U.S. State Department official said Abiola began coughing and
wheezing during a meeting with a delegation led by U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
	   Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early stages of their
meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   ``We all helped to put him in a car. There was no ambulance
immediately available,'' Pickering said in an interview with CNN.
	   Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting before he fell ill,
said Jim Callahan, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. officials
watched Nigerian doctors' last-ditch efforts to save Abiola's life
at a government clinic. Clinton expressed regret at the ``sudden
and untimely'' death.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the State Department said there was no reason to
believe that the death was not the result of natural causes.
Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions, but cast
doubt on the official explanation of his death.
	   His daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   Another daughter, Hafsat, said in an interview with CNN that the
timing was suspicious.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' she said. ``All of a sudden at the
eve of his release, he dies.''
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died last month of a heart attack.
	   Dissidents also have complained that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other diplomats refused to stand up for Abiola _ and said
the secretary-general pressured Abiola into renouncing his claim to
the presidency.
	   Annan also was criticized for not going to Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial center where much of the country's opposition movement
is centered. Annan did meet with opposition groups in Abuja, the
capital.
	   The U.S. delegation did not plan to visit Lagos either. The
delegation was to hold a small meeting with civilian leaders,
including some opposition figures, said Charles Patterson, the
principal officer at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja.
	   American-Nigerian relations have been poor in recent years,
particularly after Abacha executed playwright and pro-democracy
activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other people in November 1995.
	   But since taking power, the new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by releasing
some political prisoners and pledging that all eventually will be
freed.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, news of Abiola's death was
met with isolated incidents of stone throwing.
	   Just north of Lagos, however, in the university town of Ibadan,
students took to the streets in a show of outrage over Abiola's
death while still in military custody. There were no immediate
reports of arrests or injuries linked to the protests.
	   Abiola grew up in a poor family and earned a degree in economics
from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He later amassed a
fortune in industries including publishing, shipping, and oil.
	   He worked for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.,
serving as company chairman for Africa and the Middle East from
1971 to 1988. Some Nigerians blamed him for the country's appalling
telephone system, saying he made millions by using inferior
materials and pocketing the extra money. Abiola denied the
accusations.
	   Nigeria was shunned internationally during Abacha's harsh rule,
under which political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280
people are believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in
regular prisons except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative
comfort of a government guest house in Abuja.
	   Corruption in Abacha's Nigeria left the economy and
infrastructure in shambles.

Violence erupts between residents over water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two people were injured when a
squabble over collecting water erupted into fight between
residents, some of them armed with knives and machetes, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   With severe water rationing in effect for nearly 2 million
people in Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs, residents line up with
pails and plastic containers several times a week to draw supplies
from huge tankers deployed by city authorities. Disputes have
become common.
	   The fight started when people objected to three men breaking the
line to collect water from a truck in the Petaling Jaya suburb of
the Malaysian capital, the Star newspaper said.
	   The three offenders pulled out knives and traditional Malaysian
machetes to confront the angry crowd. Two people, who tried to stop
the fight, were injured.
	   Teo Voon Liong, 37, who was slashed on his thigh, was taken to a
private hospital. The other man, whose identity was not known,
needed only first aid for a small cut on his neck, the daily said.
	   Althouth officials claim the water supply has improved in recent
weeks, many residents, especially in Petaling Jaya, say a thin
trickle flows out of faucets for barely 30 minutes once in five
days.
	   Authorities have blamed a drought for depleting the rain-fed
water reservoirs. But many residents and independent experts say
the problem is mismanagement.

Murdoch set to join fleet of luxury yachts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A class for the luxury yachts of the
world's rich and famous has been added for the year 2000 edition of
Australia's top ocean race.
	   The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia (CYCA) announced Wednesday
that a special category in the Sydney to Hobart race had been
established to accommodate the floating palaces.
	   CYCA general manager Bruce Rowley said 12-15 of the yachts,
including Rupert Murdoch's private yacht, were likely to take part.
	   Murdoch, a CYCA member and Sydney to Hobart veteran, was
encouraging his billionaire friends to take part, an official said.
	   The media tycoon's luxury Morning Glory, equipped with some of
the world's most sophisticated communications gear, was in Hobart
last year to await the arrival of son Lachlan, who was making his
Sydney to Hobart debut.
	   Rupert Murdoch was in the winning crew in 1995 aboard Sayonara,
owned by American computer giant Oracle Corporation's chief Larry
Ellison.
	   Rowley said many luxury yachts would be around Australian waters
throughout 2000. They were expected to be in Auckland for the
Americas Cup in February and in Sydney for the Olympics in
September.
	   The yachts, worth up to U.S. dlrs 20 million, are usually
fabulously appointed. Luxury bars and saloons are standard while
some have marble baths and chandeliers.
	   Rowley said that despite their luxury, and the fact they were
built for cruising rather than racing, some were very fast.
	   Well sailed in conditions that suited them, some could beat the
maxis that take the Sydney to Hobart line honors.
	   Vice commodore Hans Sommer said the CYCA had already received a
number of inquiries from owners interested in staying on after the
Olympics.
	   Among them were the owners of two Dutch-built super yachts who
had already laid a personal side bet of a case of best champagne,
Sommer said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shock, sorrow and renewed pleas for Nigeria to
return to civilian rule greeted the death Tuesday of the nation's
most prominent political prisoner, Moshood Abiola.
	   Opposition groups blamed his death on ill-treatment during four
years in jail and harassment by the military regime.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who met with
Abiola a week ago and who expected his imminent release from jail,
called on Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
to fulfill promises ``to release all remaining political prisoners
unconditionally and to define a credible process for the democratic
transition to civilian rule within a reasonable period.''
	   Abiola, presumed winner of 1993 elections, suffered an apparent
heart attack while meeting a visiting U.S. State Department
delegation.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel praised Abiola as a ``great
fighter for democracy and human rights.''
	   ``I appeal to all political and societal forces in the land to
safeguard calm and level-headedness in this painful and critical
situation,'' he said. ``The great work of reconciliation and
renewal that Gen. Abubakar has set in motion in the few weeks since
he took office must not be endangered by rash and dangerous
agitation.''

	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, news of Abiola's death was
met with isolated incidents of stone throwing.
	   Just north of Lagos, however, in the university town of Ibadan,
students took to the streets in a show of outrage over Abiola's
death while still in military custody. There were no immediate
reports of arrests or injuries linked to the protests.
	   Abiola grew up in a poor family and earned a degree in economics
from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He later amassed a
fortune in industries including publishing, shipping, and oil.
	   He worked for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.,
serving as company chairman for Africa and the Middle East from
1971 to 1988. Some Nigerians blamed him for the country's appalling
telephone system, saying he made millions by using inferior
materials and pocketing the extra money. Abiola denied the
accusations.
	   Nigeria was shunned internationally during Abacha's harsh rule,
under which political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280
people are believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in
regular prisons except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative
comfort of a government guest house in Abuja.
	   Corruption in Abacha's Nigeria left the economy and
infrastructure in shambles.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock indexes gain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon dollar-yen rate, bond prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo's main stock indexes rose moderately
Wednesday on growing hopes Japan will cut taxes to spur economic
growth. The yen rose against the U.S. dollar.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 114.69 points, or 0.70
percent, closing at 16,530.97. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index had
gained 65.83 points, or 0.40 percent.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was scheduled to hold a news
conference in Nagoya, central Japan, later Wednesday. He was
expected to announce tax cuts, the mass-circulation newspaper
Yomiuri said.
	   Market participants hope tax cuts will bolster consumer demand
and pull Japan out of its deepest recession since World War II.
	   The dollar fell to 139.04 yen in late afternoon, down 0.79 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
138.75 yen overnight.
	   On Tuesday, Hiromu Nonaka, a senior official of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, said the prime minister was definitely
going to call for cutting at least some taxes.
	   A national sales tax increase and tighter fiscal policy by
Hashimoto's party last year have been widely blamed as a source of
Japan's economic troubles.
	   Hashimoto was visiting Nagoya to campaign for Sunday's elections
for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Leaders of Hashimoto's party agreed Wednesday morning that the
party needs to make clear its intention to make permanent income
tax cuts, Nikkei News reported.
	   Newspaper polls published Tuesday predicted Hashimoto's party
would not gain a majority of seats in the upper house.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,268.40. It
had climbed 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, the previous day.
	   Despite the gains in the indexes, declines outnumbered advances
653 to 510, while 125 issues were unchanged.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 517
million shares, down from 544.54 million Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.365 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 110.70 yen from 111.15
yen.

Ranariddh brings electoral campaign to Cambodia's northwest
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with tens of thousands coming to hear
prince, predictions of victory &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANTEAY MEANCHEY, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh told
20,000 cheering people Wednesday he would win the July 26 elections
and would not share power again with Hun Sen, who deposed him as
co-prime minister in a coup last year.
	   Playing on the hatred many Cambodians have for neighboring
Vietnam, their country's historic enemy, Ranariddh accused Hun Sen
of being pro-Vietnamese and ridiculed his rival's claims of being
tougher on the Khmer Rouge.
	   The rally in Banteay Meanchey was an indication that support for
Ranariddh remains strong in the northwest, a bastion of his
royalist FUNCINPEC party, a year after Hun Sen brought their
tension-filled co-premiership to an end with a bloody takeover.
	   Ranariddh finished atop U.N.-organized elections in 1993 but was
forced into a power-sharing arrangement when Hun Sen threatened
civil war. Then as now, Hun Sen controls the bulk of the security
forces.
	   ``I believe we will win a bigger victory in '98 than in '93, but
there won't be any power-sharing with the loser again,'' the prince
said.
	   In a reference to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese,
Ranariddh said: ``If you don't want illegal immigrants to take over
our country and catch our fish, who will you vote for?''
	   ``FUNCINPEC!'' came the reply.
	   Ranariddh and other opposition candidates have played the
anti-Vietnamese card, identifying Hun Sen with the harsh Vietnamese
occupation of the 1980s. Hun Sen came to power under Vietnam's
tutelage and retains close ties to Hanoi.
	   In 1979, Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge
regime, which had caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas came to dominate a resistance coalition that
included Ranariddh's forces.
	   The Khmer Rouge boycotted the 1993 elections but began to
disintegrate three years later, when thousands of war-weary
fighters began defecting. Their notorious leader, Pol Pot, died in
April of a purported heart attack while under arrest by former
comrades.
	   Hun Sen's government has vowed to bring three other senior
figures still on the run _ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ to
trial for crimes against humanity, but others have received pardons
in exchange for making peace.
	   Ranariddh, who as co-premier supported pardons-for-peace
tactics, mocked claims that only Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party
can prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
	   ``How can he do that?'' Ranariddh said. ``The Khmer Rouge have
returned already. They have even visited Phnom Penh.''
	   Ranariddh spoke on a stage surrounded by bodyguards. The
opposition and human rights groups have accused Hun Sen of rigging
the elections by using violence.
	   Party members reported the death of activist Sman Kim over the
weekend in Kompong Thom province, to the east. He was shot on his
way to a rice field. Human rights workers were still investigating
the motive.
	   ``We believe this is a political killing,'' said May Sam Oeun,
FUNCINPEC's campaign manager.
	   The death would be the 12th killing of an opposition activist in
six weeks. At least half of those are believed to be politically
linked.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to restore international aid
and legitimacy lost after his takeover.

EU to tell BA-American, Star Alliance to surrender airport slots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED after announcement expected around 1100 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ In return for EU approval of their
alliance, British Airways and American Airlines on Wednesday faced
plans to limit their usage of London airports and cut up to 55
percent of flights on some transatlantic routes to ensure fair
competition.
	   European Union regulators planned Wednesday to announce rulings
on the planned merger between British Airways and American
Airlines, as well as a rival alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa,
Scandinavian Air Services and United Airlines.
	   The EU regulators were expected to demand that British Airways
and American Airlines shed 267 weekly takeoff and landing slots at
London airports and cut flights on some transatlantic routes by up
to 55 percent to give other airlines chance to compete.
	   If BA and American comply, they could be over the first
regulatory hurdle to the planned mega-alliance that competitors
have denounced as a menace to fair competition on air routes across
the Atlantic.
	   The merger also requires approval from Britain's Department of
Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of Transportation.
	   U.S. authorities have said they would make approval contingent
on Britain negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United
States that would end current restrictions that allow only four
airlines _ BA, American, United and Virgin Atlantic _ to fly to the
United States from London's Heathrow airport.
	   The EU also was expected to announce a preliminary ruling
Wednesday on a rival alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa,
Scandinavian Air Services and United Airlines.
	   On a visit Tuesday to Lisbon, Portugal, EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the EU would call on Lufthansa
and its partners in the Star Alliance to surrender 108 slots at
Frankfurt and Copenhagen airports.
	   After the provisional rulings by the commission, the EU's
20-member executive body, the airlines and their competitors will
be able to submit opinions over the summer.
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines were horrified. They said the alliance
would control 60 percent of the traffic between Britain and United
States, squeeze out competitors and push up prices.
	   To prevent that, the EU was expected to order the companies to
scale back frequencies on flights between London and U.S. cities
including the hubs of Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
	   Van Miert said Tuesday that BA and American would have to give
up 267 of around 700 weekly take off and landing slots at London's
Gatwick and Heathrow airports. Around 220 of those will be at
Heathrow, the main European hub for transatlantic flights.

Defense workers, coal miners protest throughout Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new wave of labor protests gained momentum
Wednesday as defense workers demonstrated in two cities and coal
miners halted traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway for the sixth
straight day.
	   Labor protests that shook Russia in May have been on the
increase again as coal miners and other workers demand back wages
that are months overdue. The miners and others say the government
has failed to come up with the money that was promised two months
ago.
	   In Moscow, several hundred defense industry workers representing
more than 20 regions held a rally in front of the Defense Ministry
to call overdue wages. The marchers also demanded President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation.
	   In the eastern port city of Vladivostok, several thousand
defense workers, doctors and others assailed the Kremlin and the
regional authorities for failing to pay workers. Some demonstrators
said they have been owed money for up to 20 months.
	   Also, prosecutors near Vladivostok opened a criminal case
against coal miners and other workers who blocked a railway leading
to the region's largest power plant. The action has blocked fuel
deliveries to the plant.
	   In central Siberia, several hundred miners from the town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk continued their blockade of the Trans-Siberian
which began on Friday. They claim the government broke its promise
to pay back wages that were part of a settlement that ended a
similar blockade in May.
	   Coal miners said they were prepared to lift the blockade if
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev, who negotiated the May
settlement, meets with them to discuss their demands. Sysuyev
responded by saying they should first remove the railway picket.
	   Trains were stranded in several places along the Trans-Siberian.
But one group of Siberian coal miners from the town of Topki agreed
to end the blockade which interrupted railway traffic in the
northern part of the region.
	   The various protests have not caused any major disruptions to
the national economy, but they do reflect the frustrations felt by
millions of unpaid workers.
	   Wage and pension debts have plagued Russia for years. The
problem stems from the government's chronic inability to collect
taxes, which leaves it short of the money needed to pay workers.
	   The Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, the
nation's largest union group, said Wednesday it would organize a
nationwide protest in October to demand Yeltsin's resignation and
force the government to change its course.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military leadership was warned
just weeks ago that the country's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, suffered from ``life threatening'' health
conditions, a U.S.-based human rights groups said Wednesday.
	   Abiola died Tuesday after suddenly becoming ill during a meeting
with visiting U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' said Dr.
Charles Clements in a June 22 letter sent to Nigeria's new military
leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote to
Abubakar to appeal for Abiola's release on medical grounds.
	   Abiola's death, came just as the end of his imprisonment seemed
near, causing the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, the government said in
a statement.
	   His death came just as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shock, sorrow and renewed pleas for Nigeria to
return to civilian rule greeted the death Tuesday of the nation's
most prominent political prisoner, Moshood Abiola.
	   Opposition groups blamed his death on ill-treatment during four
years in jail and harassment by the military regime.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who met with
Abiola a week ago and who expected his imminent release from jail,
called on Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
to fulfill promises ``to release all remaining political prisoners
unconditionally and to define a credible process for the democratic
transition to civilian rule within a reasonable period.''
	   Abiola, presumed winner of 1993 elections, suffered an apparent
heart attack while meeting a visiting U.S. State Department
delegation.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel praised Abiola as a ``great
fighter for democracy and human rights.''
	   ``I appeal to all political and societal forces in the land to
safeguard calm and level-headedness in this painful and critical
situation,'' he said. ``The great work of reconciliation and
renewal that Gen. Abubakar has set in motion in the few weeks since
he took office must not be endangered by rash and dangerous
agitation.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Nigeria had lost its
``symbol of democracy.''
	   ``It is therefore particularly tragic that he should die now at
this time of change and hope for Nigeria,'' added Cook.
	   Abiola's daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   ``All our efforts have come to nothing because without his life
there is nothing else we can fight for,'' she said.
	   But then Miss Abiola added, ``This is the wake up call for all
our leaders that we don't have time. We must secure the future for
all Nigerians.''
	   While Annan said Abiola had seemed in good health when they met,
the London spokesman for a coalition of opposition groups said
Abiola's health had been deteriorating for a long time.
	   Bolaji Akinyemi, a Nigerian former foreign minister who is now
spokesman for the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria, urged a
delay in burial for a team of World Health Organization doctors to
perform an autopsy.
	   ``... The last four years of his life, the blows that he
suffered, the assassination of his wife, the physical abuse in jail
_ probably part of which has contributed to this cardiac arrest _
have to me made him a martyr in African politics,'' said Akinyemi
in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 TV network.
	   Akinyemi, foreign minister from 1985-87, said Abiola was the
only politician since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960
who bridged the divide between north and south, Christians and
Muslims, rich and poor.
	   '' People from all over the country voted for this man. Nigeria
has lost its best hope in many, many years,'' said Akinyemi.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, Nigeria's ambassador,
Ibrahim A. Gambari, urged Nigerians to wait for the results of an
autopsy that he said would be performed in the presence of Abiola's
personal doctor and family.

Prime minister says he wants permanent tax cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto gave his first
clear indication Wednesday that he will seek permanent tax cuts to
revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   Hashimoto made the statement at a news conference while
campaigning in the central Japanese city of Nagoya.
	   Japan's main stock indexes rose Wednesday on optimism that
Hashimoto would promise permanent tax cuts in an effort to improve
his party's flagging popularity ahead of Sunday's upper house
elections.
	   Hashimoto said he was taking a ``cautious'' stance toward tax
cuts for lower income brackets, suggesting he may be leaning toward
reducing rates for wealthier taxpayers.
	   On Friday, Hashimoto told another campaign rally he supports
``permanent tax reforms'' but then seemed to backtrack two days
later when he said those reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's
overall tax burden.

Dutch foreign minister to quit politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van
Mierlo is quitting politics and will not be part of the new Cabinet
being formed, Dutch television reported Wednesday.
	   Van Mierlo, whose centrist Democrats 66 party took a beating in
national elections in May, is the third Cabinet minister to leave
the government. He said he would step down in about two weeks.
	   Last month, Economic Affairs Minister Hans Wijers, also a member
of the D66 party, announced that he, too, was quitting politics.
Even before the elections, Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager, a
D66 leader, said she wouldn't return.
	   There has been broad speculation that Health Minister Els Borst,
also a D66 leader, would be the next to resign.
	   Since the parliamentary elections, leaders of Prime Minister Wim
Kok's left-of-center Labor Party and the right-leaning Liberal
Party _ the two big winners _ have been meeting with D66 leaders to
reshape the governing coalition and form a new government.
	   They said earlier this week they had reached agreement on a
financial blueprint for the new administration.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.
	   It typically takes months to form a new government in the
Netherlands; in 1977, it took more than 200 days to accomplish.

Taiwan's top China negotiator to make first visit to Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's top China negotiator said he
hoped to meet his Chinese counterpart in Shanghai in late September
to nurture a climate that could usher in the second formal session
between them in five years.
	   Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, called his upcoming meeting with Wang Daohan a warmup
move following a three-year deadlock.
	   ``It's been so long ... and I think we need a warmup move to
pave the way for the next summit that we have expected,'' Koo said.
	   ``The visit will be relatively free,'' he told reporters. ``We
can talk about anything. We don't need to sign any agreements.''
	   Koo said he will visit Shanghai and Beijing, but won't have
enough time to also visit coastal Fujian or the cities of Xian and
Nanjing, which China suggested.
	   Koo was responding to an invitation extended to him last month
by the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, China's
negotiating body.
	   Koo last met Wang in Singapore in 1993 in the first open
dialogue between Taiwan and China since Mao Tse-tung's Communists
drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists from the mainland to Taiwan in
1949.
	   Taiwan hopes Koo's visit can lead to restarting negotiations
that China suspended three years ago over a trip to the United
States by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui.
	   But plans for the visit come at a time when Taiwan is angry at
Beijing for pressing U.S. President Bill Clinton to pledge on his
recent visit not to support a separate Taiwanese government.
	   Although this has been a longstanding U.S. policy, Taiwanese
fear the first public statement of the policy by a U.S. president
could enhance China's position on reunifying with Taiwan.
	   Despite Washington's urging, it is unclear whether Taiwan and
China will narrow their differences over resuming dialogue.
	   Su Chi, deputy secretary-general of the president's office, said
China has shown little enthusiasm about resuming talks. China has
pressed Taiwan to accept Beijing's sovereignty, but has refused to
accept Taiwan's sovereignty, he said.
	   ``We can't accept it if they treat us as a local government,''
Su said at a luncheon with foreign correspondents. ``We have to be
guarded because our room for maneuver is small.''

Protesters burn banks, clash with police, in Tehran suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 300 protesters shouted slogans
against the city's mayor and set fires inside banks in a Tehran
suburb in a protest over a decision to build a park where they had
wanted to build homes, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Residents of the poor southwestern suburb of Massoudieh chanted
slogans against Gholamhossein Karbaschi, smashed windows of two
banks, set fire to the equipment inside and hurled molotov
cocktails, the Iran Daily reported. The crowd shouted ``Death to
the Mayor, Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Police dispersed the crowd by shooting in the air and throwing
tear gas canisters. An undisclosed number of people were arrested,
the paper reported, but there was no word on injuries.
	   Karbaschi, Tehran's suspended mayor, is on trial for corruption.
He has been credited with easing pollution and beautifying Tehran,
a city of 10 million. He has built parks, new roads, sports and
cultural centers, adding a splash of color to the city's typically
drab streets.
	   The demonstrators were protesting a municipality decision to
build a park and an amusement arcade at a site they claimed was
their property. They had been stopped numerous times by the
municipality from building homes there, the paper said.

president Gerald Ryan has welcomed a British decision to scrap
games scheduled against Wales and England later this year.
	   New Zealand will play three tests against Britain, in
Huddersfield on Oct. 28, Bolton on Nov. 7 and Watford on Nov. 14.
	   ``We refused to play them because we would have made a loss,''
Ryan said. ``We are not yet in a position to pay for development
and told them that.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus soared in the first 20 days
of June to 718.57 billion yen (dlrs 5.18 billion), up 60.4 percent
from the same period last year, the Finance Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   Exports rose 4.8 percent from last year on higher shipments of
cars and film equipment, and imports dropped 6.4 percent on
decreased purchases of crude oil, wood, electric parts and
semiconductors, the ministry said.
	   The figures were reported before adjustment for seasonal
factors.
	   In May, the last full month for which statistics are available,
the trade surplus rocketed to 1.22 trillion yen (dlrs 9.03
billion), up 66.6 percent from the same month last year.
	   Demand for foreign products has remained weak amid Japan's
economic slowdown, while the yen's weakness against the U.S. dollar
has made Japanese exports cheaper in the United States.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. and Microsoft Corp. of the United States said
Wednesday they have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly
develop digital electronics technology and products.
	   The agreement envisions working together on digital audio-visual
technology for next generation personal computers and digital cable
advanced set-top boxes, the companies said.
	   The agreement also allows Matsushita to use the Windows CE
operating system in computer and audiovisual products, they said.
	   Windows CE is a scaled-down version of the Microsoft Windows
platform designed for use with handheld personal computers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Wednesday it will run
its first bullet trains by 2004, but only about half as far as
originally planned.
	   The country had planned to build a 430-kilometer (270-mile)
high-speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan, a port city on the
southeast coast, by 2004.
	   The government said Wednesday the country's financial crisis has
dried up funds and it will be able to build only 250 kilometers
(155 miles) of line over the next six years.
	   The Construction and Transportation Ministry put the cost of the
250-kilometer line at 12.7 trillion won (dlrs 9 billion). It said
construction of the remainder of the line will begin in 2006 and be
completed six years later.
	   In the interim, an existing railroad will be electrified to let
the bullet trains keep running from Taegu, a city in central South
Korea, to Pusan at a much reduced speed, the ministry said.
	   In March, the government audit agency recommended that
cash-strapped South Korea reconsider building the railroad, saying
it ``cannot afford the unprofitable, reckless project.''
	   The bullet train, which would be Asia's second after Japan's
Shinkansen, is by far the largest among hundreds of half-finished
projects South Korea launched during its boom years in the 1980s
and early 90s.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Uncertainty over currency stability in
China is causing Taiwanese companies to revise their investment
strategies on the mainland, Chi Su, deputy secretary-general in the
president's office, said Wednesday.
	   Taiwanese investors are ``waiting until depreciation'' pressures
on the yuan are over before they funnel money into China, Su told a
group of foreign reporters. A threat of a yuan devaluation ``in
itself deters foreign investment.''
	   Concerns over the yuan have effectively helped the government's
``Go Slow, Be Patient'' policy toward the mainland. The Taiwan
government urges companies to slow down or transfer investments
from China in an effort to reduce reliance on the mainland.
	   ``Taiwan has flexible policies, a flexible economy,'' he said.
	   Su said that China faces much the same problems that Taiwan did,
only bigger.

	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Businessmen at the Subic
Bay Freeport said Wednesday they have lost millions of dollars
because of a squabble over who should head the government agency
overseeing the industrial zone, and appealed for a quick
resolution.
	   The dispute arose after newly inaugurated President Joseph
Estrada fired Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, and appointed a longtime Gordon critic,
Felicito Payumo, as his replacement.
	   Payumo was to take over on July 1 but hundreds of Gordon's
supporters barricaded the freeport's gates. Thousands of workers
stayed away from factories in the industrial zone, fearing they
might be caught in a clash between supporters and opponents of
Gordon.
	   In a statement, the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce
estimated losses were as high as dlrs 3.5 million just for that
day.
	   It said the tension forced one ship to cancel a port call,
delaying the export of more than dlrs 1 million of goods. The entry
of raw materials also was delayed and as much as 85 percent of the
work force in the zone was absent, it said.
	   Federal Express and Acer, a Taiwanese computer maker, are among
the biggest investors at Subic, a former U.S. naval base that was
closed in 1992 and converted into an industrial and tourism center.
	   Fedex, which operates its Asian hub at Subic, was forced to
divert flights to Manila's airport and move dependents of
Subic-based pilots to Manila.

Libya says Gadhafi has resumed his duties after hip operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has
resumed his duties after an operation to repair a broken hip, the
official Libyan news agency JANA reported Wednesday.
	   Gadhafi, 56, is now in good condition and has started
physiotherapy on his hip, which he broke while exercising, JANA
said in a report from the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   Gadhafi carried out his routine duties on Wednesday and received
foreign guests, JANA said.
	   Gadhafi had announced Monday at a news conference that he would
undergo an operation on his hip. The operation occurred late Monday
and, on Tuesday night, Libyan television showed Gadhafi in the
operating theater, talking to aides under local anesthesia while a
team of surgeons operated.
	   By Tuesday Gadhafi was well enough to be shown on television in
a wheelchair greeting dignitaries he had invited to Libya to take
part in prayers marking the birthday of Prophet Mohammed. The
visitors included the American Muslim leader, Louis Farrakhan, who
kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks.

Prime minister says he wants permanent tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to show Hashimoto doesn't support lower minimum
taxable income, 7th graf; ADDS quote from Hashimoto, details of
speech &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto gave his first
clear indication Wednesday that he will seek permanent tax cuts to
revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   ``As part of permanent revisions of the tax system, I aim to
create a tax system that can receive the support of the people,''
Hashimoto said at a news conference while campaigning in the
central Japanese city of Nagoya.
	   Hashimoto also said he hopes to come to a decision before the
year's end about lowering corporate taxes.
	   He said the income tax cuts would take effect next year.
	   Japan's main stock indexes rose Wednesday on optimism Hashimoto
would promise permanent tax cuts in an effort to improve his
party's flagging popularity ahead of Sunday's upper house
elections.
	   Japan is under intense pressure at home and abroad to take steps
to stimulate its economy to halt the yen's slide and help prop up
Asia's ailing economies.
	   Hashimoto said he was taking a ``cautious'' stance toward
lowering the minimum tax rate, denying speculation he would offset
tax cuts for wealthier Japanese by raising rates for lower income
earners.
	   Japan's minimum taxable income now stands at 3.6 million yen
(about dlrs 25,000).
	   On Friday, Hashimoto told another campaign rally he supports
``permanent tax reforms'' but then seemed to backtrack two days
later when he said those reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's
overall tax burden.

Two injured in Spanish festival bull run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain AP) _ Two people were slightly injured Wednesday
in the second day of Spain's annual San Fermin bull-running
festival although there were no reports of gorings.
	   An estimated 3,000 people tested their speed and bravery to run
with six bulls along the 850-meter (935-yard) course through the
cobblestone streets to the town's bullring.
	   The race, which started as scheduled at 8 a.m. (0600 gmt), was
virtually incident free and finished in under three minutes.
	   The two people injured were treated in hospital for light
bruises but later released, news reports said.
	   The only real scare came where some 50 people were momentarily
trapped in a pileup at the entrance to the bull ring where the run
concludes.
	   In the melee, one of the steers used to try to keep the bulls in
a pack scrambled over the mound of humanity to make its way into
the ring.
	   Police quickly cordoned off the entrance to allow people get
free from the pileup.
	   Each year tens of thousands of people, including many
foreigners, attend what has come to be one of Europe's most popular
festivals. The event was made world famous by Ernest Hemingway's
1927 novel ``Fiesta - The Sun Also Rises.''
	   The bulls used in the run inevitably face death at the hands of
matadors in the afternoon bullfight, another of the major
attractions of the festival which began Monday.
	   In the first run Tuesday, one Spaniard was gored in the groin
and another was injured on being trampled by crowds. The last
fatality at the festival occurred in 1995 when an American was
gored to death.
	   A total of 13 people have died at San Fermin since Spanish
officials began keeping records in 1924.

Romanian Homosexuals will run in Gay Olympic Games in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Six Romanian homosexuals will
participate in the Gay Olympic Games in Amsterdam this summer,
media reported Wednesday.
	   The five men and one woman will travel to the games at the
beginning of August to compete for medals in dance, triathlon
marathon, chess and athletics, Libertatea daily said.
	   ``We want to prove wrong the rumors that homosexuals aren't
athletes, are weak or cowards,'' Daniel Iorga, a bronze medalists
in athletics at the 1996 Berlin Gay Olympics, told the daily.
	   In Romania, public homosexual acts are a crime and punihsable by
law with three months to five years prison. Legislators recently
rejected a governmental amendment to abolish the law.
	   The athletes' expenses will be supported by a homosexual rights
group, Gay Association Accept, the Netherlands Embassy to Romania
and a Swiss foundation.

Wakanohana, four others remain undefeated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ New yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana
drove out No. 3 maegashira (senior wrestler) Shikishima on
Wednesday, joining four other wrestlers still unbeaten after four
days of the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   The others were yokozuna Takanohana, Hawaiian-born ozeki
(champion) Musashimaru, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai and
No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma.
	   Yokozuna Akebono from Hawaii and ozeki Takanonami had 3-1
records.
	   Wakanohana charged Shikishima (2-2) with an arm throw attempt
and sent him out.
	   Takanohana grabbed winless No. 3 maegashira Gojoro's belt and
forced him out.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, held off winless No. 2 maegashira
Tochinonada's initial hand thrusts, grabbed his foe's belt and
drove him out.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, crashed hard into winless No.
1 maegashira Oginishiki and thrust him down.
	   Takanonami forced out winless komusubi (junior champion second

grabbed No. 13 maegashira Kotoryu's leg and toppled him for his
second victory against two defeats. Kotoryu is 3-1.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
suffered his third defeat against one victory as he was slapped

Protestants protest, riot for third night over blocked Orange
</HEADLINE>
parade &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Wednesday violence, comment &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Belfast drivers made their way
to work Wednesday along roads strewn with burned-out cars and
rioters' rubble after a third night of Protestant violence over
restrictions on an Orange Order parade.
	   Leaders of Northern Ireland's 80,000-member Protestant
brotherhood have vowed to stand their ground at an Anglican church
outside Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast, until
British authorities let them march as usual down nearby Garvaghy
Road past the town's main Catholic enclave. Protesters there first
tried to block the annual march in 1995.
	   Under orders from a government-appointed Parades Commission,
British security forces erected extensive barricades to block the
July 5 march. The ensuing standoff has brought rioting to Northern
Ireland for the third consecutive summer.
	   Police and soldiers game under gunfire at they confronted mobs
early Wednesday in Protestant east Belfast, the Protestant section
of Antrim, west of Belfast; and Newtownards, east of Belfast.
	   And in Protestant Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus to the north,
rioters threw homemade grenades and gasoline bombs at police and
army lines.
	   Arsonists attacked a Catholic elementary school in Lisburn, a
southwest Belfast suburb, and a shelter for homeless people in east
Belfast, forcing its occupants to flee. On Wednesday morning army
bomb-disposal experts defused a grenade attached to the gateway of
a Catholic high school in north Belfast.
	   A Protestant mob menaced Catholic homes in Lurgan, Portadown's
neighboring town, breaking windows and firing shots in the air.
Such mutual threats over the past 30 years have ensured that
Northern Ireland today is more segregated than ever before in its
history.
	   The Orange Order _ whose annual marches since the early 1800s
proclaim ``civil and religious liberty for all'' but are despised
by many Catholics as sectarian provocations _ denies any
responsibility for the violence.
	   ``These people are not principled protesters,'' said David
McNarry, a coordinator of the order's province-wide campaign of
parades and street protests, which continued Wednesday and are
illegal but largely nonviolent. The people attacking the police and
destroying property were ``the kind of people who are probably in
trouble 365 days out of the year,'' he said.
	   Late Tuesday, several thousand Orangemen paraded through north,
south and east Belfast, ignoring the authorities' requirement for
28-day notices.
	   Orangemen and supporters formed human barricades across roads in
a dozen mostly Protestant towns. In some places they only allowed
cars through if their drivers could prove they were members of the
203-year-old fraternal group.
	   In 1996, the last time police blocked the march outside Drumcree
Anglican church, they gave up after four nights of intensifying
Protestant violence and forced the Orangemen past furious Catholics
down Garvaghy Road.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, chief opponent of April's peace accord
outlining a compromise government for Northern Ireland, said he was
confident the Orangemen would be allowed down Garvaghy Road again
this year.
	   He said it would be ``far better'' if authorities redeployed
police and troops against the Garvaghy Road Catholics before
Sunday. That will be the eve of the Orangemen's biggest annual
celebrations across Northern Ireland, when they commemorate the
1690 victory of the Protestant King William of Orange over the
Catholic James II.
	   David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, the Protestant and Catholic
politicians jointly heading Northern Ireland's new cross-community
government, worked behind the scenes to inch Portadown's Orange
leaders and members of the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition closer
together.

Heavy rains, Alpine snows hit parts of Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Storms dumped heavy rain across a wide
area of Austria and snow in high Alpine areas, snarling traffic and
causing local flooding in the capital Vienna and eastern parts of
the country.
	   Police were requiring chains Wednesday for all motorists driving
over the Grossglockner Pass, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of
Salzburg, after snow fell in the higher elevations overnight.
	   The storms struck late Tuesday, dumping heavy rains in Vienna,
Upper Austria, Lower Austria and Steiermark. Highway B 33 was
temporarily closed in the Melk area west of Vienna Tuesday night.
	   In the Steiermark region southwest of Vienna, police reported
the storm knocked out electric power, toppled trees, flooded
basements and damaged roofs in the Radkersburg district.
	   Several people were slightly injured, police said, giving no
precise figure.
	   Troops of the Austrian army were called out to assist police and
firemen in Steiermark, media reports said.

Hong Kong shares higher on stable yen, interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks closed higher Wednesday, with
investors encouraged by a stable yen and local interbank interest
rates.
	   The benchmark Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator for
blue chips, ended three sessions of losses and climbed 185 points,
or 2.2 percent, closing at 8,629.18.
	   Analysts said the market rose due to a stronger yen and stable
trading on Wall Street. The positive sentiment of the overseas
markets also caused Hong Kong interbank rates to fall slightly
Wednesday.
	   But Jansen Au of Tai Fook Securities Co. said investors were
still waiting for ``Japan's economic reforms and news about a
long-term tax cut.''
	   Market volume rose to 3.46 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 444
million) from Tuesday's 2.95 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 378
million).
	   The day's biggest gainer was HSBC Holdings, up 3.50 Hong Kong
dollars to 191.00. Other gainers included Hutchison Whampoa, up
2.20 to 42.20, and Sun Hung Kai Properties, up 1.40 to 32.70. Hong
Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific gained 20 cents to 6.30.
	   Television Broadcasts lost 30 cents to 20.50, Citic Pacific fell
20 cents to 14.20, and Bank of East Asia dropped 10 cents to 8.50.

Supreme Court rejects appeal of woman jailed for offending Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an
appeal to reduce the two-year prison term of an Israeli woman who
put up posters portraying the Prophet Mohammed as a pig.
	   Tatiana Suszkin, 26, was convicted after posting drawings
showing the Muslim prophet as a pig on the doors of Arab-owned
shops in the West Bank town of Hebron last year. Muslims, as well
as Jews, consider pigs to be unclean.
	   The posters set off clashes in Hebron, a town of 450 Jewish
settlers and 130,000 Palestinians. They also triggered outrage
throughout the Muslim world, including angry street protests in
Bangladesh and Iran, and rulings by Muslim clerics that insulting
the prophet should be punishable by death. Israeli leaders
condemned her actions.
	   Suszkin supports the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group.
	   She was convicted of committing a racist act, supporting a
terrorist organization, attempting to create religious offense and
attempted vandalism. She also was convicted of endangering life by
throwing rocks at Arab drivers.
	   Her lawyer, Sean Casper, asked that two of the convictions _
support of a terrorist group and attempt to offend religious
feelings _ be struck. He also asked that Suszkin be convicted of
attempting to commit a racist act, rather than the act itself.
	   Casper requested a reduction in sentence, but did not specify by
how much. Suszkin, who was arrested a year ago and convicted in
January,has another year to serve.
	   The Supreme Court issued a ruling in writing Wednesday rejecting
his appeal for a reduced sentence, but no reasons were offered,
Casper said.

Protesters burn banks, clash with police, in Tehran suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 300 protesters shouted slogans
against the city's mayor and set fires inside banks in a Tehran
suburb after a decision was made to build a park where they wanted
to build homes, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Residents of the poor southwestern suburb of Massoudieh chanted
slogans against Gholamhossein Karbaschi, smashed windows of two
banks, set fire to the equipment inside and hurled Molotov
cocktails Monday night, the Iran Daily reported. The crowd shouted
``Death to the Mayor, Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Police dispersed the crowd by shooting in the air and throwing
tear gas canisters. An undisclosed number of people were arrested,
the paper reported, but there was no word on injuries.
	   Karbaschi, Tehran's suspended mayor, is on trial for corruption.
He has been credited with easing pollution and beautifying Tehran,
a city of 10 million. He has built parks, new roads, sports and
cultural centers, adding a splash of color to the city's typically
drab streets.
	   The demonstrators were protesting a municipality decision to
build a park and an amusement arcade at a site they claimed was
their property. They had been stopped numerous times by the
municipality from building homes there, the paper said.

Are Australians racist? Judgment hangs in balance, commissioner
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With Australia's international
reputation on race issues at its worst in decades, the nation's
race discrimination commissioner warned Wednesday that final
judgment on whether this is a racist nation hangs in the balance.
	   ``Our past is deeply etched with racism,'' said Zita Antonios,
citing the dispossession and forced assimilation of Aborigines and
the former ``White Australia'' immigration policy as examples.
	   But Australians also have a deep belief in social justice and,
``with a few virulent exceptions, reject overt racism,'' she told
the Foreign Correspondents' Association.
	   Australians' general sense of fair play was being distorted into
prejudice against Aborigines and immigrants for receiving special
treatment from governments to address disadvantage or special
circumstances, Antonios said.
	   Speaking on the same day Parliament passed Prime Minister John
Howard's law restricting Aborigines' land rights, Antonios said
Aborigines are being attacked as privileged when analysis shows
they are the most dispossessed and chronically disadvantaged people
in Australia.
	   Ethnic minorities are being stigmatized as a threat to national
unity because of their desire to maintain cultural identity, she
said.
	   Independent federal legislator Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized.'' She says immigrants
should be given an English-language test and that special welfare
benefits to Aborigines should be abolished.
	   One Nation attracted more than 20 percent of the vote in a June
13 Queensland state election, and has been polling in the mid-teens
nationally.
	   The party's success in Queensland was widely reported around the
world and critically received in Asia. The government has warned
One Nation could damage Australia's crucial trade with the region.
	   Antonios said the unprecedented economic and social upheaval of
modern times heightened feelings of anxiety and insecurity in
Australia and had ``broken the threshold of tolerance.''
	   Hostility toward Aborigines and immigrants was the result.
	   ``Asian Australians are telling us loudly that it is not
comfortable being an Asian in Australia right now,'' Antonios said.
	   Antonios said the rise of a new right wing in Australia
reflected similar events in many countries including the United
States, and made Australia one of many nations that are ``grappling
to maintain or define their sense of identity, security and
sovereignty while achieving substantive social justice.''
	   ``Australia has a strong tradition of social justice which can
provide a common source of inspiration across political division.
We also have a history of racism,'' Antonios said.
	   ``Whether Australia is a racist nation lies with the people of
this country and the answer still lies in the balance.''
	   As race discrimination commissioner, Antonios adjudicates race
discrimination complaints under Australia's Race Discrimination
Act.

Colombo's latest worry: Crows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add photo number &QL;

 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Harsh-voiced, shiny crows are plaguing
the Sri Lankan capital. They're pushing other birds out of Colombo,
attacking pets, annoying humans at play, at work and on the road _
and experts aren't sure what to do.
	   ``It is really an alarming situation, believe me,'' Ismeth
Raheem, chief of Colombo's 55-year-old Bird Club, said in an
interview this week.
	   Members of the Bird Club observe birds throughout Sri Lanka and
advise the government on how to protect and manage the hundreds of
bird species on the island.
	   The crux of the problem is that people have encroached on the
crows' home. The birds have found they are not only able to live
with their fellow bipeds, but thrive in their company. Raheem
estimates there are 500,000 crows in Colombo today, compared to
100,000 five years ago.
	   Once upon a time crows were the only dwellers on ``Crow Island''
off Colombo. But in the battle for space over the last 15 years or
so, humans won and the island is now home to tens of thousands of
people.
	   Crows, which are both predators and scavengers, gorge on garbage
thrown out by Colombo's 2.5 million residents and occasionally
snack on a kitten.
	   Drivers are forced to either come to a sudden halt or take sharp
turns to avoid crows on city roads crouched over the carcasses of
cats and other prey.
	   A cricket match in a Colombo suburb was recently interrupted by
hundreds of crows attracted to the field by a half-eaten loaf of
bread.
	   The departure of an Australian ship that had delivered apples to
Colombo had to be delayed after dozens of crows descended on
leftover fruit strewn on the decks. Finally, the crew fired blanks
to scare away the birds.
	   The house crow and bigger jungle crow are two of 425 bird
species _ 26 of them unique to Sri Lanka _ enjoying this Indian
Ocean island's tropical climate, isolation from the Asian mainland
and wide range of habitats.
	   Raheem also said he feared that crows were scaring away other
bird species, including Paradise flycatchers and the Indian Golden
Oriole, by invading their nests.
	   The crow population has grown so large that it would be futile
to try to cull their numbers to restore nature's balance, Raheem
said.
	   ``I don't think we can afford the cost of ammunition,'' he said.
	   At any rate, powerful monks in this largely Buddhist nation who
frown on killing any living being may object to a crow slaughter.
As an alternative, female crows could be caught and sterilized. But
Raheem says that would be very difficult.
	   The crows do provide some benefits _ they do their part to keep
the garbage under control, and squirrels seem to find their nests
comfortable resting places.

Russia hopes to get IMF loan soon to stabilize markets
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is moving closer to a multi-billion-dollar
loan package from the International Monetary Fund aimed at
stabilizing the country's sinking financial markets, a top official
said.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to international
lenders, said the two sides hope to work out the details of a dlrs
10 billion to dlrs 15 billion loan in meetings this week and next.
	   ``We have reached a mutual understanding with our partners,''
Chubais told journalists Tuesday after a meeting with the Moscow
representatives of the IMF and the World Bank.
	   ``We wanted to resolve all principal issues in a tight time
frame, by the end of the week, and spend the next week on working
out practical problems,'' he said. The next meeting is scheduled
for Thursday.
	   Many economists say the loan is essential to restore confidence
to Russia's faltering markets and halt the exodus of foreign
investors. The stock and bond markets have been falling for months,
though this has not yet had much of an impact on ordinary Russians.
	   However, the Russian ruble is under pressure as well, and a
devaluation would result in price hikes that would inflict
additional pain on all Russians. A new IMF loan would help ease the
pressure on the ruble.
	   Russia's financial markets have suffered several simultaneous
blows _ the government's shaky finances, a drop in revenues from
oil exports, and a loss of investor confidence brought on by the
Asian economic crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's administration also has presented an
economic stabilization package to parliament that includes more
than 20 proposals, most aimed at streamlining the country's
complicated tax system.
	   However, parliament's lower house has so given only tentative
approval to a handful of measures, and is not scheduled to meet
again until July 15.
	   Martin Gilman, the IMF's chief representative in Moscow, said
additional aid to Russia would depend on the implementation of the
government's stabilization package.
	   If the government's economic program becomes bogged down in the
State Duma, parliament's lower house, President Boris Yeltsin may
sign many of bills into law in the form of decrees.
	   ``There is understanding for Russia's tough position, but one
can't just lose heart, and the actions of the government must
stimulate growth,'' Chubais said.
	   Russian government bonds took a nosedive Tuesday and the stock
markets continued to sink. The stock market dropped about 5 percent
while interest rates on short-term government bonds shot up to 120
percent, from 90 percent on Monday.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value this year and
the interest rates on government bonds have soared to unsustainable
levels.

Prime minister says he wants permanent tax cuts

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto gave his first
clear indication Wednesday that he will seek permanent tax cuts to
revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   ``As part of permanent revisions of the tax system, I aim to
create a tax system that can receive the support of the people,''
Hashimoto said at a news conference while campaigning in the
central Japanese city of Nagoya.
	   Hashimoto also said he hopes to come to a decision before the
year's end about lowering corporate taxes.
	   He said the income tax cuts would take effect next year.
	   Japan's main stock indexes rose Wednesday on optimism Hashimoto
would promise permanent tax cuts in an effort to improve his
party's flagging popularity ahead of Sunday's upper house
elections.
	   Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party had resisted calls
for permanent tax cuts, stressing instead the need to rein in
Japan's ballooning national deficit.
	   But Japan has come under increasing pressure at home and abroad
to pull its economy out of recession to halt the yen's slide and
help prop up Asia's ailing economies.
	   Polls have shown the LDP unlikely to win an upper house majority
as opposition parties such as the Japan Communist Party gain
support on platforms calling for sweeping tax cuts.
	   Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in Tokyo,
said the poor performance in opinion polls may have driven
Hashimoto to change his tune about tax cuts.
	   ``Domestic politics has taken over,'' Lyons said.
	   Hashimoto offered few details of how he would reduce taxes,
except to say he would not do so by increasing the tax burden for
lower income earners.
	   There had been speculation Hashimoto might seek to offset tax
cuts for wealthier Japanese by lowering the minimum tax rate _
effectively forcing more of Japan's population to pay income taxes.
	   Japanese currently are not required to pay income tax unless
they earn more than 3.6 million yen (about dlrs 25,000) per year.
	   On Friday, Hashimoto said he supports ``permanent tax reforms''
but then seemed to backtrack two days later when he said those
reforms wouldn't reduce the nation's overall tax burden.

Nike's Tiger Woods product line selling slowly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ A year ago, no one was predicting
lukewarm sales of Tiger Woods signature products.
	   But Nike Inc.'s long-awaited Tiger Woods line has fallen far
below par.
	   Sales of the Tiger Woods signature shoe, which retails for
between dlrs 225 and dlrs 250, have been particularly slow.
	   ``It just plain flat was a total disaster,'' Jerry Offerdahl,
owner of four Nevada Bob's Discount Golf shops in Oregon, told The
Oregonian newspaper. ``We're already closing them out.''
	   Retailers blame high prices, the shoe's offbeat style and Woods'
relatively poor performance on the PGA Tour this year.
	   ``All the Woods stuff is so gaudy,'' said Ryan Kleinjan, of Golf
America in Egan, Minnesota. ``It's easy to sell a 13-year-old. But
the 40-year-old lawyer is turned off by it.''
	   The tepid consumer reaction is a stunning setback for Nike,
which thought Woods' appeal was so universal that he would be the
next can't-miss endorser.
	   Nike signed Woods to a five-year deal worth almost dlrs 40
million when he became a professional in late 1996. Now some
question how effectively Nike has used Woods.
	   In his rookie year, Woods was a phenomenon, including a
record-smashing win at the Masters. Wherever he went, PGA ticket
sales and television ratings skyrocketed.
	   Even Nike chairman Phil Knight, a man not given to hyperbole,
predicted Woods would ``change the way people view the game of
golf.''
	   Nike made the decision to go beyond a mere signature shoe and
develop an entire Tiger Woods product line. But the company's
designers faced a tricky set of demographic and style questions.
	   They could have played it safe and fashioned a traditional look.
But Nike had something in mind, sources told The Oregonian, more
like the fire-engine red high-tops that U.S. basketball star
Michael Jordan wore onto NBA courts in the mid-1980s.
	   Depending on who's doing the talking, the Tiger Woods signature
shoe _ the Air Zoom TW _ is either sleek and elegantly modern or
downright ugly.
	   ``The design was a little radical,'' Offerdahl said. ``It didn't
take us long to realize the shoes looked good on one guy _ Tiger
Woods.''
	   A dozen retailers from California to Minnesota to Delaware
agreed that the Tiger line of footwear has been disappointing.
Nike's Tiger Woods apparel line has done better in some locations.
But there, also, some retailers feel Nike got too aggressive on
price by charging dlrs 54 and up for polo shirts.
	   The company introduced the Woods line, which includes golf shoes
and apparel, in February. Starting in April, Nike's golf unit was
hit by management departures, which may or may not be related to
the performance of the Tiger Woods products.
	   Bob Rief, former general manager of the unit, left the company
about two weeks ago. He would say only that the parting was
``amicable.'' Four other Nike golf managers left in the last three
months.
	   Until recently, Nike's big investment in golf looked like a
rousing success. The Beaverton company's golf sales jumped from
dlrs 35 million four years ago to about dlrs 200 million in the
fiscal year that ended May 31.
	   The lackluster showing of the Woods line adds to growing
questions about the value of athlete endorsements. Some companies
are paring back on their relationships with athletes in the belief
that few are worth the money.
	   Woods, however, remains a power to reckon with, said Bob
Dorfman, a sports industry expert with Foote Cone and Belding, a
San Francisco ad agency. ``I don't think this is the end of his
viability as an endorser,'' he said. ``He's a young guy. The
reality of golf is, nobody wins all the time.''
	   Indeed, Woods remains one of the most popular figures in sports.
	   Rob Correa, vice president for programming at CBS Sports, said
that in the Nissan Open in March and the BellSouth Classic in May,
two tournaments in which Woods was in contention on the final day,
CBS' ratings were up 31 percent and 68 percent, respectively, from
the year before.

Russian official: Kuril Islands will remain Russian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top official visiting the country's Far East
said Wednesday that Moscow had no intention of surrendering the
disputed Kuril Islands to Japan.
	   ``Russia's borders are invariable. It's inadmissible and
unconstitutional to give away the islands,'' Nemtsov said at a
meeting with regional officials on Sakhalin Island, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty ending World
War II hostilities because of a dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain that Soviet troops seized at the end of the war.
	   Relations between the two nations have been warming in recent
years and President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed to conclude the peace treaty by 2000
during their meeting in Russia last November.
	   At a subsequent summit in Japan in April, they pledged to
accelerate efforts to conclude the treaty. However, neither side
has publicly offered a major compromise.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
returned home unharmed Wednesday after a nearly 24-hour standoff
with police on a road outside the capital, an act of defiance the
military regime said could disrupt peace.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, arrived back
at her lakeside home following an overnight sit-in in her car after
she was stopped some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yangon.
	   She rejected police orders to go back until she was allowed to
meet a member of her National League for Democracy, who was brought
to the car Wednesday morning from farther north in Min Hla
township, said NLD sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The trip flouted an unofficial ban on Suu Kyi traveling outside
Yangon. In a statement Tuesday, the government called it a bid to
``create unnecessary and unwanted confusion, confrontation and
collision.''
	   When Suu Kyi and other three people in her car refused to return
to Yangon, local officials called over about 30 soldiers to
manually lift the car _ with the people inside _ and turn it around
to face toward the capital, a high-ranking party official said.
	   Neither Suu Kyi nor the others in the car, NLD Chairman Aung
Shwe, another party official and the driver, were harmed, the party
sources said.
	   Suu Kyi wanted to tell Hla Hla Moe, a party member elected in
1990 to a parliament that the military never allowed to convene, to
stop meeting demands by local authorities to check in twice a day,
the party sources said.
	   Suu Kyi's activities are tightly restricted. The trip outside
her home without a customary security forces escort, followed by
her refusal to return when stopped, amounted to a challenge to
government authority amid a wider push to hasten civilian rule.
	   Last month, her party for the first time set a deadline, Aug.
21, demanding that the government convene the 1990 parliament. The
NLD overwhelmingly won those elections but the ruling generals,
whose supporters were beaten, never allowed parliament to meet.
	   Since the demand was issued, the government has required the
members-elect living outside the capital to report twice a day to
local authorities, an apparent attempt to keep them from convening
on their own. Those who refuse have reportedly been detained.
	   It was the second time since she was released in 1995 from six
years of formal house arrest that Suu Kyi has tried to leave
Yangon. In 1996, she tried taking a train north to Mandalay, but
the coach she would have ridden in was removed from service.
	   Suu Kyi has again been restricted to her home since 1996 but is
occasionally allowed to leave to meet small groups of supporters
and to receive some visitors. She is barred from making speeches or
other public political activities.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi's trip Tuesday coincided with the anniversary of the
demolition that year of the Students' Union building at Yangon
University, a symbol of political militancy.
	   Recent challenges her party has thrown at the government
coincide with the anniversary of an anti-military uprising in 1988
that was crushed when the army killed thousands of protesters.
	   Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was vaulted
into the leadership of the pro-democracy movement by the events.
	   A new generation of generals also came to power. They opened the
long-isolated economy to foreign investment in hopes of lifting the
country out of poverty, but have allowed little dissent.

VW decision on WWII slave laborers could affect other German firms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen's about-face decision to pay its
former World War II slave laborers should force other German firms
to reconsider their longstanding refusal to consider similar claims
for back wages, a lawyer said Wednesday.
	   Klaus von Muenchhausen, who represents about 100 former VW slave
laborers, welcomed VW's announcement Tuesday that it would set up a
private fund to handle such claims.
	   ``It was very very late, 50 years too late, but a great success,
morally and legally,'' von Muenchhausen said by telephone from his
Bremen office.
	   The lawyer, who also represents former slave laborers from other
German firms, said he expected the decision by VW, Europe's largest
carmaker, would make it difficult for other companies to continue
their own refusal to honor such claims.
	   German companies have largely avoided back wage payments,
arguing that the Nazi regime was responsible for wartime slave
labor, and that any claims should be directed to the regime's
successor _ the current German government.
	   ``It will become a question of prestige,'' von Muenchhausen
said. ``It will be very hard for other firms, like BMW or Siemens,
to say we won't pay.''
	   Details of the Volkswagen's planned fund will be released in
mid-September.
	   VW said it was acting ``in recognition of its historical and
moral responsibilities arising from the use of forced labor during
World War II.''
	   Von Muenchhausen said he believed his clients, teen-agers during
the war who were sent from the Auschwitz death camp to work for VW
during 1944-1945, would get their money by the end of the year.
	   VW did not say how much it would pay; the lawyer said his
clients were seeking 4,000 marks (dlrs 2,200) for each month
worked.
	   He said he was pursuing similar action against Varta, a battery
firm, and Hochtief, a construction company, on behalf of former
slave laborers from the Netherlands.
	   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Los Angeles-based
Simon Wiesenthal Center, said he hoped VW's action would also
influence Swiss banks still holding on to assets of Holocaust
victims.
	   ``It will put pressure on other corporations and banks to remove
all sorts of legal firewalls that have been erected,'' he said.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany during the war. The German government has compensated Nazi
slave laborers for imprisonment and health damage, but has refused
to honor wage claims because laborers technically were working for
private companies.
	   But the Diehl defense contracting company said in May it would
compensate surviving Jewish women. The women were taken from a
concentration camp at Grossposen, in what is now Poland, and forced
to work in two Diehl factories building munitions during the war.
	   Von Muenchhausen had threatened to take VW to court unless a
settlement was reached by July 31. He said state officials in Lower
Saxony, which holds a major stake in VW, had promised to help seek
a settlement.
	   The state's governor, Gerhard Schroeder, sits on VW's board and
is also running to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl in federal
elections this fall.

Indonesia forms anti-rape task force in wake of riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shocked by rapes reportedly committed
during riots in May, Indonesia's government on Wednesday
established a task force to protect women against sexual violence.
	   The new body is to be headed by Hasri Ainun Habibie, the wife of
President B.J. Habibie, and Women's Affairs Minister Tutty
Alawiyah.
	   Human rights groups have documented more than 100 cases of rape
and sexual assault during the rioting, which led to the ouster of
Suharto as president. However, they estimate many victims have not
come forward.
	   Most rape victims are believed to be from the ethnic Chinese
minority, which was made a scapegoat for the nation's deep economic
crisis.
	   ``The priority is to protect women and to ensure that violence
against women, seen on May 13 and 14, doesn't happen again,'' Mrs.
Alawiyah told reporters after a Cabinet meeting.
	   On Tuesday, the national Human Rights Commission acknowledged
that rapes and sexual harassment were used by groups to terrorize
Chinese during the riots.
	   Women's groups have said the government has been slow to
investigate the rape reports.
	   Rioting over several days, together with student-led democracy
protests, helped end Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule. About
1,200 people were killed in the violence.
	   Mobs of looters and arsonists destroyed hundreds of
Chinese-owned stores in anger over the country's economic decline.
	   Indonesia is experiencing its worst economic crisis in 30 years,
and inflation and mass unemployment have soared.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ One day after the death of Nigeria's most
prominent political prisoner, protesters have taken to the streets
while a human rights group Wednesday said the country's military
leadership was warned of Moshood Abiola's frail health
	   Abiola _ imprisoned for four years _ died Tuesday after suddenly
becoming ill during a meeting with visiting U.S. diplomats. He was
60.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' said Dr.
Charles Clements in a June 22 letter sent to Nigeria's new military
leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   Although Abiola was just days away from being released by
Abubakar, Nigeria's ruling military junta failed to act on the
medical advice.
	   Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote to
Abubakar to appeal for Abiola's release on medical grounds.
	   Abiola's death is the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, but the government said
it also ordered an autopsy. It was unclear who would conduct it.
	   A funeral was scheduled later in the day Wednesday.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, said he was unable to
participate in the autopsy and called for physicians from Britain
and Canada to take part.
	   ``This is not something I can take part in, at least for now,
and we are contacting the Commonwealth Medical Association to be
involved in the any autopsy,'' Falomo said.
	   His death came just as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, youths and student groups
have staged several noisy demonstrations along busy streets.
Setting tires on fire and pelting stones, thousands of people
joined in the impromptu protests after learning of Abiola's death.
	   Gunshots rang out in parts of the city, but it was unclear who
was shooting.
	   Two people were reportedly killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos. The deaths have not yet been independently confirmed.
	   Students in the southern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   A former backer of Nigeria's military regime who later ran on
his own for president on an anti-poverty platform, Abiola became a
hero of pro-democracy activists.
	   A U.S. State Department official said Abiola began coughing and
wheezing during a meeting with a delegation led by U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
	   Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early stages of their
meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting before he fell ill,
said Jim Callahan, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. officials
watched Nigerian doctors' last-ditch efforts to save Abiola's life
at a government clinic. Clinton expressed regret at the ``sudden
and untimely'' death.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the State Department said there was no reason to
believe that the death was not the result of natural causes.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions, but cast
doubt on the official explanation of his death.
	   His daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   Another daughter, Hafsat, said in an interview with CNN that the
timing was suspicious.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' she said. ``All of a sudden at the
eve of his release, he dies.''
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died last month of a heart attack.
	   Dissidents also have complained that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other diplomats refused to stand up for Abiola _ and said
the secretary-general pressured Abiola into renouncing his claim to
the presidency.
	   Annan also was criticized for not going to Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial center where much of the country's opposition movement
is centered. Annan did meet with opposition groups in Abuja, the
capital.
	   The U.S. delegation did not plan to visit Lagos either. The
delegation was to hold a small meeting with civilian leaders,
including some opposition figures, said Charles Patterson, the
principal officer at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja.
	   American-Nigerian relations have been poor in recent years,
particularly after Abacha executed playwright and pro-democracy
activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other people in November 1995.
	   But since taking power, the new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by releasing
some political prisoners and pledging that all eventually will be
freed.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''

	   ``The parties have committed to divesting MCI's Internet assets,
thus eliminating the overlap,'' the 20-member EU executive body
said in a statement.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States.
	   Their merger needed EU approval because the companies do
business in Europe. Under EU rules, the Commission checks all
mergers with a major impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc.
It can demand changes to, or veto, those it judges to infringe
European laws governing fair competition.
	   The alliance, proposed in November, continues a global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The EU authorities stressed they have cooperated closely with
the U.S. Department of Justice, which has yet to give its approval
to the planned merger.
	   The Commission added that the companies must seek the consent of
European and U.S. authorities to the proposed buyer of divested
activities.

Nicklaus' streak of consecutive majors to end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with more quotes, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus has pulled out of next week's
British Open, ending his streak of consecutive majors at 154.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors, also announced Wednesday that he
would not play in the PGA Championships.
	   Nicklaus, 58, has played in every major for which he's been
eligible since earning a spot in the 1957 U.S. Open. His most
recent major was last month's U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in San
Francisco.
	   ``After 42 years of playing major championship golf, I feel that
my ability to compete at the highest level on a continuous basis is
marginal at best,'' Nicklaus said in a statement. ``...I feel this
is the time to end my streak of consecutive majors, for which I
have been eligible, at 154.''
	   Nicklaus said he had planned to end the streak at this year's
Masters until the USGA gave him an exemption to play at the U.S.
Open.
	   ``I feel that the preparation time and physical demands which
are required to be competitive on a continuous basis are difficult
for me to satisfy at this time,'' he said. ``Therefore, I have
elected not to play in the British Open and PGA Championships in
1988.''
	   The statement was issued by Nicklaus' publicists in North Palm
Beach, Fla., and released at the Loch Lomond inivitational
tournament in Scotland.
	   The announcement came a week before the start of the British
Open at Royal Birkdale. Nicklaus, a three-time British Open
champion, had played in every British Open since 1962.
	   Nicklaus is playing this week at the Ford Seniors Players
Championship in Dearborn, Mich.
	   ``I didn't want to end the streak by having it said that Jack
Nicklaus could not longer play the game,'' he said. ``Instead, I
wanted to step back with the feeling that the competitive spirit
and ability still thrived within me. I wanted to end the streak on
my own terms.''
	   Nicklaus has made the cut in 130 of the 154 majors in which he's
played, including 10 of the last 12. He finished in a stirring
sixth-place tie at this year's Masters and was tied for 43rd at the
U.S. Open.
	   Nicklaus thanked his fans and supporters.
	   ``I did not wish to get to the point where I could not produce a
golf game and an effort that would warrant their loyalty,'' he
said. ``I certainly hope that, God willing, that I will play in
several major championships in the years to come.''
	   In addition to his British Open victories, Nicklaus has won the
Masters a record six times, the PGA Championship a record-tying
five times and the U.S. Open a record-tying four times. He has
lifetime exemptions for the Masters and PGA and an exemption into
the British Open until the age of 65.
	   Nicklaus' last major victory was at the 1986 Masters.
	   The next longest active streak in golf is Nick Faldo's 44
consecutive majors.

Saudis execute Indian convicted of murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ An Indian man convicted of murder
was beheaded in Saudi Arabia Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Noor Alem Ansari was found guilty of fatally hitting Mohammed
bin Naser al-Shahrani, a Saudi, on his head with an axe after an
argument, the ministry said in a statement.
	   The statement said Ansari was executed in the southern city of
Asir, but it did not say when or where the crime was committed.
	   His execution brings to 14 the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

North Korea quietly marks President Kim's death anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea quietly marked the fourth
anniversary Wednesday of the 1994 death of President Kim Il Sung,
without the massive rallies reported in previous years, South
Korean officials said.
	   Instead, the reclusive communist North was shifting attention
toward an anticipated ascension to full power by Kim Jong Il, the
late dictator's son and heir apparent, later this month, they said.
	   North Korea had previously staged massive memorial services and
rallies of party and military officials to mark the July 8
anniversary of the death of Kim Il Sung, who had ruled the country
for half a century as a virtual demigod.
	   This year, Kim Jong Il led a small group of army generals to
visit Pyongyang's Kumsusan Memorial Hall, where his father lies in
state. There were no other major ceremonies, South Korean monitors
said.
	   ``The massive mourning seems to be over. Instead, we see more
references to Kim Jong Il as new leader,'' said Moon Dae-kun, an
official at Seoul's Ministry of National Unification.
	   Since the father's death, the 56-year-old son has ruled the
country as top military commander and chief of the ruling Workers
Party. But he has yet to become president.
	   In the past month, hundreds of North Korean cities, counties and
military units have appealed to the younger Kim to become their
candidate in upcoming elections to choose deputies to the Supreme
People's Assembly, the North's rubber-stamp legislature.
	   The Assembly's major mission will likely be to elect Kim Jong Il
as president, thus completing the communist world's first
hereditary transfer of power, South Korean officials say.
	   North Korea elected 687 deputies to its single-chamber
parliament in 1990. A new election at the end of their four-year
term was canceled because of Kim Il Sung's death in 1994.
	   North Korea has since been operating without a legislative
body.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz flew back to
Turkey early Wednesday after a road accident involving his convoy
in Macedonia injured three members of his delegation.
	   Yilmaz and his Macedonian counterpart, Branko Crvenkovski, were
not injured.
	   The accident took place Tuesday near the town of Bitola, located
100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
A private car slammed into a vehicle that was part of the
motorcade, killing two Macedonians traveling in the private car.
	   A specially equipped plane carrying Yilmaz, State Minister Rustu
Kazim Yucelen and legislator Sinasi Altiner landed in the Turkish
capital of Istanbul Wednesday morning.
	   Yucelen and Altiner, who were injured in the car crash, were
transferred to a hospital. They were in stable condition, a doctor
told private NTV television.
	   Fikret Bila, a journalist with the daily Milliyet newspaper who
was also injured in the accident, remained in Macedonia and was
said to be in a serious condition after undergoing head surgery on
Tuesday, hospital authorities in Bitola said.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Britain's ambassador to Bahrain broke a
thigh bone when he tripped while undressing and had to undergo
surgery, an embassy spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Ian Lewty, 54, broke his left thigh bone on Saturday and
underwent a successful operation on Sunday at the Salmaniya
Hospital, spokeswoman Caroline Alcock said.
	   She did not give details except to say that Lewty tripped and
fell while undressing to go for a swim at his home.
	   The injury was serious, but Lewty has not seemed to be in much
pain since the operation, said Alcock, adding that he has been
receiving flowers, gifts and cards from well-wishers.
	   Lewty, who has been the ambassador to Bahrain for more than two
years, will remain in hospital for a few more days at least, said
Alcock.
	   She said the island's ruler, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa,
visited him on Monday.
	   Bahrain, which was once a British protectorate, has about 5,500
Britons living and working on the island.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators on Wednesday
conditionally approved the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S.
telecommunications groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom
Inc., pending the sale of MCI's Internet business.
	   Approval from the European Commission was seen as a formality
after the companies accepted the demand they divest overlapping
businesses, primarily the MCI's Internet interests.
	   ``The parties have committed to divesting MCI's Internet assets,
thus eliminating the overlap,'' the 20-member EU executive body
said in a statement.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States.
	   Their merger needed EU approval because the companies do
business in Europe. Under EU rules, the Commission checks all
mergers with a major impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc.
It can demand changes to, or veto, those it judges to infringe
European laws governing fair competition.
	   The alliance, proposed in November, continues a global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The EU authorities stressed they have cooperated closely with
the U.S. Department of Justice, which has yet to give its approval
to the planned merger.
	   The Commission added that the companies must seek the consent of
European and U.S. authorities to the proposed buyer of divested
activities.

Police arrest man on suspicion of arson attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police charged a farmer with trying to set
a brush fire Wednesday following a rash of more than 180 forest and
brush fires that swept the country, a fire department official
said.
	   Kleanthis Kapsianos, 34, was charged with a total of eight arson
blazes. Authorities believe he suffers from psychological problems.
	   It was not immediately clear if some of the alleged blazes
occurred during the past weekend, when dozens of homes and
thousands of acres (hectares) of forest were destroyed by
wind-driven fires. The blazes were blamed for at least two deaths.
	   Kapsianos was arrested while he was starting a fire in brush
land near the central village of Milies, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) northwest of Athens, authorities said.
	   Following the weekend fires, another person was charged with
arson for allegedly setting fire to dried grass. Three others face
charges of negligence for allegedly not containing fires.
	   More than two thirds of the blazes began within an hour of each
other on Saturday, leading to suspicions that they could have been
the result of an organized arson spree.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators conditionally
approved Wednesday the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S.
telecommunications groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom

	   Approval from the European Commission had been widely expected

Commission has therefore declared the concentration compatible with

	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. The merger
would be the second-richest in the telecommunications industry
after SBC Communications Inc.'s planned dlrs 60.1 billion purchase
of rival Baby Bell Ameritech Corp.
	   Their merger needed EU approval because the companies do

compliance with the undertakings,'' the statement said.

Philippine stocks slip on profit-taking; peso closes slightly
</HEADLINE>
higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were dragged lower
Wednesday by profit-taking in the absence of positive market-moving
developments, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, rose slightly against the U.S. dollar in
quiet trading.
	   The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index slipped 2.82
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,857.50, following its 5.93-point gain
Tuesday.
	   ``The sentiment right now is pretty negative. There aren't any
developments that could encourage buying interest,'' said Edwin
Siao, trader for institutional sales at Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Worrisome to investors was the inflation report released Monday,
which showed the country's inflation rate at 10.7 percent in June
compared with 10.3 percent in May, traders said.
	   Fears of a return to crony capitalism were also raised following
the re-election of tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco as chairman of food and
beverage conglomerate San Miguel Corp. on Tuesday, traders said.
	   Cojuangco returned to the post he held 12 years ago, when he was
booted out on government charges that he had gained control of San
Miguel through ill-gotten wealth and close ties with former
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   When Marcos was ousted, Cojuangco went with him to the United
States. His position as chairman of San Miguel was taken over by
Andres Soriano III, who resigned last week along with five other
board members.
	   San Miguel shares closed mixed Wednesday. The A shares, which
are reserved for local investors, rose 3.5 percent, while the B
shares, available to Filipinos and foreigners, fell 1.6 percent.
	   Siao said the market has repeatedly tried in past sessions to
stage a convincing rally, but this has always been overtaken by
stock market players eager to cash in on gains.
	   Investors aren't in a hurry to enter the market since economic
recovery both in the country and in Asia remains far off, traders
said.
	   In currency trading, participants continued to closely monitor
the Japanese yen, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.397 pesos for the day, up from 41.370
pesos Tuesday.
	   The dollar was last traded at 41.470 pesos, its high for the
day.
	   A relatively stable yen over the session helped underpin the
peso, which stayed in a tight range between 41.240 and 41.470
pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said there was little prospect of
meaningful gains in the peso as dollar inflows remain light and
concern mounts over the health of the domestic economy. A slowdown
in export growth is a particular point of concern, the trader said.

Private Israeli firms sell `security concept' to all buyers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bus screeches around the corner,
almost crashing into a middle-aged man in dark glasses yelling
orders to a commando team hidden behind an army tent.
	   Within seconds, the team has boarded the bus, disarmed the
``terrorists,'' saved the ``hostages'' and thrown in a smoke bomb
for good measure.
	   ``An environmentally friendly smoke bomb,'' notes the man in
glasses, coughing his way out of smoke range.
	   In real life, the hostages, terrorists and commando team are all
employees of the Silver Shadow company _ one of dozens of private
firms selling Israel's much-vaunted security expertise worldwide.
(If this had been an actual terrorist encounter _ rather than a
demonstration for the media _ the ringleader in the dark shades
would not have been in plain view.)
	   If a military or paramilitary unit in South America wants to
prepare itself for a hostage situation, a Silver Shadow team flies
in to train them. If an anti-government group in central Africa
wants to learn how to break into a prison, the Israelis will be
there too.
	   Silver Shadow is one of 120 firms displaying their wares this
week at a defense and security exhibition in Tel Aviv. Demand for
Israeli know-how is high _ some 1,500 visitors and buyers from more
than 30 countries are expected to attend.
	   The Israeli exhibitors are showing everything from personal
telephone scramblers to armor-piercing shells, bomb-sniffing robots
and mini-submarines.
	   While the Silver Shadow teams headed off to lunch, Amos Golan
lowered his shades and explained how he and his partner, Asaf
Nadel, created the company three years ago to sell what they call
``a security concept.''
	   Before founding the company, Golan worked for an anti-terrorist
army unit in the West Bank. Nadel worked for the Shin Bet, Israel's
renowned domestic security agency. Most, if not all, of Silver
Shadow's employees come straight from military combat units.
	   ``We will train any group how to combat terror. We have
experience, we have the knowledge, we have the newest methods, and
we care,'' Golan said as he unloaded a dozen mini-Uzis from the
back of his beat-up Chevrolet.
	   Israel's approximately 600 private security companies export
about dlrs 500 million worth of goods yearly, exhibition organizer
Zeev Omer said. That is about one-fourth of the total annual
exports of the country's three top defense contractors _ Israel
Military Industries, Israel Aircraft Industries and Rafael, which
account for dlrs 2 billion in exports.
	   Private Israeli security firms must get Defense Ministry
approval to sell weapons and training overseas. The ministry would
not respond to queries about its criteria for approving projects,
but Nadel said the ministry intervened only in cases where there
was concern the knowledge or arms might be used against Israel.
	   In any case, a global market and modern communications make it
easy for firms to get around any restrictions. While private
security firms won't reveal their client lists, some of their more
questionable activities have come to light in recent years.
	   Yair Klein, a lieutenant colonel in the army reserves who ran a
private security firm, was convicted by an Israeli court in 1991 of
illegally exporting military arms and information. The court did
not elaborate on the charges, but Colombian officials accused him
of arming and training drug traffickers. He denied all the charges.
	   Mike Harari, a former operative for Israel's Mossad spy agency,
was accused of providing bugging devices and weapons systems to
former Panamanian strongman Manual Noriega.
	   Other firms are suspected of training anti-government soldiers
in Zaire and Basque fighters in southern Spain.
	   ``When I was in the army, I fought to make sure the Palestinians
did not get their state,'' said one Silver Shadow employee,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But that was because that was
my job, not because I hate the Palestinians, or can't understand
their cause.
	   ``If people in Spain, or Africa or where have you want to fight
against the government ... and they are willing to pay, then those
people are freedom fighters in my eyes and I will do everything to
help them.''

Zubin Mehta, Zhang Yimou to stage Turandot in imperial palace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An extravagant opera production in September will
place Puccini's icy Chinese princess Turandot amid the golden roofs
of China's former imperial palace.
	   Conductor Zubin Mehta and Chinese film director Zhang Yimou will
stage the dlrs 15 million production in a quiet corner of the
Forbidden City, in a 500-year-old courtyard of a temple where the
emperors offered sacrifices to their ancestors.
	   The opera depicts a Chinese emperor's daughter who says any
suitor who solves three riddles may marry her, but those who fail
will be executed.
	   On Wednesday, the opera's producers described the difficulties
in placing Giacomo Puccini's last opera in the setting he imagined.
	   An acoustics engineer from the Vienna State Opera and the latest
equipment will be brought in so that the sound quality will be the
same as in a theater.
	   The outdoor setting is in front of the Imperial Ancestral
Temple, located east of the main tourist track through the palace.
The temple is part of the imperial compound that now is a park,
with centuries-old cypress trees, called the Working People's
Palace of Culture.
	   A hefty premium was paid to Lloyds of London to insure the
buildings, and the Chinese government was paid a substantial but
undisclosed rental for the ancient site.
	   All this makes the production the most expensive opera ever
staged, producer Michael Ecker said at a news conference.
	   Tickets for each of the eight 4,200-seat shows Sept. 5 through
13 range from dlrs 150 to dlrs 1,200, with higher rates for
corporate sponsorships.
	   Performers agreed to waive their fees for two shows so that
Chinese opera lovers who could not afford those prices could buy
tickets at 200 to 1,200 yuan (dlrs 24 to dlrs 120).
	   Casting plans include Sharon Sweet as Turandot, Barbara
Hendricks as the slave Liu and tenors Lando Bartolini, Kristjan
Johansson and Sergei Larin as Calaf.
	   Mehta is bringing the chorus and orchestra from the Florence
Opera House, where he is chief conductor. About two-thirds of the
cast of 1,000 _ dancers, members of a children's chorus and extras
_ will be Chinese.
	   Zhang, known for Oscar-nominated films such as ``Raise the Red
Lantern,'' said ``Turandot'' brings together ``people of different
countries in a real exchange and mutual understanding _ a spiritual
and emotional exchange.''
	   Mehta and Zhang worked together on ``Turandot'' once before,
last year in Florence.
	   ``We're both flexible to each other's wishes and in the end it
was a cooperation of great friendship,'' Mehta said, speaking via
televised conference call from Munich.
	   The Beijing ``Turandot'' will be an almost entirely new
production, with sets, costumes and choreography by Chinese
artists.
	   The idea of ``Turandot'' in its original setting took shape in
1994, when Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra visited
Beijing, said Chinese producer Zhang Yu.
	   Then it took several years of working to get approval from
Chinese authorities.

Presidents of Russia, Ukraine to meet in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and
Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine agreed to hold a ``broad-format'' summit
in September, officials said Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin and Kuchma spoke by telephone Wednesday and decided to
meet Sept. 18-19 in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the
Kremlin said in a statement.
	   Large delegations of Russian and Ukrainian government officials
and businessmen will accompany their presidents, officials said.
	   During a summit in February, the two leaders signed an ambitious
economic cooperation plan. Yeltsin said at the time that the
meeting left ``no unsettled problems'' between the two nations.
	   There have been frictions between the two Slavic nations in
recent years over issues such as control of the Black Sea naval
bases from the Soviet era, and Ukraine's natural gas debts to
Russia.
	   The two presidents had initially planned to hold informal talks
in June, but Yeltsin asked for a postponement due to Russia's
financial crisis.

Hyundai autoworkers threaten to strike again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Unionized workers at Hyundai Motor Co.
returned to work Wednesday after a two-day strike, but threatened
to walk out again next week unless the company cancels its plan to
lay off 4,830 workers.
	   Workers at South Korea's largest car maker said the company
should cancel the layoff plan by next Tuesday or the union will
begin another strike, jointly with a militant labor umbrella group.
	   The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, of which Hyundai is a
member, plans to organize a nationwide strike next Wednesday to
protest growing layoffs.
	   Claiming a membership of 500,000, the militant labor group
controls the nation's car, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   Hyundai announced plans in May to lay off nearly 9,000 workers.
It paid extra bonuses to shed about 4,000 workers in early
retirement.
	   Amid a sharp economic downtown, car sales have dropped 50
percent this year.
	   Hyundai, capable of producing 1.65 million cars a year, earlier
said that it was operating at 40 percent of its capacity because of
sluggish sales and had no other option but to lay off redundant
workers.
	   Workers rejected the notion, saying the company should cut work
hours rather than lay off workers. Hyundai's management rejected
the union's suggestion as a ``makeshift measure.''
	   Hyundai's two-day strike this week was its second walkout in a
week. The union staged a one-day strike last week.
	   A flexible labor market is a key condition of a record dlrs 58
billion bailout of the faltering South Korean economy by the
International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Layoffs have since been spreading as the Seoul government pushed
a restructuring of its economy. The development was shocking to
South Korean workers, accustomed to lifetime employment.
	   Government figures show that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the
end of the year.
	   Also Wednesday, unionized workers at 12 general hospitals in
Seoul and other major cities vowed to start strikes in the next
week in joint action for higher pay and other financial benefits.
	   Union workers at the Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul
said they will walk off jobs Thursday except for a few sections
including emergency and operating rooms.

 &UR; EU tells BA-American, Star Alliance to surrender airport slots
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU decision &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Airways and American Airlines
must shed 267 weekly take-off and landing slots at London airports
in return for European Union approval of their alliance, the EU's
top regulator said Wednesday.
	   EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert demanded the
companies to cut flights on some transatlantic routes to give other
airlines chance to compete.
	   Van Miert also announced a preliminary ruling on a rival
alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa, Scandinavian Air Services and
United Airlines. He said Lufthansa and its partners in the Star
Alliance must surrender 108 slots at Frankfurt and Copenhagen
airports.
	   If BA and American comply, they could be over the first
regulatory hurdle to the planned mega-alliance which competitors
have denounced as a menace to fair competition on air routes across
the Atlantic.
	   Van Miert told a news conference the EU Commission needed more
time to consider problems relating to ticketing arrangements with
travel agents and frequent flyer programs in the BA-American
alliance.

Philippines to lobby in ASEAN for drug-free Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will lobby for the
signing of a declaration on fighting illegal drugs in Southeast
Asia when foreign ministers of the region meet in Manila later this
month, a senior foreign affairs official said Wednesday.
	   The official, who asked not to be named, said the Philippines
will sponsor a joint declaration to be signed by the foreign
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during
their July 24-29 meeting.
	   The proposal seeks to ban the illicit production, processing,
trafficking and use of any prohibited drug in the region by 2020.

Prime minister says he wants permanent tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS comments from currency trader in graf 6, more
details from Hashimoto speech &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ His party's popularity flagging ahead of upcoming
elections, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto gave his first clear
indication Wednesday that he will seek permanent tax cuts to revive
Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   ``As part of permanent revisions of the tax system, I aim to
create a tax system that can receive the support of the people,''
Hashimoto said at a news conference while campaigning in the
central Japanese city of Nagoya.
	   Hashimoto gave few details, other than to say the cuts would
take effect next year.
	   He also said his governing Liberal Democratic Party would come
to a decision before the year's end about lowering corporate taxes.
	   The Japanese currency dropped almost a yen against the U.S.
dollar as traders expressed frustration at Hashimoto's failure to
offer a more specific plan.
	   ``Come on, let's get real,'' said Tony Coveney, treasury
director at N.M. Rothschild and Sons in London.
	   Earlier, Japan's major stock indexes had climbed in anticipation
of tax cut promises by Hashimoto, who spoke after the stock markets
closed.
	   The promise marks a change of direction for Hashimoto, who had
avoided taking a clear stand on permanent tax cuts, stressing
instead the need to rein in Japan's ballooning national deficit.
	   At times during the campaign, Hashimoto seemed to flip-flop on
tax policy, calling for ``permanent tax reforms'' and then
appearing to backtrack by saying those reforms wouldn't reduce the
nation's overall tax burden.
	   Analysts said Hashimoto's hand may have finally been forced as
opinion polls show his party unlikely to win a majority in upper
house elections on Sunday.
	   ``Domestic politics has taken over,'' said Gerard Lyons, chief
economist at DKB International in Tokyo.
	   Polls published Wednesday morning by major Japanese newspapers
showed the LDP as many as nine seats shy of the 69 it needs to gain
a majority.
	   They also show opposition parties such as the Japan Communist
Party likely to increase seats as they campaign on platforms
calling for sweeping tax cuts.
	   Japan has also come under increasing pressure abroad to pull its
economy out of recession to halt the yen's slide and help prop up
Asia's ailing economies.
	   Hashimoto said an LDP tax panel will meet July 16 to start
working out the details of the income tax cuts.
	   He denied speculation he would pay for the cuts by lowering the
minimum tax rate _ a politically unpopular step that would have
increased the tax burden for lower income earners.
	   Some economists have called on the LDP to adopt a reform of the
tax system that would pay for rate cuts for the wealthy by
increasing the number of Japanese who must pay taxes.
	   Japanese currently are not required to pay income tax unless
they earn more than 3.6 million yen (about dlrs 25,000) per year.

	   ``We have not solved all the problems, but lots and frequencies
have been decided now by the Commission,'' Van Miert said.
	   However the final go-ahead for the BA-American pact could still
be months away and will eventually need approval from national
regulators in Britain and the United States.
	   Britain's Department of Trade and Industry on Wednesday
``signaled conditional approval'' to the linkup, according to
spokesman Colin Seabrook.
	   After the provisional rulings, the airlines and their
competitors will be able to submit opinions over the summer, which
could lead to a definitive ruling from the Commission, the EU's
20-member executive body, in the Autumn.
	   U.S. authorities are making approval contingent on Britain
negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United States that
would end current restrictions that allow only four airlines - BA,
American, United and Virgin Atlantic to fly to the United States
from London's Heathrow airport.

World Cup: Mourning after, a black mood envelopes orange Holland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMS101 &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ For a month, the Dutch painted the
town orange. But overnight, the national mood has faded to black,
and a hangover has swallowed up the high.
	   With the World Cup hopes of its dream team suddenly dashed, the
Netherlands awoke Wednesday gruff and groggy, doing what it could
to piece together some pride after losing to Brazil in a
nail-biting semifinal.
	   Barkeeps swept up orange confetti and peeled beer-soaked orange
cocktail napkins from sidewalks, contemplating how a tiny twist of
events Tuesday night might have taken Holland to the final for the
first time in 20 years.
	   Instead, the Dutch are down and out. Brazil won 4-2 on a penalty
shootout after a 1-1 tie in regulation play and overtime, advancing
to Sunday's final to face the winner of Wednesday night's match
between France and Croatia. The Dutch have to settle for the
third-place match Saturday against the loser of the France-Croatia
semifinal Wednesday night.
	   ``Silence. A Fog Hangs Over the Living Room,'' read a front-page
headline in the daily De Volkskrant.
	   ``It will take me years to recover,'' muttered Remco Zannis, an
Amsterdammer aimlessly wandering the streets of the Dutch capital
after the fateful match.
	   To call the Dutch soccer-crazy doesn't even come close to
reality. This is a nation obsessed, and the grace and power of the
Orangemen as they steadily advanced toward the Holy Grail had
captured the country's imagination.
	   From the beer-bellied port workers of Rotterdam to the
ruddy-faced farmers in Friesland, more than 11 million Dutchmen
tuned in to watch Tuesday's semifinal. Traffic, typically bumper to
bumper in this crowded land of 15 million, was practically
nonexistent for a couple of hours every time the Dutch played.
	   Orange, the national color, was everywhere.
	   Briefcase-toting businessmen rode the trains to work wearing
ridiculous orange wigs and goofy grins. The truly die-hard dyed
hair, mustaches, beards, even eyebrows Day-Glo orange. Long strings
of triangular orange flags fluttered outside homes, offices and
factories.
	   On Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square, soccer balls dangled
like Christmas ornaments from trees wrapped in orange plastic, and
fountains spewed orange-colored water.
	   In the southern city of Tilburg, one farmer even painted the
cows in his field orange.
	   That party atmosphere has gone from gay to gray. The drinking
songs have faded, now that the Cup has slipped from Holland's
hands.
	   ``What can you do? What can I say?,'' a listless Jeroen
Oudshoorn said from behind the counter of his Amsterdam sporting
goods store, throwing up his hands.
	   ``We played very well, but we didn't have luck. We did the best
we could.''
	   As the Dutch set about shaking off their depression and looking
ahead to Saturday's consolation match, they could at least take
some comfort in an amusingly timed business development.
	   The biggest Dutch bank, ABN Amro, announced Wednesday it's
taking over Brazil's No. 4 bank, Banco Real, for dlrs 2.1 billion
in cash.

Palestinians ask Turkey to pressure Israel over Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders told visiting Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on Wednesday that his country's close
ties with Israel are hurting the Palestinians.
	   Cem rejected the complaints, saying Turkey was in a unique
position to play a positive role in the Mideast conflict because of
its good relations with Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Cem spoke to reporters after meetings with the top PLO official
in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, and Palestinian legislators, at
Islam's third holiest shrine, the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Cem,
a Muslim, toured the compound, but did not pray.
	   In recent years, Israel and Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, have stepped up their military cooperation, much to the
dismay of Israel's Arab neighbors, especially Syria.
	   In Wednesday's meeting, the Palestinian delegation told Cem that
the strong bilateral ties give Israel the political maneuvering
room to carry out policies they say are aimed at limiting the
number of Arab residents in disputed Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians have long complained that Israel's demolition of
Arab homes built without a license, the revocation of the residency
permits of hundreds of Palestinians and other measures are used as
tools of population control.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
Jerusalem has 420,000 Jewish and 180,000 Arab residents.
	   ``We told them (the Turks) that the more they strengthen their
relations (with Israel), the more Israel takes advantage of that to
impose a new status quo in Jerusalem,'' said Palestinian legislator
Hatem Abdel Qader after the meeting with Cem , which lasted a
little under an hour.
	   ``We asked that they not be satisfied with a declaration of
intentions by Israel, but pressure Israel because it is taking
advantage of its good relations with Turkey to impose a status quo
in Jerusalem,'' Abdel Qader said.
	   The Palestinians were told they had no reason to worry, Abdel
Qader said. ``They (the Turks) told us that Turkey's relationship
with Israel does not hurt the Palestinians,'' he said.
	   Cem told reporters that his country was in a good position to
try and mediate in the conflict.
	   ``We are one of the rare countries that have good relations with
both sides involved in these problems,'' he said.
	   ``Turkey has and will have a more enhanced role in being a
positive factor, a factor for peace and understanding in some very
intricate problems which are not only problems for this certain
geography but which are problems that my government and my people
are very sensitive to,'' he said.
	   After the Jerusalem meeting, Cem held talks in the West Bank
town of Ramallah with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat.

BRUSSELS: Heathrow airport.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines complained the alliance would control 60
percent of the traffic between Britain and United States, squeeze
competitors out of the skies and push up prices for transatlantic
travelers.
	   To prevent that, the EU is expected to order the companies to
scale back frequencies on flights between London and Chicago,
Dallas and Miami.
	   BA-American ``will be obliged to reduced their combined number
of weekly frequencies, if so requested by a competitor during a
period of six months,'' said a Commission statement.
	   Van Miert said Tuesday BA and American will have to relinquish
up to 267 of around 700 weekly take off and landing slots at
London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports, if so requested by
competitors.
	   ``The slots are to be given up without compensation,'' the
statement added.
	   Wednesday's ruling is expected to spark a lobbying campaign from
the airlines concerned to secure fewer slot reductions, while their
rivals press for yet tougher conditions.

Philippine government eyeing Marcos money to reduce deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will renew
efforts to recover more than half a billion dollars from Swiss bank
accounts belonging to the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to help
reduce its growing budget deficit, officials said Wednesday.
	   The money, frozen since 1986 when Marcos was toppled in a
``people power'' revolt, was transferred earlier this year from
Switzerland to an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   Felix de Guzman, the newly appointed head of the agency in
charge of recovering Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth, said the
agency's goal under the administration of new President Joseph
Estrada is the ``speedy disposition'' of government cases against
the Marcos family and their associates for immediate recovery of
their assets.
	   ``My role is to speed up the recovery of the wealth because ...
we have a deficiency in the budget,'' said de Guzman, chairman of
the Presidential Commission on Good Government.
	   The budget deficit amounted to 15.4 billion pesos (dlrs 375
million) for the first five months this year and is expected to
reach 30 billion pesos (dlrs 732 million) by the end of 1998.
	   The government hopes to win a forfeiture and confiscation case
it has filed against Marcos' widow, Imelda, to acquire the Swiss
deposits. Another possible way to get the money is through an
out-of-court settlement between the government and the Marcos
family.
	   But getting the money, the subject of legal battles for the past
12 years, will not be easy.
	   The government has been barred by the Philippine Supreme Court
from entering into a deal with the Marcoses to divide the money.
	   It also must settle the claims of 9,539 Filipinos who were
awarded dlrs 2 billion from the Marcos estate in a class action
suit for human rights violations during the Marcos administration.
	   The Swiss court order transferring the money to Manila says the
Philippine government can take possession of it only if the human
rights victims receive fair compensation and Mrs. Marcos is
convicted of wrongdoing in connection with the money.
	   De Guzman said he will ``examine the merits'' of an aborted 1993
agreement with the Marcos family to divide the money 75-25 in favor
of the government in exchange for dropping all charges against
them.
	   He said that if the government decides to negotiate a
settlement, it will ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its
decision against an agreement with the Marcoses.
	   Even if the government finally gets the money, a law specifies
that it must be spent to fund a land reform program.
	   ``If it is deviated to some other purposes there may be a need
for a law,'' de Guzman said.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The family of Nigerian opposition leader
Moshood Abiola is refusing to accept the official version of his
sudden death _ a heart attack _ saying the timing was ``too
convenient.'' Grief and anger swept across the country Wednesday as
news of the death of Abiola, a potent symbol of reform for
Nigeria's poor masses, spread among his supporters. In the
commercial capital of Lagos, thousands of youths and students
staged tumultuous demonstrations along busy streets, setting tires
on fire and throwing stones. Two people were reportedly killed
during the protests, though the deaths have not been independently
confirmed. (NIGERIA-ABIOLA)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Belfast drivers made their way
to work Wednesday along roads strewn with burned-out cars and
rioters' rubble after a third night of Protestant violence over
restrictions on an Orange Order parade. Leaders of Northern
Ireland's 80,000-member Protestant brotherhood have vowed to stand
their ground at an Anglican church outside Portadown, 30 miles (50
kms) southwest of Belfast, until British authorities let them march
as usual down nearby Garvaghy Road past the town's main Catholic
enclave. Protesters there first tried to block the annual march in
1995. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ As diplomats from six countries gathered
Wednesday to review options for stopping the violence in Serbia's
Kosovo province, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said a
Western military intervention could not be ruled out. Economic
sanctions imposed last month to pressure Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the conflict with ethnic Albanian
separatists have failed to stop the fighting in Kosovo, Kinkel told
German television. (GERMANY-KOSOVO CONTACT GROUP)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Intensified fighting between ethnic
Albanian militants and Serb forces in Kosovo has put increased
pressure on officials from six countries who are meeting Wednesday
to try to negotiate a solution for the troubled province. Serb
forces shelled four villages Tuesday near the southern town of
Djakovica, ethnic Albanian sources said. Serb sources, meanwhile,
said insurgents withdrew from a village near Pec where two
policemen were killed the previous day. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain plans to slash it's nuclear deterrent in
half and sell off 20 percent of its stocks of missiles, ammunition,
land and other defense assets over the next three years, The Times
said Wednesday. The Times and The Daily Telegraph said the plans
for the 2.2 billion pound (dlrs 3.6 billion) sell-off are part of a
package of proposals to reorganize Britain's armed forces that were
leaked to them on the eve of the government's announcement to
Parliament on Wednesday. Leaders of the opposition Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties condemned the leaks and demanded an
investigation. Defense Secretary George Robertson, who called the
leak ``grossly improper,'' said Wednesday morning that the
``severest action'' would be taken against the person responsible.
(BRITAIN-DEFENSE CUTS)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Union leaders hinted strikers would
take more bold action Wednesday to cap the biggest labor protest in
the history of Puerto Rico. Tens of thousands of protesters began a
48-hour general strike against the sale of the state telephone
company Tuesday by dramatically blocking a main highway and its
entry to San Juan's international airport with hundreds of cars.

EU tells BA-American, Star Alliance to surrender airport slots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with EU decision announced &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Airways and American Airlines
must shed 267 weekly take-off and landing slots at London airports
in return for European Union approval of their alliance, the EU's
top regulator said Wednesday.
	   EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert demanded the
companies to cut flights on some transatlantic routes to give other
airlines chance to compete.
	   Van Miert also announced a preliminary ruling on a rival
alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa, Scandinavian Air Services and
United Airlines of the United States. He said Lufthansa and its
partners in the Star Alliance must surrender 108 slots at Frankfurt
and Copenhagen airports.
	   If BA and American comply, they could be over the first
regulatory hurdle to the planned mega-alliance that competitors
have denounced as a menace to fair competition on air routes across
the Atlantic.
	   Van Miert said at a news conference that the EU Commission
needed more time to consider problems relating to ticketing
arrangements with travel agents and frequent flyer programs in the
BA-American alliance.
	   ``We have not solved all the problems, but lots and frequencies
have been decided now by the Commission,'' Van Miert said.
	   However, final approval for the BA-American pact could still be
months away and will eventually need approval from national
regulators in Britain and the United States.
	   Britain's Department of Trade and Industry on Wednesday
``signaled conditional approval'' to the linkup, spokesman Colin
Seabrook said.
	   After the provisional rulings, the airlines and their
competitors will be able to submit opinions over the summer, which
could lead to a definitive ruling from the Commission, the EU's
20-member executive body, in the fall.
	   U.S. authorities have said their approval will be contingent on
Britain negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United
States that would end current restrictions that allow only four
airlines - BA, American, United and Virgin Atlantic to fly to the
United States from London's Heathrow airport.
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines complained that the alliance would control
60 percent of the traffic between Britain and United States,
squeeze out competitors and push up prices.
	   To prevent that, the EU is expected to order the companies to
scale back frequencies on flights between London and Chicago,
Dallas and Miami.
	   Van Miert said Tuesday that BA and American will have to
relinquish up to 267 of around 700 weekly take off and landing
slots at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports, if so requested by
competitors.
	   ``The slots are to be given up without compensation,'' according
to a statement by the Commission.

Study: Singapore Internet buying may quadruple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The number of Singaporeans who buy something
over the Internet may quadruple in the next six months, a survey
released Wednesday by the National Computer Board showed.
	   The study said that about 2 percent of Singaporeans between 18
and 55 years old, or about 40,000 people, have bought via the
Internet over the past year.
	   After polling a group of 1,500 adults, the pollsters concluded
that the number of cyber buyers could rise to 177,000 by the end of
the year, or to 8 percent of Singapore's adult population.
	   The survey showed that almost one-third of adults in this
high-tech island republic of 3.1 million have used the Internet.
The most frequently used function was electronic mail and
information retrieval.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new wave of labor protests gained momentum
Wednesday as defense workers demonstrated in several Russian cities
and coal miners halted traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway for
the sixth straight day.
	   Labor protests that shook Russia in May have been on the
increase again as coal miners and other workers demand back wages
that are months overdue. The miners and others say the government
has failed to come up with the money that was promised two months
ago.
	   In Moscow, several hundred defense industry workers representing
more than 20 regions held a rally in front of the Defense Ministry
to call overdue wages. The marchers also demanded President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Mikhailov met the protesters and
acknowledged that the government's debt defense workers stood at
some 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs 400 million). He pledged to resolve
it in the ``near future,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Defense workers also held rallies in several other cities,
including the eastern port of Vladivostok, where several thousand
protesters criticized authorities for failing to pay workers. Some
demonstrators said they have been owed money for up to 20 months.

Report: Economic downturn caused increase in corruption cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An economic slump is partly to blame for an
increase in corruption cases reported in the first half of this
year, Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency said Wednesday.
	   Together with better surveillance and enforcement, economic
problems accounted for a 24 percent increase, the Independent
Commission Against Corruption said in a statement.
	   Hong Kong watches corruption levels carefully, anxious to keep
its reputation as one of the cleanest places to do business in
Asia. After the handover to Chinese rule last July 1, authorities
were particularly intent on keeping Hong Kong free of
mainland-style graft and corruption.
	   Corruption reports numbered 1,780 for the first half of this
year, compared to 1,435 for the same period last year, the
statement said.
	   Most of the corruption reports came from the private sector,
with 909 cases compared to 735 last year. The areas that registered
most increases included building management, trade, transportation
services, catering and entertaining services, and finance and
insurance sectors, the commission said.
	   With unemployment at a 15-year high of 4.2 percent and Hong Kong
entering recession, it said company closures and bankruptcies
``have resulted in more suspected corruption and fraud cases.''
	   ``Management and staff appeared to be much more prepared to
report corruption in order to protect their own interests as
profits dwindled,'' the statement added.
	   Reports of police corruption increased from 243 to 295,
including alleged bribes-for-promotion and police protection
rackets. A total of 101 cases of corruption in government were
reported.
	   The anti-corruption commission was set up after rampant
corruption in the police force led to high-level arrests in the
1970s.

World Cup: Sports marketing giant to take over French arm in wake
</HEADLINE>
of ticket scandal &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The marketing consultant for FIFA said Wednesday it
would take control of a French subsidiary involved in a World Cup
ticket scandal.
	   ISL Worldwide of Switzerland will buy out the remaining 51
percent of ISL Marketing France and assume day-to-day management of
the Paris-based company, according to Glen Kirton, senior vice
president of the international firm.
	   Kirton said the action was a direct response to the scandal, in
which three people, including the president of ISL France, were
arrested in connection with alleged ticket fraud. The World Cup
organizing committee also has filed a formal complaint with
prosecutors against the French branch of ISL.
	   ISL Worldwide, which has handled international marketing for
FIFA since 1982, contends it was victimized by a consultant who
fraudently sold thousands of tickets to which he had no access.
	   Taking direct control of ISL France was the fastest way to limit
damage to the international firm's reputation and make sure that
both companies shared more than just a name, Kirton said.
	   ``We allowed ISL France to use the ISL title totally because of
the World Cup,'' Kirton said. ``We have looked closely at the
workings of the company and there is no doubt in our minds that the
business is legitimate.
	   ``We now move to take full responsibility of the management of
the company by acquiring the remaining 51 percent. We will assume
the legitimate business concerns to make sure the goals of ISL
Worldwide are reflected in the management of the company.''
	   ISL is one of the pioneers of international sports marketing
with a reputation for high- quality programs. It just signed a new
contract to continue as FIFA's marketing pipeline through the 2006
World Cup, and will take over new responsibilities and powers, such
as television production and Internet services.
	   The case involving ISL France was one of a number of ticket
scandals to hit the tournament and perhaps the most embarrassing to
FIFA because of the ties with the international company.
	   ISL Worldwide never has been linked to any of the ticket
problems and has repeatedly stressed that it was not involved in
ticket distribution except for the 180,000 tickets that went to
FIFA's 12 worldwide sponsors as part of their contracts.
	   Kirton said that represented 8 percent of total tickets
available and that the sponsors used a majority of the tickets in
promotions.
	   He also said the percentage would remain roughly the same for
the 2002 World Cup, which will be held in Japan and South Korea.

Lack of birth certificate jinxes a third of world's children
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conference, SUBS graf on 1989 convention to
give exact number of countries that have ratified it; trims
slightly &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One-third of the world's children are jinxed at
birth because they aren't officially registered, the U.N.
children's agency said Wednesday in its annual report.
	   Without proof of birth, some 40 million children born each year
often can't enter school, receive health care or immunizations, get
married, own land, vote or obtain a passport, the report said.
	   Almost all these children are from developing countries, where
75 percent of the world's children live, and in many instances they
are ``the most marginalized, the most forgotten,'' UNICEF Executive
Director Carol Bellamy said at a news conference launching the
report.
	   The report said the absence of an official certificate is
especially serious for children displaced by war, famine or natural
disaster.
	   A birth certificate is a child's first right _ the right to an
official identity and nationality guaranteed in the 1989 Convention
on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF says. The convention has been
ratified by 191 countries, but not by Somalia and the United
States.
	   Bellamy said all the countries that have ratified the convention
are legally and morally obligated to register children, ``yet
dozens of countries are not in compliance.''
	   ``Not having a birth certificate means that a child is rendered
effectively invisible to the state. In many matters, it can be the
funtional equivalent of having never been born,'' she said.
	   Without a birth certificate, a child cannot receive health care
in more than 30 countries or be legally vaccinated in at least 20
countries, UNICEF said. Most countries demand to see a birth
certificate before enrolling a child in school.
	   Proof of birth can protect children _ for example, proving that
a boy is ineligible for military service or a girl is too young to
go to work, it said.
	   Some countries haven't even established a mandatory birth
registration system, among them Afghanistan, Cambodia, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Namibia and Oman. And 22 nations have no available data
on birth registration, UNICEF said.
	   According to the report, a country's birth registration system
may fail to function for all its people by accident or design.
	   In Myanmar, for example, full citizenship is granted only to
people who can prove continuous residence and no intermarriage back
to their great-grandfathers.
	   Poor and rural countries tend to have lower rates: Sierra Leone
has a birth registration rate of less than 10 percent, Zimbabwe
registers about one-third of births, and Bolivia about a half,
UNICEF said.
	   Yet eight countries facing economic difficulties manage to
register at least 90 percent of births _ Armenia, Azerbaijan,
China, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan,
the report said.
	   The report, The Progress of Nations 1998, also hailed the
dramatic increase in the percentage of infants vaccinated against
six major child-killing diseases _ 80 percent today compared with 5
percent in 1980.
	   New vaccines will be capable of saving up to 8 million more
lives a year, but UNICEF said a lack of commitment by donors and
governments of developing countries _ mainly because of the dlrs
700 million annual cost _ could preclude these vaccines getting to
those youngsters most in need.
	   And it asked: ``Could the reason be that these 8 million are,
overwhelmingly, the unseen, unheard children of the poor?''

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ One day after the death of Nigeria's most
prominent political prisoner, protests erupted Wednesday in the
southern city of Lagos, where police used tear gas to disperse
angry demonstrators.
	   A human rights group, meanwhile, said the country's military
leadership was warned of Moshood Abiola's frail health just weeks
before his death.
	   Abiola _ imprisoned for four years _ died Tuesday after suddenly
becoming ill during a meeting with visiting U.S. diplomats. He was
60.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' said Dr.
Charles Clements in a June 22 letter sent to Nigeria's new military
leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, youths and student groups
staged marches and noisy demonstrations along some busy streets.
Stacks of old tires were set ablaze on the roads, where motorists
turned and fled the area. Other parts of the city remained quiet.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests. Abiola was enormously popular in the south,
where a growing number of people are blaming the military for his
death.
	   Gunshots rang out in parts of the city overnight, but it was
unclear who was shooting.
	   Two people were reportedly killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos. The deaths have not yet been independently confirmed.
	   Students in the southern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   Although Abiola was just days away from being released by
Abubakar, Nigeria's ruling military junta failed to act on the
medical advice.
	   Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote to
Abubakar to appeal for Abiola's release on medical grounds.
	   Abiola's death is the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, but the government said
it also ordered an autopsy. It was unclear who would conduct it.
	   A funeral was scheduled later in the day Wednesday.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, said he was unable to
participate in the autopsy and called for physicians from Britain
and Canada to take part.
	   ``This is not something I can take part in, at least for now,
and we are contacting the Commonwealth Medical Association to be
involved in the any autopsy,'' Falomo said.
	   His death came just as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.

Russia hopes to get IMF loan soon to stabilize markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 5-7 with stock market down 3 percent at midday
Wednesday, DELETES outdated material in last two grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is moving closer to a multi-billion-dollar
loan package from the International Monetary Fund aimed at
stabilizing the country's sinking financial markets, a top official
said.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to international
lenders, said the two sides hope to work out the details of a dlrs
10 billion to dlrs 15 billion loan in meetings this week and next.
	   ``We have reached a mutual understanding with our partners,''
Chubais told journalists Tuesday after a meeting with the Moscow
representatives of the IMF and the World Bank.
	   ``We wanted to resolve all principal issues in a tight time
frame, by the end of the week, and spend the next week on working
out practical problems,'' he said. The next meeting is scheduled
for Thursday.
	   Many economists say the loan is essential to restore confidence
to Russia's faltering markets and halt the exodus of foreign
investors. The Russian stock market, which has lost more than half
its value this year, was down 5 percent on Tuesday and was off
another 3 percent by midday Wednesday.
	   Yuri Timoschenko, a trader at CentreInvest Securities, said the
market was expected to continue falling about 3 to 5 percent daily
until there were positive developments, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   The market turmoil has not yet had much of an impact on ordinary
Russians.
	   However, the Russian ruble is under pressure as well, and a
devaluation would result in price hikes that would inflict
additional pain on all Russians. A new IMF loan would help ease the
pressure on the ruble.
	   Russia's financial markets have suffered several simultaneous
blows _ the government's shaky finances, a drop in revenues from
oil exports, and a loss of investor confidence brought on by the
Asian economic crisis.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's administration also has presented an
economic stabilization package to parliament that includes more
than 20 proposals, most aimed at streamlining the country's
complicated tax system.
	   However, parliament's lower house has so given only tentative
approval to a handful of measures, and is not scheduled to meet
again until July 15.
	   Martin Gilman, the IMF's chief representative in Moscow, said
additional aid to Russia would depend on the implementation of the
government's stabilization package.
	   If the government's economic program becomes bogged down in the
State Duma, parliament's lower house, President Boris Yeltsin may
sign many of bills into law in the form of decrees.
	   ``There is understanding for Russia's tough position, but one
can't just lose heart, and the actions of the government must
stimulate growth,'' Chubais said.

Indonesian Foreign Minister rejects referendum in disputed East
</HEADLINE>
Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Indonesia's Foreign Minister has ruled
out Portugal's proposal for a referendum in East Timor as a way of
resolving Lisbon and Jakarta's 23-year-old dispute over the
half-island territory.
	   Indonesia is ready to grant a large degree of autonomy to East
Timor, which it invaded and then annexed following the 1975
departure of Portugal's colonial administration, Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas was quoted as saying in a Portuguese newspaper interview
published Wednesday.
	   However, a referendum ``would not be realistic,'' Alatas told
the daily Diario de Noticias.
	   He said a referendum on the territory's future would trigger
``disturbances and fighting'' between East Timorese who favor
integration with Indonesia and those who want full independence.
	   ``A referendum would open old wounds,'' Alatas was quoted as
saying.
	   Indonesian forces have been widely accused of human rights
abuses in trying to contain opposition to their rule over the past
two decades in East Timor.
	   Pro-independence activists, meanwhile, have stepped up their
campaigning in the wake of the resignation in May of President
Suharto, who sent troops to invade the territory in 1975.
	   Alatas said the proposed autonomy, which would encompass all
areas of policy except defense, taxation and foreign relations, is
the ``most realistic, feasible and possible compromise for a final
solution to the East Timor problem.''
	   Portugal has insisted that a referendum under United Nations
auspices should be held in East Timor to decide the territory's
future. The U.N. has been brokering talks between Lisbon and
Jakarta.
	   There was no immediate reaction to Alatas' comments from the
Portuguese government.
	   In the interview, Alatas said jailed East Timorese guerilla
leader Xanana Gusmao, currently serving a 20-year sentence, would
be released ``within days'' as part of a reform program pledged by
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie.
	   However, Alatas told Portuguese television Tuesday night that
Gusmao would not be granted early release.
	   A popular and charismatic figure among pro-independence
activists, Gusmao led a small band of guerillas who stage sporadic
hit-and-run attacks on Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor.

EU tells BA-American, Star Alliance to surrender airport slots

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Airways and American Airlines
must shed 267 weekly take-off and landing slots at London airports
in return for European Union approval of their alliance, the EU's
top regulator said Wednesday.
	   EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert also demanded the
companies cut the frequencies of their flights from London to
Dallas, Miami and Chicago, if requested by competitors in the six
months after the alliance is launched.
	   Van Miert also announced a preliminary ruling on a rival
alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa, Scandinavian Air Services and
United Airlines. He said Lufthansa and its partners in the Star
Alliance must surrender 108 slots at Frankfurt and Copenhagen
airports.
	   If BA and American comply, they could be over the first
regulatory hurdle to the planned mega-alliance which competitors
have denounced as a menace to fair competition on air routes across
the Atlantic.
	   British Airways Chief Executive, Bob Ayling, called decision
``positive news'' adding he is ``now even more hopeful that
regulatory approval will be given.''
	   But Ayling said he was unhappy that regulators want the alliance
to give up so much.
	   ``Some of the terms being suggested by Brussels are too harsh,
and would penalize the airline and Britain unfairly,'' Ayling said
in a statement.
	   ``Every lost slot means lost flights, lost business, lost
service for customers. Every lost slot means 30 jobs we cannot
create.''
	   Van Miert told a news conference the EU Commission needed more
time to consider other problems relating to ticketing arrangements
with travel agents and frequent flyer programs under the
BA-American alliance.
	   ``We have not solved all the problems, but slots and frequencies
have been decided now by the Commission,'' Van Miert said.
	   However the final go-ahead for the BA-American pact could still
be months away and will eventually need approval from national
regulators in Britain and the United States.
	   Britain's trade secretary, Margaret Beckett, said she intends to
approve the alliance, if measures are taken to ensure fair
competition on transatlantic routes into London.
	   Beckett said Britain's stance will be compatible with the EU
decision.
	   The airlines and their competitors will be able to submit
opinions on the provisional rulings over the summer, which could
lead to a definitive ruling from the Commission, the EU's 20-member
executive body, in the Autumn.
	   U.S. authorities are making approval contingent on Britain
negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United States.
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines complained the alliance would control 60
percent of the traffic between Britain and United States, squeeze
competitors out of the skies and push up prices for transatlantic
travelers.
	   To prevent that, Van Miert said BA and American will have to
relinquish up to 267 of around 700 weekly take off and landing
slots at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports, if so requested by
competitors.
	   ``The slots are to be given up without compensation,'' the
statement added.
	   The EU said it expected to rule by the end of the year on two
other transatlantic airline alliances, one between Northwest and
KLM, the othe other involving Delta, Sabena, Austrian Airlines and
Swissair.

World Cup: Police to let fans celebrate in hoped-for moment of
</HEADLINE>
glory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police are promising to cut fans some
slack if Croatia beats France on Wednesday for a place in the World
Cup finals, intervening only if celebrations threaten lives and
property.
	   Tens of thousands of Croats are expected to watch the semifinal
contest on giant TV screens set up in the capital's parks and
squares. Few restaurants, cafes and bars are without a television
set.
	   The winner faces four-time World champion Brazil on Sunday. The
loser will have to settle for the third-place match Saturday
against the Netherlands.
	   ``Until now, police have not and will not act to spoil the
spontaneous festivities,'' Zagreb's police chief, Ivan Stanko,
said.
	   Many Croats still view police with fear and apprehension _ a
legacy of the country's years of Communist rule when it was part of
Yugoslavia.
	   But Stanko says he wants to change that image. And after
Croatia's remarkable success _ including its 3-0 upset of
powerhouse Germany _ even the police have caught World Cup fever.
	   If things go well for the Croats on Wednesday, Stanko said, ``we
will join in on the celebrations, too, but in a manner still
befitting enforcers of the law.''
	   Stanko said he has told police to intervene in celebrations only
if lives and property are seriously endangered.
	   Nevertheless, police will be out in force at key intersections
and city squares, just in case.
	   One person died and more than 40 were injured in Saturday's
nationwide delirium which exploded in the wake of the victory over
Germany. Scores of windows were smashed in shops, cars and street
cars.
	   According to a newspaper poll, 95 percent of the 4.8 million
Croats watched the quarterfinal match, one of the country's finest
moments since it gained independence in 1991. The margin of error
was not given.

Belarus backs off from ultimatum to ambassadors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus, which is locked in a diplomatic
dispute with several nations, backed off slightly Wednesday from a
threat to seize the home furnishings of foreign ambassadors.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it had relaxed a deadline for
ambassadors from the United States and other countries to move
their belongings out of a diplomatic compound on the outskirts of
Minsk, the capital.
	   Nine countries have recalled their ambassadors from Belarus to
protest a government order saying that they must temporarily move
out of their homes.
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the Drozdy compound. The ambassadors say Belarus has no
right to force them out for any reason.
	   Belarus had told foreign embassies that they needed to move all
their furnishings out by Wednesday or it would seize them. But at
the last moment, it relented a bit.
	   ``There will be no 11 a.m. deadline today,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Igor Poluyan said. ``But we'll ask them to move whenever
the need arises, when we'll need to carry out repairs in this or
that residence.''
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all left Minsk in
protest over the conflict.

Asian stock markets generally close slightly higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets generally closed slightly
higher Wednesday, with share prices in Tokyo climbing on
strengthening hopes the government would adopt permanent tax cuts
to revive Japan's economy.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 114.69 points, or
0.70 percent, closing at 16,530.97.
	   Investors were expecting Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to
announce plans for permanent tax cuts after his governing party,
worried about parliamentary upper house elections Sunday, was
reported in agreement that it needed to clarify its intentions.
	   After the market closed, Hashimoto gave his first clear
indication that he will seek permanent tax cuts, but offered few
details, other than to say the cuts would take effect next year.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was trading at 139.04 yen in
Tokyo late Wednesday, down 0.79 yen from late Tuesday.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed slightly higher on recent lower
interest rates and the yen's rise against the dollar.
	   The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index ended at 318.79,
up 1.29 points. Trading was active at 85.4 million shares.
	   Analysts said the index gave up much of its early gains as
investors took profits on recent rises.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished sharply lower on
continued worries over the country's weak currency and its economic
problems. The Composite Index was down 12.27 points, or 2.6
percent, closing at 455.28.
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended marginally higher as investors
waited to see the outcome of government plans to ease tight
liquidity in the economy. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index
gained 1.15 points, closing at 273.43.
	   JAKARTA: A rush of profit-taking sent share prices lower as
local investors cashed in on short-term gains. The JSX index closed
10.965 points lower at 472.980.
	   HONG KONG: Stocks closed higher, with investors encouraged by
easing local interbank interest rates and a stable Japanese
currency. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 185 points, or 2.2
percent, to 8,629.18.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices in Singapore closed lower as a
much-anticipated speech by the Japanese prime minister failed to
spur last-minute buying. The Straits Times Industrial Index closed
7.40 points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 1,107.78.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher following favorable preliminary June
sales reports from computer and Internet-related companies. The
market's Weighted Stock Price Index closed up 90.85 points, or 1.15
percent, at 7,936.82, a six-week high.
	   WELLINGTON: Share prices in New Zealand closed stronger,
effectively reversing all the previous day's losses. The benchmark
NZSE-40 Index rose 21.46 points, or 1 percent, closing at 2,088.99.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower, weighed down by
profit-taking in the absence of positive market-moving
developments. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell
2.82 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 1,857.50.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher as bank stocks
helped drive the market to a stronger finish. Resources also
enjoyed a session of gains. The All Ordinaries Index closed at
2,774.1, up 4.80 points.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain plans to slash its nuclear deterrent in
half and sell off 20 percent of its stocks of missiles, ammunition,
land and other defense assets over the next three years, The Times
said Wednesday.
	   The Times and The Daily Telegraph said the plans for the 2.2
billion pound (dlrs 3.6 billion) sell-off are part of a package of
proposals to reorganize Britain's armed forces that were leaked to
them on the eve of the government's announcement to Parliament on
Wednesday.
	   Leaders of the opposition Conservative and Liberal Democrat
parties condemned the leaks and demanded an investigation. Defense
Secretary George Robertson, who called the leak ``grossly
improper,'' said Wednesday morning that there would be an immediate
and thorough inquiry and the ``severest action'' would be taken
against the person responsible.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officials called off the search
Wednesday for victims of a ferry accident in which 35 people died
and 35 more were still missing, a news report said.
	   Fifty-two people were rescued and 35 bodies were found after the
ferry capsized and sank June 25 in the Alas Straits between the
islands of Sumbawa and Lombok, a popular tourist destination, about
1,125 kilometers (700 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The ship KMP Bahana Nusantara was initially reported to have
carried 94 crew and passengers. However, shipping officials said
Wednesday that 122 people were aboard, meaning that 35 were still
unaccounted for.
	   The cause of the accident has yet to be determined.

UN agency warns that Indonesians face acute food shortages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Nearly half of Indonesia's population faces acute
food shortages following a prolonged drought and a worsening
economic crisis, a U.N. agency said Wednesday.
	   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said fewer
people were able to purchase food due to high unemployment and
rising prices, following the depreciation of the local currency.
	   The agency estimated that by the end of 1998 nearly half of
Indonesia's approximately 200 million citizens will fall below the
poverty line. In 1996 there were 22.5 million poor, according to
FAO.
	   Insufficient rainfall, as well as locus infestations in some
areas, means this season's harvests of rice and other crops will be
less than expected, the agency said.
	   It appealed to international donors to provide additional
assistance.

Jewish leader welcomes Volkswagen's change of mind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-VW-Slave Labor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Hungarian Jewish community leader
welcomed Wednesday the new decision by German automobile
manufacturer Volkswagen to compensate slave laborers used in its
plants during WWII.
	   The company announced Tuesday it would open a private fund to
compensate slave laborers, in recognition of its historical and
moral responsibilities for using forced labor during the war.
	   According to Peter Feldmajer the president of the Federation of
Jewish Communities, up to 1,000 Hungarian Jews who worked in
Volkswagen plants from 1944-45 could be eligible for compensation.
	   ``This is a welcome turn,'' Feldmajer told the Associated Press
in a telephone interview.
	   Details of the fund will be announced in mid-September.
	   Last month, Klaus von Muenchhausen, a lawyer from Germany said
he would file a lawsuit seeking back wages for the Hungarian Jews,
most of whom are now in their 70s, who were sent from the Auschwitz
concentration camp to Volkswagen's factory in Wolfsburg, Germany to
produce armaments.
	   Volkswagen said the Nazi government was responsible for the
forced labor and that the Hungarians should place their claims with
the regime's successor, the current German government.
	   Feldmajer said Volkswagen's change of heart follows examples set
by two other Germany companies, Siemens and Mercedes-Benz, who
voluntarily paid reparations to former slave laborers after the
war.
	   This excluded victims living behind the Iron Curtain, who were
unable to apply for the money.
	   A German court opened a loophole in the reparations law last
year, to allow East Europeans to apply for imprisonment and health
compensation even if they missed the 1965 deadline.
	   About two thirds of Hungary's pre-World war II Jewish population
of one million perished in the Holocaust. Today some 100,000 Jews
live in the country.

Close military ties imperative to stability during Asian crisis,

defense chief says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Close military ties between Western
nations and Australia are imperative to stability in the
Asia-Pacific region during the Asian economic crisis, Australia's
new defense chief said Wednesday.
	   Lt.-Gen. Frank Hickling told a conference of military
representatives from the United States, Britain, Canada and New
Zealand that the Asian economic crisis was a timely reminder that
instability can come from unexpected quarters.
	   ``The only sure thing about future security is uncertainty,''
Hickling said, in his first speech since becoming commander of
Australia's armed forces earlier this week.
	   ``Australia's security from direct armed attack is dependent
upon regional security,'' he said. ``At a time of uncertainty, it
is therefore imperative that the armies represented in this room
retain their close links and seek to enhance their
interoperability, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.''

Thai police vow to enforce anti-smoking laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in Thailand have announced they
will start enforcing a law banning smoking in public places, Thai
newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Assistant city police commissioner Maj. Jongrak Juthanon
announced the policy after meeting the head of the government's
anti-smoking body, Dr. Waraporn Pumisawat, who complained that the
ban was not being enforced, the newspaper The Nation reported.
	   The Non-smokers' Health Protection Act and the Tobacco Products
Control Act came into effect earlier this year. They impose fines
of 2,000-20,000 baht (dlrs 50-dlrs 500) for smoking in such places
as government offices, buses, malls, supermarkets, barbershops,
tailor shops, beauty salons and drug stores.
	   Restaurateurs who do not arrange non-smoking areas in their
restaurants will also be fined. said the Bangkok Post.
	   Police Maj. Jongrak was quoted as saying that police initially
would apply light penalties against offenders in an effort to raise
public awareness.

Parliament defeats bid to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Bills to draft ultra-Orthodox seminary students
were defeated by parliament Wednesday, but stirred new debate about
the role of religion in Israel and the deepening rift between
secular and observant Jews.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government depends on
two ultra-Orthodox parties for survival, opposed the conscription
bills, including one introduced by opposition leader Ehud Barak, a
former armed forces chief of staff.
	   Netanyahu and the religious parties won rare backing from Arab
opposition legislators who apparently feared the legislation would
set a precedent of drafting Israel's Arab citizens as well, if not
into the army, then into some form of national service.
	   Barak's bill was defeated by a 53-45 vote, and a similar
proposal by the opposition Meretz Party was voted down by 53-41.
	   A leading ultra-Orthodox rabbi, Eliezer Shach, had urged his
flock to ``lay down their lives'' rather than submit to a draft.
	   The ultra-Orthodox say Torah study, not military might, has
ensured the survival of the Jewish people, and that young men
should dedicate their lives to reading the Scriptures. Rabbis also
feel that the army, with its mingling of the sexes, is not an
appropriate place for seminary students.
	   Under the current system, full-time Jewish seminary students are
not drafted and even receive a government living allowance if they
don't have jobs. According to recent estimates, about 30,000
seminary students of draft age are not serving in the army.
	   In general, Israeli men have to serve three years and then are
called up each year for several weeks of reserve duty until their
mid-40s. The sponsors of the new draft bills said a majority of
Israelis wanted to see a more equal sharing of the defense burden.
	   About 70 percent of Israeli Jews are secular. Among the
observant Jews, many do military service, including the so-called
religious Zionists who produce a disproportionately high number of
combat soldiers and officers.

Faldo pulls out of Loch Lomond with elbow injury; could miss
</HEADLINE>
British Open &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Nick Faldo pulled out of the Loch
Lomond tournament Wednesday with an elbow injury and could be in
danger of missing next week's British Open.
	   Faldo withdrew just before his scheduled tee-off after injuring
a tendon in his right elbow on the driving range.
	   Faldo went for treatment, returned to hit some more shots but
realized he could do more damage by trying to play.
	   ``He's injured the tendon on the inside of his right elbow and
traumatized a muscle,'' said European tour physiotherapist Jon
Shrewsbury. ``We will give him treatment for three or four times a
day now. It involves ice, rest, electrotherapy and putting on a
fiberglass cast.''
	   The injury was the latest setback in a miserable year for Faldo,
who entered the Loch Lomond tournament as a warmup for next week's
British Open at Birkdale.
	   The three-time British Open champion has dropped out of the top
100 on the U.S. money list, has fallen to an all-time low of 50th
in the world rankings and missed the halfway cut at both the
Masters and U.S. Open.

Two injured in Spanish festival bull run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain AP) _ Two people were slightly injured Wednesday
in the second day of Spain's annual San Fermin bull-running
festival.
	   An estimated 3,000 people tested their speed and bravery to run
with six bulls along the 850-meter (935-yard) course through the
cobblestone streets to the town's bullring.
	   The race, which started as scheduled at 8 a.m. (0600 gmt), was
virtually incident free and finished in under three minutes.
	   The two people injured were treated in hospital for light
bruises but later released, news reports said.
	   The only real scare came where some 50 people were momentarily
trapped in a pileup at the entrance to the bull ring where the run
concludes.
	   In the melee, one of the steers used to try to keep the bulls in
a pack scrambled over the mound of humanity to make its way into
the ring.
	   Each year tens of thousands of people attend one of Europe's
most popular festivals. The event was made world famous by Ernest
Hemingway's 1927 novel ``Fiesta - The Sun Also Rises.''
	   The bulls used in the run are killed by matadors in the
afternoon bullfight, another of the major attractions of the
festival which began Monday.
	   In the first run Tuesday, one Spaniard was gored in the groin
and another was injured when he was trampled by crowds. The last
fatality at the festival occurred in 1995 when an American was
gored.
	   A total of 13 people have died at San Fermin since Spanish
officials began keeping records in 1924.

World Cup: Brazil reaches final with talent still untapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Outside the locker room, an exhausted
Mario Zagallo held up one finger. His personal countdown had
reached one game.
	   ``Only one left,'' said the Brazilian coach, his shaky voice
firming. ``Our mission is almost accomplished. And we will win the
`penta,' have no doubt.''
	   `Penta,' fifth in Portuguese, is how Brazilians intimately refer
to the World Cup title they fully expect to win on Sunday. They had
just passed _ barely _ the biggest hurdle in their path.
	   For much of their epic semifinal battle on Tuesday, the
Netherlands outplayed, outhustled and outsmarted the defending Cup
champions. They did almost everything except win.
	   After 120 minutes and the game deadlocked 1-1, luck made the
difference. Goalie Taffarel guessed right twice on penalty kicks by
Philip Cocu and Ronald de Boer, giving Brazil an insurmountable 4-2
lead in the tiebreaker and a spot in the finals.
	   ``God was with us at the right moment,'' Taffarel said.
	   ``Luck is fundamental, no question,'' added Bebeto. ``No one is
champion without it.''
	   Faith, luck, destiny _ the fact is Brazil reaches the finals
without displaying the overpowering soccer so many expected from
the four-time champions.
	   With a young generation brimming with talent, Zagallo switched
the defense-first style that won the '94 Cup for a ``killer''
attack, led by two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo. But the
attack has been less than overwhelming.
	   Against the Netherlands, Brazil showed only glimmers of
greatness. There was a goal and a handful of chances by Ronaldo,
some disconcerting dribbles from Denilson, and not much more.
	   Credit the Dutch defense. They tied Brazil in knots in the first
half, when striker Patrick Kluivert repeatedly missed from close
range on chances that could have decided the game. Still, Brazil
looked little like a champion.
	   ``We had problems,'' Zagallo admitted. ``The Dutch were superior
in the first half.''
	   Through six games, Brazil has played just well enough to get by
against an unexceptional field.
	   After beating Scotland and Morocco in the first round, they
could afford to lose to Norway _ and lost. Then came a 4-1 win over
unpretentious Chile and a dramatic 3-2 victory against Denmark,
with the drama heightened by Brazil's defensive lapses.
	   Though it's hard to argue with success, Zagallo knows his team
should be playing better.
	   ``Some players aren't performing 100 percent yet,'' he said.
``Imagine if they were.''
	   Among them is Ronaldo. He was brilliant in the second half,
lethargic in the first. Some blame his erratic pay on tendinitis in
his knee, others hint he's a tad overweight. Though he leads the
team with four goals, many expect more from the world's best
player.
	   Another sub-par performer is Roberto Carlos, the Real Madrid
defender who finished second to Ronaldo in the Player of the Year
balloting. His booming free kick was supposed to be a major weapon
in Brazil's arsenal, but he hasn't scored yet, and his defense has
been spotty.
	   Roberto Carlos says he's had trouble adjusting to the lighter
ball used at the Cup. It doesn't ``take'' the spin that makes a
shot curve, he says, but instead flies off in odd directions.
	   When the inspiration isn't there, though, Brazilians have shown
they can dig in and scrap with any team.
	   ``Our heart was on the field, our willpower, our
determination,'' said Rivaldo.
	   If it isn't art, it may be enough.

Democrats bring back critical voice to Hong Kong's legislature
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A year after leaving the legislature, Democrats
on Wednesday brought back critical voices and demands for more
democracy in an angry debate over why some activists are refused
permission to visit mainland China.
	   Martin Lee, leader of the Democrats and Hong Kong's de facto
opposition leader, promised that the new legislature, which
replaced an appointed body dismissed by many as a rubber stamp,
would return ``real monitoring'' of the government.
	   The legislature met briefly a week ago to elect a president. On
Wednesday, it held a full session. Arguments with officials erupted
when Democrats and their allies demanded answers on whether police
had violated human rights in their handling of demonstrators last
year, and why some activists have been barred from mainland China.
	   At least a dozen activists, many of them Democrats, have been
refused renewal of their visiting permits to mainland China.
	   Hong Kong was handed back to China last year, and the activists
say they don't understand why they cannot get permission to visit
the mainland.
	   Neither China nor Hong Kong has ever explained why they are
banned. Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen told
legislators Hong Kong has no right to question the central
government's decisions under the ``one country, two systems''
reunification formula.
	   Suen refused to say whether he had discussed the issue with
mainland officials, or whether he was given any explanations.
	   ``We want to know what your understanding was,'' said a furious
Lee Cheuk-yan, who has been refused a permit. ``Was it because you
didn't know what questions to ask, or whether you didn't want to
tell us what you know?''
	   Such clashes were uncommon in the past year.
	   To protest the democratic reforms Britain introduced without its
consent, Beijing dismantled the largely elected legislature and
appointed an interim body dominated by business and pro-Beijing
elites.
	   Compared with the pre-handover legislature, the interim body was
rarely critical of the government. Issues concerning human rights
and democracy were almost never discussed.
	   The interim body also repealed several laws expanding labor
rights and passed legislation putting more limits on
demonstrations.
	   One of the hottest issues to come before the new legislature is
a law on subversion, sedition and treason. However, newspapers have
quoted Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung as saying there is no
hurry to introduce the bill.
	   Martin Lee said the Democrats, Hong Kong's largest political
party, will fight for more democracy and human rights. Union
officials also say they want expanded labor rights.
	   Democrat Andrew Cheng also will sponsor a motion calling for all
60 seats in the legislature to be elected by direct, popular vote
in the year 2000, and the chief executive to be subsequently
elected in the same way.
	   The Democrats and their allies won 14 of the 20 directed elected
seats, but the council is dominated by conservative elites because
half of the legislators are representatives of professions, and 10
members were elected by a conservative electoral college.

African writers seek understanding of Rwandan genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ When half a million people were killed
four years ago in the Rwandan genocide, many African writers and
poets could not comprehend how it happened.
	   On Wednesday, nine of them began a two-month visit to meet
survivors and see the genocide sites in the tiny Central African
nation in order to draw inspiration that will later translate into
poetry, plays or fiction.
	   ``We're mobilizing African writers to spread the word about what
happened in Rwanda and to help avoid similar events from
happening,'' Chadian writer Nocky Djedanoum said. ``We feel the
European writers didn't do enough, and it is our responsibility to
influence Africans.''
	   Djedanoum, who organized the project, ``Rwanda: Duty to Write,''
said each of the writers had agreed to write a novel, a play or a
poem after the visit.
	   The project is funded by the private French Fondation de France
and the Rwandan Ministry of Culture.
	   ``There is a wrong perception in Europe that the genocide was
ethnic or tribal,'' said Rwandan poet and playwright Jean-Marie
Vianney Rurangwa. ``It was organized by an elite in power.''
	   The former Hutu government used local authorities, journalists
and writers to spread hate and order killings of minority Tutsis
and politically moderate Hutus during the 90-day killing spree. The
slaughter ended in July 1994 when Tutsi-led rebels seized power.
	   Rurangwa, who was only two years old in 1962 when his Tutsi
parents were forced into exile, is now planning to return and
publish his works in French, not in his native Kinyarwanda, ``to
influence and change the elite.''
	   Although English is becoming more widely used in Rwanda _
because many of the returned Tutsi exiles grew up in neighboring
English-speaking Uganda _ French is still widely spoken.
	   ``Once the elite has understood that we must live together
without killing each other, then students in schools will not be
ordered to kill their Tutsi friends the way they did in 1994,'' he
said. ``The change must come from above.''
	   Djendanoum said educating the general public about Rwanda was
not the objective of the project. Rather, he said, the writers
would concentrate on giving their impressions of what they learned
and experienced during their time in Rwanda.
	   ``The message is that genocide can happen anywhere and anytime.
In my native Chad, there has been a long war. Genocide is possible
there, too,'' he said.
	   The writers who are visiting Rwanda were Koulsy Lamko (Chad),
Monique Ilboudo (Burkina Faso), Moussa Konate (Mali), Boubacar
Boris Diop (Senegal), Tierno Monenembo (Guinea), Pius Ngandu
Nkashama (Congo), Abdourahman Waberi (Djibouti) and Meja Mwangi
(Kenya).

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ At hitter-friendly Coors Field, offensive records
are the norm, and the American League's 13-8 victory over the
National League featured a rash of them.
	   The combined 21 runs Tuesday night eclipsed the record 20 in
1954 when the AL won 11-9 in Cleveland. The AL's 13 runs and 19
hits tied tied team records and the combined 31 hits also tied a
record.
	   It was the longest nine-inning game in All-Star history at 3
hours, 38 minutes, eclipsing the 3:10 in 1954.
	   The five stolen bases by the AL set another record, and Ivan
Rodriguez became the first catcher in All-Star history to get three
hits in the game. All of his hits were singles, tying the record
for singles in an All-Star game.
	   Baltimore's Cal Ripken made his 15th consecutive All-Star start,
topping Willie Mays' mark of 14.
	   Atlanta shortstop Walt Weiss became the oldest position player
to make his All-Star debut as a starter (34 years, 7 months).
	   Craig Biggio struck out three times, tying another All-Star
mark.
	   The crowd of 51,267 was the largest in the four-year history of
Coors Field.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Can France finally break its jinx and make it to
the World Cup final for the first time ever?
	   On the streets of Paris, there were mixed feelings hours before
Wednesday night's match against Croatia.
	   ``Of course we'll win, no doubt,'' said Jean-Pierre Dumel, a
Parisian waiter. ``Well, we should. But you never know. We have a
habit of blowing it. There's so much expectation.''
	   After a lukewarm start to the tournament, France has caught
World Cup fever.
	   Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Paris to
celebrate the last two victories over Paraguay and Italy _ the
first thanks to a last-minute goal, the next one after a penalty
shootout.
	   France has suffered three heart-breaking defeats at the
semi-final stage _ in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Another is unthinkable.
	   In the end, Dumel said, he predicts a tight 1-0 victory for
France. ``Unless, of course...''
	   His hesitation stems from the fact that France has a great
defense, but its strikers have hit a barren spell. And the Croatian
team is an unknown quantity that has already surprised many by
beating Germany.
	   Yves Cabrera, 22, was more confident, saying France would win
3-0. ``In the past we've had stylish teams who never made it.
Today's team is more efficient.''
	   Headlines in the French press reflected the mood: ``Near to the
Goal,'' said Le Parisien. ``This would be historic,'' said
L'Equipe.
	   France Soir, showing a large photo of a Croatian fan, said:
``But who are these Croats?''
	   On the Champs Elysees, a magnet for French revelers after
matches, there was a feeling among the Croatian fans, decked out in
red-and-white national colors, that they have less to lose _
they're happy just to have come this far.
	   About 1,000 Croatians flew in early Wednesday on five special
charter flights. Some were leaving straight after the match.
Others, confident of victory, planned to stay until Sunday to see
the final.
	   Most said they were just proud to be here and were determined to
have a good time _ and leave a good impression.
	   A red-and-white Croatia cap hanging from her back pocket,
Drazenka Menicanim, a young lawyer from Zagreb, said the most
important thing was Croatia's image.
	   ``Croatia is a new child in Europe. And like every child we have
certain problems of adaptation,'' she said. ``But we're here to
prove that we belong in Europe.''
	   She estimated that five percent of the world currently knows
about Croatia, but said the figure would rise to 15 percent after
Wednesday's game, and 25 percent if Croatia gets to the final.
	   ``And we will,'' she predicted confidently. ``It's 2-0. Goals
from Davor Suker and Zvonimir Boban.''
	   Dumel, the French waiter, said Croatia had done well, in part
thanks to its mystery element.
	   ``But I think we can do it. It's now or never,'' he said.

Estrada promises new planes for air force in reduced modernization

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Despite prospects of a large budget
deficit, President Joseph Estrada promised Wednesday to buy new
planes to strengthen one of the region's weakest air forces under a
scaled-down modernization program.
	   ``The men and women of the Philippine air force certainly
deserve more than what they get now,'' Estrada said at the 51st
anniversary of the air force's founding. ``I assure you that you
will have the planes, weapons and equipment that will match your
competence, patriotism and courage.''
	   Estrada also said he plans to buy more patrol boats for the
navy.
	   In 1995, the Philippine Congress approved a 15-year, 331 billion
peso (dlrs 8 billion) military modernization plan. But the program
faces cutbacks because of a government budget deficit and the Asian
currency crisis, which has made foreign armaments more expensive in
terms of the local currency.
	   Estrada had earlier said any increased military spending should
go for better soldiers' salaries and housing benefits instead of
weapons.
	   After the anniversary ceremony, Estrada complained of
difficulties in preparing the government budget.
	   ``We are starting off a little in the red,'' he said of the
country's 8 billion peso (dlrs 195 million) budget deficit and dlrs
45.5 billion foreign debt.
	   He said he is urging Congress to scrap its ``pork barrel''
development funds, which are often misused, and is eyeing a tax
amnesty program for delinquent taxpayers to boost revenues for his
administration.
	   On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military
modernization program faces substantial cutbacks.
	   Mercado said the 1995 program was pegged at an exchange rate of
30 pesos to a dollar but the currency crisis has pushed the rate
above 40 pesos, forcing a re-evaluation of the whole program.
	   ``I asked for a review because we have so little money,''
Mercado said.
	   Under the plan, the Philippines is shopping for new multi-role
jet fighters for the air force and fast patrol craft for the navy,
whose World War II-vintage ships are no match for speedboats used
by pirates and smugglers.
	   The air force has about five aging F-5 jet fighters, about 20
Italian-made S-211 jet fighters, normally used for training, and
about 10 OV-10 turboprop attack aircraft. The rest of its aircraft
are helicopter gunships and cargo planes.

Shock, suspicion at death of top Nigerian political prisoner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with comments from OAU, Germany,
Spain, New Zealand; shortens pvs &QL; 
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Appeals for calm and a return to civilian rule in
Nigeria mingled Wednesday with suspicion and bitter recriminations
over the death of Moshood Abiola, the West African nation's most
prominent political prisoner.
	   Two of Abiola's daughters and opposition groups charged that the
military regime was responsible for his death through ill-treatment
during four years in jail and by ignoring doctors' warnings that
his health was deteriorating.
	   Abiola, 60, the presumed winner of 1993 elections, died Tuesday
after suffering an apparent heart attack during a meeting with
visiting U.S. diplomats.
	   The 53-member Organization of African Unity said Nigeria's new
military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, had taken ``encouraging
steps,'' but should now immediately release all political prisoners
and return the country to democratic government.
	   ``Chief Abiola has come to be an important symbol of the
pro-democracy movement in Nigeria,'' OAU Secretary-general Salim A.
Salim said in a statement Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   ``The most fitting tribute therefore that can be given to him is
to ensure that democratic government is restored in Nigeria as soon
as possible,'' Salim said.
	   Abiola's death was front-page news in many Western newspapers.
	   In Spain, the center-right newspaper El Mundo commented
Wednesday, ``Nigeria appears to be cursed.''
	   In London, the pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph noted that in
all but 10 of the years since Nigeria received independence from
Britain in 1960, Africa's most populous nation has been under
military rule.
	   ``The lion's share of the mess in which it finds itself ... must
be laid at the military's door,'' the newspaper said.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who met with
Abiola a week ago and who expected his imminent release from jail,
said Abubakar should fulfill promises to release all political
prisoners unconditionally and announce a program for civilian rule.
	   Annan said Abiola appeared in good health when they met. Family
members said his health has long deteriorated _ but were suspicious
of the heart attack.
	   His daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   Another daughter, Hafsat, told CNN, ``It was too convenient. All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Nigeria had lost ``its
symbol of democracy.''
	   In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged calm. ``The
great work of reconciliation and renewal that Gen. Abubakar has set
in motion in the few weeks since he took office must not be
endangered by rash and dangerous agitation,'' Kinkel said.
	   In New Zealand, one of eight nations in the Commonwealth of
former British colonies that have been monitoring Nigeria, the
opposition Labor Party said Abiola's death was a suspicious as it
was tragic.
	   Bolaji Akinyemi, a Nigerian former foreign minister who is now
spokesman for the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria,
demanded an independent autopsy by a team of World Health
Organization doctors.
	   Another London-based opposition group, Campaign for Democracy in
Nigeria, also demanded foreign doctors perform the autopsy. Abiola,
it said, was ``killed by the Gen. Abubakar junta and those who
scuttled all efforts to free him.''

Passenger services improve at new airport; big problems in
</HEADLINE>
cargo-handling &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with cargo handler extending usage of old
airport facilities, passenger services improving &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Services for passengers improved Wednesday
after two days of misery at Hong Kong's new airport, but computer
problems forced air cargo handlers to extend a shipping embargo.
	   Merchants complained that seafood and fresh flowers, fruit and
vegetables all were old or spoiled because of air cargo delays.
Seafood wholesalers and retailers said they were facing the loss of
half their profits.
	   Hong Kong's press was sharply critical. Editorials questioned
whether airport officials had rushed the opening, and in the
process damaged Hong Kong's reputation rather than giving the
territory a much-needed morale boost.
	   Since the airport opened Monday morning, passengers had suffered
delays in baggage handling and flight information. Some complained
that they had to wait an hour or more to get off the their planes
after they arrived, and many said that the vast airport's signs
were poor.
	   One of the most damaging developments was the decision Tuesday
of a major cargo handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to
temporarily move import and export clearance operations back to its
facilities at the old airport until computer bugs could be
straightened out at the new airport. It also placed a 24-hour
embargo on cargo carried by passenger planes.
	   Officials said Wednesday that things were getting better in the
passenger terminal.
	   ``From the report I have received, there have been very marked
improvements already over the last two days, particularly this
morning compared with yesterday, and yesterday with the performance
on Monday,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told reporters.
	   Early Wednesday, airport corporate development director Clinton
Leeks told Hong Kong radio the faulty flight information system was
working and baggage backlogs had been cleared. He said it now was
time for independent providers of essential services to improve.
	   The real problems were at the new cargo terminal, and it did not
appear that they would be solved overnight.
	   Television reports showed the streets of an open seafood market
littered with crabs that had died by the time they arrived at
market. Seafood shipments were being delayed 20 hours at the
airport, TV-B said.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, told reporters Wednesday that the embargo on cargo
imports carried by passenger planes would be extended 48 hours.
	   Charter said that beginning Saturday, all exports will be
processed at Chek Lap Kok, while imports except for perishable and
life-saving materials will be trucked to the company's facilities
at the old Kai Tak airport for clearance.
	   He refused to be drawn into a discussion about who was to blame.
But editorialists were bitterly critical of the airport management.
	   As Hong Kong slips into recession, the South China Morning Post
said Chek Lap Kok might turn into another in a series of
nightmares.
	   ``Everyone was thirsting for a confidence-building event;
instead the airport's first days may join economic downturn, avian
flu, red tides on the register of depressive events of the past
year,'' it said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard cited what it said was a ``lack of
foresight, preparation, practical training and testing of
facilities.''
	   The new airport, built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island, replaced old and overcrowded Kai Tak.

The mourning after: A black mood envelopes orange Holland

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ For a month, the Dutch painted the
town orange. But overnight, the national mood has faded to black,
and a hangover has swallowed up the high.
	   With the World Cup hopes of its dream team suddenly dashed, the
Netherlands awoke Wednesday gruff and groggy, doing what it could
to piece together some pride after losing to Brazil in a
nail-biting semifinal.
	   Barkeeps swept up orange confetti and peeled beer-soaked orange
cocktail napkins from sidewalks, contemplating how a tiny twist of
events Tuesday night might have taken Holland to the final for the
first time in 20 years.
	   Instead, the Dutch are down and out. Brazil won 4-2 on a penalty
shootout after a 1-1 tie in regulation play and overtime, advancing
to Sunday's final to face the winner of Wednesday night's match
between France and Croatia. The Dutch have to settle for the
third-place match Saturday against the loser of that showdown.
	   ``Silence. A Fog Hangs Over the Living Room,'' read a front-page
headline in the daily De Volkskrant.
	   ``It will take me years to recover,'' muttered Remco Zannis, an
Amsterdammer aimlessly wandering the streets of the Dutch capital
after the fateful match.
	   To call the Dutch soccer-crazy doesn't even come close to
reality. This is a nation obsessed, and the grace and power of the
Orangemen as they steadily advanced toward the Holy Grail had
captured the country's imagination.
	   From the beer-bellied port workers of Rotterdam to the
ruddy-faced farmers of Friesland, more than 11 million Dutchmen
tuned in to watch Tuesday's semifinal. Traffic, typically bumper to
bumper in this crowded land of 15 million, was practically
nonexistent for a couple of hours every time the Dutch played.
	   Orange, the national color, was everywhere.
	   Briefcase-toting businessmen rode the trains to work wearing
ridiculous orange wigs and goofy grins. The truly die-hard dyed
hair, mustaches, beards, even eyebrows Day-Glo orange. Long strings
of triangular orange flags fluttered outside homes, offices and
factories.
	   On Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square, soccer balls dangled
like Christmas ornaments from trees wrapped in orange plastic, and
fountains spewed orange-colored water.
	   In the southern city of Tilburg, one farmer even painted the
cows in his field orange.
	   That party atmosphere has gone from gay to gray. The drinking
songs have faded, now that the Cup has slipped from Holland's
hands.
	   ``What can you do? What can I say?,'' a listless Jeroen
Oudshoorn said from behind the counter of his Amsterdam sporting
goods store, throwing up his hands.
	   ``We played very well, but we didn't have luck. We did the best
we could.''
	   As the Dutch set about shaking off their depression and looking
ahead to Saturday's consolation match, they could at least take
some comfort in an amusingly timed business development.
	   The biggest Dutch bank, ABN Amro, ironically announced Wednesday
it's taking over Brazil's No. 4 bank, Banco Real, for dlrs 2.1
billion in cash.

Saudis detain 8 Filipinos and Dutchman for evangelizing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has detained eight
Filipinos and a Dutch national for distributing Christian
pamphlets, diplomats said Wednesday.
	   The Filipinos and Dutchman belonged to a bible-study group in
the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where they were accused of
evangelicizing, diplomats at the Filipino and Dutch embassies said.
	   ``We have received the information from relatives and friends of
the detainees, but have not yet gotten confirmation from the Saudi
authorities,'' said a Filipino diplomat on condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomat said 10 Filipinos and a Dutchman were arrested
between June 6 and June 13. Two Filipinos were later released.
	   The Dutch embassy said the Saudi authorities had refused to
allow its officials to visit the Dutch citizen in jail.
	   ``We heard he was arrested for religious activity, but we have
not yet been allowed to see him,'' said the Dutch diplomat on
condition of anonymity.
	   Saudi officials would not comment.
	   Saudi Arabia is an arch-conservative Muslim nation under whose
laws the preaching of Christianity is a crime punishable by up to
one year in prison and deportation.

Resistance troops honor casualties of Cambodian coup

	   O'SMACH, Cambodia (AP) _ Guerrillas loyal to deposed Cambodian
Co-Premier Norodom Ranariddh gathered Wednesday at their
headquarters base to honor their comrades and other victims of the
coup that drove them into resistance last year.
	   ``Today we commemorate those who lost their lives last year,''
said guerrilla commander Nhek Bunchhay, who narrowly escaped with
his life from the coup before making his way to O'Smach on the Thai
border. ``These are people who lost their lives fighting for
democracy in Cambodia.''
	   With the collapse in April of the communist Khmer Rouge rebel
movement, O'Smach is one of the few remaining areas of Cambodia not
under the control of the government of Hun Sen, who deposed
Ranariddh, his co-premier, last July.
	   Nhek Bunchhay then commanded the only major concentration of
troops loyal to Ranariddh in Phnom Penh, and his men bore the brunt
of attacks by Hun Sen's forces. Many also became casualties as they
fled the capital after their base was overrun.
	   Buddhist monks chanted prayers for the dead at Wednesday's
ceremony, attended by a smattering of civilians in addition to
about 500 guerrillas.
	   The civilians, who gathered by the base's flagpole, carried
banners, including one that read: ``Hun Sen still be in power,
bloodshed be continuing.''
	   Activities at the ceremony, about an hour long, included a
inspection of the troops and the playing of traditional Cambodian
music.
	   The guerrillas and officers here are estranged even from
Ranariddh, the man to whom they owe their loyalty.
	   Ranariddh, in an effort to regain his old position, is running
in the July 26 general election. But because candidates may not
command their own armies or claim control over territory, he has
had to disavow the band of loyalists.
	   Ranariddh, Nhek Bunchhay and another guerrilla commander, Serey
Kosal, were all convicted earlier this year by a Hun Sen-controlled
court of illegal collaboration and plotting their own takeover.
	   Ranariddh was given a royal pardon afterward, allowing him to
take part in the election, but the two military men were not,
leaving them subject to arrest and imprisonment if they return to
the capital.
	   One representative from Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party attended
Wednesday's ceremony. Two members of the Sam Rainsy party and one
from the Khmer Neutral party were also there. Their groups are
members with FUNCINPEC in an opposition electoral alliance.

Apartheid chemical secrets may have leaked, truth panel warns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Secrets from an apartheid
chemical and biological warfare program may have leaked to other
countries, a body probing human rights abuses warned on Wednesday.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is investigating the
covert program which researched a bacteria that would only kill
blacks, supplied poisons to government assassins and made large
quantities of deadly anthrax and cholera.
	   Testifying before the panel, former army Surgeon General Niel
Knobel described how technical information and findings from the
project were transferred to computer discs as it was being wound
down before South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994. Most
of the paperwork was then destroyed.
	   Though the discs are currently stored in a government safe,
commissioner Denzil Potgieter warned that dangerous secrets from
the program could already have leaked.
	   ``They might already be in circulation elsewhere,'' he told
Knobel, adding
	   that the commission viewed the prospect with ``absolute alarm.''
	   Knobel did not deny the possibility and said it was
``speculative.''
	   The program was headed by Dr. Wouter Basson who set up a network
of military front companies as cover for apartheid scientists
intent on developing chemical and biological weapons to defend
white rule.
	   Knobel testified that he had urged former President F.W. de
Klerk and President Nelson Mandela to access the discs to see
exactly what they contained, but so far the discs have not been
investigated.
	   Commissioner Wendy Orr said examining the discs would fail to
reveal if secrets were passed on or sold by Basson, who is the only
person to know the full extent of the program's operations.
	   Basson has refused to appear before the commission, claiming he
may prejudice his upcoming criminal trial on charges ranging from
drugs possession to conspiracy to murder.
	   The Truth Commission was set up by Mandela in 1995 and charged
with unovering the facts about abuses committed by all sides in the
fight against apartheid.

Saudis detain 8 Filipinos and Dutchman for evangelizing

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has detained eight
Filipinos and a Dutch national for distributing Christian
pamphlets, diplomats said Wednesday.
	   The Filipinos and Dutchman belonged to a bible-study group in
the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where they were accused of evangelizing,
diplomats at the Filipino and Dutch embassies said.
	   ``We have received the information from relatives and friends of
the detainees, but have not yet gotten confirmation from the Saudi
authorities,'' said a Filipino diplomat on condition of anonymity.
	   The diplomat said 10 Filipinos and a Dutchman were arrested
between June 6 and June 13. Two Filipinos were later released.
	   The Dutch embassy said the Saudi authorities had refused to
allow its officials to visit the Dutch citizen in jail.
	   ``We heard he was arrested for religious activity, but we have
not yet been allowed to see him,'' said the Dutch diplomat on
condition of anonymity.
	   Saudi officials would not comment.
	   Saudi Arabia is an arch-conservative Muslim nation under whose
laws the preaching of Christianity is a crime punishable by up to
one year in prison and deportation.

ECB chief says euro countries need to work harder on cutting debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's top central banker on
Wednesday told countries set to join the single currency next year
that they had to work harder to reduce their budget deficits.
	   At a news conference a day after governors of the new European
Central Bank met, bank president Wim Duisenberg expressed concern
that some countries chosen to inaugurate the ``euro'' currency in
1999 were not trying hard enough to meet treaty requirements on
budget deficits and national debt.
	   The treaty setting out terms for monetary union calls for member
states to get their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross
domestic product and their total outstanding debt below 60 percent.
	   ``It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of
member countries the prospects for this ... to actually develop
seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued,'' Duisenberg said,
singling out Ireland and Italy especially.
	   On Monday, Duisenberg met with finance ministers representing
the 11 euro-zone countries, where he was briefed on the those
countries' 1998 and 1999 budgets.
	   Meanwhile, Duisenberg said the European Central Bank will
implement use of the controversial minimum reserve requirement to
stabilize European money market rates.
	   The minimum reserve requirement binds commercial banks to hold
reserves with the ECB. Many commercial banks don't like it because
they say it's too restrictive and will make costs too high.
	   Currently, six out of 11 euro-zone countries require minimum
reserves.
	   Some euro-zone officials have expressed concern that countries
in the monetary union will lose financial sector business to
Britain, which has no such requirement.
	   But bank vice president Christian Noyer said the requirement
``is absolutely neutral in its effect on the banking community.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Albanian extremists firing from a
speeding van wounded a Serb policeman Wednesday and killed an
Albanian civilian bystander in a Kosovo province town, police said
at the scene.
	   Elsewhere in rebellious Kosovo province, ethnic Albanians said
Serb forces killed five Albanians on Wednesday in the border
village of Morine, 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of here.
	   The attacks occurred as diplomats from six countries met in
Bonn, Germany to discuss efforts to resolve the crisis, which
escalated in February when Serb forces cracked down on Albanian
extremists fighting for independence for the province.
	   According to police, gunmen of the extremist Kosovo Liberation
Army opened fire from a van on an unmarked police car parked in the
town of Suva Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The gunmen escaped. A Serb policeman was wounded in the shoulder
and a 33-year-old Albanian street vendor was killed. His
blood-soaked body lay on the pavement as European Union diplomats,
part of a newly-formed international observer mission, arrived at
the scene.
	   In reporting the five deaths in Morine, the Kosovo Information
Center did not say whether the dead were civilians or guerrillas.
	   But the center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said most of the women and children had already fled
the village. No independent confirmation was available.
	   Elsewhere in the rebllious province, government forces have
deployed more troops and police on the 30-kilometer (20-mile)
stretch of road linking the Koso towns of Djakovica and Pec, where
ethnic Albanian guerrillas control areas on both sides of the
highway.
	   The presence of additional forces raised fears of new clashes in
the volatile area.
	   In Bonn, representatives of the so-called Contact Group _ the
United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ were to
continue the search for ways to halt the fighting.
	   Major powers fear the conflict could spread to other areas of
the Balkans with large Albanian populations.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form
the Yugoslav federation.

World Cup: Corporate ticket packages fail to materialize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ About 2,500 business people have been left without
tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Paris after the collapse of
a company selling corporate hospitality packages for up to 2,299
pounds each (dlrs 3,816).
	   Liquidators of International Championship Management, based in
London, have notified several companies _ including IBM, DHL and
Amstrad _ that their tickets could not be delivered.
	   The firms paid an estimated 3 million pounds (dlrs 4.98 million
for the ticket packages, which included catering, transport and
five-star hotel accomodation.
	   ICM, whose clients include more than 230 companies across
Europe, collapsed last month.
	   The liquidators said ICM never had the tickets for the games and
was relying on two licensed ticket brokers to supply them. But the
tickets never came through.
	   One of the licensed brokers which failed to deliver the tickets
was Great Portland Entertainment, a London firm which was closed
last month after failing to produce 25,000 tickets worth nearly 2.5
million (dlrs 4.15 million).

Eyewitness noticed loose construction of fateful bridge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An eyewitness testified Wednesday that
he heard a loud noise as police vehicles crossed over a footbridge
shortly before it collapsed, plunging four Australian athletes to
their deaths, and noticed how loosely the bridge was constructed.
	   ``There was a roar of wooden boards that were not fastened down
properly,'' Eli Feiglin, an employee for one of the sponsors of the
Maccabiah Games opening ceremony, said in Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court. ``I noticed the loud noise.''
	   The bridge leading to the opening ceremonies buckled as the
Australian team crossed last July 14. Dozens of athletes were
injured after falling into the polluted Yarkon River.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   An engineer testified earlier that the bridge collapsed because
of structural problems, and not because of the weight of the police
motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles that crossed before the
athletes.
	   Itamar Herman, chairman of the games' opening ceremony
committee, testified Wednesday that organizers did not learn until
after the collapse that the bridge was built by a sub-contractor,
and not by the Irgunit company that handled most of the
construction for the opening ceremonies.
	   Yoram Eyal, the organizing committee chairman, was
``astonished'' to learn that the bridge was built by a
sub-contractor,'' Herman said.
	   Herman said he spoke the next day to Adam Mishorin, the director
of Irgunit and a defendant, ``who said he was shocked and could not
explain what happened.''
	   Eyal's attorney, Dov Weissglas, said the Maccabiah organizers
had ``no reason to think that Irgunit was not capable of carrying
out the projects, or to expect any problems with the bridge.''
	   Another witness, Maccabiah comptroller Itamar Kanari, said he
was also unaware that Irgunit was using a subcontractor to build
the bridge.
	   Kanari said the Maccabiah only contracted with Irgunit to build
the bridge in June _ a month before the games _ because until then
the organizers had expected the army to agree to build the bridge
for free.

Are Americans taking over the Eiffel Tower?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Forget the World Cup ticket scandals, worries about
soccer hooligans, the strike at Disneyland Paris. Some REALLY
disturbing news appeared in the French press Wednesday.
	   ``American Threats to the Eiffel Tower,'' said a headline in the
daily Le Parisien.
	   ``Will the American flag soon be flying over the summit of the
Eiffel Tower?'' it asked.
	   It took no less than a Cabinet minister to calm the waters.
	   In what was termed a ``response to certain items in the press,''
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn issued a statement
reminding his countrymen that ``the Eiffel Tower belongs to the
city of Paris and is part of the public domain.''
	   The hoopla over the tower _ for a century the enduring symbol of
Paris _ stems from the news that a company called Credit Foncier de
France will soon be privatized. A probable customer is the General
Motors Acceptance Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors based
in Detroit, Le Parisien said.
	   Where's the connection with the Eiffel Tower? A subsidiary of
CFF is involved in a company called SNTE, which manages the tower.
	   Though the danger of an American flag on top of what the French
call ``the Iron Lady'' appeared quite remote, the news was enough
to evoke patriotic fears.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi wrote a letter in June expressing his concern
to Strauss-Kahn.
	   In his statement Wednesday, the finance minister emphasized that
no matter what happens, the city of Paris retains control.
	   ``The city has all the necessary guarantees,'' said
Strauss-Kahn. ``The president and the director-general (of SNTE)
are approved by the city of Paris and the statutes cannot be
modified without its agreement.''
	   But that may not be quite enough to quell the anxiety.
	   ``It is inconceivable and unacceptable,'' said Philippe
Dominati, a rightist council member quoted in Le Parisien, ``that
the Eiffel Tower pass under control of an American group.''
	   Messages left early Wednesday with GMAC were not immediately
returned.

Defense and security allocations up 1.4 percent in 1998-99 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Ethiopian parliament has
approved a 1.4 percent increase in defense and security spending in
the 1998-99 budget.
	   As a two-month border dispute with neighboring Eritrea appeared
deadlocked, and both countries continued to send troops to their
common border, parliament on Tuesday voted to approve the
allocation of 1.032 billion birr (about 147 million dollars) for
defense and security spending. This amounts to 9.4 percent of the
total budget of 11 billion birr (dlrs 1.5 billion).
	   Defense and security spending accounted for 8 percent of the
1997-98 budget.
	   The 1998/99 budget represents an increase of about 685 million
birr (about 98 million dollars) over the previous budget.
	   Allocations for health, education and social services account
for 16.8 percent of the budget.
	   About 15 percent of the budget _ 25 percent of estimated
domestic revenue _ will be used to service the external debt of
more than 5 billion dollars.
	   The federal government expects to cover its expenditure from an
estimated domestic revenue of about 7.7 billion birr such as from
direct and indirect taxes, custom and export taxes and revenues
from state investments.
	   The remainder, 3.4 billion birr or 30 percent of the total is
expected to be covered by what the Ministry of Finance describes as
counterpart funds, bilateral and international technical assistance
and loans.
	   Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Rampaging teen-agers smashed shop
windows and hurled bottles and cans at police early Wednesday,
apparently inspired by a huge strike against the sale of the state
telephone company.
	   Police fired tear gas to halt the riot, which erupted soon after
midnight near the suburban headquarters of the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co.
	   Dozens of youngsters smashed the windows of a police car, a
Burger King and a few other shops at San Patricio Plaza, the police
said.
	   ``They were drinking beer from early on. I don't think they
understand that this is a serious strike,'' said one picketer who
tried to stop the teen-agers.
	   It was the only reported violence early in the second day of a
48-hour general strike that began with protesters blocking the
entrance to Ely Lilly's pharmaceutical plant.
	   Picketers also cut off San Juan's second airport of Isla Grande,
which is used by light aircraft.
	   ``Our objective today is to paralyze industry,'' Jaime Figueroa
Jaramillo of the Union of Electrical Industry and Irrigation
Workers said.
	   With 15 cars and a picket line, protesters blocked the gates to
the Carolina plant of Indianapolis-based Ely Lilly -and- Co., just
outside San Juan. They kept workers out for a couple of hours
before breaking up, apparently to move elsewhere.
	   There was none of the drama that began the strike Tuesday, when
people in hundreds of vehicles jammed the entrance to the island's
main international airport and forced tourists to walk the 1 1/2
miles (two kilometers) to the airport terminal.
	   ``The fight doesn't end here. It's just beginning,'' Sen. Ruben
Berrios of the U.S. territory's Independence Party told a sea of
protesters Tuesday waving the island's single-star red, white and
blue flag.
	   In other incidents Tuesday, gunmen shot at a bank involved in
buying the telephone utility; protesters planted a bomb that was
harmlessly exploded by police outside a provincial branch of the
same bank; and saboteurs slashed telephone cables, leaving 260,000
people without long-distance service.
	   Union leaders have denied responsibility for sabotage and other
violent acts that routinely accompany labor protests. Police have
suggested a clandestine pro-independence guerrilla group might have
been responsible for the bombings.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Giant center Todd MacCulloch scored
19 points as Canada leveled its four-match men's basketball series
with Australia at 1-1 on Wednesday.
	   MacCulloch dominated the boards and made a crucial three point
play in overtime as Canada scored a 96-93 win after the scores were
locked at 83-all at full-time.
	   Michael Meeks contributed 17 and William Njoku scored 13 while
Australia's Shane Heal was the game high scorer on 22. Tony
Ronaldson added 18 and Andrew Gaze scored 14 for the hosts.
	   Both teams will play in the world championships in Athens later
this month.
	   Canadian coach Steve Konchalski was full of praise for
MacCulloch and said his rebounding was a key to the team's
performance.
	   ``Todd MacCulloch had a hell of a basketball game, 19 points and
11 boards, we were 47-34 in rebounds his 11 boards were a big part
of that,'' Konchalski said.
	   Australia shot to a quick lead helped by smart shooting from
former NBA guard Heal, who racked up 11 points in the first 10
minutes to help his side to a 23-18 lead midway through the first
half.
	   But Canada steadied and, with forwards Kory Hallas and Meeks
working their way into the match with some strong drives through
the key, it was back to a three-point game at half-time.
	   Canada dominated the opening minutes of the second half, with
MacCulloch controlling his defensive keyway along with forwards
Meeks and Njoku.
	   Njoku was also hot at his offensive end, scoring three quick
two-pointers and when guard Sherman Hamilton sank a big
three-pointer just more than two minutes into the half, Canada led
by six points.
	   Australia fought back with good shooting by Ronaldson and hit
the lead seven minutes into the half, but the lead wavered until
Meeks tied the game from the foul-line 32 seconds from full-time.
	   MacCulloch again came to the fore at the start of the extra
period, opening with a strong basket, and converting a bonus shot
from the foul line.
	   Heal and Gaze both missed three-point attempts and two-pointers
to Canada's Meeks and guard Sherman Hamilton made it a seven-point
lead that sealed the match.
	   Australian coach Barry Barnes said it was the type of tight
match he wanted in the lead-up to the world championships.
	   ``That's the competition we want, we're not that hot we're going
to win every game we play,'' Barnes said.

Arrested ordered for actress accused of violating Islamic law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court on Wednesday ordered the
arrest of an actress charged with violating an Islamic law that
prohibits an unmarried man and woman from being alone together in a
room.
	   The warrant against actress-producer Julie Dahlan was issued by
the Shariah Court in the northern state of Penang after she failed
to appear for a hearing on the charge of khalwat, or ``close
proximity,'' the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   Offenders are publicly tried in Islamic courts and can face up
to two months in jail and a fine if convicted.
	   Dahlan, 44, is alleged to have been in a hotel room with a
non-Muslim male member of her movie crew during a shoot in 1996.
She was then producing a Malay movie titled ``Cinta Metropolitan,''
or Metropolitan Love.
	   While Dahlan was arrested and released on bail, the man, an
Indonesian named Rudy Rasiman, 31, was released by Islamic
Religious Department officers after questioning.
	   Islamic law prohibits sex outside marriage and unmarried couples
found alone together in a room are deemed to have committed the
crime.
	   Malaysia is predominantly Muslim. Islamic law is not applied to
minority Christians, Buddhists or Hindus and is independent of
federal and state judiciary when applied to Muslims.

Philippine tycoon Lucio Tan to settle tax case, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lucio Tan, one of the Philippines'
wealthiest men, is negotiating a settlement of his alleged 25.6
billion peso (nearly dlrs 1 billion) tax evasion case, a senior
government official says.
	   Talks have begun between the government and Tan on how to settle
his alleged delinquency ``amicably,'' the official said early this
week, insisting that neither his name nor the date of his remarks
be reported.
	   The source refused to say how much Tan, who is listed by Forbes
Magazine as among the world's richest men, is willing to pay but
said ``the amount is huge, and the government, which is bankrupt,
needs money.''
	   President Joseph Estrada had said earlier he was considering a
compromise with delinquent taxpayers to raise money for projects of
his new administration without imposing new taxes.
	   Estrada said he hoped to collect half of the tax due from these
delinquent companies and individuals. He said he would then require
them to state their assets and net worth, on which the government
would assess their next tax payments.
	   Estrada said Tan, who was one of his supporters in last month's
presidential election, would not be spared in the tax
investigation.
	   ``Nobody is above the law,'' Estrada said. ``Whoever they are,
regardless of whoever gets hit, we will apply the full force of the
law.''
	   Estrada plans to use revenues collected under the tax amnesty
arrangement to pay government debts and fund agricultural projects.
	   Tan, his Fortune Tobacco Corp. and 11 conduit marketing
companies, and 65 of his business executives are facing multiple
tax evasion cases before the Department of Justice.
	   Tan has said the cases against him were filed for not supporting
former President's Fidel Ramos' candidacy in 1992.
	   The internal revenue office has not produced any evidence so far
against Tan.
	   The source told reporters that even if the government pursues
the tax cases against Tan, winning them is still uncertain because
he has good lawyers to defend him. They can also delay the case
until the end of Estrada's term, the source added.
	   In February last year, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously to
overturn a lower court's order halting a preliminary investigation
of tax evasion charges against Tan initiated by the Department of
Justice in 1993. It also ordered the department to create a new
investigating panel.
	   Under Philippine law, the Justice Department must conduct an
inquiry to determine criminal liability before formally submitting
a case in court. The process, however, can be delayed by numerous
legal questions usually raised by lawyers of accused offenders.

US Supreme Court looks at justice European style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - As the world becomes smaller, questions
of great import will require global decisions and the Supreme Court
of the United States will draw more and more on judgments from
other jurisdictions in its own deliberations, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said Wednesday.
	   That is why O'Connor is leading a team of four American Supreme
Court justices in talks with European judges and court officials.
	   The issues here, said Justice Stephen Breyer, are the same as in
the United States.
	   ```Why should people in Brussels be telling us what to do?' -
that sounds like people in Tulsa asking, `Why should Washington
tell us what to do?''' Breyer said as the justices chatted with a
small group of reporters.
	   Also on the 10-day trip are Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Anthony M. Kennedy, along with Chief Justice Tom Phillips of the
Texas Supreme Court, Judge Richard Arnold of the U.S. Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals, and a number of other American judicial
officials and law professors.
	   First stop was Luxembourg, where the justices had long talks
with the 15 judges at the European Court of Justice and other
officials, followed by visits to European Union institutions in
Brussels. The justices are also scheduled to visit courts in
Germany and France.
	   ``In every successful democracy, we find an unelected judiciary
that is playing a role ... in applying a fundamental charter,''
said O'Connor.
	   There are clear differences between the U.S. Supreme Court and
the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, a supra-national
branch of the European Union. In Europe, for example, a legal issue
can be extracted from a national case, sent to the European Court
for a decision, then returned to the originating country where the
case is then continued. The U.S. court can only rule on cases, not
issues isolated from cases.
	   ``We were tremendously impressed with their ability to function
with 11 official languages,'' said Ginsburg.
	   Decisions of the European court are available to the U.S.
Supreme Court and O'Connor said she and others review them
regularly.
	   Of particular interest to the Americans are European decisions
on such issues as discrimination in the workplace, religious
freedom and state sovereignty within a federal system. Knowing how
others have dealt with these matters gives insight to the American
justices.
	   ``In the next century, we are going to want to draw upon
judgments from other jurisdictions,'' said O'Connor. ``We are going
to be more inclined to look at the decisions of that (European)
court ... and perhaps use them and cite them.''
	   One example, she said, is air disasters and the limitations on
liability contained in the Warsaw Convention. The Supreme Court has
had to interpret that convention, but only after looking at what
other courts have done.
	   In today's shrinking world there are a whole network of
international treaties which have dispute-resolution mechanisms,
she said.
	   ``We are going to see in the next century a considerable amount
of litigation coming out of these treaties,'' O'Connor said.
	   The justices will visit the German Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe, where religious freedom will top the agenda. O'Connor
said there were no plans to discuss Scientology, a hot issue in the
United States and Germany, rather the legal principles of freedom
of religion.
	   Other tough matters include the question of what issues should
be decided by unelected judges and which should be decided by
elected officials.
	   ``We've been working on that for 200 years,'' said Breyer.
``They (the Europeans) haven't worked it out. Neither have we.''

Switzerland opens first bearded vulture breeding center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLDAU, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's first breeding center
for the rare bearded vulture opened Wednesday with four birds aged
from one to 15 years.
	   The center, located at a wildlife park in the central Swiss
Alps, will contribute to years of efforts by an international
project to re-establish the eagle-like bird.
	   In April 1997, the first bearded vulture chick in almost a
century was born in the wild. The protected species was
reintroduced to the Alps in 1986 after an absence of more than 60
years.
	   There are four or five birds living in the wild in Switzerland
and a total of around 50 in the Alps.
	   The bearded vulture is the mountain range's biggest bird. It has
a wingspan of up to three meters (10 feet) and can weigh up to
seven kilograms (15 pounds).
	   Built at a cost of 700,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 483,000), the
center is sealed off from the public by a larger enclosure.
	   Birds reared at Goldau will be released in the Swiss Alps or in
neighboring France and Italy, the center said. Others may be kept
for breeding.
	   Efforts to revive the bearded vulture's fortunes in Switzerland
received a setback last November when a hunter in the western state
of Valais shot down ``Republic 5,'' a four-year-old female
sponsored by the Republic National Bank of New York.
	   Legal proceedings have yet to be completed in the case, which
caused a media outcry in the country.

Ugandan rebels attack Ugandan refugee camp in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan rebels killed three people and
abducted at least 100 others in a raid on a refugee camp for
Ugandans in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Allied Democratic Forces rebels on Saturday attacked Kikiri
refugee camp, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of the Ugandan
border, the independent Monitor said.
	   Military spokesman Capt. Shaban Bantariza confirmed the attack,
he but declined to confirm the figures, saying ``it is true, but I
am not sure of the numbers.''
	   John Kwizera, the deputy spokesman for the U.H. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Uganda, declined comment, saying he
first needed details from colleagues in the western Uganda border
town of Bundibugyo.
	   Kikiri is opposite Bundibugyo, which is about 390 kilometers
(242 miles) west of Kampala.
	   The Ugandans fled to Congo last year after the ADF attacked
their villages and temporarily occupied Bundibugyo.
	   The rebels, who are seeking President Yoweri Museveni's ouster,
operate from bases in the thickly forested Rwenzori Mountains that
form the border between Uganda and Congo.
	   The rebels include remnants of former Ugandan armies, Muslim
fighters and soldiers of the former armies of Rwanda and Zaire _
now Congo.
	   Government troops mounted a major offensive along the border
after the rebels June 8 set fire to dormitories, killing an
estimated 80 students in Kamarole (Fort Portal), 315 kilometers
(195 miles) west of Kampala.
	   An additional 100 students are missing and were presumed
abducted by the rebels.

Crane rips outer skin of container loaded with nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) _ A crane ripped the metal covering of a
nuclear waste rail container Wednesday as it was loading the
container onto a truck. Police and nuclear safety officials found
no leaks of dangerous waste.
	   The accident happened at 8:30 a.m. at the Magdeburg-Rothensee
train station, in northern Germany, where the waste was set for
transport to a storage center 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in
Morsleben.
	   The crane ripped a 60-centimeter- (23 1/2-inch-) long tear in
the container covering but did not damage the thick concrete
underneath.
	   Environment Minister Angelika Merkel last month ordered
increased vigilance in reporting nuclear accidents after reports
that companies for years have been shipping nuclear waste in
containers that leaked radiation.

Minister: Political opponents to blame for power cuts outcry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's electricity minister blamed
political opponents Wednesday for a public outcry over power cuts
that have affected 1 million people.
	   Rationing was introduced this month after technical problems at
a major power plant cut electricity supplies. The state-run
electricity company had said that rationing would continue for two
more months until the repairs are completed.
	   The decision has caused mounting anger, and some have blamed
corruption for failure to repair the network eight years after the
end of the civil war and despite tens of millions of dollars
already spent on restoration projects.
	   But Elie Hobeika, the minister of electricity and hydraulic
resources, accused his political opponents _ whom he did not name _
of being behind what he described as a campaign against him.
	   ``They're trying to hinder my political career by saying that
power outages are due to commissions I granted to my followers here
and there,'' Hobeika told reporters at his office. ``All these
allegations are baseless.''
	   Hobeika, a former Christian militia chief during the 1975-90
civil war, is an aspirant to the Lebanese presidency when President
Elias Hrawi's term expires in November.
	   He had promised around-the-clock electricity to Lebanese homes
after years in the dark during the war and came under fire when
electricity was interrupted in central Lebanon.
	   ``Since Hobeika took over the electricity company, the value of
candles and kerosene lights went up,'' columnist Faisal Salman
wrote in the leftist As-Safir newspaper.
	   Since 1992, the government has signed 47 contracts worth more
than dlrs 1 billion to rebuild the electricity network. Only 28
projects, costing dlrs 372 million, have been completed so far.

Supporters of slain lawmaker pick successor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) - A Communist lawmaker was selected Wednesday to
head the anti-government movement founded by Lev Rokhlin, a
prominent legislator who was shot dead last week.
	   Rokhlin, 51, was a former general who was killed at his country
home last Friday. His wife, Tamara, said she shot her husband and
her fingerprints were found on the weapon, police said.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the chairman of the parliament's security
affairs committee, was chosen to replace Rokhlin as chairman of the
Movement in Support of the Armed Forces, a group Rokhlin founded
last year.
	   Like Rokhlin, Ilyukhin is a vocal critic of President Boris
Yeltsin. Ilyukhin recently initiated an impeachment motion against
Yeltsin that is currently under consideration in parliament's lower
house, the State Duma.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian media continued to offer up various
theories about Rokhlin's death.
	   The weekly Argumenty i Fakty quoted unidentified friends of
Rokhlin as saying Mrs. Rokhlin, angry that her husband had left a
pro-government party last year and lost his perks, had threatened
to kill him on several occasions.
	   The newspaper also speculated that Rokhlin could have been
killed by those who feared he was going to expose military
corruption, or by government officials worried that Rokhlin might
organize protests by disgruntled former military officers.
	   A number of opposition politicians and newspapers have
speculated about how Rokhlin was killed, but they have not produced
any evidence to contradict the police statements.
	   The liberal Noviye Izvestia claimed the former general was
murdered by a group of professional killers, possibly acting on
official blessing. It even had an elaborate map on its front page
showing how this might have happened.
	   The newspaper claimed that agents of the Russian Federal
Security Service had been bugging Rokhlin's house and following his
movements but suddenly withdrew on the eve of the murder.
	   Rokhlin's daughter, Yelena, claimed that Mrs. Rokhlin professed
her innocence shortly before her arrest. But Mrs. Rokhlin agreed to
confess to the killing because unidentified assailants threatened
to return and kill all of the family if she pointed a finger at
them.

EU conditionally approves MCI-Worldcom merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with MCI-Worldcom welcoming approval, ADDS details,
EDITS to conform
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators conditionally
approved the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S. telecommunications
groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom Inc. Wednesday,
pending the sale of MCI's Internet business.
	   Approval from the European Commission had been widely expected
after the companies accepted its demand they divest overlapping
businesses, primarily MCI's Internet interests.
	   ``The parties have committed to divesting MCI's Internet assets,
thus eliminating the overlap,'' the 20-member EU executive body
said in a statement.
	   ``Subject to full compliance with these conditions, the
Commission has therefore declared the concentration compatible with
the common market.''
	   Without the sale of MCI's Internet businesses, the merged
company would control around 50 percent of the market, which the EU
said would be an unfairly dominant position.
	   In a statement, Worldcom and MCI welcomed the decision and said
they anticipated closing the merger this summer following final
regulatory approval from American authorities.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. The merger
would be the second-richest in the telecommunications industry
after SBC Communications Inc.'s planned dlrs 60.1 billion purchase
of rival Baby Bell Ameritech Corp.
	   The merger needed EU approval because the companies do business
in Europe.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks all mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc. It can demand changes
to, or veto, those it judges infringe European laws governing fair
competition.
	   The alliance, proposed in November, continues a global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The EU authorities stressed they have cooperated closely with
U.S. Department of Justice, which has yet to give its approval to
the merger.
	   The Commission said it may appoint a trustee to ensure the
companies comply with the conditions, and added that they must seek
consent from European and U.S. authorities on the proposed buyer of
MCI's Internet business, which is worth an estimated dlrs 4
billion.
	   In May, MCI agreed to sell part of its Internet holdings to
Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications PLC.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Lebanon and Kuwait

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Canadian company is to upgrade
Lebanon's antiquated postal services, investing up to dlrs 92
million, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   As-Safir said the Cabinet approved the deal last week, but the
Canadian embassy would not confirm it.
	   Quoting government documents, the newspaper said the Canadian
firm is to set up a company with a capital of dlrs 20 million to
run the postal service. CPSML/PROFAC will own two-thirds of the
shares and one third will be sold to private Lebanese investors.
	   In terms of the deal, CPSML/PROFAC must invest between dlrs 50
million and dlrs 91.9 million over the 12-year period of the
contract, the newspaper said. The contract can be extended for
another three years.
	   At least dlrs 37.3 million will be spent on technology and
development and dlrs 26.2 million on machines and equipment, said
As-Safir.
	   The postal service, like other public services in Lebanon,
suffered greatly during the 1975-90 civil war. Although it has
improved in recent years, home delivery remains almost
non-existent.
	   It sometimes takes several months for a letter posted locally to
reach an address in Lebanon.
	   Since 1995 the government has sought a formula to upgrade the
service without burdening the national treasury, which faces a
budget deficit.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Parliament has approved the 1998-99 budget of the
government's Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, with an
estimated surplus of 158.18 million dinars (dlrs 516.92 million).
	   The 1998-99 budget for what is virtually Kuwait's foreign aid
agency forecasts a revenue of 167.4 million dinars and an
expenditure of 9.22 million dinars.
	   All but two of the 42 lawmakers who attended the house's weekly
session on Tuesday voted for the budget, which started at the
beginning of this month.
	   Figures for the previous budget were not available, but the fund
had a surplus of 149.85 million dinars (dlrs 489.70 million) in
fiscal 1996-97.
	   Around 86 countries have benefited from the fund's soft,
long-term loans since its inception in 1962. The borrowers are Arab
as well as non-Arab developing states.
	   The fund's assets are estimated at around 3 billion dinars (dlrs
9.80 billion).

South Korea to expel Russian diplomat in retaliation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian reaction, grafs 6-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea ordered the expulsion of a
Russian diplomat Wednesday, four days after one of its own envoys
was kicked out of Moscow on spying charges.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Oleg N. Abramkin, one of six embassy
councilors, was declared persona non grata and given three days to
leave the country.
	   The ministry said Abramkin had engaged in ``activities that go
against his status as a diplomat.'' That's a common diplomatic
euphemism for spying, but the ministry did not elaborate.
	   South Korea had been promising ``retaliatory measures'' ever
since Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at its embassy in Moscow,
was ordered expelled last week.
	   ``Despite our action, we hope that the friendly relations
between South Korea and Russia will be maintained and further
developed,'' ministry spokesman Lee Jo-jin said.
	   In Moscow, the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Deputy
Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin as calling South Korea's action
``an absolutely unwarranted and inequitable response.''
	   He said he had conveyed Russia's displeasure to South Korean
Ambassador Lee In-ho.
	   Interfax also quoted Karasin as saying Seoul's decision was ``an
unprovoked escalation of tension in Russian-Korean relations,'' and
``the responsibility for the possible consequences of this decision
will be borne by the Korean side.''
	   On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said Cho had obtained classified data from a Russian
contact. He urged Seoul not to use Cho's expulsion as a pretext for
retaliation.
	   Cho was detained for about two hours after he met with the
alleged contact last Friday, then ordered to leave Russia for
``unlawful activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
	   South Korea protested the way Russia handled the case,
especially Cho's brief detention by Federal Security officials
despite his diplomatic immunity.
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB,
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy
chief of the Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, which deals
with both North and South Korea as well as China and Mongolia.
	   It planned to charge Moiseyev with turning over classified
information to South Korea.
	   Moiseyev has remained in jail since his arrest.
	   It was the first time a South Korean diplomat had been expelled
by Russia since the two countries opened diplomatic ties in 1990.

Hungary trade regime favors domestic and European producers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Hungary's increasingly Euro-centered trade
policies, aimed at achieving European Union membership, are putting
non-European manufacturers of some products at a disadvantage, a
trade report out Wednesday said.
	   Tariffs and restrictions on imports and exports of cars favor
European automobile firms and two Hungarian producers, Opel Hungary
and Magyar Suzuki, the 115-page World Trade Organization review
said.
	   ``This is not only to the detriment of producers of other
imported cars, but also at the expense of domestic industries that
receive lower levels of protection,'' the report said.
	   EU producers of textiles, clothing and footwear also have
preferential access to the Hungarian market.
	   Hungary's need to bring its farming policies more in line with
the EU, which provides higher support to European farmers, ``could
well lead to a less liberal trade regime,'' the report said.
	   The WTO review warned that Hungary will face challenges in
reconciling its drive to join the European Union with its continued
participation in WTO and regional trade agreements.
	   The Hungarian government insisted in a report to the WTO that
bringing its legislation in line with European Union law is
unlikely to produce problems in Hungary's trade relations with
other countries.
	   The report by the WTO secretariat was compiled as part of a
two-day WTO meeting in Geneva reviewing Hungary's trade policies.
	   The study praised Hungary for making a rapid transition to a
market economy under extremely difficult economic and social
conditions.
	   While further changes are needed, the country has already
dramatically readjusted its trade policies towards European Union
and Central European Free Trade Agreement members, the report said.
	   Most tariff and quantitative limits on trade between Hungary and
the EU have been removed.
	   Between 1990 and 1996, the EU's share of Hungary's total exports
grew to nearly 63 percent from 45 percent while its share of
imports from the EU increased to almost 60 percent from 49 percent.
	   Considerable progress has been made in bringing Hungarian
standards in line with international and European norms, the study
said.
	   But enforcement of tax and other laws remains an important
problem, it added.

Attacks jeopardize Angola's delayed peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Attacks by suspected members of the former
rebel movement UNITA on police and civilians in remote areas of the
country are threatening to derail Angola's 1994 peace pact, a
United Nations spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The situation in Angola is ``very tense,'' U.N. spokesman David
Wimhurst told The Associated Press.
	   Sixteen policemen were killed in an ambush on Monday in Lunda
Norte province, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Luanda,
police said.
	   The government said army units had later clashed with the gunmen
and that thousands of people had fled the fighting. No further
details were provided nor was the report independently verified.
	   The clash came after gunmen shot 10 people dead in an attack on
a bus in the same province on July 4, according to government
officials.
	   The government alleges that remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong
guerilla army are responsible for the attacks. UNITA has angrily
rejected the accusations and blames roaming gangs of bandits for
the incidents.
	   The U.N. mission monitoring the peace agreement has just 1,200
staff in the vast southwest African nation and is unable to confirm
the government's claims, Wimhurst said.
	   ``We're just trying to keep a lid on it. We're urging restraint
on both sides,'' Wimhurst said.
	   Implementation of the peace deal, which ended a two-decade civil
war, has been delayed by lingering hostility between the government
and UNITA, whose name is a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   U.N. special Angolan envoy Maj. Kofi Obeng was scheduled to meet
Wednesday with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi at Andulo, the rebel
chief's central highland base, about 480 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of Luanda.
	   ``Our aim is to ensure that war does not break out again,''
Obeng told reporters before leaving Luanda.
	   Savimbi has refused to quit his stronghold _ one of four towns
that must still be returned to government control _ because he says
he fears for his safety in the capital.

From studs to spuds: Israeli men gain weight watching World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The guys in shorts in France may be sweating it
out, but the Israeli World Cup fans watching them on TV only have
extra pounds to show as the soccer tournament is winding down.
	   Seventy-five percent of Israeli men watching the soccer event
have gained between at least 3.3 pounds (1.5 kilos) and 5.5 pounds
(2.5 kilos), according to a telephone survey of 115 men conducted
by an Israeli diet food company.
	   The source of this transformation from studs to spuds over the
past three weeks can be traced to the mens' increased junk food
intake and reduced physical activity, the survey found.
	   Most of the men have traded visits to the gym for long hours at
home on the couch, watching match after match as they munch down.
	   Top on the list of favored noshes were sunflower seeds which
Israeli men split, spit, and eat as part of their soccer watching
ritual.

Australian fugitive Skase denied residency by Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Fugitive Australian businessman
Christopher Skase has 15 days to get out of Spain after an
application to renew his residency permit was denied, the
Australian government said Wednesday.
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said that while the
decision means substantial inconvenience for the failed tycoon, it
was no guarantee Skase would return to Australia.
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
the Spanish resort island of Majorca, where he fled after being
charged in 1992 in relation to the U.S. dlrs 930 million (1.5
billion Australian dollar) collapse of his Qintex group of
companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was not well enough to return to Australia.
	   Vanstone said Skase had been informed of Spain's decision
Tuesday, giving him 15 days from Wednesday to either leave the
country or launch an appeal.
	   ``It is very important to stress that Mr. Skase does have
judicial appeal processes available to him,'' Vanstone told
reporters.
	   Two weeks ago, Skase launched proceedings against Spain's
earlier refusal to grant him Spanish identity documents. That
appeal followed Spain's delivery of Skase's Australian passport to
the Australian government.
	   Vanstone said Skase is not obliged to return to Australia if he
can find another country to go to, and that ``presumably ... he has
made plans.''
	   She added, ``I would hope that Mr. Skase would simply decide
that enough is enough and come home and face Australian justice.
After all, he claims he's innocent of any wrongdoing.''

EU tells BA-American, Star Alliance to surrender airport slots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Virgin; CLARIFIES in 18th graf that
slots refer to flights between London and United States
 &UR; AP Photos BRU101
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ British Airways and American Airlines
must shed up to 267 weekly takeoff and landing slots at London
airports in return for European Union approval of their alliance,
the EU's top regulator said Wednesday.
	   EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert also demanded the
companies cut the frequency of their flights from London to Dallas,
Miami and Chicago, if requested by competitors in the six months
after the alliance is launched.
	   In a second announcement, Van Miert issued a preliminary ruling
on a rival alliance led by Germany's Lufthansa, Scandinavian Air
Services and United Airlines. He said Lufthansa and its partners in
the Star Alliance must surrender 108 slots at Frankfurt and
Copenhagen airports.
	   British Airways Chief Executive, Bob Ayling, called BA's pact
with American ``positive news,'' adding he is ``now even more
hopeful that regulatory approval will be given.''
	   But Ayling said he was unhappy that regulators want the alliance
to give up so much.
	   ``Some of the terms being suggested by Brussels are too harsh
and would penalize the airline and Britain unfairly,'' Ayling said
in a statement.
	   ``Every lost slot means lost flights, lost business, lost
service for customers. Every lost slot means 30 jobs we cannot
create.''
	   BA's rivals at Virgin Atlantic Airways said the conditions were
not tough enough.
	   ``The alliance is still unacceptable in principle as it will
create a virtual monopoly between Britain and America on the
world's busiest long-haul airline routes,'' Virgin said in a
statement.
	   Van Miert told a news conference the EU Commission needed more
time to consider other problems relating to ticketing arrangements
with travel agents and frequent flyer programs under the
BA-American alliance.
	   ``We have not solved all the problems, but slots and frequencies
have been decided now by the Commission,'' Van Miert said.
	   Final go-ahead for the BA-American pact could still be months
away and will eventually need approval from national regulators in
Britain and the United States.
	   Britain's trade secretary, Margaret Beckett, said she intends to
approve the alliance if measures are taken to ensure fair
competition on transatlantic routes into London.
	   She said Britain's stance will be compatible with the EU
decision.
	   The airlines and their competitors will be able to submit
opinions on the provisional rulings over the summer, which could
lead to a definitive ruling from the Commission, the EU's 20-member
executive body, in the autumn.
	   American authorities are making approval contingent on Britain
negotiating an ``open skies'' agreement with the United States.
	   When BA and American announced their intention to link-up in
1996, competing airlines complained the alliance would control 60
percent of the traffic between Britain and United States, squeeze
competitors out of the skies and push up prices for transatlantic
travelers.
	   To prevent that, Van Miert said BA and American will have to
relinquish up to 267 of their 770 current weekly takeoff and
landing slots for U.S. flights at London's Gatwick and Heathrow
airports, if so requested by competitors.
	   ``The slots are to be given up without compensation,'' the
statement added.
	   The EU said it expected to rule by the end of the year on two
other transatlantic airline alliances, one between Northwest and
KLM, the other involving Delta, Sabena, Austrian Airlines and
Swissair.

Subic businesses report heavy losses from freeport's leadership
</HEADLINE>
struggle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Businessmen at the Subic
Bay Freeport said Wednesday they have lost millions of dollars
because of a squabble over who should head the government agency
overseeing the industrial zone. They appealed for a quick
resolution.
	   The dispute arose after newly inaugurated President Joseph
Estrada fired Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, and appointed a longtime Gordon critic,
Felicito Payumo, as his replacement.
	   Payumo was to take over on July 1, but hundreds of Gordon's
supporters barricaded the freeport's gates. Thousands of workers
stayed away from factories in the industrial zone, fearing they
might be caught in a clash between supporters and opponents of
Gordon.
	   In a statement, the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce
estimated losses were as high as dlrs 3.5 million just for that
day.
	   It said the tension forced one ship to cancel a port call,
delaying the export of more than dlrs 1 million of goods. The entry
of raw materials also was delayed and as much as 85 percent of the
work force in the zone was absent, it said.
	   Federal Express and Acer, a Taiwanese computer maker, are among
the biggest investors at Subic, a former U.S. naval base that was
closed in 1992 and converted into an industrial and tourism center.
	   Fedex, which operates its Asian hub at Subic, was forced to
divert flights to Manila's airport and move dependents of
Subic-based pilots to Manila.
	   ``Fears of conflict have led to significant and, in some cases,
severe losses to freeport investors since July 1,'' the chamber
said. ``We would appeal to the parties involved to avoid
unnecessarily protracted delays which may interfere with the
court's ability to make a decision in order that conditions at the
freeport be returned to normality as soon as possible.''
	   Gordon, who has been chief of the freeport from the beginning,
argues that he still has a six-year tenure following his
re-appointment by Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, in February.
Estrada, however, nullified Ramos' order.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, appeared to be in retaliation for efforts
by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases
movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon has won a court order suspending Payumo's takeover for 17
days.
	   Most of the losses were suffered initially by the factories, but
tourism-related business also sharply declined, said Bob Couttie, a
spokesman for the chamber.
	   ``The investors are still committed to Subic,'' he said. ``They
came here because of the quality of the people, the quality of the
place, where the place was and the infrastructure that they had.
And all that is still there, so we are not inclined to walk away
from it.''

 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amid suspicion and recriminations Wednesday over
the death of Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, the Commonwealth secretary-general said the military
regime is about to announce a firm program for restoring civilian
rule. He expected a new deadline of six months from now.
	   ``This is a watershed moment,'' said Chief Emeka Anyaoku,
secretary-general of the 54-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its
ex-colonies. ``I believe if this is not handled properly, Nigeria
may be in for very severe trouble.''
	   Two of Abiola's daughters and opposition groups charged that the
military regime was responsible for his death through ill-treatment
during four years in jail and by ignoring doctors' warnings that
his health was deteriorating.
	   Abiola, 60, the presumed winner of 1993 elections, died Tuesday
after suffering an apparent heart attack during a meeting with
visiting U.S. diplomats.
	   The Commonwealth secretary-general, in a British Broadcasting
Corp. interview, said he did not suspect foul play _ although
Abiola had looked well, smiled and joked when he met him last month
as part of Commonwealth monitoring of Nigeria, a suspended member.
	   Anyaoku said he spoke Tuesday night to Nigeria's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, and Abubakar was ``determined to
usher in democracy.''
	   ``So I expect him in the next day or so to make a prouncement to
this effect,'' said Anyaoku, adding that five political parties
sponsored by Abubakar's predecessor, who died June 8, likely would
not survive.
	   The 53-member Organization of African Unity said Abubakar had
taken ``encouraging steps,'' but should now immediately release all
political prisoners and prepare to return the country to democratic
government.

Christian Democrats move into opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Christian Democrats moved into
the opposition Wednesday after their leader said they would not
support the minority government of Social Democrat Milos Zeman.
	   Zeman, winner of June elections, and ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus,
leader of the second strongest party, are working on a pact under
which Klaus' center-right Civic Democratic Party could support
Zeman's one-party minority Cabinet.
	   The agreement will likely be announced later Wednesday after it
is approved by leaderships of the two parties.
	   Zeman's Social Democrats won the elections but captured only 74
seats in the 200-member Parliament _ too few to form a majority
government.
	   Christian Democratic chairman Josef Lux was prepared to enter
into a center-left coalition with Zeman, counting on tacit support
of the rightist Freedom Union. But the plan collapsed after the
Freedom Union refused to play along.
	   Klaus indicated he might offer support of the Social Democrats
in Parliament in exchange for important parliamentary posts for his
party.
	   This leaves the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union out in
the cold and political power in the hands of the two big parties.
	   ``The Christian Democrats will not support the government of
Milos Zeman under the protectorate of Vaclav Klaus,'' a
disappointed Lux told Czech radio after meeting with Zeman
Wednesday.
	   The Christian Democrats were members of Klaus' former
three-party coalition. But they left it late last year, causing the
Cabinet to implode. The Freedom Union was later formed by defectors
from the Civic Democratic Party.

EU postpones talks on free trade with Mercosur, Chili
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday postponed a decision on rules for
negotiating free trade agreements with five Latin American
countries.
	   The decision was delayed for two weeks after the EU's
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler appealed for more time to
study the impact for European farmers of free trade accords with
Chili and the Mercosur group - Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
	   The EU and Mercosur signed an agreement on trade and economic
cooperation in 1995. A similar agreement was signed with Chili, an
associate member of Mercosur, in June 1996.
	   Both agreements set out a phased dismantling of trade barriers
and increased consultations on political and economic issues. The
agreements also cover a wide range of issues from nuclear safety to
consumer protection.
	   However, France is reticent to open up trade with these
countries fearing competition for its large farming sector,
particularly its meat and grain producers.
	   European farming organizations have also warned the move will
endanger the livelihood of farmers in the 15-nation bloc.
	   Earlier this week the Committee of Agricultural Organizations in
the EU, an umbrella group that represents EU farmers, warned many
farmers would be forced out of work if the EU opens up trade with
Latin America.
	   In a statement, the group's president Luc Guyau noted EU farmers
already face important cuts in EU subsidies as part of a package of
reforms planned ahead of the EU's expansion into eastern Europe.
	   The European Union has been striving to expand its links with
Latin America, especially following the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.
	   The EU's Commissioner for relations with Latin America, Manuel
Marin, has said the EU should kick off free trade talks with
Mercosur and Chili before an EU-Latin America summit due to be held
in May next year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
	   Once the Commission approves a negotiating mandate, it must
still be approved by EU countries at ministerial level.

Mega media project to continue despite economic turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said
Wednesday the government will continue funneling money into its
ambitious cybercity project despite economic turmoil.
	   Mahathir Mohamad said that 6 million ringgit (dlrs 1.5 million)
would be pumped into the high-tech city, known as the Multimedia
Super Corridor, as part of a 5 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.25 billion)
stimulus package unveiled last week.
	   ``This project is going to go on turmoil or no turmoil,''
Mahathir said, adding that the country's future depended on it.
	   ``It is very important for our development,'' Mahathir told a
conference of prospective investors. ``If we don't master
technology, we're going to be left behind.''
	   The 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) MSC, a pet project of the
prime minister, was one of several megaprojects intended to help
steer the nation to developed country status by 2020.
	   A regional economic downturn has pushed Malaysia's economy
dangerously close to recession. Its currency, the ringgit, has lost
nearly 40 percent against the U.S. dollar since last July.
Half-finished building projects pock the capital, Kuala Lumpur, as
emblems of hard times.
	   Mahathir said most of the MSC was paid for before the economic
crisis took hold and not affected by the currency troubles.
	   ``We don't need to buy anything. We've already bought it,'' he
said. ``We just need to put in some infrastructure.''
	   ``We are going to put in every effort and all the money that we
can afford into this project and it will take off,'' Mahathir said.
	   The additional funding would come from a 5 billion ringgit (dlrs
1.2 billion) fund announced by Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim last
week to revive stalled projects and develop infrastructure.
	   Mahathir added that Malaysia had advantages to offer investors
over other countries launching similar projects.
	   ``There's no obstruction at all from the environment, the
government and the people,'' he said.
	   He hinted, however, that some degree of censorship might be
necessary. The government has already tried unsuccessfully to limit
access to pornographic and other unsavory websites.
	   ``We have not been able to lock up (the computers),'' Mahathir
said, adding, ``You really don't need some of the information.''
	   The MSC, touted as a Silicon Valley of the East, stretches south
from the capital to the newly opened Kuala Lumpur International
Airport and includes a new government headquarters, which has been
stalled due to the economic crisis.

In a challenge to government, legislators back bigger stimulus
</HEADLINE>
package &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Legislators from across the political spectrum
buried differences Wednesday and overwhelmingly backed an
aggressive economic stimulus package, presenting Hong Kong's
post-handover government with its first meaningful opposition.
	   Members of the 60-seat legislature voted 51-1 in favor of a
motion demanding deeper tax cuts and fee reductions than the
government has proposed.
	   The motion has no legal effect, but it places the government
under tremendous pressure. It also could be a sign of things to
come.
	   While pro-Beijing politicians and Hong Kong's business elite
form a solid majority generally loyal to the government, there has
been speculation that the pro-Beijing faction could line up with
government critics on economic issues.
	   Hong Kong, following much of Asia, is heading into economic
recession. The government has announced several packages to
stimulate the economy, but says there is relatively little it can
do.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang refused to make any commitments
to the legislators, saying the government must be a prudent fiscal
manager.
	   ``We may not solve all our problems no matter how much more we
spend,'' Tsang said. ``I agree this is time we return our riches to
the people, but we must do it reasonably.''
	   Supporters of the motion, sponsored by Chan Kam-lam of the
pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong,
included Beijing supporters, government critics, and labor and
employee representatives.
	   Seven political parties and about a dozen independents, forming
an overwhelming majority in the legislature, formed a coalition
last month to demand the stimulus measures.
	   Yeung Sum, vice chairman of the Democrats, Hong Kong's main
opposition, said the unity was encouraging.
	   ``This is a good start, and a good development in Hong Kong
politics. We can drop our political difference, and work together
with one another to improve people's lives,'' said Yeung.
	   ``The single good thing that came out of the financial crisis is
it has brought us together,'' said Miriam Lau, of the pro-business
Liberal Party.
	   Last month, the government introduced a multibillion-dollar
stimulus package that received mixed reviews. Officials froze land
sales until next March and reduced taxes and fees to boost the
sagging economy. The package will result in a budget deficit.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter,
the first contraction in 14 years. Unemployment is at a 15-year
high at 4.2 percent.
	   Margaret Ng, a liberal independent who represents the legal
profession, voted against the motion. She said the proposed cuts in
taxes, rent and fees were too minimal and could not help taxpayers,
but the cuts would violate ``honored commercial principles under
the rule of law.''
	   She said the government should not bow to pressure. ``A
credible, consistent government with clear principles and long-term
plans is essential to confidence'' of Hong Kong people and overseas
investors, she said.

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and the foreign ministers of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania
met Wednesday to buttress the growing U.S.-Baltic cooperation that
the Kremlin is watching warily.
	   The meeting in the Latvian capital was the first session of the
Partnership Commission formed by the U.S.-Baltic Charter that was
signed in January.
	   In that document, the United States affirmed its support for the
three former Soviet republics' efforts to join NATO. Russia is
adamantly opposed to their membership, saying that bringing the
Western military alliance to Russia's western border would be
potentially destabilizing.
	   Talbott on Wednesday reiterated Washington's contention that
Russia has nothing to fear from NATO.
	   ``If Russia can come to see the Baltics not as a passageway for
invading armies or as the buffer against imaginary enemies but as a
gateway outward, to the new Europe, of which it seeks to be an
increasingly active part, then everyone will benefit,'' he said,
according to the Baltic News Service.
	   The meeting also was expected to take up U.S. support for the
Baltics' economic reform efforts.

Japan to begin research fishing for bluefin tuna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Fishery Agency said Wednesday it will start
its first research fishing for southern bluefin tuna in
international waters after talks with Australia and New Zealand on
catch quotas stalled.
	   The research program will begin Friday in the Indian Ocean,
southwest of Australia, to confirm the tuna population, said agency
spokesman Joji Morishita.
	   Japan has been banned from fishing in Australian waters since
January, when talks broke down without setting catch quotas for
this year for the tuna, highly prized in Japan for sashimi.
	   Australia and Japan were unable to reach agreement on scientific
research on tuna populations.
	   Morishita said the research fishing is aimed at obtaining
evidence to back Japan's position that the tuna population is
sufficient to allow larger fishing quotas.
	   Japan wants its quota increased by 3,000 metric tons from its
limit last year of 6,065 metric tons. Australia's quota was 5,265
metric tons and New Zealand's 420 metric tons.
	   The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna,
consisting of the three nations, annually allocates a total
allowable catch and a fishing quota for each member country.
	   Australia and New Zealand sharply reacted to Japan's
announcement.
	   Australian Resources Minister Warwick Parer called in Japanese
Ambassador Yukio Satoh and condemned Japan's decision: ``Japan's
decision to go ahead with the experimental fishing program is
shortsighted, and will reduce the chance that the southern bluefin
tuna stock will recover from its present depleted state.''
	   In Wellington, New Zealand's Acting Foreign Minister Simon Upton
and Fisheries Minister John Luxton said in a joint statement: ``We
do not believe there are scientific benefits that would justify the
further depletion caused by removals under Japan's experimental
fishing program.
	   The research fishing is to continue through Aug. 31, with 65
boats planning to catch up to 1,400 tons of tuna, Morishita said.
After some of them are used for studies of their stomach contents,
cells and muscles, they will be put on the market.
	   Although Japan is banned from Australian waters, it can take any
size catch of tuna it wishes from other waters.
	   Australia and New Zealand maintain that the upcoming research
fishing should be included in Japan's quota for this year.
	   Reckless fishing practices in the late 1970s and early 1980s
prompted the three nations to tighten fishing quotas in the
mid-1980s.

Top Turkish general to visit northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top general will visit the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state this week to assess military
options if Greek Cypriots deploy missiles, reports said Wednesday.
	   Turkey ardently opposes Greek Cypriot plans to station Russian
anti-aircraft missiles on the island, saying that the advanced
S-300 systems would give Cyprus the offensive capability to strike
aircraft flying over southern Turkey.
	   The military said Wednesday Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, chief of
the general staff, will pay an official visit to the Northern
Turkish Republic of Cyprus on Friday.
	   Karadayi is scheduled to inspect the 30,000-strong Turkish
forces on the island and discuss countermeasures against the
deployment of the missiles, private NTV television said.
	   Last week, Russian and Greek officials announced that the
missile systems, originally scheduled for delivery this summer,
will not arrive before November.
	   U.S. and European officials have been pressuring Cyprus to
cancel the dlrs 375 million purchase, saying it needlessly
increases tension on the island and could set off a war between
Greece and Turkey -- NATO partners at odds over longstanding
disputes in the Aegean Sea alongside Cyprus.
	   In the latest show of force, Greek and Turkish warplanes were
stationed on opposing sides of the Mediterranean island last month.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sectors since
1974, when Turkey sent in troops following an abortive coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   The Turkish Cypriot state established in the northern third of
the island is only recognized by Ankara.

Mbeki holds urgent talks with Nigeria, plans to meet Abiola's
</HEADLINE>
relatives &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African government
called Wednesday on Nigerians to act with restraint following the
death of their opposition leader and said it was in ``urgent
contact'' with Nigeria's government.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki ``has been reassured by Nigeria
that they are doing their best to assure ... that the democratic
process will continue,'' Joel Netshitenzhe, a spokesman for the
deputy president, said in a telephone interview.
	   Mbeki planned to visit Nigeria on Thursday and convey South
Africa's condolences to relatives of Moshood Abiola, who died
Tuesday days before his expected release from detention. Mbeki also
probably would meet with Nigerian military leader Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, Netshitenzhe said. The trip was planned before Abiola's
death.
	   The Nigerian government said Abiola, the apparent winner of the
1993 presidential elections who had been in detention since 1994,
died of a heart attack. Some family members doubt the explanation.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' one daughter, Hafsat, told CNN. ``All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   In a statement, the South African government urged Nigerians to
restrain themselves amid ``this new and grave situation'' while
also reinforcing their nation's moves toward democracy.
	   Flags at the South African government's main offices in Pretoria
will be flown at half-mast for a week in Abiola's honor.

EU postpones talks on free trade with Mercosur, Chile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Chile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday postponed a decision on rules for
negotiating free trade agreements with five Latin American
countries.
	   The decision was delayed for two weeks after the EU's
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler appealed for more time to
study the impact for European farmers of free trade accords with
Chile and the Mercosur group - Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
	   The EU and Mercosur signed an agreement on trade and economic
cooperation in 1995. A similar agreement was signed with Chile, an
associate member of Mercosur, in June 1996.
	   Both agreements set out a phased dismantling of trade barriers
and increased consultations on political and economic issues. The
agreements also cover a wide range of issues from nuclear safety to
consumer protection.
	   However, France is reticent to open up trade with these
countries fearing competition for its large farming sector,
particularly its meat and grain producers.
	   European farming organizations have also warned the move will
endanger the livelihood of farmers in the 15-nation bloc.
	   Earlier this week the Committee of Agricultural Organizations in
the EU, an umbrella group that represents EU farmers, warned many
farmers would be forced out of work if the EU opens up trade with
Latin America.
	   In a statement, the group's president Luc Guyau noted EU farmers
already face important cuts in EU subsidies as part of a package of
reforms planned ahead of the EU's expansion into eastern Europe.
	   The European Union has been striving to expand its links with
Latin America, especially following the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.
	   The EU's Commissioner for relations with Latin America, Manuel
Marin, has said the EU should kick off free trade talks with
Mercosur and Chile before an EU-Latin America summit due to be held
in May next year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
	   Once the Commission approves a negotiating mandate, it must
still be approved by EU countries at ministerial level.

Two injured in Spanish festival bull run
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS book title to ``The Sun Also Rises.'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain AP) _ Two people were slightly injured Wednesday
in the second day of Spain's annual San Fermin bull-running
festival.
	   An estimated 3,000 people tested their speed and bravery to run
with six bulls along the 850-meter (935-yard) course through the
cobblestone streets to the town's bullring.
	   The race, which started as scheduled at 8 a.m. (0600 gmt), was
virtually incident free and finished in under three minutes.
	   The two people injured were treated in hospital for light
bruises but later released, news reports said.
	   The only real scare came where some 50 people were momentarily
trapped in a pileup at the entrance to the bull ring where the run
concludes.
	   In the melee, one of the steers used to try to keep the bulls in
a pack scrambled over the mound of humanity to make its way into
the ring.
	   Each year tens of thousands of people attend one of Europe's
most popular festivals. The event was made world famous by Ernest
Hemingway's 1927 novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''
	   The bulls used in the run are killed by matadors in the
afternoon bullfight, another of the major attractions of the
festival which began Monday.
	   In the first run Tuesday, one Spaniard was gored in the groin
and another was injured when he was trampled by crowds. The last
fatality at the festival occurred in 1995 when an American was
gored.
	   A total of 13 people have died at San Fermin since Spanish
officials began keeping records in 1924.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ One day after the death of Nigeria's most
prominent political prisoner, protests erupted Wednesday in the
southern city of Lagos, where police used tear gas to disperse
angry demonstrators.
	   Authorities say at least 10 people were killed in overnight
clashes between protesters and police. By midafternoon, the Lagos
violence appeared to be waning, with police clearing away burned
cars and other wreckage and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   A human rights group, meanwhile, said the country's military
leadership was warned of Moshood Abiola's frail health just weeks
before his death.
	   Abiola _ imprisoned for four years _ died Tuesday after suddenly
becoming ill during a meeting with visiting U.S. diplomats. He was
60.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' said Dr.
Charles Clements in a June 22 letter sent to Nigeria's new military
leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, youths and student groups
staged marches and noisy demonstrations along some busy streets.
Stacks of old tires were set ablaze on the roads, where motorists
turned and fled the area. Other parts of the city remained quiet.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in a Wednesday afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, saying ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa also closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests. Abiola was enormously popular in the south,
where a growing number of people are blaming the military for his
death.
	   Gunshots rang out in parts of the city overnight, but it was
unclear who was shooting.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Students in the southern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   Although Abiola was just days away from being released by
Abubakar, Nigeria's ruling military junta failed to act on the
medical advice.
	   Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote to
Abubakar to appeal for Abiola's release on medical grounds.
	   Abiola's death is the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, but the government said
it also ordered an autopsy. It was unclear who would conduct it,
though Marwa said the government would cooperate with Abiola's
family regarding their the autopsy.

Marines extend losing streak record to 18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Chiba Lotte Marines didn't stop after setting a
Japanese professional baseball record of 17 losses in a row. They
lost No. 18 Wednesday, bowing 6-4 to the Orix BlueWave at Kobe.
	   The BlueWave took a quick lead on Ichiro Suzuki's sixth homer of
the season in the first inning and Yasuo Fujii's 13th homer, a
two-run shot, in the second. Reliever William Fraser (3-3),
formerly of the Montreal Expos, held the Marines hitless over the
last two innings for his first save.
	   In losing their 17th consecutive game Tuesday, the Marines broke
a record of 16 set by the former DaiTokyo team in 1936 and tied by
the Yakult Swallows in 1970.
	   In another Pacific League game, Hiroshi Narahara and Atsushi
Kataoka each singled home a run in the third inning as the
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 3-1
at Tokyo Dome.
	   Brian Shouse, who joined the Buffaloes from the Boston Red Sox
last week, came in to pitch in the seventh inning with one out and
runners on second and third. He struck out all five batters over
the last 1 2/3 innings.
	   The Fighters are now 7 1/2 games ahead of the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks, who moved into second place with an 11-4 victory over the
Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome.
	   The Hawks extended their winning streak to seven and the Lions
suffered their third straight defeat.
	   Catcher Kenji Jojima of the Hawks went 3-for-5 and drove in six
runs with two homers, bringing his season total to 10.
	   In the Central League, Takanori Suzuki, who leads the league
with a .340 average, doubled in a run against Darrel May in the
third inning as the front-running Yokohama BayStars blanked the
Hanshin Tigers 1-0 at Osaka Dome.
	   Starter May (1-4), formerly with the Anaheim Angels, gave up
eight hits over six innings and took the loss.
	   The BayStars are one game ahead of the Chunichi Dragons, who
beat the Yakult Swallows 2-1 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The Dragons' Leo Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, drove in
both runs with a double in the first inning and a single in the
third.
	   The Swallows suffered their fifth consecutive defeat.
	   A scheduled game between the Yomiuri Giants and the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp at Sapporo was rained out.

Are Americans taking over the Eiffel Tower?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. company spokesman in
Philadelphia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Forget the World Cup ticket scandals, worries about
soccer hooligans, the strike at Disneyland Paris. Some REALLY
disturbing news appeared in the French press Wednesday.
	   ``American Threats to the Eiffel Tower,'' said a headline in the
daily Le Parisien.
	   ``Will the American flag soon be flying over the summit of the
Eiffel Tower?'' it asked.
	   It took no less than a Cabinet minister to calm the waters.
	   In what was termed a ``response to certain items in the press,''
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn issued a statement
reminding his countrymen that ``the Eiffel Tower belongs to the
city of Paris and is part of the public domain.''
	   The hoopla over the tower _ for a century the enduring symbol of
Paris _ stems from news that a company called Credit Foncier de
France will soon be privatized. A key bidder is the General Motors
Acceptance Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors.
	   Where's the connection with the Eiffel Tower? A subsidiary of
CFF is involved in a company called SNTE, which manages the tower.
	   Though the danger of an American flag on top of what the French
call ``the Iron Lady'' appeared quite remote, the news was enough
to evoke patriotic fears.
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi wrote a letter in June expressing his concern
to Strauss-Kahn.
	   In his statement Wednesday, the finance minister emphasized that
no matter what happens, the city of Paris retains control.
	   ``The city has all the necessary guarantees,'' said
Strauss-Kahn. ``The president and the director-general (of SNTE)
are approved by the city of Paris and the statutes cannot be
modified without its agreement.''
	   A spokesman for GMAC's commercial mortgage division said
Wednesday that the French government has yet to decide whether
GMAC's bid will be accepted, but that in any case, Parisians' fears
of a tower takeover are unfounded.
	   ``We do not manage properties,'' Scott Rombach said from his
office in suburban Philadelphia. ``We're in the commercial mortgage
business.''
	   But that may not be quite enough to quell the anxiety.
	   ``It is inconceivable and unacceptable,'' said Philippe
Dominati, a rightist council member quoted in Le Parisien, ``that
the Eiffel Tower pass under control of an American group.''

Start of next Mir mission postponed for 10 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The next crew to the Mir space station will blast
off 10 days later than planned because the Russian government
failed to pay its electricity bills, officials said on Wednesday.
	   The Russian space program has been struggling to survive amid a
cash shortage so desperate that officials have even discussed
abandoning Mir next month.
	   Last week, the government finally promised to pay the dlrs 600
million it owed for Mir's operations last year and the space agency
said they could keep the station in orbit until June 1999. Space
officials had originally planned to discard Mir in December 1999.
	   Yuri Semyonov, head of the state-run RKK Energiya corporation
which runs the Mir, said the next launch has been postponed because
of a two-week power blackout at the Baikonur cosmodrome which
Russia leases from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   When Russians failed to pay the bills, local authorities
responded by turning off power for two weeks _ a customary
practice. The electricity has since been turned back on, but
workers have fallen behind in preparations, Semyonov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Deputy Mission Control chief Viktor Blagov said the launch date
has now been set for August 13. ``Never mind, it's a good date,''
he joked, referring to the common superstition about the number 13.
	   Meanwhile, doctors ordered current crew members Talgat Musabayev
and Nikolai Budarin to start taking drugs to boost their strength.
	   ``That doesn't mean that the crew has health problems, but the
drugs are needed to improve metabolism and heart activity,'' said
Igor Goncharov, Russia's chief space doctor.
	   During the radio hook-up with the crew, the cosmonauts said they
were feeling fine and didn't need the drugs, but Goncharov
insisted.
	   Blagov said the current crew will return to Earth on August 25.
No further extension of the current team's stay is possible because
the service lifetime of their escape capsule ends in late August.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman, an ardent
soccer fan, departed for France Wednesday to watch the Croats
battle for a berth in the World Cup finals.
	   Tudjman, who also made the trip last Saturday to watch the
team's 3-0 victory over Germany, will sit in the VIP section of the
Stade de France in Paris, as Croatia faces off against host France
at 9:00 p.m. (1900GMT).
	   ``It will, without a doubt, be a great match,'' Tudjman said,
admitting that the French were favored to win. ``For Croatia, it is
already a magnificent success to have found itself amongst the best
four nations in the sport.''
	   The 76-year-old leader will be accompanied by other government
officials, including Premier Zlatko Matesa.
	   ``I wish our heroes the best of luck,'' Tudjman said before
boarding the plane.
	   The winner of the match will meet four-time world champion
Brazil in Sunday's final. The loser will play the Netherlands for
third place on Saturday.

Algeria team meeting with UN chief ahead of mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A team of high-ranking diplomats met
Wednesday with the U.N. chief for consultations ahead of a trip to
investigate the six-year wave of violence that has overwhelmed
Algeria.
	   The team plans to leave for the North African country July 22.
	   Algeria had for years resisted international demands to admit
such a team, arguing that the Muslim insurgency was an internal
matter. It relented after a series of consultations with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.N. officials said.
	   The team, which will be headed by former Portuguese President
Mario Soares, was meeting with Annan and other U.N. officials.
	   The Algerian government has been battling a Muslim insurgency
since January 1992, when the regime canceled parliamentary
elections that an Islamic party was poised to win. Since then, the
conflict has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   Demands for an independent inquiry were spurred by suggestions
that the army or government-armed self-defense forces might have
had at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   Other team members include: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former
secretary of state.

Faldo pulls out of Loch Lomond with elbow injury; could miss
</HEADLINE>
British Open
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Faldo quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Nick Faldo pulled out of the Loch
Lomond tournament Wednesday with an elbow injury and could be in
danger of missing next week's British Open.
	   Faldo withdrew just before his scheduled tee-off after injuring
a tendon in his right elbow on the driving range.
	   Faldo went for treatment, returned to hit some more shots but
realized he could do more damage by trying to play.
	   ``I hit 10 wedges this morning without any problems, then midway
through my fourth nine-iron something went `boom' in the elbow,''
he said. ``I just felt this stabbing pain and knew straight away
that I was in trouble. I've lost the power in the arm and can't get
my backswing even to halfway.''
	   European tour physiotherapist Jon Shrewsbury said Faldo would
use a fiberglass cast and undergo treatment three or four times a
day, including electrotherapy.
	   ``The arm has been immobilized and I'm told it should stay that
way for a couple of days,'' Faldo said. ``I'll review the situation
on Friday and Saturday.''
	   Faldo said his prospects for next week's British Open at Royal
Birkdale were uncertain.
	   ``I've never missed an Open and hope it doesn't come to that,''
he said. ``Obviously, I'm a bit worried about Birkdale, but at
least I'm in the right place to get the best treatment. I'm still
hopeful that I might be able to start swinging a club again at the
weekend.''
	   The injury was the latest setback in a miserable year for Faldo.
	   The three-time British Open champion has dropped out of the top
100 on the U.S. money list, has fallen to an all-time low of 50th
in the world rankings and missed the halfway cut at both the
Masters and U.S. Open.

Myanmar blasts foreign officials' criticism as `presumptuous'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ In what appeared to be a slap at
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Myanmar's Foreign
Ministry expressed regret Wednesday over ``presumptuous
observations and remarks on Myanmar'' by some unnamed countries.
	   ``Recent statements made by certain responsible ministers
regarding their concern on the presupposed situation in the Union
of Myanmar are found to be presumptuous,'' said a statement from
the ministry.
	   In Manila Saturday, Siazon had appealed to Myanmar's military
government to peacefully resolve its differences with the
opposition National League for Democracy, saying the economic
crisis and political changes in Southeast Asia could be seriously
affected by instability in Myanmar.
	   He also warned that the situation could lead to the
deterioration of relations between the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and the European Union and other Western countries,
which are critical of human right conditions in Myanmar, also known
as Burma.
	   ``It is regrettable, however, that presumptuous observations and
remarks made on isolated and wrong information could lead to
misunderstanding and misconception not only in bilateral relations
but also in intra-ASEAN perceptions, which are against the inherent
and ultimate objectives of ASEAN as a whole,' Myanmar's Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.
	   Siazon also had criticized Myanmar's military government for
depriving a generation of students of a proper education by
extended suspensions of university classes. The regime has
suspended classes several times in an effort to nip political
dissent in the bud.
	   Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader
of the National League for Democracy, had appealed earlier to new
Philippine President Joseph Estrada to help persuade the military
dictatorship to make democratic reforms.
	   Siazon's remarks came a time of heightened confrontation between
the military regime and Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy,
which recently demanded that the military seat the winners of a
1990 general election. The league won a sweeping victory in the
polls, but was never allowed to take power.
	   The tensions continued Tuesday, when officials intercepted Suu
Kyi as she was driving to meet a party member outside of the
capital. They forced her to turn back.
	   The Foreign Ministry statement said Myanmar officials ``have
been exercising utmost restraint in dealing with the aggressive and
confrontational attitude of certain elements with the hope of
inviting outside interference in the internal political
development.''
	   Siazon's remarks endorsed Thailand's recent call for ASEAN to
reconsider its policy of non-interference in the affairs of member
states. He said the Philippines has dropped its longstanding policy
of non-interference in the internal affairs of its ASEAN neighbors,
and ASEAN should not cling to a stance of benign neglect.
	   The Philippines is host to the ASEAN Regional Forum and
ministerial meetings starting July 20.
	   Many Western nations have ostracized the military regime in
Myanmar for its poor human right records. ASEAN and Japan, however,
have pursued a policy of ``constructive engagement,'' arguing that
close ties bring a better opportunity for influence.

EU approves Halliburton, Dresser merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved a merger
Wednesday between the U.S. based Halliburton Company and Dresser
Industries Inc.
	   The EU Commission said the deal was in line with fair
competition rules.
	   ``Concerns that the merger might ... strengthen a dominant
position in drilling fluid segments have been removed by
undertakings submitted by the parties to the U.S. Department of
Justice,'' which is also reviewing the deal, the Commission said.
	   It said the merger should not cause serious harm to competitors
supplying cement to North Sea oil rigs.
	   ``The analysis of market structure, potential competition,
countervailing power of the buyers and the corporate structure of
the parties (dispelled) any serious concerns'' in this area, the EU
executive body said.
	   The Commission, which is empowered to veto deals it judges
hinder fair competition in the 15-nation bloc, said it will closely
monitor developments in this area.
	   The merger announced in February between Dresser and Halliburton
will create the world's largest oil-drilling services company.
	   Both companies have diversified activities in the field of
engineering and construction, energy and oilfield services and
equipment and petroleum products, the Commission said.

	   Berlusconi's opposition partners rushed to his defense,
criticizing the verdict by the Milan court Tuesday as politically
motivated.
	   ``All of this puts into question one of the fundamental
principles of law: that justice is the same for all,'' said
Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightist National Alliance party and
Berlusconi's main ally.
	   The media mogul and former premier was given a two year and nine
month prison term for bribing tax inspectors to obtain favorable
audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   It is unlikely Berlusconi will go to jail, however, because in
Italy sentences under three years are eligible for suspension.
	   ``I will continue along my path,'' the AGI news agency quoted
Berlusconi as telling senators from his Forza Italia party. ``I am
sorry for what is happening.''
	   Berlusconi, who says he is a victim of a vendetta by Milan
prosecutors he sees as left-leaning, was convicted for fraud in
December in a 1987 film company deal.
	   Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies was debating a proposal by
the opposition to set up a commission to investigate the Milan
corruption probes starting in 1992 that implicated hundreds of
politicians and business figures.

Police arrest two men on suspicion of arson attacks

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities charged two men on Wednesday
with trying to set brush fires following a rash of more than 180
forest and brush fires that swept the country, fire department
officials said.
	   Police in central Greece charged Kleanthis Kapsianos, 34, with a
total of eight arson attacks. Authorities believe the farmer
suffers from psychological problems.
	   It was not immediately clear if some of the alleged blazes
occurred during the past weekend, when dozens of homes and
thousands of acres (hectares) of forest were destroyed by
wind-driven fires. The blazes were blamed for at least two deaths.
	   Kapsianos was arrested while he was starting a fire in brush
land near the central village of Milies, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) northwest of Athens, authorities said.
	   Firefighters on the eastern Aegean island of Lesvos arrested
30-year-old manual laborer Giorgos Kalogeros on arson charges,
after he allegedly attempted to burn brush land in the north of the
island, a spokesman from the main fire department said.
	   Firefighters in Greece are authorized to make arrests in cases
of suspected arson.
	   Following the weekend fires, another person was charged with
arson for allegedly setting fire to dried grass. Three others face
charges of negligence for allegedly not containing controlled
fires.
	   More than two thirds of the blazes began within an hour of each
other on Saturday, leading to suspicions that they could have been
the result of an organized arson spree.

Experts: Asia's sea horses threatened by overfishing, habitat
</HEADLINE>
destruction &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CEBU, Philippines (AP) _ Asia's once-abundant population of sea
horses has declined alarmingly in recent years because of heavy
demand for their use in traditional medicines, aphrodisiacs and
aquariums, conservationists said Wednesday.
	   The destruction of their habitat is also contributing to the
decline, they said.
	   ``We're dealing with a situation where we still have time,''
said Heather Hall of London's Zoological Society. ``But there is
now a grave cause for concern.''
	   About 40 conservationists, including Hall, and traders in
medicinal and commercial products derived from sea horses and other
marine life are meeting in central Cebu city this week to discuss
ways of saving the popular sea creatures without resorting to a ban
on their collection.
	   Asian countries, including the Philippines, India, Vietnam,
Thailand and Indonesia, are among the world's largest exporters of
live and dried sea horses.
	   No extensive inventory of sea horse populations exists but
drastic declines in catches have been reported all over Asia in
recent years, indicating their diminishing numbers, said Amanda
Vincent, a biologist from Canada who has done extensive research on
sea horses.
	   In the Philippines, for example, sea horse catches by fishermen
have declined by up to 70 percent in some areas, Vincent said. No
law specifically protects sea horses in the country, she said.
	   The Philippines supplies about 5 million sea horses a year to
China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, with
the demand far exceeding supply.
	   Sea horses thrive mostly in shallow warm tropical seas and are
unusual because of their horse-like appearance, their ability to
rapidly change color to avoid predators, and the reproductive role
of males, which become pregnant.
	   Sea horses have been used since ancient times as a cure for a
wide variety of illnesses including asthma, stomach aches, colds
and tooth aches. They are also used as aphrodisiacs and as charms
to ward off evil spirits.
	   An estimated 20 million sea horses are exported to 40 countries
each year.
	   Vincent said the continued depletion of sea horse stocks will
hurt impoverished Filipino fishermen who depend on sea horse
fishing for their livelihood.
	   She said the four-day Cebu conference, which started Monday, has
brought together for the first time conservationists, traders and
Chinese medicine practitioners to discuss ways of conserving sea
horses.
	   In 1995, Hall and other conservationists, along with a local
environmental group, established what they say is the world's first
sea horse conservation project in Handumon, a sea horse fishing
village in the central Philippine province of Bohol.
	   She said the project has successfully encouraged most of
Handumon's fishermen to set up a marine sanctuary for sea horses
and other marine species. The fishermen also gather fisheries data
and replant mangroves, becoming a model for sustainable marine
resource management.

Turkmenistan, Iran criticize Russian-Kazak deal on Caspian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The visiting president of Turkmenistan on
Wednesday criticized a Russia-Kazakstan deal to carve up among
themselves part of the oil-rich Caspian seabed.
	   ``The seabed and the waters of the sea cannot be divided on a
bilateral basis,'' President Separmurat Niyazov said at a joint
news conference with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Under the agreement reached Monday, Russia and Kazakstan plan to
divide the northern part of the Caspian seabed into separate
Russian and Kazak sectors.
	   Iran and Turkmenistan say that the riches of the Caspian Sea,
one of the world's most promising sources of oil and gas, should be
divided equally among the countries bordering it.
	   ``The sea belongs to all the countries of the region and it
should be a sea of peace and friendship, with a single legal regime
governing its surface and seabed,'' Khatami said.
	   In a statement Tuesday, Iran's Foreign Ministry said that ``any
bilateral agreement contrary to the existing legal regime of the
Caspian Sea has no credibility and Iran will not recognize it.''
	   Niyazov said the Russia-Kazakstan agreement will in no way help
resolve the dispute that involves the four countries and
Azerbaijan.
	   Niyazov who ended a three-day visit to Tehran on Wednesday, also
signed a joint statement with Khatami calling for a consensus on
all decisions relating to the Caspian Sea by the countries
bordering it, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The two presidents also signed three agreements on cooperation
in the fields of politics, economics and sport.
	   Iran has close economic ties with Turkmenistan, its northern
neighbor. A gas pipeline inaugurated earlier this year pumps 3.8
billion cubic meters (133 billion cubic feet) of natural gas a year
from Turkmenistan to Iran.

Strife in Kosovo continues as diplomats convene

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police fought separatists
Wednesday in what ethnic Albanians described as the worst violence
since the clash that set off Kosovo's crisis. Six Albanians were
reported killed in that and other fighting.
	   The newest violence was reported by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center, which located it near the Albanian border in
the area of Morina village, 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   The ``fierce fighting between Serb forces and KLA units'' was
potentially the worst since the Serb police crackdown on the Kosovo
Liberation Army in February that led to the upsurge of violence now
gripping the Serbian province, it said.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report. The
Information Center said the bodies of five Albanians killed in the
fighting were brought to morgue at Djakovica and said there were
presumably many killed and wounded on both sides.
	   In a separate incident, Albanian extremists firing from a
speeding van wounded a Serb policeman Wednesday and killed an
Albanian civilian bystander in a Kosovo province town.
	   The attacks occurred as diplomats from six countries met in
Bonn, Germany to discuss efforts to resolve the crisis, which
escalated in February when Serb forces cracked down on Albanian
extremists fighting for independence for the province.
	   According to police, gunmen of the extremist Kosovo Liberation
Army opened fire from a van on an unmarked police car parked in the
town of Suva Reka, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The gunmen escaped. A Serb policeman was wounded in the shoulder
and a 33-year-old Albanian street vendor was killed. His
blood-soaked body lay on the pavement as European Union diplomats,
part of a newly formed international observer mission, arrived at
the scene.
	   Elsewhere in the rebellious province, government forces deployed
more troops and police on the 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch of
road linking Djakovica and Pec, where ethnic Albanian guerrillas
control areas on both sides of the highway.
	   The presence of additional forces raised fears of new clashes in
the volatile area.
	   In Bonn, representatives of the so-called Contact Group _ the
United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ were to
continue the search for ways to halt the fighting.
	   Major powers fear the conflict could spread to other areas of
the Balkans with large Albanian populations.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form
the Yugoslav federation.

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Close military ties between Western
nations and Australia are imperative to maintain stability in the
Asia-Pacific region during the turbulence of the Asian economic
crisis, Australia's new defense chief said Wednesday.
	   Lt. Gen. Frank Hickling told a conference of military
representatives from the United States, Britain, Canada and New
Zealand that the Asian economic crisis was a timely reminder that
instability in the region can come from unexpected quarters.
	   ``The only sure thing about future security is uncertainty,''
Hickling said in his first speech since becoming commander of
Australia's armed forces earlier this week.
	   ``Australia's security from direct armed attack is dependent
upon regional security, both in our immediate neighborhood and
throughout the wider Asia-Pacific region,'' he said.
	   ``The recent Asian economic crisis is a timely reminder that
tomorrow's security issues may not all arise from direct military
confrontation.
	   ``Close military ties enable the strategic environment to be
shaped, and this is a substantial contribution to international
stability during periods of turbulence.
	   ``At a time of uncertainty, it is therefore imperative that the
armies represented in this room retain their close links and seek
to enhance their interoperability, particularly within the
Asia-Pacific region.''

 &UR; Palestinians ask Turkey to pressure Israel over Jerusalem
 &UR; Eds: Updates throughout with quotes from Cem, Shaath. Changes

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Turkey's close ties with Israel are
hurting the Palestinians, Palestinian leaders told visiting Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on Wednesday.
	   ``We were frank in explaining to Mr. Cem our concern over the
Turkish-Israeli relations, especially at this time with Israeli
procrastination and arrogance of power,'' Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath told The Associated Press.
	   Cem defended his country's relations with Israel, saying some
Arab countries have exaggerated and misrepresented Turkey's
relationship with Israel.
	   ``I think it has become fashionable in some Arab countries to
talk about Turkey's relationship with Israel and say it is bad for
the Arabs,'' he told reporters in Ramallah after meeting with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. ``I don't think
that.''
	   Cem said Turkey would never let its relations with another
country affect its relationship with the Palestinians.
	   ``If we are friends with Palestine we are friends forever, and
we do not bargain on our friendship,'' he said. ``No one can say to
us, `We will give you so and so _ but on your policy towards
Palestine you have to move.''
	   Israel and Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, have stepped
up their military cooperation in recent years, to the dismay of
Israel's Arab neighbors, especially Syria.
	   ``We have good relations with Israel. Economic and trade
relations. We don't have a strategic military agreement with
Israel,'' Cem said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Cem met with the top PLO official in
Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, and Palestinian legislators, and toured
Islam's third holiest shrine, the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Cem,
a Muslim, did not pray.
	   The Palestinian delegation told Cem that the strong bilateral
ties give Israel the political maneuvering room to carry out
policies they say are aimed at limiting the number of Arab
residents in disputed Jerusalem.
	   ``We told them that the more they strengthen their relations
(with Israel), the more Israel takes advantage of that to impose a
new status quo in Jerusalem,'' said Palestinian legislator Hatem
Abdel Qader after the meeting with Cem , which lasted a little
under an hour.
	   Palestinians have long complained that Israel's demolition of
Arab homes built without a license, the revocation of the residency
permits of hundreds of Palestinians and other measures are used as
tools of population control.
	   In Ramallah, Cem said Turkey was against any unilateral acts in
Jerusalem and said his country was very sensitive to the issues of
Jerusalem and the peace process.
	   ``We don't believe and we don't accept unilateral acts and we
don't think unilateral acts will be helpful in solving any
problem,'' Cem said.
	   Shaath said the Palestinians accepted Cem's assurance of
Turkey's support.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a capital in east Jerusalem,
the sector captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Jerusalem has 420,000
Jewish and 180,000 Arab residents.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his
cabinet Wednesday, one day after the surprise death of the
country's most prominent political prisoner and while political
violence swept some cities.
	   However, the Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's
ruling junta, was left intact.
	   An official announcement about the dissolution will be broadcast
later Wednesday, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's military leader, inherited
the cabinet from his predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, who died last
month.
	   Abacha's rule was marked by harsh authoritarianism, while
Abubakar says he plans to move the country toward civilian rule.
	   The announcement comes as the country is already in turmoil over
the Tuesday death of Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993

Dutch foreign minister to quit politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on Van Mierlo. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van
Mierlo announced Wednesday he is quitting politics and will not be
part of the new Cabinet being formed.
	   Van Mierlo, whose centrist Democrats 66 party took a beating in
national elections in May, is the third Cabinet minister to leave
the government. He said he would step down in about two weeks.
	   Van Mierlo's decision to step down did not come as a surprise,
based on his party's poor showing in the elections. D66, a junior
member of the last governing coalition, lost 10 of its 24 seats in
parliament's 150-seat lower house.
	   Van Mierlo, 66, a former Amsterdam newspaper editor, was one of
D66's founders. He has been foreign minister since 1994 and was
defense minister from 1981-82.
	   Last month, Economic Affairs Minister Hans Wijers, also a member
of the D66 party, announced that he, too, was quitting politics.
Even before the elections, Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager, a
D66 leader, said she wouldn't return.
	   There has been broad speculation that Health Minister Els Borst,
who will take over leadership of the D66 from Van Mierlo, could be
the next to resign.
	   Since the parliamentary elections, leaders of Prime Minister Wim
Kok's left-of-center Labor Party and the right-leaning Liberal
Party _ the two big winners _ have been meeting with D66 leaders to
reshape the governing coalition and form a new government.
	   They said earlier this week they had reached agreement on a
financial blueprint for the new administration.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.
	   It typically takes months to form a new government in the
Netherlands; in 1977, it took more than 200 days to accomplish.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Thousands of people were forced to
walk long distances or use overcrowded city buses Wednesday as
taxis and mini-vans went on strike to protest new traffic
regulations.
	   Last week Abebe Zeleil, head of the city's transport and
communications bureau, announced the division of traffic offenses
into six categories with fines ranging from 40 to 140 birr (about
dlrs 6 to 20).
	   The normal fine for traffic offenses has been 15 birr (about
dlrs 2).
	   Abebe said the new regulations are designed to make drivers more
careful. He said 234 people were killed and another 976 injured in
traffic accidents in Addis Ababa from July last year to March.
	   He said the traffic police accident control and investigating
department has recorded an average of 700 traffic offenses a month
in the city.
	   Taxi and minibus owners and drivers who were stiking in the
Ethiopian capital called the new regulations as punitive rather
than preventive.

	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The director of the National Council
of Disabled Persons of Zimbabwe accepted an apology from one of the
country's largest tea companiesfor an advertisement.
	   Tanganda Limited's advertisement contained a ``poem'' with the
words:
	   ``What worries him,
	   ``A man that was born deaf and blind and mute?
	   ``In his imagination,
	   ``Wind has a tail, wings and feathers.
	   ``The world is totally dull and dead.
	   ``The only thing that keeps him happy is taste --
	   ``The taste of Tanganda -- the only one he will recognise and
know.''
	   Crispen Manyuke, after receiving the apology from Tanganda
executive Antoinette van Greunen, said: ``The storm in a teacup is
over.''

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters from the
ethnic Chinese community protested Wednesday against crime
following the death of an infant during a robbery last month.
	   ``This innocent baby was killed by cold-blooded savages who
showed not a shred of respect for life,'' said Chinese community
leader Cecil Leong, reading from a statement which asked for the
death penalty to be reinstated.
	   Twnty-month-old Danny Zhong was shot in the head during a
robbery at the Mr. Beijing shop in central Johannesburg on June 26.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The most frequent outcome of a World Cup soccer
match is 1-0. In the history of the World Cup, 100 matches or 17.3
percent ended in this score, FIFA statistics show.
	   At the tournament now under way, 18.3 percent of matches up to
the semifinals ended in 1-0 victories.
	   The second most frequent score is 2-1, an outcome in 14.6
percent of World Cup matches in tournament history. At France 1998,
however, 16.6 percent of the matches through the quarterfinals
ended in that score, including Brazil's 2-1 victory over Scotland
in the opener.
	   Ranking third is the 2-0 score, with 9.7 percent of matches in
World Cup history. But that score is lagging behind a bit this
tournament with only 6,6 percent of matches ending in 2-0.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The closing ceremony for France 98 will be short
and ``centered around fire,'' director Yves Pepin said Wednesday.
	   The 8 1-2 minute show Sunday night at Stade de France will begin
with a colorful parade of musicians and acrobats.
	   Then comes the ``race of the joyful ones,'' Pepin said,
including a lot of pyrotechnical effects.
	   The 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea will be saluted with the
help of Korean and Japanese percussionists.
	   The grand finale will be the stadium taking off, so to speak.
The roof will start to move and rockets will light up and fly away,
Pepin said.
	   The closing ceremony will be held after the awarding of the
World Cup trophy and the traditional lap of honor by the winning
team.

	   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Netherlands' hope of a World
Cup title wasn't the only thing to go down the drain.
	   Many of the 11 million Dutch who watched Tuesday evening's
semifinal loss to Brazil waited until breaks in the game to go to
the bathroom, causing a huge strain on the Netherlands' water
systems, government engineers said Wednesday.
	   ``In the pauses and between the overtime sessions and the
penalty shootout, toilets got massive use,'' engineering consultant
company DHV said in a news release.
	   That simultaneous flushing of millions of toilets taxed the
Dutch water system to its capacity, said officials who monitored
the situation in the eastern city of Enschede.
	   They even offered charts, graphs and bizarre statistics, such as
the fact that 65 percent more water was used during Tuesday night's
halftime than during the interval of the Netherlands-Argentina
match.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ German soccer federation officials on Wednesday
visited the family of the French policeman who was left in a coma
after an attack by German neo-Nazi hooligans.
	   DFB President Egidius Braun and General Secretary Horst Schmidt
went to see Lorette Nivel, the wife of the injured policeman,
Daniel Nivel.
	   Nivel has been in a coma since he was assaulted by German
hooligans June 21 in Lens, where Germany played Yugoslavia in a
first-round match. Three Germans have been arrested for alleged
involvement in the attack.
	   The Nivels, who have two children, live in Arras, near Lens in
northern France.
	   Mrs. Nivel thanked the German officials for the wave of sympathy
coming from Germany, according to a DFB statement.
	   Several charity drives in Germnay have collected significant
amounts for the Nivel family, including 600,000 marks (dlrs
330,000) gathered from the public by the DFB.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Guys in shorts are sweating it out in France,
but the Israeli World Cup fans watching them on TV only have extra
pounds to show as the soccer tournament nears the final.
	   Seventy-five percent of Israeli men watching the soccer event
have gained between at least 3.3 pounds (1.5 kilos) and 5.5 pounds
(2.5 kilos), according to a telephone survey of 115 men conducted
by an Israeli diet food company.
	   The mens' increased junk food intake and reduced physical
activity over the last three weeks of the tournament is the cause
of the added weight, the survey found.
	   Most of the men have traded visits to the gym for long hours at
home on the couch, watching match after match as they snack.
	   Top on the list of favored noshes were sunflower seeds which
Israeli men devour as part of their soccer watching ritual.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ France may have knocked Italy out of the World Cup,
but the Italians have mounted a style offensive in Paris for the
summer.
	   Commemorating the Centenary of the Italian Football Association,
various functions and events are being held at Casa Azzurri, just
off the Champs Elysses, to display Italian culture and fashion.
	   ``Our intention is to make the wider public ... here for the
World Cup, aware of the high-class products made in the Campania
region, specially those in fashion, jewellery and accessories,''
said Giuseppe Maccauro, regional minister of Campania. them a poor
World Cup performance.

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ This suburb of Paris and home of the
imposing Stade de France is holding ``Banlieues du Monde 98''
(Suburbs of the World 98) for youths from around the globe.
	   The festival, which took two years to organise, drew 800
youngsters from suburban towns in 21 countries for a program of
soccer matches and music concerts during the World Cup.
	   ``The concept is we mix football and music because it's the
culture of the young _ not just the young. And, of course, it was
very important to integrate the kids from all over the world to
participate in the World Cup,'' said organizer Mustapha Terki.
	   Ojar Aparicio, goalkeeper of the winning Spanish seven-a-side
team, showed his delight with the whole event.
	   ``It's a beautiful experience because it was the first time I
had been out of Spain. It was fantastic to be here with all the
other suburbs during the World Cup. Really, an unforgettable
experience,'' he said.
	   The kids have also been given highly coveted tickets for World
Cup matches played in the 80,000-seat stadium.

Lebanon accuses 77 of spying for Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A government prosecutor Wednesday accused
77 people of passing information to Israel on Lebanese and Syrian
troop movements and the activities of Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Nasri Lahoud said in a statement that the 77 faced charges for
``the crimes of contacting the Israeli enemy and its agents'' and
passing information to them.
	   If convicted, the suspects could face the death penalty, the
prosecutor's office said in a statement.
	   Seventeen of the suspects are under arrest and the remaining 60
are at large, the statement said.
	   The 77 were also accused of ``entering enemy territory'' _
visiting Israel _ which carries a one year jail sentence.
	   According to the Lebanese army intelligence department, the
group was formed in 1995 to monitor military movements in areas
outside the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   The group reported on Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, the
Lebanese army, the 35,000 Syrian troops deployed in the country and
Syrian units inside of Syria.
	   The suspects sent letters written in invisible ink to contacts
in Athens, the statement said.
	   One of the suspects received dlrs 7,300 for the 11 letters he
sent to Athens.

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Ian Woosnam shot a 4-under-par 67 to
take the early first-round lead Wednesday at the 850,000-pound
(dlrs 1.4 million) Loch Lomond tournament, a tuneup for next week's
British Open.
	   Woosnam closed with a seven-foot birdie putt to finish with a

	   Two shots further back were Jamie Spence and Americans Stewart
Cink and Robert Damron. Spain's Sergio Garcia, the British amateur
champion, shot a 71.
	   Colin Montgomerie, seeking his first win on home soil, shot a
1-over 72 as did Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
	   Howard Twitty had a 78 and Mark Brooks a 79.
	   Late starters included defending champion Tom Lehman and U.S.
amateur champ Matt Kuchar, making his first European tour start.
	   Nick Faldo withdrew just before his tee off with an injured
right elbow and could be in danger of missing the British Open at

	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, who is chasing
his fourth Swedish Open title, Wednesday overcame Austrian
qualifier Markus Hipfl to move into the quarterfinal round of the
Swedish Open ATP tournament.
	   Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, defeated the
Austrian 2-6, 6-1, 6-2.
	   If seasoned claycourt player Gustafsson, now ranked 26th, wins
again, he will be one up on compatriots Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander, the only other players with three titles.
	   Two other seeeds were eliminated in Wednesday's action. Both the
defending champion, second seed Magnus Norman of Sweden and eighth
seed Carlos Costa of Spain, joined fourth seed Magnus Larsson of
Sweden who exited Tuesday when he lost to unheralded Spaniard
Fernando Vicente.
	   Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic beat Norman 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 and
Jerome Golmard of France straightsetted Costa 6-2, 6-4. ``I had too
much respect for him and forgot to think positively,'' said Norman
who has played far below par the last six months. In 16 tournaments
he has survived the second round only once.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's revenues from oil exports fell 52
percent to dlrs 310 million in the first five months of 1998 from
dlrs 640 million in the same period of 1997, the semi-official
daily Al-Ahram reported Wednesday.
	   The fall in revenue resulted from low prices as well a decline
in oil production: 123,466,520 barrels between January and May 1998
compared to 129,623,720 barrels during the same period of 1997,
Al-Ahram said.
	   Domestic consumption for the period increased to 58,295,490
barrels in 1998 from 56,521,630 barrels in 1997.
	   Production of natural gas over the period increased to 4,611,000
tons in 1998 from 4,398,000 tons in 1997, and local consumption of
gas increased to 4,107,000 tons in 1998 from 4,008,000 tons in
1997, Al-Ahram said.
	   Petroleum exports are one of Egypt's top four earners of foreign
exchange, and officials have frequently warned of declining
revenues as a result of the fall in international oil prices.

	   Net profit in the 1997 first half amounted to 8.83 million
dinars (dlrs 23.4 million), the bank showed in its balance sheet.
	   Total assets of the bank in the first half increased by 8

<TEXT>
	   MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) _ A crane ripped the metal covering of a
nuclear waste rail container Wednesday as it was loading the
container onto a truck. Police and nuclear safety officials found
no leaks of dangerous waste.
	   The accident happened at 8:30 a.m. at the Magdeburg-Rothensee
train station, in northern Germany, where the waste was set for
transport to a storage center 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in
Morsleben.
	   The crane ripped a 60-centimeter- (23 1/2-inch-) long tear in
the container covering but did not damage the thick concrete
underneath.
	   Environment Minister Angelika Merkel last month ordered
increased vigilance in reporting nuclear accidents after reports
that companies for years have been shipping nuclear waste in
containers that leaked radiation.
	   Merkel banned transport of highly contaminated nuclear waste,
such as spent fuel rods. Shipments of moderately contaminated
waste, such as the type being stored at Morsleben, has continued.

New Hungarian government sworn in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Hungary's president on Wednesday
formally authorized Prime Minister Viktor Orban's center-right
government to take up duties.
	   President Arpad Goencz handed over certificates allowing Orban
and his Cabinet to run the country. A brief parliamentary
swearing-in ceremony was scheduled for later Wednesday.
	   Combating organized crime and improving economic performance top
the list of priorities of the new government, which will hold its
first session Thursday.
	   Heading the interior ministry is Sandor Pinter, the country's
former top police officer who was fired by the previous government
after an upsurge in organized crime which in the past six months
has been blamed for 17 bombings in the capital alone.
	   The most recent bomb ripped through Budapest last Thursday,
targeting and killing a police informer. Three other people were
also killed and 24 wounded. A police investigation has so far
produced no results.
	   Speaking to reporters at a news conference Tuesday, Orban said
the new anti-crime measures ``will be aimed at producing the result
whereby those behind the shootings and bombings will have reason to
fear, not the citizens _ as it is today.''
	   The new administration's second priority is to stimulate the
economy through tax cuts, as well as curbing corruption.
	   Orban's foreign policy goals include keeping Hungary on the path
to NATO and European Union membership, both considered key to
Hungary's security and development. He said his administration will
do everything possible to accelerate the integration process.
	   The new premier also wants Hungary to be remain a stable partner
to foreign governments and foreign investors.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ In the wake of rioting and protests
triggered by the death of the country's top political prisoner,
Nigeria's military ruler on Wednesday dissolved his cabinet, but
left the junta intact.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar dissolved the cabinet _ a mix of
civilian and military advisers _ which he inherited from his
predecessor, the late Gen. Sani Abacha. A formal announcement of
the move was expected later Wednesday, a government spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The move came one day after Moshood Abiola, the country's
imprisoned president-elect, died after suddenly becoming ill. He
was 60.
	   Protests erupted Wednesday in the southern city of Lagos, where
police used tear gas to disperse angry demonstrators.
	   Authorities say at least 10 people were killed in overnight
clashes between protesters and police. By mid-afternoon the Lagos
violence appeared to be waning, with police clearing away burned
cars and other wreckage and fanning out in ever-greater numbers.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police.
	   A human rights group, meanwhile, said the country's military
leadership was warned of Moshood Abiola's frail health just weeks
before his death.
	   Abiola _ imprisoned for four years _ died Tuesday after falling
ill during a meeting with visiting U.S. diplomats.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' said Dr.
Charles Clements in a June 22 letter sent to Abubakar.
	   Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote to
Abubakar to appeal for Abiola's release on medical grounds.
	   In Lagos, youths and student groups staged marches and noisy
demonstrations along some busy streets. Stacks of old tires were
set ablaze on the roads, where motorists turned and fled the area.
Other parts of the city remained quiet.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in a Wednesday afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, saying ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa also closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests. Abiola was enormously popular in the south,
where a growing number of people are blaming the military for his
death.
	   Gunshots rang out in parts of the city overnight, but it was
unclear who was shooting.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Students in the southern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   Although Abiola was reportedly just days away from being
released by Abubakar, Nigeria's ruling military junta failed to act
on the medical advice.
	   Abiola's death is the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack, but the government said
it also ordered an autopsy. It was unclear who would conduct it,
though Marwa said the government would cooperate with Abiola's
family regarding their the autopsy.
	   A funeral scheduled later in the day Wednesday was likely to be
postponed until the autopsy could be performed.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, said he was unable to
participate in the autopsy and called for physicians from Britain
and Canada to take part.
	   ``This is not something I can take part in, at least for now,
and we are contacting the Commonwealth Medical Association to be
involved in the any autopsy,'' Falomo said.
	   His death came as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.
	   A former backer of Nigeria's military regime who later ran for
president on an anti-poverty platform, Abiola became a hero of
pro-democracy activists.
	   He had been drinking tea and chatting before he fell ill, said
Jim Callahan, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions, but cast
doubt on the official explanation of his death.
	   His daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   Another daughter, Hafsat, said in an interview with CNN that the
timing was suspicious.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' she said. ``All of a sudden at the
eve of his release, he dies.''
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason Abacha, who died last month
of a heart attack.
	   Dissidents also have complained that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other diplomats refused to stand up for Abiola _ and said
the secretary-general pressured Abiola into renouncing his claim to
the presidency.
	   Since taking power, the new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by releasing
some political prisoners and pledging that all eventually will be
freed.

Serbs condemned for closing independent radio station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISH HAMID &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An international watchdog for press
freedom strongly condemned the recent shut-down by Serb police of
an independent radio station, broadcasting in the restive province
of Kosovo.
	   Zvonko Tarle, a co-founder of Radio Kontakt, said Wednesday the
idea of the Pristina-based, bilingual station was ``to keep spirit
of togetherness alive ... (between) Serbs and Albanians alike.''
	   In a statement issued the previous day, the International Press
Institute criticized the Yugoslav government for yanking Radio
Kontakt from the airwaves on July 1. The move came two days after
the station started broadcasting programs from the British
Broadcasting Corporation, Voice of America, and Belgrade-based
Radio B92.
	   Kosovo has been wracked by fighting between Serb security forces
and ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence since late
Feb.
	   According to the Yugoslavs, the station was closed because it
did not have a broadcasting license. ``...No station can broadcast
without a license,'' the statement quoted Yugoslav Information
Secretary Goran Matic saying. ``This is a technical issue rather
than a political one.''
	   In an open letter to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, IPI
said it understood Radio Kontakt had been told by the government
that its application was complete and that a license would be
forthcoming.
	   The station opened one month ago as a joint-venture between
several independent Serbian radio stations and a Belgrade-based
publishing house. All its programs were broadcast in both Serbian
and Albanian, and most of the staff were from mixed Serb-Albanian
marriages, Tarle said.
	   Milosevic's regime, which relies on state-run media to help
maintain its grip on power, has previously cracked down on other
independent media, including Radio B92 which was shut down
temporarily during the nationwide anti-government protests in the
winter of 1996-97.
	   The Vienna-based International Press Institute is a global
network of editors and media executives who promote freedom of the
press and improved journalistic standards.

Nicklaus' streak of consecutive majors to end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, background, number os strokes in this
year's Master's. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus has pulled out of next week's
British Open, ending his streak of consecutive majors at 154. He
also said Wedneday that he will not play the PGA Championship next
month.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors and two U.S. Amateur titles, has
played in every major for which he has been eligible since the 1957
U.S. Open, when he missed the cut as a 17-year-old amateur.
	   Even at age 58, he tied for sixth in this year's Masters and
tied for 43rd in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club last month.
	   ``After 42 years of playing major championship golf, I feel that
my ability to compete at the highest level on a continuous basis is
marginal at best,'' Nicklaus said. ``I feel this is the time to end
my streak of consecutive majors, for which I have been eligible.''
	   Nicklaus did not join the PGA Tour until 1962, so he was not
eligible for the PGA Championship until then. He has not missed a
major since the 1962 Masters, a streak of 146. He won the U.S. Open
two months later, beating Arnold Palmer in a playoff.
	   Nicklaus said he had planned to end the streak at this year's
Masters, where Augusta National honored him with a plaque for
playing in his 40th straight event.
	   But the USGA gave him a special exemption to play in his 42nd
consecutive U.S. Open.
	   ``I feel that the preparation time and physical demands which
are required to be competitive on a continuous basis are difficult
for me to satisfy at this time,'' he said. ``Therefore, I have
elected not to play in the British Open and PGA Championships in
1998.''
	   He said his left hip, which has bothered him over the years,
seized up on him the day after the U.S. Open while playing at a
Johnny Miller course near Salt Lake City.
	   Nicklaus was to be in Manchester next week to open a new course,
and said he might play the British Open at Royal Birkdale if his
hip was holding up.
	   ``I didn't want to end the streak by having it said that Jack
Nicklaus could no longer play the game,'' Nicklaus said.
	   ``Instead, I wanted to step back with the feeling that the
competitive spirit and ability still thrived within me. I wanted to
end the streak on my own terms.''
	   Nicklaus has made the cut in 130 of the 154 majors in which he's
played, including 10 of the last 12.
	   While his streak of majors may never be matched, his performance
in them is even more impressive.
	   Nicklaus is one of only four players to win the career Grand
Slam, and he's done that three times over _ six Masters, four U.S.
Opens, three British Opens and five PGA Championships.
	   In addition, he has been runner-up 19 times at the majors. For
his first 26 years as a pro, Nicklaus finished in the top 20 in at
least one major each year.
	   He has lifetime exemptions for the Masters and PGA Championships
and an exemption into the British Open until the age of 65.
	   Nicklaus has not won on the PGA Tour since becoming the oldest
Masters champion in 1986. He was back in the hunt again this year,
getting within two strokes of the lead on Sunday and finishing four
strokes back of Mark O'Meara.
	   At the British Open two years ago, Nicklaus opened with rounds
of 69-66 and was one off the lead, but closed with a 150 on the
weekend and tied for 44th.
	   The next longest streak belongs to Nick Faldo _ 44 straight
dating to his first major, the 1987 British Open. But Faldo
	   Nicklaus' last major victory was at the 1986 Masters. The next
longest active majors streak is Nick Faldo's 44. But Faldo withdrew
from the Loch Lomond Invitational in Scotland today with an elbow
injury, and is in danger of missing the British Open next week.

 &UR; Four NATO warships begin three-day visit to Albania &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURRES, Albania (AP) - With fighting escalating in Yugoslavia's
rebellious Kosovo province, four NATO warships arrived Wednesday in
Albania for the first time to underscore the alliance's resolve to
keep the conflict from spreading in the Balkans.
	   ``This alliance has many, many capabilities,'' NATO's top
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, told reporters aboard the Italian
frigatte, ``Espero.'' ``We would encourage all parties to
participate in a very constructive way to peacefully resolve the
crisis.''
	   Last week, NATO's Allied Forces Southern Europe command
announced that the four ships -- from Italy, Turkey, Greece and
Spain -- would pay a three-day, first-ever visit to this Albanian
port as part of efforts to contain the conflict in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia, which
is part of Yugoslavia.
	   The port call was approved at a May 28 NATO foreign ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg. At the meeting, the ministers also decided
to help Albania and Macedonia patrol their borders and to hold
maneuvers in Albania with land and air forces in August.
	   On the first day of the visit, Clark also met with Albanian
Prime Minister Fatos Nano to discuss the crisis in the region.
	   ``I think even more important that quoting discussions is the
visible capacity represented by these ships,'' Clark said. ``Our
message is clear: we are supporting the government of Albania.''
	   He urged parties in the Kosovo conflict ``to recognize and take
account off NATO considerable capabilities.''
	   ``We need a constructive dialogue by all parties to find a
peaceful resolution to this conflict,'' he said. He urged both Serb
forces and the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army to ``stop
violence, come together in a peaceful dialogue to achieve a
peaceful solution.''

Pakistan warns of moratorium because of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo ISL101 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In just three weeks Pakistan may be
forced to declare a partial moratorium on its debt repayment if
international lending institutions withhold money to punish
Pakistan for its nuclear program, a senior official said Wednesday.
	   At the end of this month Pakistan must pay roughly dlrs 800
million toward its hefty dlrs 30 billion debt.
	   Without international help that payment would wipe out
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, leaving this poor country of
140 million people with no money to pay for imports.
	   Instead, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan would
consider a partial moratorium.
	   ``In two or three weeks they (the International Monetary Fund)
must let us know,'' Aziz told a news conference in the federal
capital. This statement followed a day of meetings with
International Monetary Fund director Paul Chabrier.
	   Aziz didn't elaborate on the substance of the meetings.
	   ``They (IMF) wants to help'' but the group of eight
industrialized countries already has agreed to sanctions to punish
both Pakistan and India for its nuclear tests conducted in May.
	   The industrialized countries have agreed to withhold all
international financing except for humanitarian assistance.
	   That means a loss of roughly dlrs 1.5 billion, which Pakistan's
ailing economy cannot afford.
	   Aziz said Pakistan has warned the IMF that sanctions could
create economic turmoil, spin out of control and result in chaos.
	   ``They would virtually be creating a situation,'' he said.
	   Aziz said defaulting is not an option.
	   Instead, the finance minister said Pakistan would try to arrange
a moratorium or a partial moratorium on its debt repayment.
	   Aziz also said Pakistan would consider seriously restricting its
imports. Its trade deficit this year was dlrs 1 billion.
	   Right now, Aziz said Pakistan pays out dlrs 3 billion a year.
	   ``We get 3 billion dollars and we pay back 3 billion dollars. If
we only get 1.5 billion dollars where are we going to get the other
1.5 billion dollars?'' he asked.
	   Chabrier met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as well as Aziz on
Wednesday in the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore.
	   ``The meetings were positive,'' but there were no guarantees, he
said.
	   Pakistan is arguing that the international lending institutions
should not be bound by political decisions taken by its donor
countries, said Aziz.

Novotna advances to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech republic (AP) _ Fresh from victory at Wimbledon,
Jana Novotna continued her winning ways on Wednesday, beating
Slovakia's Janette Husarova 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and advancing into the
second round of the dlrs 160,000 Czech Open ladies tournament.
	   Novotna, who won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon Sunday, was
cheered on by about 1,000 spectators at the center court of the
Stvanice clay court stadium.
	   Novotna took a 1-0 lead when the match was interrupted for 30
minutes due to rain. She then broke for a 3-2 lead and went on to
win the first set 6-2.
	   She was set for a quick victory serving for the match at 5-4,
but lost her serve. Husarova then forced a tie-break, which Novotna
won 7-3.
	   ``It was a difficult transition from grass to clay,'' Novotna
said. She spent the last four weeks playing on grass preparing for
Wimbledon before playing the rain-soaked clay courts in Prague.
	   ''I am glad I won it,'' she said. ''I want to play my best
tennis at home.''
	   In other first-round action, Adriana Gersi of the Czech Republic
pulled out of a match against second-seed Sandrine Testud of France
after losing just one game, citing a bad cold.
	   Third seed Natasha Zvereva of Belarus beat Spain's Maria-An
Sanchez-Lorenzo 6-4, 6-2 and Virginia Ruano-Pascual of Spain upset
fourth seed Joannette Kruger of South Africa 6-2, 6-4.

EU approves Halliburton, Dresser merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union approved a merger
Wednesday between the U.S.-based Halliburton Company and Dresser
Industries Inc.
	   The EU Commission said the deal was in line with fair
competition rules.
	   ``Concerns that the merger might ... strengthen a dominant
position in drilling fluid segments have been removed by
undertakings submitted by the parties to the U.S. Department of
Justice,'' which is also reviewing the deal, the Commission said.
	   It said the merger should not cause serious harm to competitors
supplying cement to North Sea oil rigs.
	   ``The analysis of market structure, potential competition,
countervailing power of the buyers and the corporate structure of
the parties (dispelled) any serious concerns'' in this area, the EU
executive body said.
	   The Commission, which is empowered to veto deals it judges
hinder fair competition in the 15-nation bloc, said it will closely
monitor developments in this area.
	   The merger announced in February between Dresser and Halliburton
will create the world's largest oil-drilling services company.
	   Both companies have diversified activities in the field of
engineering and construction, energy and oil field services and
equipment and petroleum products, the Commission said.

USAID starts new program to help child victims of Chernobyl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The United States Agency for International
Development launched a new program Wednesday to help cure child
victims of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, officials in Kiev
said.
	   The three-year, dlrs 4 million project will provide the
country's health care workers with up-to-date methods of early
detection of thyroid cancer and the necessary equipment to treat
the disease, Pamela Mandel of USAID's Kiev mission told a news
conference.
	   USAID's new project, to be implemented by a group of U.S.
medical and scientific organizations jointly with Ukrainian
specialists, starts at a time when the country has to spend
increasing amounts of money to help people whose health was
affected by the 1986 catastrophe.
	   The explosion of a nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl power plant
left about 10 percent of Ukrainian territory polluted with
radiation and has contributed to a sharp spread of thyroid cancer
in the contaminated areas, especially among children.
	   According to Ukrainian government officials, the number of
registered cases of thyroid cancer among children in the areas
polluted with radiation has sharply grown in recent years, reaching
over 1,000.
	   Medical experts have predicted the cancer epidemic will reach
its peak in five to seven years due to the nature of the disease,
which fully develops years after a person is contaminated by
radiation.
	   George Contis, director for USAID's new project, said the
program will be implemented chiefly in rural areas, where the
health care system is poorly developed and fails to identify
children with thyroid cancer.
	   He said the project would help identify at least another 500
children who have the disease.
	   According to Ukraine's Emergencies Situations Ministry, over 1
million Ukrainian children were affected by the Chernobyl disaster,
and more than half of them live in contaminated areas.
	   The government spends about dlrs 100 million annually to treat
people whose health was affected by Chernobyl radiation.

Assault-rifle ammunition confiscated, smugglers escape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A border patrol unit in northern Greece
confiscated six sacks of assault rifle ammunition smuggled across
the Albanian border Wednesday, an army announcement said.
	   The border patrol spotted a group of smugglers who dropped the
sacks of ammunition containing 7,500 bullets for Kalashnikov and
Simonov assault rifles. The group fled into Albanian territory.
	   Greece has tightened security along its 200 kilometer- (125
mile) long border with Albania in recent months in an attempt to
clamp down on the arms and drugs trade and on crossings by illegal
immigrants.
	   Large quantities of weapons have been smuggled across Greece's
northwestern border since last March, when civil unrest broke out
in Albania and civilians looted military arsenals around the
country.

Jewish settlements oppose Jerusalem expansion plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several Jewish settlements found themselves in
a rare alliance with the Palestinians Wednesday by voicing
opposition to a controversial new Israeli plan to expand
Jerusalem's municipal authority.
	   The ``umbrella plan,'' approved last month by the Israeli
Cabinet would bring several suburbs and settlements ringing the
city, under Jerusalem's jurisdiction for matters such as planning
and building.
	   Wednesday, leaders from three West Bank settlements located east
of Jerusalem said they would oppose the plan and fight to maintain
independent control of their communities.
	   ``An umbrella municipality will hurt the residents of the city
and its development.'' said Uri Yaacov, spokesman Maale Adumin, the
second-largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   Although the settlements hope to be annexed into Israel under a
final peace agreement with the Palestinians, they do not want to be
under Jerusalem's authority, Yaacov said, adding that the forum
plans to present an alternative plan to Israel's prime minister.
	   The plan outraged Palestinians who charged it violates fragile
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by altering the city's
demographics and making settlements on occupied land appear to be
part of Jerusalem. Israel has acknowledged the plan aims to
increase the city's Jewish population but said it's not political.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. Palestinians want to establish a state
with east Jerusalem as its capital and the future of the city is to
be discussed in further negotiations.
	   The United States, which is trying to end a 16-month impasse in
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, called the plan regrettable.
	   Meanwhile, over 100 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip held a
peaceful protest march against the plan, carrying banners reading
``Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine,'' and ``No to
settlements,'' through Gaza City to the United Nations office
there. the group presented U.N. representatives with a letter
calling on the international organization to force Israel to
reverse the plan.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   National weather service forecast for Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   There was a considerable amount of mid- to high level clouds
across the eastern half of Puerto Rico this morning. These clouds
were produced from some showers and thunderstorms across the east
earlier this morning. The western half of the island was mainly
clear. Showers were spotty and light across the east but mainly
over the coastal waters. Winds picked up out of the east and were
gusting up to 20 mph.
	   A surface trough and an upper level trough just west of Puerto
Rico combined with relatively strong easterly winds will help to
keep unstable conditions across the islands this afternoon.
	   The southeast flow around the trough will carry plenty of
moisture over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through this
afternoon. Therefore mid- to high level clouds across the east will
diminish somewhat. But the unstable atmosphere and increased
moisture will help to induce further cloud and shower development
this afternoon.
	   Most of the showers will form along the southern mountain slopes
and downstream from El Yunque and the islands to our east. The
heaviest showers and thunderstorms will be over the west this
afternoon enhanced by surface heating and sea breeze effects.
	   A gradual improvement of the weather conditions is expected
tonight as this system continues to move to the west.
	   Small craft operators should exercise caution especially in the
afternoon due to moderate to strong east winds.

World Cup: florist stands to collect another jackpot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ No one will be rooting for Brazil to win Sunday's
World Cup final more than Adrian Fitzpatrick.
	   The Birmingham florist stands to become the biggest ever winner
from a British bookmaker.
	   If Brazil wins, it will bring his total World Cup winnings from
bookmakers William Hill to 939,500 pounds (dlrs 1.5 million).
	   In 1994, Fitzpatrick won 395,000 pounds (dlrs 632,000) when
Brazil won the Cup, having staked a 13,000-pound (dlrs 20,000)
accumulator bet. Now, he will land 544,500 pounds (dlrs 871,200) if
the Brazilians win again.
	   This year, Fitzpatrick bet 18,000 pounds (dlrs 28,800) on a
double, coupling a Brazil victory with Arsenal winning last
season's Premiers League title.

Novotna advances to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Fresh from victory at Wimbledon,
Jana Novotna continued her winning ways on Wednesday, beating
Slovakia's Janette Husarova 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and advancing into the
second round of the dlrs 160,000 Czech Open ladies tournament.
	   Novotna, who on Sunday won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon,
was cheered on by about 1,000 spectators at the center court of the
Stvanice clay court stadium.
	   Novotna took a 1-0 lead when the match was interrupted for 30
minutes due to rain. She then broke for a 3-2 lead and went on to
win the first set 6-2.
	   She was set for a quick victory serving for the match at 5-4,
but lost her serve. Husarova then forced a tie-break, which Novotna
won 7-3.
	   ``It was a difficult transition from grass to clay,'' Novotna
said. She spent the last four weeks playing on grass preparing for
Wimbledon before playing the rain-soaked clay courts in Prague.
	   ``I am glad I won it,'' she said. ``I want to play my best
tennis at home.''
	   In other first-round action, Adriana Gersi of the Czech Republic
pulled out of a match against second-seed Sandrine Testud of France
after losing just one game, citing a bad cold.
	   Third seed Natasha Zvereva of Belarus beat Spain's Maria Antonia
Sanchez Lorenzo 6-4, 6-2 and Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain upset
fourth seed Joannette Kruger of South Africa 6-2, 6-4.

Balkan contact group expected to call for Kosovo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with meeting over, statements &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Major powers trying to stop the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province demanded an immediate cease-fire Wednesday
and for the first time called on governments to crack down on the
flow of funds to ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army in the region, the Contact Group _ the United
States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France and Italy _ warned that
sanctions could also be applied to the militants if they stand in
the way of a resumption of negotiations.
	   ``Whether we like it or not, the KLA is now a factor on the
ground, controlling at least 30 percent and probably more of
Kosovo,'' said U.S. envoy Richard Gelbard.
	   If the guerrillas do not agree to join in seeking a peaceful
solution to the crisis, he said, ``we will try to interrupt their
ability to sustain themselves through the full chain of supply.''
	   In a statement issued after 12 hours of talks, the diplomats
reiterated that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bears
``primary responsibility'' for the fighting in Kosovo, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian.
	   But they noted that his ``security forces have shown some
measure of restraint recently,'' and added that ``armed Kosovo
Albanian groups also have a responsibility to avoid violence.''
	   They called on all countries to take urgent steps to prevent
funds collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent
to finance the KLA. Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main
source of support.
	   They said they would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution to
back the demand.
	   Western diplomats also suggested measures could be taken to
disrupt the guerrilla army's logistics and supply routes _
presumably a reference to sealing the border with Albania, possibly
with NATO troops.
	   The growing support in Kosovo for the KLA has come at the
expense of the more moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,
who backs the goal of independence for Kosovo but disavows
violence.
	   After long relying on Rugova to speak for all Kosovo Albanians,
the Contact Group this time stressed that their negotiating team
``must be fully representative of their community in order to speak
authoritatively.''
	   Although Milosevic has ruled out negotiating with the KLA, U.S.
officials recently began making contact with senior KLA leaders in
Kosovo and abroad to seek their participation.
	   But Gelbard said it was too soon to say whether they would be
able to control the loosely organized guerrilla force.
	   ``We're in the process of testing them to see if they can
deliver on commitments,'' he said.
	   Hundreds have died in the rebellious province since fighting
escalated in late February, and the major powers fear a
continuation of violence could disrupt neighboring countries with
large Albanian populations.
	   Even if talks resume, resolving the crisis will prove difficult.
No foreign government supports independence for Kosovo, and
Albanians have rejected a renewal of the broad autonomy the
province had until Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   The Contact Group said it had agreed to recommend ``basic
elements'' of a resolution to the negotiating teams, but refused to
elaborate.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Former Premier Filip Dimitrov was
appointed ambassador to the United States on Wednesday.
	   The 43-year-old lawyer and former leader of the reformist Union
of Democratic Forces formed the first non-communist Cabinet in
Bulgaria after 1989.
	   In 1997 Dimitrov was appointed Bulgaria's ambassador to the
United Nations in New York.
	   He will replace Snezhana Botusharova in his new post.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Rampaging youths smashed shop
windows and hurled bottles and cans at police early Wednesday,
apparently inspired by a huge strike against the sale of the state
telephone company.
	   The strike itself, which began with a dramatic blockade of the
international airport Tuesday, turned into mundane picketing on its
last day, Wednesday.
	   Telephone union leader Annie Cruz said labor leaders will meet
Thursday and probably discuss ending the protest that led to the
general strike _ an indefinite walkout by telephone company
employees who stopped working three weeks ago.
	   Cruz told The Associated Press that that would not indicate a
defeat in the face of government's indifference to strikers'
demands, but a change of tactics. The unions may opt for occasional
one-day strikes, she said.
	   Police fired tear gas to halt Wednesday's riot, which erupted
soon after midnight near the suburban headquarters of the Puerto
Rico Telephone Co.
	   Dozens of youngsters smashed the windows of a police car, a
Burger King and a few other shops at San Patricio Plaza, the police
said.
	   ``They were drinking beer from early on. I don't think they
understand that this is a serious strike,'' said one picketer who
tried to stop the teen-agers.
	   It was the only reported violence early in the second day of the
48-hour general strike. Protesters blocked entry Wednesday to San
Juan's second airport of Isla Grande, which is used by light
aircraft, and to an industrial park including a large Eli Lilly
pharmaceutical plant.
	   ``Our objective today is to paralyze industry,'' Jaime Figueroa
Jaramillo of the Union of Electrical Industry and Irrigation
Workers said.
	   But the protesters moved on after a couple of hours of picketing
the Eli Lilly plant, in Carolina just outside San Juan, and the
Indianapolis-based company said its operation was barely affected.
	   There was none of the drama that marked the start of the strike
Tuesday. In addition to the international airport blockade then,
gunmen shot at a bank involved in buying the telephone utility;
protesters planted a bomb that was harmlessly exploded by police
outside a provincial branch of the same bank; and saboteurs slashed
telephone cables, leaving 260,000 people without long-distance
service.

Once-thriving, Poland's main film studio bankrupt and for sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Once the training ground for directors
such as Roman Polanski, the state-owned Lodz film studio is
bankrupt and up for sale, officials announced Tuesday.
	   Janusz Rau, a lawyer handling the liquidation, says he hopes to
find film industry buyers for the editing studios, storage houses
and lab.
	   ``Its potential will still serve the film world, but in
different structures with new owners,'' Rau was quoted Wednesday as
telling the Rzeczpospolita newspaper.
	   The studio, which opened in 1945, was at first a communist
propaganda machine but grew to produce quality, feature-length
films. In addition to Polanski, other young directors at the film
center included the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, best known for his
award-winning ``Three Colors'' trilogy.
	   But the heavily-subsidized Lodz Studio failed to adopt to a
market economy after the fall of communism in 1989. And the Polish
film industry has lagged as post-communist tastes abandoned
homegrown art films in favor of U.S. action movies.
	   The studio's debt is estimated at 14 million zlotys (dlrs 4
million).

Italy says it will contribute to trust fund for Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Italy agreed Wednesday to contribute to
a trust fund designed to help crisis-hit Asian economies develop
sound financial structures and to support social programs in the
region.
	   ``Italy will give something, and other European Union donors
have indicated they may increase their share,'' said Geoffrey Lamb,
the director of the World Bank's trust fund and co-financing
department.
	   Britain, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Luxembourg
have already said they will contribute to the fund. An increase in
their share, added to Italy's contribution, raises the fund from
around dlrs 40 million to an estimated dlrs 45 million.
	   ``That is a reasonably conservative estimate,'' said Lamb. The
fund, which EU and Asian leaders agreed on last April in London,
includes a dlrs 16 million pledge from European Union's common
funds.
	   Lamb was speaking at the close of a donors' meeting for Asia, at
which participants discussed projects which the Bank plans to get
going in the region.
	   ``In total the Bank, with the help of donors is working on or
preparing 20 to 30 projects,'' he said. ``Half a dozen or so of
these projects should start probably within the next few weeks,
with luck within days.''
	   One of the most urgent programs on the social side will be to
set up a scholarship system in Indonesia to keep children whose
parents have lost their income in schools.
	   In Vietnam, which has not yet been severely affected by the
economic turmoil in Asia, teams of experts will be sent to help
state-owned commercial banks strengthen their monitoring skills,
Lamb said.
	   The trust fund is tiny compared to the dlrs 16 billion pledged
by the World Bank to help East Asia through the financial crisis.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators have approved
the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S. telecommunications groups
MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc. on condition that MCI's
Internet business is sold.
	   Wednesday's approval from the European Commission had been
widely expected after the companies accepted its demand that they
divest overlapping businesses, primarily the MCI's Internet
interests.
	   ``The parties have committed to divesting MCI's Internet assets,
thus eliminating the overlap,'' the 20-member EU executive body
said in a statement.
	   ``Subject to full compliance with these conditions, the
Commission has therefore declared the concentration compatible with
the Common market.''
	   Without the sale of MCI's Internet businesses, the merged
company would control around 50 percent of the market, which the EU
said would be an unfairly dominant position.
	   WorldCom and MCI said they anticipated closing the merger this
summer following final regulatory approval from American
authorities.
	   MCI and WorldCom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. The merger
would be the second-richest in the telecommunications industry
after SBC Communications Inc.'s planned dlrs 60.1 billion purchase
of rival Baby Bell Ameritech Corp.
	   Their merger needed EU approval because the companies do
business in Europe.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks all mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc. It can demand changes
to, or veto, those it judges to infringe European laws governing
fair competition.
	   The alliance, proposed in November, continues a global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The EU authorities stressed they have cooperated closely with
the U.S. Department of Justice, which has yet to give its approval
to the planned merger.
	   The Commission said it may appoint a trustee to ensure the
companies comply with the conditions, and added that they must seek
consent from European and U.S. authorities on the proposed buyer of
MCI's Internet business, which is worth an estimated dlrs 4
billion.
	   In May, MCI agreed to sell part of its Internet holdings to
Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications PLC.

Major powers call for Kosovo cease-fire, warn rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Major powers trying to stop the fighting in
Serbia's Kosovo province demanded an immediate cease-fire Wednesday
and for the first time called on governments to crack down on the
flow of funds to ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army in the region, the Contact Group _ the United
States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France and Italy _ warned that
sanctions could also be applied to the militants if they stand in
the way of a resumption of negotiations.
	   ``Whether we like it or not, the KLA is now a factor on the
ground, controlling at least 30 percent and probably more of
Kosovo,'' said U.S. envoy Richard Gelbard.
	   If the guerrillas do not agree to join in seeking a peaceful
solution to the crisis, he said, ``we will try to interrupt their
ability to sustain themselves through the full chain of supply.''
	   In a statement issued after 12 hours of talks, the diplomats
reiterated that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bears
``primary responsibility'' for the fighting in Kosovo, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian.
	   But they noted that his ``security forces have shown some
measure of restraint recently,'' and added that ``armed Kosovo
Albanian groups also have a responsibility to avoid violence.''
	   They called on all countries to take urgent steps to prevent
funds collected from ethnic Albanians living abroad from being sent
to finance the KLA. Money from abroad is the guerrilla army's main
source of support.
	   They said they would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution to
back the demand.
	   Western diplomats also suggested measures could be taken to
disrupt the guerrilla army's logistics and supply routes _
presumably a reference to sealing the border with Albania, possibly
with NATO troops.
	   The growing support in Kosovo for the KLA has come at the
expense of the more moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,
who backs the goal of independence for Kosovo but disavows
violence.
	   After long relying on Rugova to speak for all Kosovo Albanians,
the Contact Group this time stressed that their negotiating team
``must be fully representative of their community in order to speak
authoritatively.''
	   Although Milosevic has ruled out negotiating with the KLA, U.S.
officials recently began making contact with senior KLA leaders in
Kosovo and abroad to seek their participation.
	   But Gelbard said it was too soon to say whether they would be
able to control the loosely organized guerrilla force.
	   ``We're in the process of testing them to see if they can
deliver on commitments,'' he said.
	   Hundreds have died in the rebellious province since fighting
escalated in late February, and the major powers fear a
continuation of violence could disrupt neighboring countries with
large Albanian populations.
	   Even if talks resume, resolving the crisis will prove difficult.
No foreign government supports independence for Kosovo, and
Albanians have rejected a renewal of the broad autonomy the
province had until Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   The Contact Group said it had agreed to recommend ``basic
elements'' of a resolution to the negotiating teams, but refused to
elaborate.

Shock, suspicion at death of top Nigerian political prisoner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Commonwealth secretary-general
predicting quick steps toward democracy, French, South African,
Amnesty reax &QL; 
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amid suspicion and recriminations Wednesday over
the death of Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, the Commonwealth secretary-general said the military
regime is about to announce a firm program for restoring civilian
rule.
	   Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the 54-nation
Commonwealth of Britain and its ex-colonies, said he expected a new
deadline of six months from now instead of Oct. 1, the date set by
the predecessor of Nigeria's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   ``This is a watershed moment,'' Anyaoku said. ``I believe if
this is not handled properly, Nigeria may be in for very severe
trouble.''
	   Anyaoku said he spoke Tuesday night to Abubakar, who he
described as ``determined to usher in democracy.''
	   ``So I expect him in the next day or so to make a pronouncement
to this effect,'' said Anyaoku, adding that five political parties
sponsored by Abubakar's predecessor Sani Abacha, who died June 8,
likely would not survive.
	   Two of Abiola's daughters and opposition groups contend the
military regime was responsible for Abiola's death through
ill-treatment during four years in jail and by ignoring doctors'
warnings that his health was deteriorating.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said the conditions under which Abiola was held
probably contributed to his death, and called for an independent
pathologist to be involved in Abiola's autopsy.
	   Abiola, 60, the presumed winner of 1993 elections, died Tuesday
after suffering an apparent heart attack during a meeting with
visiting U.S. diplomats.
	   The Commonwealth secretary-general, in a British Broadcasting
Corp. interview, said he did not suspect foul play _ although he
noted that Abiola had looked well, smiled and joked when he met him
last month as part of Commonwealth monitoring of Nigeria, a
suspended member.
	   The 53-member Organization of African Unity said Abubakar had
taken ``encouraging steps,'' but should now immediately release all
political prisoners and prepare to return the country to democratic
government.
	   ``Chief Abiola has come to be an important symbol of the
pro-democracy movement in Nigeria,'' OAU Secretary-general Salim A.
Salim said in a statement Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   ``The most fitting tribute therefore that can be given to him is
to ensure that democratic government is restored in Nigeria as soon
as possible,'' Salim said.
	   South Africa called on Nigerians to act with restraint and said
it had received assurances from Nigeria that it is trying to ensure
the democratic process will continue. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
planned to visit Nigeria on Thursday and meet with Abubakar in a
pre-arranged trip.
	   France said Abiola had represented the democratic aspirations of
many in Nigeria but said it was confident that Abubakar was
determined to resume a process of democratic transition that would
allow the major political forces to have a voice.

Greenpeace: Norwegian super-trawler threatens fish species
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Norwegian-registered super-trawler has been
given permission to fish in Russian territorial waters, but an
environmental group warned Wednesday that the ship could threaten
the country's fish population.
	   Greenpeace called on President Boris Yeltsin to overrule the
decision of the Agriculture and Food Ministry to allow the trawler
American Monarch to fish in the Pacific waters of Russia's Far
East.
	   Greenpeace said the ship could deplete the population of the
Alaska pollack.
	   The American Monarch is based in Seattle, where the Norwegian
Aker RGI concern's American Seafoods subsidiary is based. It was
built to fish off the coast of Chile, but was denied fishing rights
there out of fear it could deplete the ocean's resources.

San Fermin: Four centuries old and as frantic as ever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Some runners exchanged bear hugs and
kisses, others kept to themselves or joked around, but when the
stampeding bulls bore down on them, everyone ran for their lives.
	   A few minutes later and the humans headed for the bars to
celebrate their injury-free sprint in the first of the nine days of
bull runs that have made Pamplona's San Fermin Festival a magnet
for the daring and foolhardy.
	   The animals faced certain death in the afternoon bullfights,
another attraction of the festival that began Monday.
	   ``Not the greatest run I've ever done but certainly good,'' said
Joe Distler, a beaming 55-year-old literature teacher from
Brooklyn, New York, who claimed not to have missed a San Fermin
since 1967.
	   ``That was truly awesome, I've done it all now. I might as well
get married,'' said Sean Matthews, 35, a city planner from
Columbia, South Carolina, after his first-ever run.
	   Each morning of the raucous northern Spain festival that
inspired Ernest Hemingway's 1927 novel, ``The Sun Also Rises,''
hoards of humans join 16 bulls and steers as they race through the
town's cobbled streets to the bullring.
	   ``It's a macho thing. It's testosterone,'' said Bob Lombardo, a
45-year-old regular runner from Philadelphia. He acknowledged some
women make the run, too.
	   Thirteen people have died along the 850-meter (yard) course or
inside the ring since records began in 1924. The last was a
22-year-old American in 1995.
	   Broadcast live on Spanish television, 1998's first run took
under three minutes and left one local 22-year-old gored in the
groin and several people trampled--a relatively clean run by local
standards.
	   Slow-motion replays showed how experienced runners keep the
bulls behind them by holding a rolled up newspaper in the animals'
field of vision.
	   Undaunted by four centuries of tradition behind the bull run or
accusations that their inexperience puts themselves and others in
danger, a growing number of visitors take part.
	   Most foreign runners would never have heard of San Fermin had it
not been for Hemingway.
	   The best rooms at the Hotel La Perla, where the author stayed on
several of his nine visits to San Fermin, triple in price during
the festival, running 40,000 pesetas (dlrs 270) a night.
	   Hemingway wrote about the run, but was just as impressed by the
reveling.
	   ``All the carnivals that I have ever seen paled in comparison,''
he wrote in a 1923 dispatch for the Toronto Star.
	   Seventy-five years later, Ben Hespe, 21, Melbourne, Australia,
could not agree more.
	   ``We're here for the party,'' he said.
	   Over the last decade, Australians and New Zealanders have
spearheaded a new and equally dangerous tradition of freefalling
from the top of a fountain in the town center, their fall broken by
a cushion of outstretched arms below.
	   ``If they want to pretend they can fly that's their business,''
said Jose Luis Perez, a 56-year-old taxi driver who like many
locals welcomes the foreign invaders, ``as long as they are here
just to have fun.''
	   Whether strolling, dancing, playing the pipes, watching the
bullfights, passing out on the curb, or running with the bulls,
nearly everyone dresses in the traditional white with red kerchief
and sash.
	   And as the sun rose on the second fiesta morning in 1998, a sea
of red and white staggered home or lined the barriers to watch the
morning's bull run after police patrols had removed the
semiconscious drunks from the course.
	   ``This is a classless fiesta. The drunk on the corner or the guy
running with the bulls could be a doctor or a workman,'' Perez
said.

Wife of jailed foreign affairs official alleges plot against him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The arrest in neighboring
Mozambique of a South African foreign ministry official on
arms-trafficking and espionage charges was engineered by rogue
members of South Africa's defense community, his wife asserted
Wednesday.
	   Shadowy figures behind a military intelligence report on a
purported coup plot against President Nelson Mandela's government
had Robert McBride arrested to bolster the claim a coup was in the
works, Paula McBride told reporters. She did not mention anyone by
name.
	   A judicial commission concluded the military report, which
emerged within two weeks of McBride's arrest last March, was deeply
flawed and that there was no to topple Mandela. The discounted
report had linked McBride to the purported plot.
	   McBride has told investigators that he was conducting a private
investigation of how guns are smuggled from Mozambique into South
Africa when he was arrested, allegedly with a load of AK-47 assault
rifles and thousands of dollars in cash.
	   The South African government said McBride was not on official
business at the time. He has since been suspended from his job as
director of the foreign ministry's Asian desk.
	   McBride has been in solitary confinement in a maximum-security
prison since his arrest and hopes to be allowed bail pending an
appeal of the charges against him, Mrs. McBride said.

Monsoon rains kill 10 in Bangladesh

	   COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered
landslides and floods that forced 100,000 people in southern
Bangladesh to move out of their homes into shelters, an official
said Wednesday.
	   At least 10 people died in the downpours on Monday and Tuesday,
six in landslides and four in flood waters, said Ali Imam Majumder,
the government administrator of Cox Bazar, the area worst hit by
the rain.
	   Floods caused by four days of monsoon rains affected 400,000
people in more than 100 villages in Cox's Bazar district, 185 miles
(296 kilometers) south of the capital Dhaka.
	   Many people remained trapped in their flooded homes on
Wednesday, one day after the rains stopped.

	   ROME (AP) _ About 100 women in camouflage outfits protested in
front of the Chamber of Deputies Wednesday to spur Parliament to
approve a law allowing women to join the military.
	   ``We are fed up with false promises,'' Debora Corbi, president
of the Association of Aspiring Women Soldiers, told the Italian
news agency ANSA. ``The time has come for Italy to have women in
its military too.''
	   The group says the government reneged on a promise to pass a law
opening the military up to women by the summer. Debate has not
started.
	   Corbi said Chamber president Luciano Violante pledged Wednesday
to put the issue on the agenda for the fall.
	   Few Italian women complain about not being allowed to join the
military as volunteers, and most men see the 10-month mandatory
military service as a waste of time.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's favorite zoo elephant packed its trunk
and hit the bars Wednesday, toasting its third birthday with
champagne and abandon.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, the elephant, named
Elbrus, ``got a bit tight'' at its birthday celebration after being
given fruitcake and a bucket of champagne.
	   After getting tipsy, the 400-kilogram (880-pound) birthday boy
waved its trunk through the bars of its enclosure and spread the
cake all over its head, the news agency said.
	   The elephant was born at the Moscow zoo three years ago to two
Laotian elephants that were adopted by the zoo when Cuba refused to
accept them as a gift from Laos, ITAR-Tass said.

 &UR; Rioting marks Abiola's death; Abubakar dissolves cabinet &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 10 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   An official announcement about the dissolution was to be
broadcast later Wednesday, according to the government spokesman
who disclosed the move, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas, who are
from the north and are the majority in the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police.
	   Students in the southwestern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   While Abiola had reportedly been quite ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, coming just days after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would
be freed, including the opposition leader.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the U.S. State Department said there was no
reason to believe that the death was not the result of natural
causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' his daughter Hafsat told CNN. ``All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   The government said it had ordered an autopsy. It was unclear
who would conduct it, though Marwa said officials would cooperate
with Abiola's family who asked it be performed by non-Nigerians.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, called for physicians from
Britain and Canada to take part.
	   A funeral initially scheduled later in the day Wednesday was
likely to be postponed until the autopsy could be performed.
	   A human rights group, meanwhile, said the country's military
leadership was warned about Abiola's health just weeks before his
death.
	   ``Chief Abiola's American doctor, Dr. Mitchell Feinman, has
concluded that his patient suffers from life threatening
conditions, which, if left untreated, could be fatal,'' Dr. Charles
Clements, the chairman of Physicians for Human Rights, said in a
June 22 letter asking Abubakar to release Abiola.
	   Abiola's death is the latest shockwave in a turbulent month for
Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator who had jailed him, died June 8,
also of a heart attack. Abubakar quickly came to power, surprising
and pleasing many Western countries by releasing some political
prisoners and pledging that all eventually will be freed.
	   A multimillionaire backer of Nigeria's military regime, Abiola
turned against his former friends and ran for president on an
anti-poverty platform. He became a hero of pro-democracy activists.
	   He was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential elections
that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the following
year and accused of treason by dictator Abacha.
	   His imminent release had been widely rumored in recent weeks,
though dissidents have complained that Annan and other diplomats
refused to stand up for Abiola _ and said the secretary-general
pressured Abiola into renouncing his claim to the presidency.
	   On Tuesday, Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting when he
fell ill during a meeting with a delegation led by U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, said Jim Callahan, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. officials
watched Nigerian doctors' last-ditch efforts to save Abiola's life
at a government clinic. Clinton expressed regret at the ``sudden
and untimely'' death.
	   Abubakar, meanwhile, had already been expected to announce
sweeping changes this week _ both to his government and to the
country's troubled transition to democracy plan _ but it was
unclear how the dissolution would be affected by the political
violence.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The Brussels stock exchange said
Wednesday it will have to consult its Luxembourg and Dutch
counterparts before deciding whether to join a trading alliance
between Frankfurt and London.
	   ``We will analyse (the invitation) but we wouldn't do anything
before talking with our Benelux partners,'' said Olivier Lefebvre,
the chairman of the board of the Brussels bourse.
	   Lefebvre said he remains cautious about the new alliance between
Frankfurt and London. ``There have been so many talks of stock
exchange alliances - we'll have to wait to see if this one is
serious,'' he said.
	   London and Frankfurt exchanges announced Tuesday they will begin
immediately setting up a system to allow shares in the top 300
European companies to be traded on either of their exchanges.
	   The two exchanges plan to harmonize market rules and accounting
standards, and plan eventually to set up a single electronic
trading system.

U.S. says Russia can't stop Baltic NATO drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott on Wednesday reassured Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia that
Washington supports their right to seek NATO membership, a prospect
that the Kremlin adamantly opposes.
	   Talbott made the statements at the inaugural meeting of the
Partnership Commission formed by the U.S.-Baltic Charter signed in
January to address security and economic concerns of the three
former Soviet states.
	   Moscow says it will not accept NATO expansion to the Baltics,
which would leave the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad surrounded by
the Western alliance and would give NATO a presence along some 400
kilometers (250 miles) of Russia's western border.
	   Russia has offered the Baltics security guarantees if they stay
out of NATO, but the move has been coldly rejected.
	   At an open discussion before meeting privately with the Baltics'
foreign ministers, Talbott reiterated the U.S. contention that
Russia has nothing to fear from NATO expansion.
	   ``If Russia can come to see the Baltic states not as a pathway
inward for invading armies, or as a buffer against imaginary
enemies, but rather as a gateway outward to the new Europe, then
everyone will benefit,'' he said. ``We will all be safer and
secure.''
	   After the meeting, he said Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have
the right to seek alliance membership and criticized Russia for
putting pressure on them to stay out.
	   ``I can only say that I think it is counterproductive for any
countries to question that right and to engage in rhetoric or to
otherwise engage in pressure tactics or intimidation,'' Talbott
told a news conference.
	   But Talbott urged Estonia and Latvia to improve the treatment of
their large Russian-speaking minorities, most of whom became
stateless people when the Baltics split from the Soviet Union in
1991.
	   The issue has antagonized Russia for years and escalated this
spring when Russia threatened trade sanctions against Latvia.
Although the Latvian parliament last month amended its
naturalization law, it is unclear when the changes will take effect
or if they will have to be ratified by a referendum.
	   Russia this month imposed higher transit fees for Latvian
transport companies, a move that Talbott sharply criticized.
	   ``The bottom line is that no country, Russia included, is
justified in economic pressure tactics against Latvia,'' he said.
	   Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs said Wednesday that
Russian economic pressure was beginning to harm to his nation's
economy.
	   ``This meeting is occurring at quite a serious time, when
business in Latvia has come under attack from Moscow,'' he said.
``Such conduct makes Russia itself appear stuck in old ways of
thinking.''

Attacks jeopardize Angola's delayed peace process

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Attacks by suspected members of the former
rebel movement UNITA on police and civilians in remote areas of the
country are threatening to derail Angola's 1994 peace pact, a
United Nations spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The situation in Angola is ``very tense,'' U.N. spokesman David
Wimhurst told The Associated Press.
	   Sixteen policemen were killed in an ambush on Monday in Lunda
Norte province, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Luanda,
police said.
	   The government said army units had later clashed with the gunmen
and that thousands of people had fled the fighting. No further
details were provided nor was the report independently verified.
	   The clash came after gunmen shot 10 people dead in an attack on
a bus in the same province on July 4, according to government
officials.
	   The government alleges that remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong
guerilla army are responsible for the attacks. UNITA has angrily
rejected the accusations and blames roaming gangs of bandits for
the incidents.
	   The U.N. mission monitoring the peace agreement has just 1,200
staff in the vast southwest African nation and is unable to confirm
the government's claims, Wimhurst said.
	   ``We're just trying to keep a lid on it. We're urging restraint
on both sides,'' Wimhurst said.
	   Implementation of the peace deal, which ended a two-decade civil
war, has been delayed by lingering hostility between the government
and UNITA, whose name is a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   The U.S. envoy to Angola Paul Hare said before leaving Luanda on
Wednesday that the peace process was going through ``a difficult
period.''
	   ``But I don't believe either side views war as a solution,''
Hare said after a five-day visit during which he met officials from
both sides.
	   U.N. special Angolan envoy Maj. Kofi Obeng was scheduled to meet
Wednesday with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi at Andulo, the rebel
chief's central highland base, about 480 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of Luanda.
	   ``Our aim is to ensure that war does not break out again,''
Obeng told reporters before leaving Luanda.
	   Savimbi has refused to quit his stronghold _ one of four towns
that must still be returned to government control _ because he says
he fears for his safety in the capital.

Israelis, Palestinians in search of the Marshall Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The day after the United Nations voted 124-4 to
upgrade the PLO's status, Israelis and Palestinians alike were left
Wednesday with one burning question: Where in the world are the
Marshall Islands?
	   Morning radio shows ran quizzes on the question, sending
listeners rushing to their atlases to discover the location of the
cluster of Pacific islands that joined Micronesia, the United
States and Israel in voting against the Palestinian proposal.
	   Israelis were already familiar with _ though still confused by _
Micronesia's longstanding backing, which has often left it Israel's
sole supporter besides the United States in lopsided U.N. votes.
	   Israel's Channel Two television sent a crew to the Pacific last
year to make a three-part series on ``The Mystery of
Israel-Micronesia Friendship,'' and Israeli tour agencies offer
trips to ``Israel's best friend across the ocean.''
	   But the additional support from the Pacific hit Israel by
surprise.
	   ``Are they near South America?'' asked one talk show caller.
``Are they named for the Marshall plan?'' asked another.
	   The Marshall Islands are actually located 1,000 miles (1,600 km)
southwest of Hawaii in the central Pacific and are named for a
British captain who visited there in 1788.
	   Both Micronesia and the Marshall Islands were administered by
United States until 1986 and still receive millions of dollars
annually in U.S. aid. The population of both countries is heavily
Christian, with strong emotional ties to Holy Land.

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, who is chasing
his fourth Swedish Open title, Wednesday overcame Austrian
qualifier Markus Hipfl to move into the quarterfinal round of the
Swedish Open ATP tournament.
	   Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, defeated the
Austrian 2-6, 6-1, 6-2.
	   If seasoned claycourt player Gustafsson, now ranked 26th, wins
again, he will be one up on compatriots Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander, the only other players with three titles.
	   The only other seed to advance to the quarterfinal round was
seventh seed Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia who beat Marat Safin of
Russia 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.
	   Two other seeeds were eliminated in Wednesday's action. Both the
defending champion, second seed Magnus Norman of Sweden and eighth
seed Carlos Costa of Spain, joined fourth seed Magnus Larsson of
Sweden who exited Tuesday when he lost to unheralded Spaniard
Fernando Vicente.
	   Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic beat Norman 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 and
Jerome Golmard of France straightsetted Costa 6-2, 6-4. ``I had too
much respect for him and forgot to think positively,'' said Norman
who has played far below par the last six months. In 16 tournaments
he has survived the second round only once.

Bolivia opens bidding for natural gas exploration contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ The Bolivian government opened bidding
Wednesday for joint venture contracts intended to secure sufficient
natural gas supplies for a pipeline being built between Bolivia and
Brazil.
	   State-owned oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos has estimated that dlrs 1.28 billion will be invested
between 1997 and 2000 on natural gas exploration projects. That
figure was based on the dlrs 450 million in investments secured
during the last round of joint-venture bidding in September 1997.
	   The contracts to be let under the current bidding round will
have terms of up to 40 years. Successful bidders will be limited to
no more than 40 lots of 2,500 hectares each in traditional
exploration areas and 400 lots in non-traditional areas. Eleven
areas throughout Bolivia are being opened up for the exploration
contracts.
	   Bids will be received, evaluated and awarded on Sept. 15.
	   The 3,061-kilometer (1,913-mile) natural gas pipeline is
expected to go into operation in mid-1999.

U.S. Navy forces three times busier than in Cold War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a ``surprising trend,'' U.S. naval forces are
almost three times busier in the post-Cold War era than they were
before 1990, U.S. Navy Secretary John Dalton said Wednesday.
	   American ships have responded to international crises like the
recent confrontation with Iraq, to peacekeeping operations and to
humanitarian missions, he said.
	   At the same time, the U.S. Navy has ``radically increased'' the
number of exercises it conducts with navies around the world,
Dalton said in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute for
Defense Studies.
	   Yet paradoxically, the United States and its Western allies who
won the Cold War have substantially cut military spending in the
1990s, he said.
	   Dalton said he didn't take issue with the force and weapons
reductions because the U.S. military now recognizes that quality
and capability are more important than quantity. But he did
question the funding cuts, noting a ``lack of will for investment
in naval forces.''
	   ``Talk of greater quality for our armed forces means, today, a
heavy investment in the promises of information warfare and modern
technology,'' he said.
	   Regional security will depend on such things as ballistic
missile defense systems aboard cruisers ``to combat more and more
actors who are gaining missile technology,'' Dalton said.
	   ``This kind of threat means real capital investment that often
goes head-to-head with public perceptions that a post-Cold War
world means smaller navies and less spending,'' he said.
	   While the perception was born in the 1990s that smaller navies
would have a smaller role to play against threats that were less
defined than the old superpower rivalry, Dalton argued that the
need for highly effective naval forces in the 21st century will
increase.
	   He cited threats posed by an ever-increasing number of
conflicts, increasingly dangerous threats from the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious fundamentalism
and international organized crime.
	   ``More importantly, I believe, no one nation will counter these
threats alone,'' Dalton said.

Norwegian woman second person tried for unlicensed bicycle riding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MYTILINI, Greece (AP) _ Police on this Aegean island have
started a new crackdown on an old crime: riding a bicycle without a
license.
	   A Norwegian woman is scheduled to go to trial Thursday for
violating the island's traffic code by riding an unregistered
bicycle.
	   In June, Mytilini's traffic police made headlines when they
pressed charges against a 12-year-old Greek girl who was riding an
unregistered bicycle when she got hit by a bus.
	   Now, the police are at it again, this time targeting a Norwegian
language teacher whose name was reported by local media as Kathleen
Marsad.
	   ``In all of Europe, there are millions of bicycles and nowhere
is a license required,'' Marsad told reporters. ``Apparently in
Greece there are no other problems so they keep themselves busy
dealing with bicycles.''
	   In accordance with the labyrinthine Article 88 of the driving
code all bicycles must be registered by presenting a receipt. Not a
single bicycle permit has been issued in the last twenty years,
according to local media.
	   Marsad purchased her bicycle ten years ago in Norway and brought
it with her when she moved to Mytilini.
	   When she tried to register the bike with local authorities, her
request was denied _ because she didn't have the receipt.

Polish farmers block border crossings to demand ban on grain

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Hundreds of farmers protested Wednesday to
demand a ban on grain imports, saying the government has failed to
introduce price structures to protect them from foreign
competition.
	   Some 200 farmers from the Solidarity trade union unlatched rail
freight cars waiting at the Polish-Czech border, spilling about 500
tons of grain imported from Hungary.
	   Another 100 unionists chanted ``Polish bread from Polish grain''
as they blocked the Polish-German border crossing at Kolbaskowo,
520 kilometers (320 miles) north from Warsaw.
	   The farmers are demanding minimum prices for imported grain and
permits for grain trade. They said the Solidarity-dominated
government did not regulate grain prices as it had promised two
weeks ago.
	   After talks with unionists, Agriculture Minister Jacek
Janiszewski said the government will introduce grain import quotas
on Aug. 6. He also said the government has approved increased
subsidies for agriculture.
	   Experts say Polish farms _ small and ill-equipped _ need to be
consolidated and made more efficient in preparation for Poland's
membership in the European Union. The powerful 4-million-strong
farmer lobby has resisted reforms.

Algeria team meeting with UN chief ahead of mission

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with team to stay about two weeks, details of
meetings. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief briefed his new Algeria
team of high-ranking diplomats on details of their mission to
investigate the six-year wave of violence that has overwhelmed the
country.
	   The team plans to leave for the North African country July 22
and stay about two weeks.
	   Algeria had for years resisted international demands to admit
such a team, arguing that the Muslim insurgency was an internal
matter. It relented after a series of consultations with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.N. officials said.
	   The team, which will be headed by former Portuguese President
Mario Soares, was meeting with Annan on the details of the trip and
holding discussions on other organizational aspects.
	   The Algerian government has been battling a Muslim insurgency
since January 1992, when the regime canceled parliamentary
elections that an Islamic party was poised to win. Since then, the
conflict has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   Demands for an independent inquiry were spurred by suggestions
that the army or government-armed self-defense forces might have
played at least a passive role in some massacres.
	   Other team members include: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former
secretary of state.

Rioting marks Abiola's death; Abubakar dissolves cabinet

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 10 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   An official announcement about the dissolution was to be
broadcast later Wednesday, according to the government spokesman
who disclosed the move, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas, who are
from the north and are the majority in the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police.
	   Students in the southwestern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   While Abiola had reportedly been quite ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, coming just days after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would
be freed, including the opposition leader.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the U.S. State Department said there was no
reason to believe that the death was not the result of natural
causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' his daughter Hafsat told CNN. ``All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   The government said it had ordered an autopsy. It was unclear
who would conduct it, though Marwa said officials would cooperate
with Abiola's family who asked it be performed by non-Nigerians.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, said six physicians were
expected in Lagos later Wednesday, two each from the United States,
Canada and England.
	   A funeral initially scheduled later in the day Wednesday was
likely to be postponed.
	   The Abiola family's suspicions come from experience. One of his
wives, Kudirat, was killed in an assassination-style killing that
the family blamed on government agents. She was an outspoken critic
of Abacha.

High Jumper suffers neck injury

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British high jumper Steve Smith, bronze medalist
at the 1996 Olympics, could be out of action for a year after
suffering a serious neck injury in training.
	   Smith, 25, one of the title favorites for this year's European
Championships and Commonwealth Games, slipped while approaching the
bar on his home track in Liverpool on Tuesday. He was hospitalized.
	   ``He will be out for what looks like a year,'' his manager,
Vicente Modahl, said. ``It is a very serious injury where he pulled
the ligaments in his neck. He's lucky not to have broken it. Steve
slipped off the mat during a training session. I can tell you he is
absolutely devastated.''
	   Smith holds the Commonwealth and British records with clearances
of 2.37 meters (7 feet, 9 1/4). He had been due to compete in
Thursday's Bislett Games in Oslo.

must make room for competitors at London's crowded Heathrow and
Gatwick airports if they want their often-delayed partnership to
take off.
	   The European Commission also slapped conditions on United
Airline's coalition with Lufthansa German Airlines and Scandinavian
Airlines System, prompting an furious reaction.
	   American and BA gave a cautious welcome to the EU decision as a
step toward finally getting the alliance up and running, but they
said the conditions were too harsh.
	   ``We object to some elements of the tentative decision, which we
believe would penalize the alliance unfairly,'' said a statement
from American Airlines Chairman and CEO Don Carty.
	   The EU's Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said BA and
American would have to cut the frequency of their flights between
London and the U.S. hub cities of Dallas, Miami and Chicago, in
exchange for EU reglatory approval.
	   They also have to surrender up to 267 weekly takeoff and landing
slots at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports for other
transatlantic routes, if requested by competitors. That would offer
rivals the chance to operate 19 new daily flights from London to
the United States.
	   The EU's executive Commission said such demands were needed to
stop ``an abuse of the parties' dominant position.'' The airlines
said they went too far and pledged to lobby for easier terms before
the pact comes up for final approval from the EU and from British
and American national authorities.
	   ``Every lost slot means lost flights, lost business, lost
service for customers. Every lost slot means 30 jobs we cannot
create,'' said British Airways Chief Executive Bob Ayling.
	   Competitors moaned the conditions were too soft and repeated
demands for the alliance to be curtailed as a threat to fair
competition in the skies over the North Atlantic.
	   ``The Commission's preliminary position will allow BA-AA to
dwarf their competition at Heathrow,'' said Scott Yohe, senior vice
president for government affairs at Delta Air Lines.
	   Meanwhile, United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa reacted with
fury at the EU demand that their alliance reduce frequencies on
flights from Frankfurt to Washington and Chicago and give up slots
on other routes at Frankfurt and Copenhagen airports.
	   ``This European Commission action would turn back the clock to
an era in which government regulators, not the market, determined
the nature of international air services,'' said United's Chairman
and CEO Gerald Greenwald.
	   United said it was filing a complaint with the U.S. Department
of Transportation against the Commission.
	   The Commission is expected to make a final ruling on both
alliances in the Autumn. Until then, the companies concerned and
their competitors are expected to battle to secure changes in the
conditions.
	   U.S. airlines wanting to get into London's Heathrow Airport will
demand far more slots than American and British Airways are thus
far being asked to give up.
	   Already Wednesday, Delta and Continental said they each needed
enough slots to offer 10 daily flights into Heathrow _ more than
the total that the Commission has asked for even before demands
from other carriers are taken into account.
	   British and U.S. regulators must also rule on the BA-American
alliance. Britain's trade secretary Margaret Beckett said she
intends to approve the deal if measures are taken to safeguard fair
competition on transatlantic routes into London. She said Britain's
stance would be compatible with the EU decision.
	   The U.S. authorities have made their approval of the deal
contingent on Britain agreeing to an ``open skies'' deal with the
United States that would free up routes between the two nations to
greater competition among airlines.

Chechen president accepts resignation of acting prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Chechnya accepted the resignation
of the rebel republic's acting prime minister Wednesday, a news
agency reported.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov also holds the title of prime
minister, but for the last six months he had turned over the
responsibilities of the office to former guerrilla leader Shamil
Basayev.
	   Basayev submitted a letter of resignation last week, saying he
had only agreed to serve for six months.
	   Maskhadov has accepted the resignation and begun to consider
other candidates for the post, his spokesman, Mairbek Vachigayev,
told the Interfax news agency.
	   Basayev is a controversial figure, reviled in Russia as the
leader of a hostage-taking raid during the 1994-96 Chechen war that
left more than 100 people dead.
	   Maskhadov and Basayev have had trouble keeping order in the
republic, which is troubled by crime and frequent kidnappings.
	   Since the war ended in 1996, Chechnya has largely run its own
affairs but the Kremlin insists it remains part of Russia.

Serb police strikes hard at border village

village linking guerrillas to Albania; Serbs saying no reports of
fighting; Contact Group urges steps against guerrillas; trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police launched their heaviest
attack yet on Wednesday against a long-besieged guerrilla enclave
on the Albanian border, killing five people and wounding several
more, said ethnic Albanian sources.
	   The escalation of fighting around the mountainous border village
of Morina was accompanied by Serb shelling of at least four other
other area villages, said the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information
Center.
	   The reported Serb assault appeared an attempt to cut off Kosovo
Albanian militants from Albania, which serves both as a refuge and
the main source of weapons used by them in their battle for
independence from Serbia.
	   In another blow to the guerrillas, major powers meeting in Bonn,
Germany, to try and stop the Kosovo fighting called on governments
for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Germany, France, Britain and Italy _ warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.
	   The Information Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership favoring a peaceful independence struggle, said the dead
in Morina, 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Pristina, were all
men but it wasn't clear whether they were guerrillas or
non-combatants.
	   Most women and children have already fled the village, which
serves as a tentative link between Albania and the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporters who visited Morina in early June said only KLA
guerrillas occupy the village's 30 or so houses, within walking
distance of Albania.
	   Serb police control the area on three sides of Morina while a
border post of the Yugoslav National Army _ dominated by Serbia,
the larger of the two Yugoslav republics _ is stationed slightly to
the west.
	   The ethnic Albanian Information Center called the fighting
potentially the worst since the Serb police crackdown on the Kosovo
Liberation Army in February that led to the upsurge of violence now
gripping the Serbian province.
	   There was no way to substantiate that claim. The Serb Media
Center, which compiles information from official sources, said it
had no immediate reports of fighting in the area, as did a
well-informed Serb source, speaking separately.
	   In violence elsewhere, Albanian extremists firing from a
speeding van wounded a Serb policeman Wednesday and killed an
Albanian civilian bystander in a Kosovo province town.
	   According to police, KLA gunmen opened fire from a van on an
unmarked police car parked in the town of Suva Reka, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The gunmen escaped. A Serb policeman was wounded in the
shoulder, while a stray bullet in the chest killed a 33-year-old
Albanian street vendor. His blood-soaked body lay on the pavement
as European Union diplomats, part of a newly formed international
observer mission, arrived at the scene.
	   Major powers fear the conflict could spread to other areas of
the Balkans with large Albanian populations.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form
the Yugoslav federation.

Central Bank: Cyprus economy to grow by 4 percent in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The economy of Cyprus is expected to grow
4 percent this year, largely because of a projected 10 percent rise
in tourist arrivals, the Central Bank said Wednesday.
	   The economy, which grew by 2.3 percent in 1997, depends heavily
on the dlrs 2 billion a year tourism industry, which is also the
largest single employer in this east Mediterranean island.
	   According to the government, a total of 2.06 million visitors
came to Cyprus last year, compared to 1.95 million in 1996.
	   In a report, the Central Bank said inflation and unemployment,
which recorded 3.6 percent and 3.4 percent respectively in 1997,
were expected to fall to 3 percent each this year.
	   The fiscal deficit, however, will grow in 1998 to around 7
percent of gross domestic product, up from 5.1 percent last year
because of high expenditure, the report said.
	   It said the expenditure is the result of increased interest on
government debt and high defense and capital expenditure.
	   In May, the Parliament rejected a government proposed package of
tax hikes aimed at reducing the deficit to 3 percent of gross
domestic product by 2000.

Newest Taliban edict bans television
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The newest edict from the hardline
Islamic Taliban army bans televisions, video cassette recorders,
videos and satellite dishes.
	   ``These video recorders and television are the cause of
corruption in this society,'' Mohammed Qalamuddin, deputy head of
the Taliban's religious ministry said Wednesday.
	   The ban was announced on Radio Shariat.
	   The Taliban shut down Pakistan's only television station when it
took control of the beleaguered capital in September 1996.
	   Since then they have issued a ban on video cassettes, but it has
not been strictly enforced. Several homes also have satellite
dishes.
	   Qalamuddin said owners have 15 days to get rid of their
television sets. After that time religious police, bearded men with
automatic rifles, will conduct spot searches and smash any
television they find.
	   Anyone who defies the ban, Qalamuddin said, will be punished in
line with Islamic law, although he didn't specify what that might
be.
	   Since taking control of 85 percent of Afghanistan the Taliban
army has imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law that bans women from
working, girls from going to school. It also outlaws most forms of
light entertainment, music, other than religious music.
	   Men are beaten if they trim their beards. They are forced to
pray in the mosque.
	   Other edicts issued by the Taliban ban women from wearing white
socks, encourages people to paint their first floor windows black
to keep prying eyes from seeing women inside.
	   Women must wear the all-enveloping burqua. Anyone defying the
rule is publicly beaten.
	   ``We sacrificed 2 million people for Shariat (Islamic) law and
we don't care what the United States or the United Nations say,''
Qalamuddin said.

Britain overhauls defense: fewer nukes, more rapid forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds. AMs. UPDATES throughout with Parliament announcement;

 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Announcing the results of a major defense review,
Britain said Wednesday it will halve the power of its nuclear
arsenal, and trim submarine and warship numbers to concentrate on
flexible units that can be deployed rapidly to trouble spots.
	   ``The world has changed out of all recognition since the end of
the Cold War,'' Defense Secretary George Robertson told the House
of Commons. ``We must now be prepared to go to the crisis, rather
than have to the crisis come to us.''
	   The review was the first since the Labor Party won power 14
months ago, succeeding a Conservative Party administration which,
despite often-bellicose rhetoric, had regularly cut defense
expenditures.
	   Labor's reduction of 685 million pounds (dlrs 1.13 billion) over
three years in the 22 billion pound (dlrs 36.3 billion) annual
defense budget, was well below the 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3
billion) orginally sought by Treasury officials.
	   Some analysts said the relatively modest cut reflected Prime
Minister Tony Blair's enthusiasm for taking part in peacekeeping
operations, such as in Bosnia or, potentially, Kosovo. Blair was
also U.S. President Bill Clinton's most hawkish ally when war
threatened with Iraq this year.
	   The cuts would be nearly 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.65 billion),
but are less because the military will sell missile stocks, some
barrack sites and other defense assets by 2001.
	   Labor, which has a strong anti-nuclear streak, pledged in its
election manifesto to cut the cost of Trident, the hugely expensive
nuclear missile system that the Conservatives bought from the
United States.
	   Each Trident submarine _ three now and four by the end of the
century _ will carry a maximum of 48 warheads, instead of 96,
Robertson said. The number of operationally available nuclear
warheads will be cut by one-third to 200.
	   ``We have cut the explosive power by 70 percent since the end of
the Cold War,'' Robertson said.
	   In another switch from the Cold War era when Britain deployed
substantial numbers of troops and tanks in Germany as part of NATO
preparedness for a Soviet attack, Robertson said 2,500 more British
troops will be withdrawn over the next few years.
	   That will leave 23,500 British troops in Germany, compared with
more than 60,000 during the Cold War.
	   The military will have new units, known as Joint Rapid Reaction
Forces, capable of swift deployment, which Robertson described as
the ``spearhead of a new, modernized front-line.''
	   The Royal Navy's fleet of destroyers and frigates will be
reduced from 35 to 32, and submarines from 12 to 10. For rapid
deployment, the military will get new roll-on, roll-off container
ships and air transports.
	   Numbers of part-time reservists will be cut, but the regular
army, now 109,000-strong, will be increased by 3,500.
	   ``Unlike today, we will be able to mount more than one
Bosnia-type operation at a time,'' Robertson said.
	   In an embarrassment for Labor, the review was leaked and details
appeared in two national newspapers Wednesday. Robertson apologized
and said he had ordered an investigation.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Representatives of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army on Wednesday ruled out a compromise with the
Yugoslav government over the future of the troubled province.
	   ``The political status of Kosovo will be independence,'' Mahmuti
Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman for the KLA-supporting Popular
Movement of Kosovo, told reporters in Geneva. ``There will be no
compromise over the future of our people.''
	   Major powers who met in the German capital Bonn on Wednesday
demanded an immediate cease-fire between Serb security forces and
the KLA.
	   For the first time, the six-nation Balkan Contact Group,
comprising the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France and
Italy, also called on governments to crack down on the flow of
funds to rebels.
	   Bardhyl, claiming to be a former political prisoner who was
granted asylum in Switzerland in 1991, said the KLA would only
agree to a cease-fire when Serb forces withdraw from the province.
	   U.S. and Russian envoys have urged Albanian politicians to rally
behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, whom Western powers have
long regarded as speaking for all Kosovo Albanians.
	   They insist he is the best choice to speak in future talks with
the Yugoslav government.
	   Another member of the movement, Buja Agush, said in Geneva that
its members opposed Rugova's leadership because previous efforts by
him to find a solution to the province's problems hadn't produced a
result.
	   Agush said there were no divisions of opinion among Kosovo's
Albanian population and insisted the KLA had its full support.
	   The Swiss branch of the Popular Movement of Kosovo is one of
several in Europe providing the KLA with cash and supplies.
	   Bardhyl said the movement sends money and humanitarian supplies,
but isn't involved in buying arms in Switzerland, drug-trafficking
or other illegal activities.
	   Although Milosevic has ruled out negotiating with the KLA, U.S.
officials have recently begun making contact with senior KLA
leaders in Kosovo and abroad to seek their participation.
	   Bardhyl and his colleagues refused to name those contacts.

Newest Taliban edict bans television
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: subs graf 3 to correct TV station in Afghanistan sted Pakistan
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The newest edict from the hardline
Islamic Taliban army bans televisions, video cassette recorders,
videos and satellite dishes.
	   ``These video recorders and television are the cause of
corruption in this society,'' Mohammed Qalamuddin, deputy head of
the Taliban's religious ministry said Wednesday.
	   The ban was announced on Radio Shariat.
	   The Taliban shut down Afghanistan only television station when
it took control of the beleaguered capital in September 1996.
	   Since then they have issued a ban on video cassettes, but it has
not been strictly enforced. Several homes also have satellite
dishes.
	   Qalamuddin said owners have 15 days to get rid of their
television sets. After that time religious police, bearded men with
automatic rifles, will conduct spot searches and smash any
television they find.
	   Anyone who defies the ban, Qalamuddin said, will be punished in
line with Islamic law, although he didn't specify what that might
be.
	   Since taking control of 85 percent of Afghanistan the Taliban
army has imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law that bans women from
working, girls from going to school. It also outlaws most forms of
light entertainment, music, other than religious music.
	   Men are beaten if they trim their beards. They are forced to
pray in the mosque.
	   Other edicts issued by the Taliban ban women from wearing white
socks, encourages people to paint their first floor windows black
to keep prying eyes from seeing women inside.
	   Women must wear the all-enveloping burqua. Anyone defying the
rule is publicly beaten.
	   ``We sacrificed 2 million people for Shariat (Islamic) law and
we don't care what the United States or the United Nations say,''
Qalamuddin said.

Rios breezes to second round, Becker scrapes through
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Top-seed and world number-two Marcelo
Rios disappointed Swiss fans by systematically disposing of home
favorite Marc Rosset in straight sets Wednesday in the opening
round of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis tournament.
	   The Chilean, who briefly ursurped Pete Sampras as world
number-one earlier this year, needed just 69 minutes to dispatch
the towering Rosset 6-3, 6-3 and secure his place in the second
round.
	   With the first-round loss, Rosset's eighth since the start of
the season, the Swiss number-one will drop below the top 40 in the
ATP rankings.
	   ``The calibre of my game is dropping and so is my ranking,''
said Rosset, the last Swiss player eliminated from the tournament.
``It's getting to be dramatic. I can't get out of it. I'm at the
bottom of a deep well and someone has drawn the cord.''
	   In other first-round action, semi-retired Boris Becker began his
campaign for a 50th career singles title with a hard-fought
three-set victory over Swiss wildcard George Bastl, 253rd in the
world.
	   In his first appearance at the ritzy alpine tournament, the
winner of six Grand Slams opened the match comfortably jumping to a
one-set lead. But unhappy on the slippery clay surface, muddied by
a slight sprinkling of rain, Becker struggled against Bastl, just
eeking a 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 7-5 win for a spot in the second round.
	   France's Cedric Pioline, seeded fourth, defeated Nicolas
Lapentti of Equador 6-4, 6-4. Spanish clay-court specialist Alberto
Costa, seeded sixth, beat qualifier Daniel Orsanic of Argentina
5-7, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Resuming the previous day's match, interrupted due to rain,
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, seeded eighth, came back to post a 0-6,
7-5, 7-6 (10-8) win over Juan Albert Viloca, a finalist last year.
	   Former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil cruised to
the second round with a 6-4, 6-4 win over France's Guillaume Raoux.

First Abacha, now Abiola: Nigeria's foes fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The deaths first of Gen. Sani Abacha
and now his primary foe, Moshood Abiola, sweep aside long-standing
enmities in Nigeria.
	   But they also threaten to unleash a new wave of ethnic violence
and jeopardize an already shaky transition to civilian rule.
	   The military dictator from the north and the civilian would-be
president from the south represented a political impasse that froze
Nigeria in an internal Cold War for four years.
	   The deaths of the nation's two top political contenders just
four weeks apart have conspiracy speculators creeping out of the
woodwork. But such theories pale next to Nigeria's bizarre and
turbulent reality.
	   The tumult began June 8, when the country awoke to find Abacha _
who ruled for five years with an iron fist _ was dead of a heart
attack. Before an autopsy could be performed, he was
unceremoniously dumped into a grave and buried.
	   A kinder, seemingly more humane military ruler emerged in Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar. The West cautiously hailed a new Nigeria as
jailed dissidents were released and promises made that Abiola would
soon go free as well.
	   But shortly after finishing a cup of tea while meeting with U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering on Tuesday, Abiola fell
ill and quickly succumbed to a reported heart attack.
	   His death triggered renewed rage, and gave Nigerians one more
reason to feel betrayed by the military. Suspicions, simmering
anger and a population fed up with the military and its brand of
leadership is ready to explode. Abiola's death could be the fuse.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' said one of Abiola's daughters,
Hafsat. ``All of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   The truth, one way or the other, will likely never come out.
	   Abiola's proponents feel robbed of a chance for a civilian
leader chosen by the people. To the very last, Abiola's supporters
insisted he was the rightful president and demanded he be allowed
to fulfill his mandate.
	   Abiola, a Yoruba and the apparent winner of the 1993
presidential election, was the first southerner to win support
across a broad spectrum of the country's fractious ethnic regions _
north, east and south.
	   His popularity long made the military uneasy. A northern
establishment dominated by Muslims from the Hausa and Falani ethnic
groups, Nigeria's military today does not seem opposed to civilian
rule, so long as it is civilian rule along its lines.
	   Abacha, a dictator bent on becoming a civilian president, was
clearly unacceptable to the people of Nigeria. Now he is dead.
	   Abiola, whose popularity and apparent election victory in 1993
would likely have brought him to power, was equally unacceptable to
the military. Now he is dead.
	   Nigeria's political landscape has been dramatically altered. If
recent developments _ a dead dictator and dead president-elect _
are pieces in a complex puzzle, the picture remains unclear.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - The new center-right government was
sworn in on Wednesday and immediately rolled back university
tuition fees established by its Socialist predecessor.
	   Parliament, dominated by members in the two-party coalition,
approved the draft by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government
re-establishing free university education for those studying for
their first degree. It also voted to return the country's public
health and pension systems to state control.
	   Earlier, President Arpad Goencz handed over certificates
allowing Orban and his Cabinet to run the country.

Study: AIDS drug found useful in hepatitis C
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2100 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A standard AIDS drug appears to slow liver damage
caused by hepatitis B.
	   A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at
the effects of the drug 3TC on people with long-standing infections
with the virus.
	   It found that after a year of treatment, signs of inflammatory
injury fell significantly in just over half of those getting the
medicine, compared with one-quarter of those on dummy medication.
	   The drug, also known as lamivudine or Epivir, is one of several
that block production of an essential viral protein known as
reverse transcriptase. Both the AIDS virus and hepatitis B use this
enzyme.
	   Worldwide, more than 300 million people are infected with
hepatitis B, and three-quarters of them are of Asian origin. The
virus can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.
	   Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha,
which can cause flu-like side effects. The researchers said 3TC is
easier to take and may work better, although the two medicines have
not been compared head to head.
	   The study was conducted on 358 patients in China. It was
directed by Dr. Ching-Lung Lai of the University of Hong Kong and
financed by Glaxo Wellcome, which makes the medicine.
	   In an editorial, Dr. Masao Omata of the University of Tokyo
noted that one year of treatment is unlikely to have an effect on
people's health, and studies of longer use are needed.

Nightly riots the norm as Northern Ireland bears sectarian

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Another night, another
nightmare for the peace-loving people of Belfast, many of whom are
staying in their homes rather than brave the hostile streets.
	   Protestant protests by day and riots by night this week over a
blocked Orange Order march showed little sign of abating Wednesday,
and the most hard-line Catholics are threatening their own trouble,
too.
	   The toll as of Wednesday afternoon, according to official
statistics: A dozen shootings, two dozen grenade blasts, 73 homes
of Catholics or police officers vandalized, 93 businesses and
schools damaged by fire, 136 vehicles stolen and burned and another
279 damaged, 44 officers and an unknown number of rioters wounded,
91 rioters arrested _ but so far, somehow, no deaths.
	   ``Every night, it's more of the same,'' said a policeman clad in
flame-retardent jumpsuit, his club tucked in his boot, his
plastic-bullet gun by his side, the visor up on his helmet to
reveal smoke-streaked cheeks and bloodshot eyes.
	   He stood guard early Wednesday at Donegall Pass, a Protestant
district in the divided heart of Belfast, where rioters have turned
the roadway into a sea of fire each night since Sunday and tried to
beat up Catholic residents of the nearby Lower Ormeau neighborhood.
	   ``This could go on another month,'' said the officer who,
because interviews with Royal Ulster Constabulary members are
supposed to be cleared with its press office, didn't want his name
published. ``We're just taking our punishment for blocking that
march. We'd be taking it in Roman Catholic areas now if we hadn't
stopped it.''
	   The march in question by Northern Ireland's Protestant
brotherhood, the Orange Order, ran into the British army's
barbed-wire barricades Sunday at the Drumcree Anglican church
outside Portadown, the order's birthplace 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of Belfast.
	   A civilian Parades Commission ruled the Orangemen should not be
allowed to continue down nearby Garvaghy Road, where Catholic
residents have tried to stop the annual march beginning in 1995.
	   Orange leaders say they're determined to prevail no matter how
long it takes, and have maintained round-the-clock camps at the
Drumcree barricades and outside the castle residence of Britain's
Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam.
	   They are organizing near-constant illegal parades and human
roadblocks, but deny responsibility for the violence of Protestant
mobs. Hijacking and burning of vehicles continued Wednesday evening
in Portadown, north Belfast and the coastal town of Carrickfergus.
	   After dark, many parts of Northern Ireland have become eerily
empty as shops close early, bus and train services are canceled and
even most taxi drivers refuse to ply their trade.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would meet Orange Order
leaders Thursday in London, but their public positions suggested
little room for negotiation _ and the order's chiefs still weren't
sure whether they'd bother going.
	   Orange leaders say they must march a Garvaghy Road route used
since 1807, but won't meet the head of the Garvaghy Road
protesters, a former Irish Republican Army prisoner. Blair's
spokesman, Alastair Campbell, emphasized the Parades Commission
ruling must stand.
	   Catholics opposed to Protestant marches along south Belfast's
Ormeau Road took the Parades Commission to court Wednesday to
challenge its decision permitting a small Orange parade this Monday
past Lower Ormeau.
	   The Lower Ormeau protest leader, former IRA prisoner Gerard
Rice, called the ruling ``perverse'' because it rewarded the
Orangemen's ``greater threat of violence.'' He wouldn't say whether
his group would obstruct the parade if its legal case failed.
	   Lower Ormeau is second only to the Portadown showdown in its
capacity to fuel sectarian emotions. In 1996, Catholics clashed
violently with police and soldiers when a Protestant parade was
permitted.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Heavy runoff from melting glaciers
swelled rivers along the border of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan,
killing at least 38 people in the Central Asian nations, officials
said Wednesday.
	   The melting, caused by hot weather topping 42 degrees Celsius
(107 degrees Fahrenheit), has caused flooding in two rivers: the
Ak-Suu in Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan-Sai in Uzbekistan,
according to the Uzbek Emergencies Ministry.
	   The flooding caused a dam on Kuban-Kel lake to break, the
Interfax news agency reported. The dam burst raised the water level
below the dam by three to four meters (nine to 12 feet) and
inundated homes along the bank, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Many of the deaths were in the mountainous Kadamzhai district in
western Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan district in eastern
Uzbekistan, the report said.
	   Emergency officials confirmed at least 20 bodies in Uzbek
morgues, and Kyrgyz authorities said six villages were destroyed.
	   Rescue workers were recovering bodies and reinforcing dikes, the
officials said.

Walking during labor doesn't help, doesn't hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2100 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Should women walk during labor?
	   Some professionals think strolling around during the early
stages makes childbirth go more smoothly. Others feel just as
adamantly that women should stay in bed.
	   A large new study finds neither side is right: Walking during
labor has no effect _ good or bad _ on labor and delivery.
	   ``Like many issues where there are very opposing views, the
truth was in the middle,'' said Dr. Steven L. Bloom, who directed
the study.
	   The study grew out of efforts to find a way to cut down on the
number of Caesarean sections at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, where Bloom is an obstetrician.
	   Some suggested that walking during labor would help do this. But
when doctors looked at the evidence, they found only four small
studies on the subject. Two found that walking speeds delivery; two
found no difference.
	   Bloom's team randomly assigned 1,067 women to walk during labor
or to stay in bed. The study is larger than all the previous
research combined. The results were published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
	   Seventy-eight percent of the women who were asked to walk
actually did so, and they spent an average of an hour on their feet
during the first stage of labor. They took an average of 553 steps,
compared with 30 steps _ mostly trips to the toilet _ for women
assigned to stay in bed.
	   Walking made no difference in the women's risk of Caesareans, in
the duration of labor, in the need for pain medicines or in the
babies' health.
	   While walking doesn't improve childbirth, it doesn't do any harm
either, Bloom said, so ``there is no reason not to allow women to
have that option during labor.''
	   Traditionally, those who favor walking argue that it might
reduce discomfort and make the uterus perform better. Those on the
other side say it's safer for women to stay in bed, where they
won't fall down and can be monitored more easily.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Robert C. Cefalo and Watson A.
Bowes Jr. of the University of North Carolina noted that the debate
has gone on for more than a century.
	   ``To walk or not to walk has always been the question,'' they
said, ``and it is still unanswered.''

Rios breezes to second round, Becker scrapes through
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Top-seed and world number-two Marcelo
Rios disappointed Swiss fans by systematically disposing of home
favorite Marc Rosset in straight sets Wednesday in the opening
round of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open tennis tournament.
	   The Chilean, who briefly ursurped Pete Sampras as world
number-one earlier this year, needed just 69 minutes to dispatch
the towering Rosset 6-3, 6-3 and secure his place in the second
round.
	   With the first-round loss, Rosset's eighth since the start of
the season, the Swiss number-one will drop below the top 40 in the
ATP rankings.
	   ``The caliber of my game is dropping and so is my ranking,''
said Rosset, the last Swiss player eliminated from the tournament.
``It's getting to be dramatic. I can't get out of it. I'm at the
bottom of a deep well and someone has drawn the cord.''
	   In other first-round action, semi-retired Boris Becker began his
campaign for a 50th career singles title with a hard-fought
three-set victory over Swiss wildcard George Bastl, 253rd in the
world.
	   In his first appearance at the ritzy alpine tournament, the
winner of six Grand Slams opened the match comfortably jumping to a
one-set lead. But unhappy on the slippery clay surface, muddied by
a slight sprinkling of rain, Becker struggled against Bastl, just
eeking a 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 7-5 win for a spot in the second round.
	   France's Cedric Pioline, seeded fourth, defeated Nicolas
Lapentti of Equador 6-4, 6-4. Spanish clay-court specialist Alberto
Costa, seeded sixth, beat qualifier Daniel Orsanic of Argentina
5-7, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Resuming the previous day's match, interrupted due to rain,
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer, seeded eighth, came back to post a 0-6,
7-5, 7-6 (10-8) win over Juan Albert Viloca, a finalist last year.
	   Former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil cruised to
the second round with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over France's Guillaume
Raoux.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Can France finally break its jinx and make it to
the World Cup final for the first time ever?
	   On the streets of Paris, there were mixed feelings hours before
Wednesday night's match against Croatia.
	   ``Of course we'll win, no doubt,'' said Jean-Pierre Dumel, a
Parisian waiter. ``Well, we should. But you never know. We have a
habit of blowing it. There's so much expectation.''
	   After a lukewarm start to the tournament, France has caught
World Cup fever.
	   Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Paris to
celebrate the last two victories over Paraguay and Italy _ the
first thanks to a last-minute goal, the next one after a penalty
shootout.
	   Late Wednesday afternoon, French and Croatian fans mingled in
city bars, drinking bars and sitting in the sun.
	   ``We'll be in the final. We'll be in the final,'' chanted a
group of French fans, with the French flag painted on their cheeks.
	   On the Champs Elysees, a mime artist posed with French soccer
fans and to their delight did hand signals for a 1-0 victory for
the home team.
	   A newspaper vendor, trying to offload his final editions of Le
Monde ran into a bar, banged a glass on the table and shouted,
``Latest headline. France forfeits match.'' He was jeered out of
the bar.
	   France has suffered three heart-breaking defeats at the
semi-final stage _ in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Another is unthinkable.
	   In the end, Dumel said, he predicts a tight 1-0 victory for
France. ``Unless, of course...''
	   His hesitation stems from the fact that France has a great
defense, but its strikers have hit a barren spell. And the Croatian
team is an unknown quantity that has already surprised many by
beating Germany.
	   Yves Cabrera, 22, was more confident, saying France would win
3-0. ``In the past we've had stylish teams who never made it.
Today's team is more efficient.''
	   Headlines in the French press reflected the mood: ``Near to the
Goal,'' said Le Parisien. ``This would be historic,'' said
L'Equipe.
	   France Soir, showing a large photo of a Croatian fan, said:
``But who are these Croats?''
	   On the Champs Elysees, a magnet for French revelers after
matches, there was a feeling among the Croatian fans, decked out in
red-and-white national colors, that they have less to lose _
they're happy just to have come this far.
	   About 1,000 Croatians flew in early Wednesday on five special
charter flights. Some were leaving straight after the match.
Others, confident of victory, planned to stay until Sunday to see
the final.
	   Most said they were just proud to be here and were determined to
have a good time _ and leave a good impression.
	   A red-and-white Croatia cap hanging from her back pocket,
Drazenka Menicanim, a young lawyer from Zagreb, said the most
important thing was Croatia's image.
	   ``Croatia is a new child in Europe. And like every child we have
certain problems of adaptation,'' she said. ``But we're here to
prove that we belong in Europe.''
	   She estimated that five percent of the world currently knows
about Croatia, but said the figure would rise to 15 percent after
Wednesday's game, and 25 percent if Croatia gets to the final.
	   ``And we will,'' she predicted confidently. ``It's 2-0. Goals
from Davor Suker and Zvonimir Boban.''
	   Dumel, the French waiter, said Croatia had done well, in part
thanks to its mystery element.
	   ``But I think we can do it. It's now or never,'' he said.

Scientists affirm inheritance of Jewish priesthood designation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 1800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have found fresh genetic evidence
that Jews who consider themselves part of the priestly class known
as Cohanim really are part of an unbroken line extending back
thousands of years.
	   The Cohanim are said to be descended from Moses' brother, Aaron.
Originally they had primary responsibility for offering sacrifices
and serving as arbiters and mentors.
	   Today, in Orthodox and some other Jewish congregations, Cohanim
are still accorded special duties and privileges. A Cohan is given
the honor of reading first from the Torah during a service, and
presides over a traditional ceremony for some first-born boys.
	   Cohanim aren't allowed to marry widows, divorcees or converts.
Because of the Jewish belief that the Temple in Jerusalem will be
rebuilt and that Cohanim will serve again as priests there, they
try to remain spiritually pure. So they stay away from dead bodies,
not attending funerals except for those of immediate family, for
example.
	   Many Cohanim have surnames such as Cohen, Kahn, Kane or similar
variations. But not all men with such surnames are Cohanim.
	   Last year, scientists who studied the Y chromosome in modern-day
Cohanim reported evidence that the designation truly has been
passed from father to son. The Y chromosome is inherited that way,
making it useful for such studies.
	   More evidence appears in a new study, reported by Israeli and
British scientists in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. They
looked for variations in the Y chromosome from 306 Jewish men,
including 106 self-identified Cohanim, from Israel, Canada and
England.
	   Most Cohanim had the same version of the Y chromosome or close
variants that differ because of random mutations. That shows there
has been ``reasonable adherence to the policy of father-son
inheritance,'' said researcher David B. Goldstein of Oxford
University.
	   By studying how long it would take for the variants to develop,
researchers concluded the inheritance of Cohanim status has gone on
longer than 700 years and maybe as long as 3,000 years or so, as
tradition maintains.
	   The sample also contained 81 self-identified Levites, a
designation that began with the Levi tribe after the Exodus and is
also supposed to pass from father to son.
	   The study could not confirm that. The Levites showed too much
variety in their Y chromosome variants. That could mean that
non-Levite Jews took up the designation in the past, or that the
original Levites had a lot of variety in their Y chromosomes,
Goldstein said.
	   Rabbi Raphael B. Butler, executive vice president of the
Orthodox Union, an umbrella organization of Orthodox congregations,
said he doubted the study would affect the designations of Cohan or
Levite today. But it's ``enlightening'' that the results agree with
the Jewish tradition, he said.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 10 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   An official announcement about the dissolution was to be
broadcast later Wednesday, according to the government spokesman
who disclosed the move, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas, who are
from the north and are the majority in the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police.
	   Students in the southwestern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   While Abiola had reportedly been quite ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, coming just days after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would
be freed, including the opposition leader.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the U.S. State Department said there was no
reason to believe that the death was not the result of natural
causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' his daughter Hafsat told CNN. ``All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   The government said it had ordered an autopsy. It was unclear
who would conduct it, though Marwa said officials would cooperate
with Abiola's family who asked it be performed by non-Nigerians.
	   Abiola's physician, Dr. Ore Falomo, said six physicians were
expected in Lagos later Wednesday, two each from the United States,
Canada and England.
	   A funeral initially scheduled later in the day Wednesday was
likely to be postponed.
	   The Abiola family's suspicions come from experience. One of his
wives, Kudirat, was killed in an assassination-style killing that
the family blamed on government agents. She was an outspoken critic
of Abacha.

Amid labor strife and market slump, Russia awaits IMF loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES thruout with market down, protests in St.
Petersburg, bond auctions, other details, background. CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Labor unrest spread Wednesday and the stock market
slid in a gloomy prologue to the expected announcement of a
multi-billion-dollar loan package from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Thousands of unpaid defense workers demonstrated in Moscow and
St. Petersburg, among other cities, and coal miners halted traffic
on the Trans-Siberian railway for the sixth straight day.
	   The Russian stock market dropped 2.65 percent on modest volume,
with investors discouraged by the results of the weekly government
bond auctions.
	   The Russian economy has been in a tailspin for much of this year
after showing its first signs of growth since well before the
Soviet collapse. The government, desperately in need of cash, has
been negotiating with the IMF for a bailout loan.
	   At the same time, workers across the country, who frequently go
without pay for months on end, have been growing increasingly
restive.
	   Russian officials continued talks with the IMF on Wednesday, a
day after announcing agreement on major issues. Anatoly Chubais,
Russia's representative to international lenders, has said he hopes
to iron out the rest of the key issues Thursday for a loan of dlrs
10 billion to dlrs 15 billion.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's spokesman spoke
approvingly of the negotiations.
	   ``We have been encouraged by the discussions that the IMF has
had with Russian financial authorities,'' Mike McCurry said. ``The
IMF and Mr. Chubais announced yesterday an agreement in principle
on certain steps that they're going to take and we think they need
to be rapidly implemented.''
	   Many economists say the IMF loan is essential to restore
confidence to Russia's faltering markets and halt the exodus of
foreign investors.
	   In the meantime, the government has been trying to raise money
through bond auctions, with increasingly dismal results.
	   The Finance Ministry managed to raise only dlrs 1.6 billion at
its bond auction Wednesday, against redemptions of dlrs 6.2 billion
on bonds maturing this week. In the second of three planned
auctions, the average yield rose to 113.82 percent, up from 110.15
percent on Tuesday.
	   Higher yields are a sign that investors lack confidence in the
bonds.
	   The ministry canceled the third auction.
	   ``It's a signal that the Finance Ministry has run out of money,
and that dealers aren't willing to buy paper even at those
yields,'' said Alexander Bobolev, a trader at the Aton brokerage in
Moscow.
	   Labor unrest provided a menacing backdrop to the financial
travails.
	   In Moscow, more than 1,000 defense industry workers representing
more than 20 regions held a rally in front of the Defense Ministry
to demand overdue wages and President Boris Yeltsin's resignation.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Mikhailov met the protesters and
acknowledged that the government's debt to defense workers stood at
some 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs 400 million). He pledged to resolve
it in the ``near future,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Defense workers also held rallies in several other cities,
including St. Petersburg and the eastern port of Vladivostok. Some
demonstrators said they had been owed money for up to 20 months.
	   Prosecutors near Vladivostok opened a criminal case against coal
miners and other workers who blocked a railway leading to the
region's largest power plant. The action has blocked fuel
deliveries to the plant.
	   In central Siberia, several hundred miners from the town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk continued their blockade of the Trans-Siberian
which began on Friday. They claim the government broke its promise
to pay back wages that were part of a settlement that ended a
similar blockade in May.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman, an ardent soccer fan, met
with each member of the Croatian team Wednesday after arriving in
France to watch the Croats battle for a berth in the World Cup
finals.
	   Tudjman, who also made the trip last Saturday to watch the
team's 3-0 victory over Germany, will sit in the VIP section of the
Stade de France in Paris, as Croatia faces off against host France
at 9:00 p.m. (1900GMT).
	   ``It will, without a doubt, be a great match,'' Tudjman said,
admitting the French were favored to win. ``For Croatia, it is
already a magnificent success to have found itself amongst the best
four nations in the sport.''
	   The 76-year-old leader was accompanied by other government
officials, including Premier Zlatko Matesa.
	   The winner of the match will meet four-time world champion
Brazil in Sunday's final. The loser will play the Netherlands for
third place on Saturday.
	   After arriving in France, Tudjman visited the Croatian team as
it prepared for the match.
	   ``It will be interesting to see if France can play on the same
level against Croatia as it did against other teams. And so see how
France will play with the pressure of a match in front of their own
fans and the pressure on them to win the World Cup,'' Tudjman said.
	   He said that Croatia had a ``great team and a great coach who
knows what he wants and knows the strength of the players on his
team.''

Nicklaus' streak of consecutive majors to end

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus has pulled out of next week's
British Open, ending his streak of consecutive majors at 154. He
also said Wednesday that he will not play the PGA Championship next
month.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors and two U.S. Amateur titles, has
played in every major for which he has been eligible since the 1957
U.S. Open, when he missed the cut as a 17-year-old amateur.
	   Even at age 58, he tied for sixth in this year's Masters and
tied for 43rd in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club last month.
	   ``After 42 years of playing major championship golf, I feel that
my ability to compete at the highest level on a continuous basis is
marginal at best,'' the American said. ``I feel this is the time to
end my streak of consecutive majors, for which I have been
eligible.''
	   Nicklaus did not join the PGA Tour until 1962, so he was not
eligible for the PGA Championship until then. He has not missed a
major since the 1962 Masters, a streak of 146. He won the U.S. Open
two months later, beating Arnold Palmer in a playoff.
	   Nicklaus, who is playing this week at the Senior Players
Championship in Dearborn, Michigan, said he had planned to end the
streak at this year's Masters, where Augusta National honored him
with a plaque for playing in his 40th straight event.
	   But the USGA gave him a special exemption to play in his 42nd
consecutive U.S. Open.
	   ``I feel that the preparation time and physical demands which
are required to be competitive on a continuous basis are difficult
for me to satisfy at this time,'' he said. ``Therefore, I have
elected not to play in the British Open and PGA Championships in
1998.''
	   He said his left hip, which has bothered him over the years,
seized up on him the day after the U.S. Open while playing at a
Johnny Miller course near Salt Lake City.
	   Nicklaus was to be in Manchester next week to open a new course,
and said he might play the British Open at Royal Birkdale if his
hip was holding up.
	   ``I didn't want to end the streak by having it said that Jack
Nicklaus could no longer play the game,'' Nicklaus said.
	   ``Instead, I wanted to step back with the feeling that the
competitive spirit and ability still thrived within me. I wanted to
end the streak on my own terms.''
	   Nicklaus has made the cut in 130 of the 154 majors in which he's
played, including 10 of the last 12.
	   While his streak of majors may never be matched, his performance
in them is even more impressive.
	   Nicklaus is one of only four players to win the career Grand
Slam, and he's done that three times over _ six Masters, four U.S.
Opens, three British Opens and five PGA Championships.
	   In addition, he has been runner-up 19 times at the majors. For
his first 26 years as a pro, Nicklaus finished in the top 20 in at
least one major each year.
	   He has lifetime exemptions for the Masters and PGA Championships
and an exemption into the British Open until the age of 65.
	   Nicklaus has not won on the PGA Tour since becoming the oldest
Masters champion in 1986. He was back in the hunt again this year,
getting within two strokes of the lead on Sunday and finishing four
strokes back of Mark O'Meara.
	   At the British Open two years ago, Nicklaus opened with rounds
of 69-66 and was one off the lead, but closed with a 150 on the
weekend and tied for 44th.
	   Nicklaus' last major victory was at the 1986 Masters. The next
longest active majors streak is Nick Faldo's 44. But Faldo withdrew
Wednesday from the Loch Lomond Invitational in Scotland with an
elbow injury, and is in danger of missing the British Open next
week.

World Cup: Dutch striker is back in the news for the right reason
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Patrick Kluivert is hitting the
headlines on the back pages again.
	   The young Dutch striker, whose career has been dogged by
off-field controversies, scored a last-gasp equalizer against
defending champion Brazil in the World Cup semifinal.
	   His close-range header equalized Ronaldo's 46th-minute goal and
sent the match into nail-biting extra time. Brazil held on and
eventually triumphed 4-2 on penalties which wouldn't have happened
if Kluivert had taken one of the four other chances that came his
way.
	   ``I've always hated that kind of end to a match, Kluivert said.
``I could have prevented it but my shot at the end of extra time
went just wide.''
	   At least it got the 22-year-old AC Milan striker making news in
the sports sections rather than the crime columns.
	   Since becoming a regular starter for Ajax Amsterdam in 1995,
Kluivert's life has been a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly.
	   He shot to fame in May 1995 by scoring the only goal in Ajax's
1-0 victory over AC Milan in the European Cup final.
	   But then his life started going off the rails.
	   In 1996 he was sentenced to community service after being
convicted of vehicular homicide for killing a man by smashing a
borrowed BMW into his car.
	   Earlier this year a young woman accused Kluivert and a group of
his friends of gang raping her after picking her up outside an
Amsterdam night club. Police investigated but filed no charges.
	   Sandwiched between the two forgettable incidents was a
disastrous move to AC Milan, where injury problems teamed up with
an alarming slump in form.
	   Desperate to transfer out of Italy for next season, Kluivert was
hoping at the World Cup to show off his talents to potential buyers
such as Arsenal and Manchester United.
	   Instead he got sent off for elbowing Belgian defender Lorenzo
Staelens in the Dutch World Cup opener and missed the next three
Dutch matches.
	   But Kluivert bounced back and proved his worth by scoring in
each of the last two Dutch games, in a 2-1 victory over Argentina
in the quarterfinals and against Brazil in the semis.
	   ``We should have reached the final,'' Kluivert said. ``I was
sure we would. We were so close to victory. I played well, if only
I'd scored again.''

Serb police strikes hard at border village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of reported fighting from sources

Kosovo. &QL;

 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police launched their heaviest
attack yet on Wednesday against a long-besieged guerrilla enclave
on the Albanian border, killing five people and wounding several
more, said ethnic Albanian sources.
	   The escalation of fighting around the mountainous border village
of Morina was accompanied by Serb shelling of at least four other
other area villages, said the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information
Center.
	   The reported Serb assault appeared an attempt to cut off Kosovo
Albanian militants from Albania, which serves both as a refuge and
the main source of weapons used by them in their battle for
independence from Serbia.
	   In another blow to the guerrillas, major powers meeting in Bonn,
Germany, to try and stop the Kosovo fighting called on governments
for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Germany, France, Britain and Italy _ warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.
	   The Information Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership favoring a peaceful independence struggle, said the dead
in Morina, 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Pristina, were all
men but it wasn't clear whether they were guerrillas or
non-combatants.
	   Most women and children have already fled the village, which
serves as a tentative link between Albania and the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporters who visited Morina in early June said only KLA
guerrillas occupy the village's 30 or so houses, within walking
distance of Albania.
	   Serb police control the area on three sides of Morina while a
border post of the Yugoslav National Army _ dominated by Serbia,
the larger of the two Yugoslav republics _ is stationed slightly to
the west.
	   Sources in the town of Djakovica, some 15 kilometers (9 miles)
east of Morina said the fierce fighting appeared to be dying down
by late Wednesday afternoon. One of them _ asking, like the others,
for anonymity _ said some unconfirmed reports had government
sources now in control of the area.
	   The ethnic Albanian Information Center called the fighting
potentially the worst since the Serb police crackdown on the Kosovo
Liberation Army in February that led to the upsurge of violence now
gripping the Serbian province.
	   There was no way to substantiate that claim. The Serb Media
Center, which compiles information from official sources, said it
had no immediate reports of fighting in the area, as did a
well-informed Serb source, speaking separately.
	   In Geneva, a group claiming to bankroll the KLA said nothing
short of independence would satisfy the guerrillas. Mahmuti
Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman of the Popular Movement of Kosovo,
said the KLA would agree to a cease-fire only if the Serbs withdrew
all armed units from the province.
	   Bardhyl said his movement sends money and humanitarian supplies
to the fighters but was not involved in arms buying in Switzerland
or generally in any illegal operations.
	   In violence elsewhere, Albanian extremists firing from a
speeding van wounded a Serb policeman Wednesday and killed an
Albanian civilian bystander in a Kosovo province town.
	   According to police, KLA gunmen opened fire from a van on an
unmarked police car parked in the town of Suva Reka, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The gunmen escaped. A Serb policeman was wounded in the
shoulder, while a stray bullet in the chest killed a 33-year-old
Albanian street vendor. His blood-soaked body lay on the pavement
as European Union diplomats, part of a newly formed international
observer mission, arrived at the scene.
	   Major powers fear the conflict could spread to other areas of
the Balkans with large Albanian populations.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form
the Yugoslav federation.

Trans-Atlantic airline pacts must fly less to get EU approval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, details. New

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators set
conditions Wednesday for a controversial alliance between American
Airlines and British Airways, including a demand that they to fly
fewer trans-Atlantic flights to maintain competition.
	   But the EU angered a rival group by saying it should also fly
under restraints.
	   Competition officials told American and BA they must make room
for competitors at London's crowded Heathrow and Gatwick airports
if they want their often-delayed partnership to take off.
	   The European Commission also slapped conditions on United
Airlines' coalition with Lufthansa German Airlines and Scandinavian
Airlines System, prompting a furious reaction.
	   American and BA said the EU decision was a step toward finally
getting the alliance up and running, but the conditions were too
harsh.
	   ``We object to some elements of the tentative decision, which we
believe would penalize the alliance unfairly,'' American Airlines
chairman and chief executive Don Carty said in a statement.
	   EU competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said BA and American
would have to cut the frequency of their flights between London and
the U.S. hub cities of Dallas, Miami and Chicago, in exchange for
EU reglatory approval.
	   They also have to surrender up to 267 weekly takeoff and landing
slots at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports for other
trans-Atlantic routes, if requested by competitors. That would
offer rivals the chance to operate 19 new daily flights from London
to the United States.
	   The European Commission said such demands were needed to stop
``an abuse of the parties' dominant position.'' The airlines
pledged to lobby for easier terms before the pact comes up for
final approval from EU, British and American regulators.
	   ``Every lost slot means lost flights, lost business, lost
service for customers. Every lost slot means 30 jobs we cannot
create,'' said British Airways CEO Bob Ayling.
	   Competitors moaned the conditions were too soft and repeated
demands for the alliance to be curtailed.
	   ``The Commission's preliminary position will allow BA-AA to
dwarf their competition at Heathrow,'' said Scott Yohe, senior vice
president for government affairs at Delta Air Lines.
	   Meanwhile, United and Lufthansa were furious with the EU's
demand that their alliance reduce frequencies on flights from
Frankfurt to Washington and Chicago and give up slots on other
routes at Frankfurt and Copenhagen airports.
	   ``This European Commission action would turn back the clock to
an era in which government regulators, not the market, determined
the nature of international air services,'' said United chairman
and CEO Gerald Greenwald.
	   United said it was filing a complaint with the U.S. Department
of Transportation against the Commission.
	   The Commission is expected to make a final ruling on both
alliances in the fall. Until then, the companies concerned and
their competitors are expected to battle to secure changes in the
conditions.
	   U.S. airlines wanting to get into London's Heathrow Airport will
demand far more slots than American and British Airways are thus
far being asked to give up.
	   Delta and Continental said they each needed enough slots to
offer 10 daily flights into Heathrow _ more than the total that the
Commission has asked for even before demands from other carriers
are taken into account.
	   British and U.S. regulators must also rule on the BA-American
alliance. Britain's trade secretary Margaret Beckett said she
intends to approve the deal if measures are taken to safeguard fair
competition on trans-Atlantic routes into London. She said
Britain's stance would be compatible with the EU decision.
	   The U.S. authorities have made their approval of the deal
contingent on Britain agreeing to an ``open skies'' deal with the
United States that would free up routes between the two nations to
greater competition among airlines.

Mandela: South Africa willing to help resolve Nigeria crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandela quotes; ADDS background &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ On the eve of a senior
official's visit to Nigeria, President Nelson Mandela said
Wednesday South Africa is willing to help resolve the crisis there.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was to meet in Nigeria with
relatives of Moshood Abiola, who died Tuesday, and ica ``can facilitate, we can help'' resolve the
country's crisis, Mandela told reporters.
	   ``But the solution will be reached as a result of negotiations
between the leaders themselves,'' Mandela said.
	   It wouldn't be the first time Mandela and Mbeki tried to resolve
crises elsewhere in Africa. Last year, they met with Zairean
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko to mediate his departure from the country
before rebel leader Laurent Kabila took it over and renamed it
Congo.
	   The Nigerian government said Abiola, the apparent winner of the
1993 presidential elections and who had been in detention since
1994, died of a heart attack. Some family members doubt the
explanation.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' one daughter, Hafsat, told CNN. ``All
of a sudden at the eve of his release, he dies.''
	   In a statement, the South African government urged Nigerians to
act with restraint amid ``this new and grave situation'' while also
reinforcing their nation's moves toward democracy.
	   Flags at the South African government's main offices in Pretoria
will be flown at half-staff for a week in Abiola's honor.

New York City finance chief: Swiss government brought on sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government's refusal to
join negotiations over the return of Holocaust assets is the main
reason for the sanctions threat against Switzerland's banks,
according to New York City's top finance official.
	   ``When the Swiss government informed us that neither it nor the
(Swiss) central bank would sign an accord ... we could no longer
put off sanctions,'' Alan Hevesi was quoted as saying in Thursday's
edition of the Zurich weekly Die Weltwoche. Copies were made
available Wednesday.
	   New York City Comptroller Hevesi claimed the Bern government had
``promised to find an indirect way to a comprehensive settlement,''
but hadn't fulfilled the pledge.
	   Jewish groups and claimants' lawyers say such a settlement can
be achieved only if the government and the central bank, accused of
profiting from handling gold taken from Holocaust victims, join
them in talks, Hevesi said.
	   Despite U.S. government objections, a Hevesi-chaired commission
advising hundreds of city and state finance officials last week
opened the way for sanctions after declaring negotiations between
Swiss commercial banks and Holocaust survivors had reached an
impasse.
	   New York City and state plan to bar short-term investments with
the banks if there is no settlement by Sept. 1, with further
restrictions if the impasse continues. Other states also have
sanctions plans.
	   Switzerland's three biggest banks made what they said was their
final offer of dlrs 600 million last month. Jewish leaders said
they should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   The banks ``have admitted they have some kind of guilt,'' Hevesi
said.
	   But the Swiss government had ``persuaded the (Swiss) public that
the Jewish community wants more and more, although Switzerland is
being so accommodating.'' he continued. ``That assertion is
false.''
	   The government insists the negotiations are strictly between the
banks and the claimants.
	   The central bank has said it will fight vigorously a
class-action suit filed against it on behalf of five Holocaust
victims.
	   Claims from some in Switzerland that the country is being
``blackmailed'' are ``simply criminal,'' Hevesi said.
	   Hevesi said protests from the U.S. government, which has praised
Switzerland for its efforts to investigate its wartime past and
repeatedly opposed sanctions, were ``irrelevant.''
	   ``Washington's opinion is important to us, but sometimes we have
a different opinion,'' Hevesi said, noting that the State
Department had failed to prevent local U.S. sanctions against South
Africa's apartheid system in the early 1980s.
	   The Swiss government ``must do an about-turn and fulfill its
obligations,'' he concluded. ``Otherwise the dispute will carry
on.''

Study: AIDS drug found useful in hepatitis B
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS overline to show that research involves hepatitis B,
not C. Hold for release at 2100 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A standard AIDS drug appears to slow liver damage
caused by hepatitis B.
	   A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at
the effects of the drug 3TC on people with long-standing infections
with the virus.
	   It found that after a year of treatment, signs of inflammatory
injury fell significantly in just over half of those getting the
medicine, compared with one-quarter of those on dummy medication.
	   The drug, also known as lamivudine or Epivir, is one of several
that block production of an essential viral protein known as
reverse transcriptase. Both the AIDS virus and hepatitis B use this
enzyme.
	   Worldwide, more than 300 million people are infected with
hepatitis B, and three-quarters of them are of Asian origin. The
virus can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.
	   Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha,
which can cause flu-like side effects. The researchers said 3TC is
easier to take and may work better, although the two medicines have
not been compared head to head.
	   The study was conducted on 358 patients in China. It was
directed by Dr. Ching-Lung Lai of the University of Hong Kong and
financed by Glaxo Wellcome, which makes the medicine.
	   In an editorial, Dr. Masao Omata of the University of Tokyo
noted that one year of treatment is unlikely to have an effect on
people's health, and studies of longer use are needed.

Czech leaders reach toleration pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates with Zeman and Klaus confirming agreement, quotes
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman, whose party came first in last month's election, said
Wednesday he was ready to sign an agreement with the runners-up to
form a single-party minority government.
	   The deal with the center-right Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus would enable Zeman to ask President Vaclav
Havel to designate him as prime minister _ albeit without a
majority in the Czech parliament.
	   Zeman was to meet Havel Thursday afternoon. If the president
designates him, Zeman would take office following parliamentary
approval at the legislature's first session next Wednesday.
	   Zeman's center-left party won 74 of the 200 parliamentary seats
in the June 19-20 elections, outpolling the others but falling
short of a majority. Klaus' Civic Democrats finished second with 63
seats.
	   After coalition talks with two small center-right parties _ the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union _ failed, Zeman settled
on Klaus, his archrival. Under the agreement, Klaus' party will
vote with Zeman's, without being part of the government.
	   Both he and Klaus reached the agreement Wednesday. The text is
to be released Thursday after both party leaders sign.
	   At a press conference Wednesday, Klaus confirmed the deal,
calling it ``the only solution which can bring long-term political
stability.''
	   Although Zeman is expected to become prime minister, political
observers said the big winner is Klaus, who controls enough seats
to bring down the government. By staying out of the Cabinet, Klaus
would not bear responsibility for unpopular decisions which the
government will likely be forced to take to revive the economy.
	   ``This is a great victory for Vaclav Klaus,'' said Jiri Pehe,
Havel's chief political adviser. ``This government will live only
as long as he (Klaus) wants it to live.''
	   Both Zeman and Christian Democrat leader Josef Lux have blamed
the Freedom Union for torpedoing talks on a three-party,
center-left coalition favored by President Havel.
	   The agreement is expected to boost power of the two largest
political parties, putting pressure on parliament's three smaller
groups _ the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and unreformed
Communists.
	   Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party have dominated Czech
politics since 1992. But the center-right, three-party coalition
government collapsed last fall amid accusations of corruption.

Huge labor protest in Puerto Rico trails off into picketing
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Drunken teen-agers rioted early
Wednesday, inspired by a massive labor protest that began with a
blockade of the island's main airport and lapsed into mundane
picketing.
	   Some stores opened, defying labor demands to stay closed until
11 p.m., (0200 GMT) when a two-day general strike to protest the
sale of the state telephone company is to end.
	   However, the island's major shopping malls remained closed
Wednesday because of a rash of bomb threats. Buses and taxis stayed
off the roads, and small commuter airlines and cargo companies at
regional airports remained grounded.
	   The youths smashed shop windows and flung bottles and cans at
police early Wednesday at a shopping mall near the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. headquarters in San Juan.
	   Police fired tear gas to halt the rampage and arrested 17
people.
	   Airlines continued flights to the island's main airport, which
was blockaded for four hours on Tuesday, creating widespread
headaches for tourists. Some had to drag luggage for 1 1/2 miles
(2.5 kilometers) in the tropical heat.
	   Labor leaders, meanwhile, said they would meet Thursday to
discuss ending the protest that prompted the general strike _ the
three-week-old walkout by 6,400 telephone workers.
	   The workers originally said they would return to work only if
Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed to a referendum on the sale. He has
refused to do so.
	   Labor leaders are considering a change of tactics including
periodic one-day walkouts, said Annie Cruz, leader of the
Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   A carnival-like atmosphere reigned on picket lines Wednesday,
with protesters singing anti-Rossello jingles and chanting ``Never
surrender _ the telephone company belongs to the people!'' Vendors
did a brisk business in single-star Puerto Rican flags.
	   Protesters blocked the entrance to Eli Lilly's pharmaceutical
plant, one of the island's largest employers, for several hours.
	   ``Our objective Wednesday is to paralyze industry,'' Jaime
Figueroa Jaramillo of the Union of Electrical Industry and
Irrigation Workers said. But the Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly said
its operation was barely affected.
	   Saboteurs, who on Tuesday strafed a bank with gunfire and
planted a bomb that police exploded harmlessly, also appeared to
lose steam. Protesters damaged an electrical transformer in Bayamon
and one man attacked a telephone pole with an axe Wednesday in
Corozal.
	   Dueling radio and television advertisements traded insults
against strikers and Rossello. One full-page newspaper
advertisement featured a picture of the 1986 DuPont Plaza Hotel
fire, which was set by disgruntled Teamsters. It killed 97 people
and injured 140.
	   ``Weigh the consequences _ where will the pressure lead?'' the
ad asked.
	   Although tens of thousands of mainly government workers are
striking, managers have ensured that most services have not been
interrupted.
	   Sabotage to telephone cables left 260,000 of the island's 1.3
million customers without long-distance service.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to a
consortium led by GTE Corp. is crucial to Rossello's plans to
privatize government enterprises. Workers fear thousands of
layoffs.

 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have found fresh genetic evidence
that Jews who consider themselves part of the priestly class known
as Cohanim really are part of an unbroken line extending back
thousands of years.
	   The Cohanim are said to be descended from Moses' brother, Aaron.
Originally they had primary responsibility for offering sacrifices
and serving as arbiters and mentors.
	   Today, in Orthodox and some other Jewish congregations, Cohanim
are still accorded special duties and privileges. They are given
the honor of reading first from the Torah during a service and
presiding over a traditional ceremony for some first-born boys.

Pope urges Roman Catholic clergy to focus on the spiritual
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II is urging Roman Catholic
priests to concentrate more on the spiritual and less on the
material.
	   The message from the Vatican, read here at a meeting of 4,000
priests from five continents, also called for greater unity among
the clergy for renewed missionary work.
	   It called for ``mutual encouragement for new
evangelizing...expressing in a very eloquent manner the new
fraternity that is emerging among you.''
	   ``Your mission, dear brothers, is clothed in great dignity, and
this should motivate you to minister to the faithful with care and
generosity, following the example of the Great Pastor,'' the pope
added.
	   John Paul's message, dated June 29, was read on Tuesday by
Cardinal Dario Castrillo Hoyos, prefect of the Vatican's Sacred
Congregation for Priests, to the 3rd International Meeting of
Priests from about 40 nations.
	   The July 7-12 ``encounter'' is being held at the Basilica de
Guadalupe, Mexico's holiest shrine, which John Paul venerated
during two of his three trips to Mexico. The ``revelation'' of the
Virgin of Guadalupe in the 16th century marked the beginning of
conversion to Christianity on the American continent.
	   The priests' earlier meetings, in 1996 in Fatima, Portugal, and
last year in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, also were held at shrines
to images of the Virgin Mary.
	   The Mexico City meeting is to guide Roman Catholic clergy during
the third millennium after the birth of Christ and _ as a sideline
_ to prepare for John Paul's fourth visit to Mexico in January.
	   A meeting of top Latin American clergy is expected during the
visit.
	   This week's encounter is divided into three study groups, which
John Paul's message said will concentrate mostly on missionary
work, spreading the Gospel and veneration of the Virgin Mary. Study
will focus on conversion, communion, and Marian missionary work.

Navy secretary says Boorda suicide was worst moment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Naval Power &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Outgoing U.S. Navy Secretary John Dalton said
Wednesday that the worst moment in his five years at the Pentagon
was the suicide of Adm. Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda.
	   ``Mike Boorda was ... someone that I personally liked and
respected and his tragic death was indeed the low point,'' Dalton
told reporters after a speech to the Royal United Services
Institute for Defense Studies.
	   The chief of naval operations took his life two years ago,
believing he had worn an unauthorized decoration for valor during
the Vietnam War.
	   Four months ago, Dalton put in Boorda's service record a letter
from Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. acknowledging the admiral was
entitled to wear the Combat Vs _ tiny bronze letters standing for
``valor.''
	   Zumwalt, who was chief of naval operations during the war, said
it was ``appropriate, justified and proper'' for Boorda to attach
the Combat Vs to the ribbons on his uniform.
	   ``I knew that Admiral Zumwalt had written such a letter and
wanted to make his comments a part of the record,'' Dalton said
Wednesday. ``I thought from the standpoint of history that his
grandchildren and great-grandchildren would like to know that those
things existed.''
	   Dalton also wrote a memo which he put in Boorda's file saying
the citations justifying the awards ``plainly state they were
awarded for service including `combat operations' and `while
operating in combat missions.'''
	   Dalton, who plans to return to the private sector at the end of
the year, said the high point of his years as navy secretary was
helping restore the reputation of the service after a series of
cheating, sexual harassment and sexual assault scandals.
	   ``We have transformed ourselves and we're a stronger Navy
today,'' he said.

Bogus police robbing motorists in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When a police car flashes its
emergency lights at you, you should pull over, right? Not
necessarily, police said Wednesday.
	   The vague advice came after robbers posing as policemen killed
one motorist and wounded another this week.
	   The decision to stop or not is a difficult one, police
Superintendent Eugene Opperman admitted.
	   ``Each situation must be judged on its own merits. People have
to decide if they should stop or continue slowly to the nearest
safe place,'' Opperman told the South African Press Association.
	   But if the person in a car with a flashing blue emergency light
winds up being a real policeman, a motorist ignoring order to pull
over could be in trouble.
	   ``Failure to stop when the order to do so comes from a
legitimate police or traffic official could have serious legal
consequences,'' Opperman said, adding that the charge carries a
maximum 4,000-rand (dlrs 650) fine or one year imprisonment or
both.
	   Motorists with cellular telephones should call police if they're
not sure if the person in the marked or unmarked car is a police
officer, Opperman suggested.
	   Law experts said if a motorist feels in danger, police might
have trouble making a charge stick.
	   ``In cases where it endangers the life of a person to (stop), it
could be readily explained in court that the person did not indend
to commit an offense,'' the Legal Resources Center said.
	   Flip Schutte, 56, was shot dead Tuesday night after he stopped
for a white car with a blue emergency light mounted on its roof.
The robbers also pulled his wife from the car and took her handbag
and a cellular phone.
	   Also Tuesday, in an apparently unrelated attack in another part
of the country, George Baloyi, 40, was wounded when he was pulled
over by a red car equipped with a flashing emergency light.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators set
conditions Wednesday for a controversial alliance between American
Airlines and British Airways, including a demand that they fly
fewer trans-Atlantic flights to maintain competition.
	   But the EU angered a rival group by saying it should also fly
under restraints.
	   European Commission officials told American and BA they must
make room for competitors at London's crowded Heathrow and Gatwick
airports if they want their often-delayed partnership to take off.
	   The Commission also slapped conditions on United Airlines'
coalition with Lufthansa German Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines
System, prompting a furious reaction.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police launched their heaviest
attack yet on Wednesday against a long-besieged guerrilla enclave
on the Albanian border, killing five people and wounding several
more, said ethnic Albanian sources.
	   The escalation of fighting around the mountainous border village
of Morina was accompanied by Serb shelling of at least four other
other area villages, said the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information
Center.
	   The reported Serb assault appeared an attempt to cut off Kosovo
Albanian militants from Albania, which serves both as a refuge and
the main source of weapons used by them in their battle for
independence from Serbia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form
the Yugoslav federation.
	   In another blow to the guerrillas, major powers meeting in Bonn,
Germany, to try and stop the Kosovo fighting called on governments
for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Germany, France, Britain and Italy _ warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.
	   The Information Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership favoring a peaceful independence struggle, said the dead
in Morina, 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Pristina, were all
men but it wasn't clear whether they were guerrillas or
non-combatants.
	   Most women and children have already fled the village, which
serves as a tentative link between Albania and the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Reporters who visited Morina in early June said only KLA
guerrillas occupy the village's 30 or so houses, within walking
distance of Albania.
	   Serb police control the area on three sides of Morina while a
border post of the Yugoslav National Army _ dominated by Serbia,
the larger of the two Yugoslav republics _ is stationed slightly to
the west.
	   Sources in the town of Djakovica, some 15 kilometers (9 miles)
east of Morina said the fierce fighting appeared to be dying down
by late Wednesday afternoon. One of them _ asking, like the others,
for anonymity _ said some unconfirmed reports had government
sources now in control of the area.
	   In Geneva, a group claiming to bankroll the KLA said nothing
short of independence would satisfy the guerrillas. Mahmuti
Bardhyl, a Swiss-based spokesman of the Popular Movement of Kosovo,
said the KLA would agree to a cease-fire only if the Serbs withdrew
all armed units from the province.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 10 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said, adding Abubakar was on the brink of
release.
	   He made no mention of the cabinet, though, beyond saying that
returning Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas, who are
from the north and are the majority in the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police.
	   Students in the southwestern university town of Ibadan have also
been protesting.
	   While Abiola had reportedly been quite ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, coming just days after U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would
be freed, including the opposition leader.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the U.S. State Department said there was no
reason to believe that the death was not the result of natural
causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``I suspect that he was poisoned, that he was murdered,'' his
daughter Hafsat said in an interview.
	   Abubakar said in his speech that an autopsy would be conducted
in cooperation with the Abiola family, and that pathologists were
being flown in from the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Pope arrives for vacation in Italian Alps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LORENZAGO, Italy (AP) _ Five-hundred people stood on a slope
Wednesday to welcome Pope John Paul II to one of his favorite spots
in the world -- the Italian Alps.
	   Many waved tiny yellow-and-white Vatican flags as the pope
stepped out of an Italian air force helicopter to begin a 13-day
vacation in this resort north of Venice.
	   John Paul, who has looked extremely weary in the Rome heat over
the past two weeks, appeared in relatively good form as he shook
hands with well-wishers and dignitaries.
	   Because of his frail condition, the 78-year-old pope no longer
takes extensive hikes but does make excursions by car, with limited
walking, during his annual summer Alpine vacation.

Who are these guys? USA Basketball says potential world champions

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Michael Jordan's reign as His Airness was still
years away when he won his first Olympic gold medal in 1984, and
David Robinson was just a big kid fresh out of Navy when he played
in the 1986 world championships.
	   Before the Dream Team, Dream Team II and whatever version this
year's was supposed to be, the United States took college players
to international games.
	   Now USA Basketball is trying the old way again _ with a '90s
twist. Because of the NBA lockout, USA Basketball dumped its NBA
All-Stars and is fielding a team of college stars, Canadian players
and Americans who play professionally overseas.
	   ``We've been able to select a team that hopefully will gel and
be competitive and bring home the gold medal,'' Craig Miller,
spokesman for USA Basketball, said Tuesday.
	   The roster will be pared to 12 by the time training camp ends
next Tuesday. The 1998 FIBA World Championships start July 29 in
Athens, Greece.
	   Of the 29 players who accepted invitations to this week's
training camp, the biggest names are Duke's Trajan Langdon and
Jimmy King, part of Michigan's famed Fab Five. Big East player of
the year Richard Hamilton, who flirted with turning pro before
deciding to return to Connecticut for his junior season, also made
the list. So did Mateen Cleaves, the Big Ten's player of the year.
	   Three current college players are coming to the training camp,
as are two who just exhausted their eligibility, 12 current CBA
players, nine who played overseas last year and three who played
both overseas and in the CBA.
	   One player, Evan Eschmeyer of Northwestern, declined an
invitation due to previous personal commitments. He will not be
replaced.
	   ``We feel confident that out of this group we can and will field
a very competitive team, a team that will go out and try to win the
world championship,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Had things gone according to the original plan, Tomjanovich
would be sizing up Grant Hill and Gary Payton this week. But with
the NBA lockout looming July 1, the 12 NBA players who'd been
chosen threatened to boycott the world championships.
	   USA Basketball moved first, dumping the NBA stars on June 16.
	   There's a lot more at stake for this team than just making their
mark, though. The world championships help determine what 12 teams
go to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and only the world
champion and the host country qualify automatically.
	   Other countries are still likely to use NBA players. Among those
scheduled to play are Vlade Divac of Yugoslavia, Steve Nash and
Rick Fox of Canada, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas of Lithuania.
	   The United States, with a team of NBA players, won the 1994
world championships in Toronto. The United States went on to win
the gold medal two years later in the Atlanta Olympics.
	   ``Before, everyone was conceding the gold medal to the U.S. and
everyone else was playing for silver and bronze,'' Miller said.
``Now, you have a competition where the best team won't be known
until the last game is played.''

Lili Alvarez, Spanish tennis pioneer, dies at 93
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Elia Maria Gonzalez Alvarez, a pioneer in
women's tennis in Spain, has died. She was 93.
	   Alvarez died Wednesday at her home in Madrid.
	   Better known as Lili Alvarez, she ruled Spanish tennis in the
1920s. She was a finalist at Wimbledon in 1926, 1927 and 1928, and
captured the French Open doubles title in 1929 with her Dutch
partner Kea Baumann.
	   Spanish Davis Cup coach Manuel Santana called Alvarez's death a
``great loss'' and praised her role in Spanish women's tennis.
	   Alvarez, who also ice skated and skiied, retired from sports in
1942 to write essays and poems, which were published in several
books. She became a political correspondent for the British
newspaper ``Daily Mail'' in the 1930s.
	   The athlete, who defined herself as a feminist, often complained
about the machismo of championship juries.
	   One year after she started playing at age 11, Alvarez won her
first international title. In her teen-age years, she rubbed
shoulders with monarchs, artists and politicians while living in
France.
	   Alvarez leaves no immediate family. She is to be buried Thursday
at the Almudena cemetery in Madrid.

Archaeologists unearth church, may be oldest in the world

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A mud brick basilica unearthed in the Red
Sea resort of Aqaba may be the oldest church in Jordan _ and
possibly the oldest building in the world that was designed to be
used as a church, archaeologists say.
	   ``There is a real possibility that it is a church built in the
late third century, but we need to study our find closely before we
come out with a resolute conclusion,'' Sawsan Fakhiri, director of
the Aqaba Antiquities Department, said Tuesday.
	   Until last month's discovery in downtown Aqaba near a bus
station surrounded by hotels overlooking the sea, the earliest
churches in Jordan were thought to date to the late fourth century.
	   For Fakhiri and other Jordanian archaeology experts, the
building is significant even if it does not prove to be the world's
oldest church, because it's a starting point in the succession of
Roman, Byzantine and Islamic civilizations along the Red Sea.
	   ``It shows the evolution of the town in terms of antiquity over
1,000 years ending with the Islamic culture,'' said Rami Khoury, a
Jordanian writer in archaeology.
	   Older churches have been found _ at Dura Europa on the Euphrates
River in eastern Syria and along the Sea of Galilee in northern
Israel, but they were constructed and used as houses before being
converted to churches.
	   ``If the Aqaba (building) does in fact prove to date to the late
third century, it would be not only the oldest church in Jordan,
but (also the oldest) in the world designed and built as a
church,'' said Thomas Parker, a history professor at North Carolina
State University.
	   He is leading the 53 Jordanian and American archaeologists and
historians excavating the site.
	   Many of the best-known Christian shrines, such as Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity, were built later or underwent major reconstruction during
medieval times.
	   Experts outside of Jordan welcomed the find, but asked for more
evidence to date the building.
	   ``I certainly think it is a very possible find,'' said Alice
Christ of the University of Kentucky. ``At that period there should
be buildings built specifically as churches.''
	   Glen W. Bowersock at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, New Jersey was more skeptical.
	   ``I hear nothing that would persuade me that it has to be third
century,'' he said. ``I would need to have coins that were third
century and did not run into the fourth century or inscriptions
with a date.''

Navy secretary says Boorda suicide was worst moment

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Outgoing U.S. Navy Secretary John Dalton said
Wednesday that the worst moment in his five years at the Pentagon
was the suicide of Adm. Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda.
	   ``Mike Boorda was ... someone that I personally liked and
respected and his tragic death was indeed the low point,'' Dalton
told reporters after a speech to the Royal United Services
Institute for Defense Studies.
	   The chief of naval operations took his life two years ago,
believing he had worn an unauthorized decoration for valor during
the Vietnam War.
	   Four months ago, Dalton put in Boorda's service record a letter
from Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. acknowledging the admiral was
entitled to wear the Combat Vs _ tiny bronze letters standing for
``valor.''
	   Zumwalt, who was chief of naval operations during the war, said
it was ``appropriate, justified and proper'' for Boorda to attach
the Combat Vs to the ribbons on his uniform.
	   ``I knew that Admiral Zumwalt had written such a letter and
wanted to make his comments a part of the record,'' Dalton said
Wednesday. ``I thought from the standpoint of history that his
grandchildren and great-grandchildren would like to know that those
things existed.''
	   Dalton also wrote a memo which he put in Boorda's file saying
the citations justifying the awards ``plainly state they were
awarded for service including `combat operations' and `while
operating in combat missions.'''
	   But when asked Wednesday whether Boorda had the right to wear
the decorations, Dalton replied that it wasn't a decision for him
to make _ ``so it's not a question of what I think or what another
senior naval official thinks.''
	   The only official way of changing Boorda's record is for someone
to request the Board of Corrections of the Naval Records to review
the awards, he said.
	   Typically, such a request is made by a family member, but no
request has been made in Boorda's case, he said.

Former U.S. official is critical of U.S. role in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A former U.S. assistant secretary of state,
questioned by a parliamentary committee investigating the 1994
Rwanda massacres, praised France for reportedly saving lives but
gave a critical portrait of a gun-shy America which failed to
intervene.
	   Herman Cohen, who served as assistant secretary of state for
African affairs from 1989 to 1993, told the committee Tuesday that
he was ``very angry at the United States government for stopping
the United Nations from intervening.''
	   The French parliamentary committee has been holding hearings
since April to investigate whether France may have played a role in
the genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandans in 1994.
	   Cohen, speaking in French, praised the French military effort --
code named Operation Turquoise -- that started in 1990, saying that
it ``was the only effort made to save Tutsi lives and I believe it
saved between 20,000 and 40,000 lives.''
	   ``The French troops contributed to stabilizing the region
somewhat, to decreasing the humanitarian catastrophe and to opening
room for negotiation,'' Cohen said.
	   Asked about the American role, Cohen suggested that the United
States had grown gun shy following losses in its 1993 intervention
in Somalia.
	   Asked whether the United States played down the Rwandan genocide
in order to avoid any obligation to intervene, Cohen replied:
``That is completely true.''
	   ``After the disaster in Somalia,'' he said, ``the United States
had become very allergic to U.N. interventions in developing
countries.''
	   The fear of repeating a Somalia-style catastrophe was behind the
U.S. rejection of a U.N. plan to send 5,000 African soldiers ``who
were willing to go,'' Cohen said.
	   The parliamentary fact-finding mission, which has held hearings
since April, was launched after reports France continued to arm and
support Rwanda's French-speaking, Hutu-led government even after
the genocide of Tutsis began in April 1994.
	   France has been accused of mounting Operation Turquoise to
protect its old Hutu friends.
	   Cohen, no longer in government service, dismissed suspicions by
some French officials that the United States and Britain were
trying to usurp French influence in Africa.
	   ``I was very surprised by this notion of an Anglo-Saxon plot
against France,'' said Cohen, ``since firstly, there was none and
secondly, had the United States wanted to do anything against
French interests in Africa, we would not have started with a
country as small as Rwanda ....
	   ``It was completely untrue and it's a shame,'' added M.Cohen,
``since it stopped the United States and France from communicating
during the crisis.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Drunken teen-agers rioted early
Wednesday, inspired by a massive labor protest that began with a
blockade of the island's main airport and lapsed into mundane
picketing.
	   Some stores opened, defying labor demands to stay closed until
11 p.m., (0200 GMT) when a two-day general strike to protest the
sale of the state telephone company is to end.
	   However, the island's major shopping malls remained closed
Wednesday because of a rash of bomb threats. Buses and taxis stayed
off the roads, and small commuter airlines and cargo companies at
regional airports remained grounded.
	   The youths smashed shop windows and flung bottles and cans at
police early Wednesday at a shopping mall near the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. headquarters in San Juan.
	   Police fired tear gas to halt the rampage and arrested 17
people.
	   Airlines continued flights to the island's main airport, which
was blockaded for four hours on Tuesday, creating widespread
headaches for tourists. Some had to drag luggage for 1 1/2 miles
(2.5 kilometers) in the tropical heat.
	   Labor leaders, meanwhile, said they would meet Thursday to
discuss ending the protest that prompted the general strike _ the
three-week-old walkout by 6,400 telephone workers.
	   The workers originally said they would return to work only if
Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed to a referendum on the sale. He has
refused to do so.
	   Labor leaders are considering a change of tactics including
periodic one-day walkouts, said Annie Cruz, leader of the
Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   A carnival-like atmosphere reigned on picket lines Wednesday,
with protesters singing anti-Rossello jingles and chanting ``Never
surrender _ the telephone company belongs to the people!'' Vendors
did a brisk business in single-star Puerto Rican flags.
	   Protesters blocked the entrance to Eli Lilly's pharmaceutical
plant, one of the island's largest employers, for several hours.
	   ``Our objective Wednesday is to paralyze industry,'' Jaime
Figueroa Jaramillo of the Union of Electrical Industry and
Irrigation Workers said. But the Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly said
its operation was barely affected.
	   Saboteurs, who on Tuesday strafed a bank with gunfire and
planted a bomb that police exploded harmlessly, also appeared to
lose steam. Protesters damaged an electrical transformer in Bayamon
and one man attacked a telephone pole with an axe Wednesday in
Corozal.
	   Dueling radio and television advertisements traded insults
against strikers and Rossello. One full-page newspaper
advertisement featured a picture of the 1986 DuPont Plaza Hotel
fire, which was set by disgruntled Teamsters. It killed 97 people
and injured 140.
	   ``Weigh the consequences _ where will the pressure lead?'' the
ad asked.
	   Although tens of thousands of mainly government workers are
striking, managers have ensured that most services have not been
interrupted.
	   Sabotage to telephone cables left 260,000 of the island's 1.3
million customers without long-distance service.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to a
consortium led by GTE Corp. is crucial to Rossello's plans to
privatize government enterprises. Workers fear thousands of
layoffs.

	   ROME (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday promised to fight on
as leader of the center-right opposition despite a second
corruption conviction, and lashed out at prosecutors.
	   The media magnate and former premier continued his attack on the
Milan pool of prosecutors for what he called a politically
motivated campaign against him.
	   ``My acquittal would have meant a declaration of guilt for the
pool for the notice in Naples,'' he told reporters. That was a
reference to the first official notification that he was under
investigation in the case, made public while Berlusconi presided
over the G-7 gathering as head of government in 1994.
	   Berlusconi had bitterly denounced the notice as a public attempt
to embarrass him while the eyes of the world were focused on the
meeting of industrial nations.
	   Meanhwile, Premier Romano Prodi met with key ministers Wednesday
night to prepare for a showdown with leaders of the parties in his
Parliament majority.
	   Splits with the hardline Communists have strained the majority
to the near-breaking point, and Prodi has indicated that without a
solid declaration of support, he might resign.
	   Earlier in the day, Berlusconi's opposition partners rushed to
his defense, criticizing the verdict by the Milan court Tuesday as
politically motivated.
	   ``All of this puts into question one of the fundamental
principles of law: that justice is the same for all,'' said
Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightist National Alliance party and
Berlusconi's main ally.
	   Berlusconi was given a two year and nine month prison term for
bribing tax inspectors to obtain favorable audits of his Fininvest
media and retail holding company. The market ignored the
conviction; the publicly traded Mediaset division registered a
slight gain Wednesday.
	   It is unlikely Berlusconi will go to jail because in Italy
sentences under three years often are suspended.
	   ``I will continue along my path,'' the AGI news agency quoted
Berlusconi as telling senators from his Forza Italia party.
	   Berlusconi, who says he is a victim of a vendetta by Milan
prosecutors he sees as left-leaning, was convicted for fraud in
December in a 1987 film company deal.
	   Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies was debating a proposal by
the opposition to set up a commission to investigate the Milan
corruption probes starting in 1992 that implicated hundreds of
politicians and business figures.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 10 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said, adding Abubakar was on the brink of
release.
	   He made no mention of the cabinet though, he said that returning
Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas are from the
north. Hausas, along with the northern Fulanis, are the majority in
the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police. State radio later said police had restored
calm there but a dusk-to-dawn curfew had been imposed.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Fresh from a meeting that called for
tougher measures against Kosovo's separatist guerrillas, Germany's
foreign minister on Wednesday lobbied the government in Albania for
support.
	   ``We are for Kosovo's autonomy and not for its independence,''
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters at the Tirana Rinas
airport where he was received by the Albanian Foreign Minister
Paskal Milo. He was echoing the common stance of the Contact Group,
which also includes the United States, Russia, France, Britain and
Italy.
	   Kinkel and other Contact Group representatives, meeting in Bonn,
Germany, to try and stop the Kosovo fighting, called Wednesday on
governments for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to
the ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.
	   The Albanian government favors a peaceful solution of the crisis
in Kosovo, a Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are the 9-1
majority.
	   But as violence in Kosovo escalates, the Albanian government is
under pressure from right wing political groups in favor of
Kosovo's succession from Serbia.
	   Maps of Greater Albania _ including Kosovo _ are easily found in
bookstores. State television refers to the fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army as ``heroes.''
	   Kinkel is expected to ask the Albanian authorities for greater
efforts in preventing the use of the country as a transit point for
money and arms supplies for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   But that is an impossible task, even if the Albanian government
wants to comply. Border regions with Kosovo are hard to control,
and smuggling and other criminal activity is rife.
	   Kinkel expressed concerns about the increasing number of ethnic
Albanian refugees arriving to Germany as they flee the violence. He
said nearly 3,000 had come in the last two days alone.
	   He met late Wednesday with the Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani.
	   On Thursday he will fly to Albania's northern border and meet
with ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.

Serb opposition group urges Milosevic to make Kosovo autonomy
</HEADLINE>
official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Serbian opposition party urged Yugoslav
President Slobodon Milosevic on Wednesday to accept foreign
mediation for Kosovo and make official his willingness to restore
autonomy to the rebellious southern province.
	   Milosevic should offer ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova a
platform that outlines four levels of autonomy for Kosovo, said
Vojislav Mihajlovic, a prominent member of the Serbian Renewal
Movement.
	   The platform should grant Kosovo a high degree of local self
rule in municipalities and towns; an autonomous provincial
legislature and government; and proportional Albanian
representation in both the Serbian and federal Yugoslav legislature
and government, said Mihajlovic, a vice president in the Serb
parliament.
	   The Serbian Renewal Movement, once the largest opposition party
in Serbia, has shown signs of cooperating with the government and
has negotiated entering the Serbian and Yugoslav government,
dominated by pro-Milosevic parties.
	   The party has sided with the government on many issues about
Kosovo, where violence has escalated since February when Serb
forces cracked down on Albanian extremists fighting for
independence. Party member Gvozden Rosic, who accompanied
Mihajlovic at a news conference, said the only differences with the
Serb leadership over Kosovo were over the methodology about ending
the conflict.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore the autonomy for
Kosovo he canceled in 1989 but has resisted calls for foreign
mediation.
	   ``We have nothing against having foreign mediators in the
solution of the crisis,'' Mihajlovic said. ``We consider the
government will also have to come around to this position.''
	   He rejected independence as a solution. ``As far as the Serb
nation is concerned, it does not exist without Kosovo,'' he said.

Canadian trade mission planned for eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien will lead a major
Canadian trade mission to Ukraine, Russia and Poland in January,
his office announced Wednesday.
	   Provincial politicians and business executives from across
Canada will be invited to join the tour, scheduled for Jan. 16-27.
	   The trip marks the fifth major trade mission since Chretien took
office in 1993 and is the first to Eastern Europe.
	   Previous missions went to China in 1994; to India, Pakistan,
Indonesia and Malaysia in 1996; to South Korea, the Philippines and
Thailand in 1997; and to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile this
year.
	   Chretien says those trips led to contracts worth billions of
dollars for Canadian business, though critics say he and his
Cabinet ministers do little more than sign deals already
negotiated.
	   Canada's two-way trade with Ukraine, Russia and Poland currently
amounts to about dlrs 1 billion (U.S.) a year.
	   Canada does nearly that much in business every day with the
United States, which continues to account for more than 80 percent
of Canada's foreign trade despite efforts to diversify and develop
new markets.

Zanardi, Gordon on Formula One list with Villeneuve, Hill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to ex-manager in third graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRACKLEY, England (AP) _ Italian Alex Zanardi, driving on the
American CART series, and NASCAR's Jeff Gordon are on a short list
to join Formula One's newest team _ British American Racing _ when
it hits the track next season.
	   BAR's managing director Craig Pollock added those two Wednesday
to a list that already includes defending series champion Jacques
Villeneuve and '96 world champion Damon Hill.
	   Villeneuve, linked with the new team since it was formed seven
months ago, denies he has decided to leave Williams and drive for
BAR. Pollock is also Villeneuve's ex-manager and former teacher.
	   ``Of course I'd like him on board,'' said Pollock, as he spoke
Wednesday at the team's new headquarters being built an hour
northwest of London.
	   ``But a certain Mr. Williams (Williams owner, Frank) would like
to keep him and a couple of other teams would like to take him
away.''
	   Pollock also expressed interest in '96 series champion Damon
Hill, who is winless this season at Jordan Mugen-Honda and has yet
to finish in the top six.
	   Pollock admitted there was a risk involved coming to a new team
and said he hoped to name a test driver at Sunday's British Grand
Prix in Silverstone, England.
	   ``But I could look him (Villeneuve) or Damon Hill in the eye and
say I could provide you with a package that you could build up,''
Pollock said.
	   Earlier this month the team announced Renault would power the
new team.
	   BAR is a joint venture of British American Tobacco, Reynard
Racing Cars and Pollock with 50 percent of the team owned by the
tobacco company and Reynard and Pollock splitting the other half.
	   Reports have suggested BAT has invested 200 million pounds (dlrs
330 million) in the team, a figure BAT declines to confirm.

Sex-related investigations rise in Canada's military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Sex-related investigations by Canada's military
police are on the rise this year, running about 50 percent higher
than in 1997, according to figures released Wednesday.
	   The military has been embarrassed in recent weeks by a series of
media reports about rapes and sexual assaults of female soldiers
over the past decade. In response, commanders have been urging
soldiers to come forward with complaints.
	   Figures released Wednesday show that the military police
investigative service has received 110 sex-related complaints so
far this year. Last year, they handled a total of 145.
	   Of this year's cases, charges have been laid in 26 incidents.

NATO Secretary-General visits Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
arrived in Kiev on Wednesday to discuss the alliance's military and
technical cooperation with Ukraine, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   During his two-day visit Solana will meet President Leonid
Kuchma and other top officials to discuss the appointment of a NATO
liaison officer, the first step towards opening a permanent mission
in the former Soviet republic.
	   Solana is also to visit the alliance's Information and
Documentation Center in Kiev and present its new director. The
center _ the only one of its kind in a non-NATO country _ was
opened last year to improve Ukrainian citizens' understanding of
the alliance.
	   Ukrainian officials said the country intends to further expand
its cooperation with NATO.
	   ``Ukraine considers NATO an alliance of democratic states which
poses no threat to its national security,'' the Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
	   The ministry said Ukraine plans to pursue a variety of military
and technical cooperation projects, such as joint design of weapons
and military conversion.
	   Ukraine also wants to cooperate with NATO in space research,
combating organized crime and drug trafficking, and coping with
emergency situations, the ministry said.
	   These issues were included in a draft cooperation program
approved by the Ukrainian government on Tuesday that is expected to
be finalized during Solana's trip.
	   Solana also plans to visit Yuzhmash, a huge rocket-producing
plant in the eastern city of Dnipropetrovsk.
	   The trip marks the first anniversary of the cooperation charter
between Ukraine and NATO.

	   The pair met in 1991, and the first mysterious death came the
following year when Schmidt said his wife of five months, Ursula
Deschamps, died when their car fell into a canal in Mons, Belgium.
	   ``Deschamps was fished out of the canal several days later,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Hugo Black. Steve Levy, a friend of
Schmidt's, told investigators that Schmidt confided ``he drowned
her by holding her head below water.''
	   Schmidt collected dlrs 500,000 in insurance money.
	   Ms. Martin met her future husband, Marc Van Beers, through a
marriage agency. He died on their Corsican honeymoon May 11, 1995,
and she collected dlrs 800,000 in insurance and money from the sale
of their house.
	   She told accident investigators that she scrambled out as their
car went over a 460-foot (140-meter) seaside cliff after dinner on
a dark night. Prosecutors contend Schmidt and three other men beat
Van Beers to death with a baseball bat, fracturing his skull before
his body was found in the surf.
	   Fabienne Lefevre, the former wife of Ms. Martin's father, is a
key witness tying the two deaths together. She said Ms. Martin
incriminated herself from her hospital bed by saying she and
Schmidt committed ``a perfect crime'' and they would profit more
than the first killing.
	   Ms. Martin's father, Jean Marie Martin, who appeared in court
but was not allowed to testify, was prepared to dispute her story.

Council concerned by report of U.N. human rights team for Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council expressed concern
Wednesday about evidence of massacres in the Congo but postponed a
response to calls by U.N. investigators for an international
tribunal to prosecute violations of human rights.
	   The council was investigating whether local Congolese courts had
the ability and the political will to carry out such prosecutions
themselves, said council sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The tribunal recommendation was made in a report, released last
week, by the U.N. human rights team which was pulled from Congo in
April because of what the United Nations said was a complete lack
of cooperation from the government.
	   The team was sent in August to investigate massacres of Rwandan
Hutu refugees allegedly carried out by Laurent Kabila's forces
during their victorious march across the African nation of Zaire.
In May 1997, Kabila took power of Zaire and renamed it Congo.
	   The Rwandan Hutu refugees fled across the border to Zaire to
escape punishment for the 1994 Hutu-sponsored massacre of an
estimated half-million Tutsis.
	   Though admittedly incomplete because of the aborted mission, the
U.N. report gave evidence of Rwandan involvement in the massacres
of hundreds of unarmed civilians by troops loyal to Kabila. It also
said it found forensic evidence of Congolese government attempts to
cover up the massacres by removing bodies from a mass grave at
Mbandaka.
	   The investigators called for the international tribunal
prosecuting the Rwandan genocide to be expanded to try what it said
were serious violations of human rights and breaches of
humanitarian law that may constitute genocide.
	   Such a tribunal, however, would only be used if the local
judicial system were judged inadequate, and the council was looking
first to determine if the Congolese system was sufficient, the
sources said.
	   Congo strongly rejected the findings of the report, however, and
there were questions about whether local courts had the ability or
the political will to prosecute the crimes.
	   Nevertheless, Congolese ambassador Andre Mwamba Kapanga, in a
meeting with council president Sergey Lavrov of Russia, said Congo
``looked forward to working with the international community'' to
help build up the judiciary system, the sources said.
	   After its first consideration of the report, the 15-member
council ``expressed concern about the conclusions of the report,''
and was preparing a response ``on the basis of the council's
responsibility of the maintenance of international peace and
security,'' Lavrov said.
	   Though no one voiced opposition, China seemed unenthusiastic
about adopting a presidential statement, council sources said.
	   Negotiations were continuing on the wording of the reaction.
	   Kabila denies that his forces targeted refugees, but has
acknowledged that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by former President
Mobutu Sese Seko to fight the rebels, may have been killed.
Kabila's men drove Mobutu into exile, where he died.

Woosnam holds first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Ian Woosnam shot a 4-under-par 67 to
take the first-round lead Wednesday at the 850,000-pound (dlrs 1.4
million) Loch Lomond tournament, a tuneup for next week's British
Open.
	   Woosnam closed with a seven-foot birdie putt to finish with a
one-shot lead over playing partner Gary Orr, Costantino Rocca and
David Howell.
	   The 40-year-old Welshman, playing before heavy rain came in the
afternoon, had two birdies on the front nine and three more on the
back nine. His only mistake came when he three-putted at the ninth.
	   ``Sometimes I've run into form too early for the Open,'' Woosnam
said. ``Hopefully this time I'm just finding some.''
	   On a day when only 11 players broke par, Paul Broadhurst and Lee
Westwood were two shots back at 69, with Americans Stewart Cink and
Robert Damron among those at 70.
	   Spain's Sergio Garcia, the British amateur champion, shot a 71.
U.S. amateur champ Matt Kuchar, playing in his first European tour
event, had a 73.
	   Colin Montgomerie, seeking his first win on home soil, shot a
1-over 72 that included four birdies and five bogeys. Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabal also had a 72.
	   Defending champion Tom Lehman, playing in the worst of the rainy
weather, played his first five holes in 5-under. But he took a
double bogey 7 at the 625-yard sixth and finished in 73.
	   Howard Twitty had a 78 and Mark Brooks, the 1996 PGA champion, a
79.
	   Former British amateur champion Gordon Sherry, fourth in the
Scottish Open three years ago, had an 80. Ryder Cup player
Per-Ulrik Johansson shot 81 and his fellow Swede Anders Forsbrand
87.
	   Nick Faldo withdrew with an injured right elbow and could be in
danger of missing the British Open at Birkdale.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A country that has finally and hopelessly caught
World Cup fever painted its faces and settled behind TV sets in
living rooms, bars and cafes Wednesday to watch ``Les Bleus'' _ the
Blues _ battle Croatia for a berth in a dream final with Brazil.
	   For France, the country that invented the World Cup, it was an
exquisite chance to make soccer history, reaching the final for the
first time.
	   But some saw it as more: the most unifying thing that's happened
here in a long time, bringing together old and young, men and
women, and different social groups in a burst of patriotic
enthusiasm.
	   Roaming Paris Wednesday, it was hard to imagine that at the
beginning of the tournament, some French were less than thrilled
about the extravaganza that would bring unruly crowds, high prices
and even worse traffic than usual.
	   On the metro, there were no bands of kilted, singing Scots or
chanting South American fans. But there were lots of Parisians with
cheeks painted the red, white and blue of the French flag _ even if
for some, the rest of their attire was more suited for the office.
	   Philippe Vallot, 36, a computer executive, was headed for the
game after work, in an elegant business suit but with painted
cheeks.
	   ``I don't know how long this feeling will last, but let's enjoy
it now,'' he said, acknowledging that many French are not the
diehard fans found in South America or some European countries,
like Italy.
	   ``At least we're all behind the French team for now,'' he said.
``Let's hope they win. It may pass, but we'll have our memories.''
	   The fever seemed to be spreading to women, too.
	   Danielle Trepant, a 46-year-old housewife from northern France,
looked as properly French as they come, with carefully coiffed hair
and a soft voice. But she was dressed head-to-foot in tricolor-flag
jacket and pants, all saying ``Allez la France!'' _ and a jester
hat with pom-poms and bells. Her cheeks, needless to say, were
multicolored.
	   ``I have to admit, I didn't really watch soccer much before
this,'' she said, her husband nodding in amused agreement.
``Actually, hardly at all. But this is different _ it's in France,
and the World Cup. It's just another spirit.''
	   Vincent Rey, a wine seller from Clermont-Ferrand in the south,
paused on a train ride to the stadium to explain how he got his
tickets: a lottery at his bank, six months ago.
	   ``It's not true, that we don't love soccer like the others,'' he
said, offering the theory that the French taste in soccer is
somewhat similar to its taste in wine: discriminating.
	   ``We appreciate the beauty of a good game,'' Rey said. ``We are

	   Disagreeing heartily was James Balen, 20, a student in London
who is half Croatian and half English. Balen has spent most of the
money he has in the world coming to France four times to support
the Croatian team _ without tickets.
	   ``The French people have been really great, I think,'' he said.
``Everybody's nice to me, hotel keepers, people in the street,
everybody.''
	   France has suffered three heartbreaking defeats at the semifinal
stage, in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Many saw Wednesday's match as the
best chance ever to make history.
	   ``This would be historic,'' blared the headline of the sports
daily L'Equipe.
	   But would the feeling last after the World Cup? Not everyone
thought so.
	   ``There will be happiness for a few days,'' said textile worker
Nicolas Tchicedemian, 25, riding home on the subway to watch the
game on TV. ``Then, everything will go right back to normal.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ A country that has finally and hopelessly caught
World Cup fever painted its faces and settled behind TV sets in
living rooms, bars and cafes Wednesday to watch ``Les Bleus'' _ the
Blues _ battle Croatia for a berth in a dream final with Brazil.
	   For France, the country that invented the World Cup, it was an
exquisite chance to make soccer history, reaching the final for the
first time.
	   But some saw it as more: the most unifying thing that's happened
here in a long time, bringing together old and young, men and
women, and different social groups in a burst of patriotic
enthusiasm.
	   Roaming Paris Wednesday, it was hard to imagine that at the
beginning of the tournament, some French were less than thrilled
about the extravaganza that would bring unruly crowds, high prices
and even worse traffic than usual.
	   On the metro, there were no bands of kilted, singing Scots or
chanting South American fans. But there were lots of Parisians with
cheeks painted the red, white and blue of the French flag _ even if
for some, the rest of their attire was more suited for the office.
	   Philippe Vallot, 36, a computer executive, was headed for the
game after work, in an elegant business suit but with painted
cheeks.
	   ``I don't know how long this feeling will last, but let's enjoy
it now,'' he said, acknowledging that many French are not the
diehard fans found in South America or some European countries,
like Italy.
	   ``At least we're all behind the French team for now,'' he said.
``Let's hope they win. It may pass, but we'll have our memories.''
	   The fever seemed to be spreading to women, too.
	   Danielle Trepant, a 46-year-old housewife from northern France,
looked as properly French as they come, with carefully coiffed hair
and a soft voice. But she was dressed head-to-foot in tricolor-flag
jacket and pants, all saying ``Allez la France!'' _ and a jester
hat with pom-poms and bells. Her cheeks, needless to say, were
multicolored.
	   ``I have to admit, I didn't really watch soccer much before
this,'' she said, her husband nodding in amused agreement.
``Actually, hardly at all. But this is different _ it's in France,
and the World Cup. It's just another spirit.''
	   Vincent Rey, a wine seller from Clermont-Ferrand in the south,
paused on a train ride to the stadium to explain how he got his
tickets: a lottery at his bank, six months ago.
	   ``It's not true, that we don't love soccer like the others,'' he
said, offering the theory that the French taste in soccer is
somewhat similar to its taste in wine: discriminating.
	   ``We appreciate the beauty of a good game,'' Rey said. ``We are
less interested in who wins. In fact, tonight all I wish for is a
beautiful match. I don't really care who wins.''
	   Disagreeing heartily was James Balen, 20, a student in London
who is half Croatian and half English. Balen has spent most of the
money he has in the world coming to France four times to support
the Croatian team _ without tickets.
	   ``The French people have been really great, I think,'' he said.
``Everybody's nice to me, hotel keepers, people in the street,
everybody.''
	   France has suffered three heartbreaking defeats at the semifinal
stage, in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Many saw Wednesday's match as the
best chance ever to make history.
	   ``This would be historic,'' blared the headline of the sports
daily L'Equipe.
	   But would the feeling last after the World Cup? Not everyone
thought so.
	   ``There will be happiness for a few days,'' said textile worker
Nicolas Tchicedemian, 25, riding home on the subway to watch the
game on TV. ``Then, everything will go right back to normal.''

 &UR; Sale of first edition of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' sets record
at book auction

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' printed by England's earliest typographer sold at auction
Wednesday for 4,621,500 pounds (dlrs 7.53 million), a price which
auctioneers Christie's said was a world record.
	   ``This has become the most expensive book ever sold,'' said
Victoria Coode, spokeswoman for Christie's. Coode said that the
previous record sale price for a book was dlrs 5.3 million paid at
auction in New York in Oct. 1987 for a Gutenberg bible printed in
1455.
	   The red leather bound edition of ``Canterbury Tales,'' printed
by William Caxton in either 1476 or 1477, was one of eight rare
books offered at the auction.
	   An edition of the first book printed in English, ``Recuyell of
the Historyes of Troye'' translated from French by Caxton and
printed in either 1473 or 1474, sold for 771,500 pounds (dlrs 1.23
million.).
	   Coode said that the ``Canterbury Tales'' were sold to a London
book dealer.
	   The eight books were part of a collection, housed at Wentworth
Woodhouse in Yorkshire, northern England, started in the 15th
century by a Fitzwilliam forbear, Thomas Wentworth, Earl of
Strafford.

World Cup: France and Croatia 0-0 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France squandered plenty of
possession and shooting chances and was held 0-0 by World Cup
outsider Croatia at halftime of their semifinal game Wednesday.
	   Although creative midfielder Zinedine Zidane looked a constant
danger to the Croatian defense around the edge of the penalty box,
his shooting and heading didn't match his imaginative play in a
game watched from the stands by Presidents Jacques Chirac of France
and Croatia's Franjo Tudjman.
	   After two games in which its strikers had failed to score, the
French forwards put together a sweetly-constructed move in the
fourth minute to open up the Croatian defense at the Stade de
France.
	   Youri Djorkaeff fed Stephane Guivarc'h down the right and the
striker neatly back-heeled the ball to Zidane on the edge of the
area but the midfielder's first-time shot was straight at 'keeper
Drazen Ladic.
	   Five minutes later the Juventus star climbed above two Croatian
defenders to head a cross from Emmanuel Petit over the bar.
	   With the French creating the better openings, Zidane and Didier
Deschamps both moved into long range shooting positions but fired
into the crowd instead of the net.
	   Zidane tried his luck from 25 meters (yards) again in the 20th
minute but Ladic dived low to his left to take the ball confidently
at the foot of the post.
	   A minute later the Croatian 'keeper had to make a far more
difficult save, plunging quickly to his right to block a powerfully
struck 30-meter free from Guivarc'h.
	   The first danger to the French defense came in the 34th minute
when Aljosa Asanovic collected a short pass forward, turned a
defender and fired wide of the near post from 15 meters.
	   Five minutes before halftime Zidine let fly with a powerful
30-meter volley which was curling wide when the diving Ladic dived
to turn it behind for a corner.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Thierry Henry, 31st),
Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Stephane
Guivarc'h, Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Slaven Bilic, Igor Stimac, Dario Simic;
Mario Stanic, Zvonimir Soldo, Zvonimir Boban, Aljosa Asanovic,
Robert Jarni; Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic.
	   Referee _ Jose Manuel Garcia, Spain.

Defendant in Gucci slay case says he only wanted to defraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A defendant accused in the killing of
fashion heir Maurizio Gucci testified Wednesday he was only trying
to defraud Gucci's widow, the main defendant in the trial.
	   Ivano Savioni also told the Milan court that the alleged
trigger-man, Benedetto Ceraulo, admitted to him that he had killed
Gucci.
	   Savioni said Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli,
commissioned the murder for some 600 million lire (dlrs 335,000).
	   The prosecution alleges she arranged the 1995 slaying in order
to gain control over his multi-million dollar estate.
	   Savioni's testimony appeared to support her defense. She claims
the other defendants killed Gucci on their own and sought to extort
money from her.
	   Savioni, the doorman for a seedy hotel in Milan's prostitution
district, is accused of contacting another defendant, Orazio
Cicala, who allegedly brought Ceraulo on board.
	   Savioni said he turned to Cicala under pressure from Reggani
Martinelli and her psychic, Giuseppina (Pina) Auriemma, in order to
show them he was working on the murder plot.
	   ``I needed a shoulder to lean on to give me some credibility,''
Savioni told the court.
	   ``Pina was being pressured and in turn she pressured me,'' he
said, calling him six to eight times a day. ``She was bombarding
me. I couldn't take it anymore,'' he said.
	   The naming of Ceraulo was important because the killer's
identity was thrown into question in June when Cicala, the driver
of the getaway car, confessed to his role but denied that Ceraulo
was the killer.

Argentine judge investigating former junta leader receives death
</HEADLINE>
threat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A federal judge investigating a
former military junta leader detained on charges of child
kidnapping recently received a death threat, the judge's secretary
said Wednesday.
	   The note, typewritten on paper with an Argentine military
letterhead alongside the national flag, was received in the mail
June 21st, Diego Olmedo said. Judge Roberto Marquevich immediately
notified authorities of the threat, Olmedo said.
	   The threat was made public for the first time Wednesday.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman said the note ``in no way is a
reflection of the feelings of the Armed Forces.''
	   In June, Judge Marquevich ordered the detention of Jorge Videla
on accusations the former president and military junta leader
kidnapped children whose parents disappeared during Argentina's
military dictatorship.
	   Marquevich reportedly is nearing the end of his investigation,
when a final ruling on the case is expected.
	   According to local media reports the note said: ``Judge Roberto
Marquevich: Your dishonest decision to jail our general Jorge
Rafael Videla, was done for who knows what sinister political
purposes and the lack of institutional response by (the head of the
armed forces) Martin Balza has crossed the line against the
enemy.''
	   ``For this, all the ranks of the glorious Argentine army have
decided to take justice in our own hands and will condemn you to
death from this moment forward. You will be executed in the same
way as those that you defend.''

 &UR; German foreign minister lobbies Albania for support on Kosovo
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time frame in penultimate graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Fresh from a meeting that called for
tougher measures against Kosovo's separatist guerrillas, Germany's
foreign minister on Wednesday lobbied the government in Albania for
	   support.
	   ``We are for Kosovo's autonomy and not for its independence,''
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters at the Tirana Rinas
airport where he was received by the Albanian Foreign Minister
Paskal Milo. He was echoing the common stance of the Contact Group,
	   which also includes the United States, Russia, France, Britain
and
	   Italy.
	   Kinkel and other Contact Group representatives, meeting in Bonn,
Germany, to try and stop the Kosovo fighting, called Wednesday on
governments for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to
the ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.
	   The Albanian government favors a peaceful solution of the crisis
in Kosovo, a Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are the 9-1
majority.
	   But as violence in Kosovo escalates, the Albanian government is
	   under pressure from right wing political groups in favor of
Kosovo's succession from Serbia.
	   Maps of Greater Albania _ including Kosovo _ are easily found in
bookstores. State television refers to the fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army as ``heroes.''
	   Kinkel is expected to ask the Albanian authorities for greater
efforts in preventing the use of the country as a transit point for
	   money and arms supplies for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   But that is an impossible task, even if the Albanian government
	   wants to comply. Border regions with Kosovo are hard to control,
and smuggling and other criminal activity is rife.
	   Kinkel expressed concerns about the increasing number of ethnic
	   Albanian refugees arriving to Germany as they flee the violence.
He said nearly 3,000 had come in the last two months.
	   He met late Wednesday with the Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani.
	   On Thursday he will fly to Albania's northern border and meet
with ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.

Egyptian foreign minister to visit Washington
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's foreign minister said Wednesday that
he will work to bridge differences with the United States during
his visit to Washington later this week.
	   Amr Moussa, who leaves for Washington Thursday, said his talks
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will focus on the
Middle East peace process and other international issues.
	   Egypt has repeatedly called on Washington to exert increased
pressure on Israel to be more forthcoming in peace talks.
	   The United States is pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to withdraw from 13 percent more of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu has said he would only agree to a 9 percent pullback.
	   ``The area of parity between Egyptian and U.S. positions
regarding many issues is larger than the area of disparity,''
Moussa said, without naming those issues.
	   He said that points of disagreement ``will be tackled in a way
that will enable the opening of new channels to achieve better
understanding.''
	   Moussa will visit France on July 17 after he leaves Washington.

Sale of first edition of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' sets record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS
at book auction

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' printed by England's earliest typographer sold at auction
Wednesday for 4,621,500 pounds (dlrs 7.53 million), a price which
auctioneers Christie's said was a world record.
	   ``This has become the most expensive book ever sold,'' said
Victoria Coode, spokeswoman for Christie's. Coode said that the
previous record sale price for a book was dlrs 5.3 million paid at
auction in New York in Oct. 1987 for a Gutenberg bible printed in
1455.
	   The red leather bound edition of ``Canterbury Tales,'' printed
by William Caxton in either 1476 or 1477, was one of eight rare
books offered at the auction.
	   An edition of the first book printed in English, ``Recuyell of
the Historyes of Troye'' translated from French by Caxton and
printed in either 1473 or 1474, sold for 771,500 pounds (dlrs 1.23
million.).
	   Coode said that the ``Canterbury Tales'' were sold to a London
book dealer.
	   The eight books were part of a collection, housed at Wentworth
Woodhouse in Yorkshire, northern England, started in the 15th
century by Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford.

Rioting marks Abiola's death; Abubakar dissolves cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 17 grafs to UPDATE death toll to at least 17, calm
restored to three affected cities. Picks up 17th graf previous,
`While Abiola ...' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 17 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said, adding Abubakar was on the brink of
release.
	   He made no mention of the cabinet though, he said that returning
Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Calm had been returned to all three cities by Wednesday evening.
In Lagos, office workers who had been trapped by the violence were
rushing back to their houses.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 10 people were killed in overnight demonstrations in
Lagos, said a senior police officer speaking on condition of
anonymity. At least some of the violence in Lagos was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas are from the
north. Hausas, along with the northern Fulanis, are the majority in
the military and the junta.
	   Riots were also reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos, where demonstrators
clashed with police. At least two demonstrators were killed, local
media reports said, though the circumstances were not immediately
clear. State radio said police had restored calm but a dusk-to-dawn
curfew had been imposed.
	   Protests, mostly involving students, in the southwestern
university town of Ibadan were also eventually calmed, though at
least five people were killed in the city, according to local media
reports. However, no further details were available.

Croatian President Tudjman in France for World Cup semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: repeating for all needing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman, an ardent soccer fan, met
with each member of the Croatian team Wednesday after arriving in
France to watch the Croats battle France for a berth in the World
Cup finals.
	   Tudjman, who also made the trip last Saturday to watch the
team's 3-0 victory over Germany, watched the match at the Stade de
France in Paris.
	   ``It will, without a doubt, be a great match,'' Tudjman said,
admitting the French were favored to win. ``For Croatia, it is
already a magnificent success to have found itself amongst the best
four nations in the sport.''
	   The 76-year-old leader was accompanied by other government
officials, including Premier Zlatko Matesa.
	   The winner of the match will meet four-time world champion
Brazil in Sunday's final. The loser will play the Netherlands for
third place on Saturday.
	   After arriving in France, Tudjman visited the Croatian team as
it prepared for the match.
	   ``It will be interesting to see if France can play on the same
level against Croatia as it did against other teams. And so see how
France will play with the pressure of a match in front of their own
fans and the pressure on them to win the World Cup,'' Tudjman said.
	   He said that Croatia had a ``great team and a great coach who
knows what he wants and knows the strength of the players on his
team.''

Archaeologists unearth church that may be oldest in the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A basilica unearthed in the Red Sea resort
of Aqaba may be the oldest church in Jordan _ and possibly the
oldest building in the world designed for use as a church,
archaeologists say.
	   Until the mud brick structure was discovered last month in
downtown Aqaba, near a bus station surrounded by hotels overlooking
the sea, the earliest churches in Jordan were thought to date to
the late fourth century.
	   Sawsan Fakhiri, director of the Aqaba Antiquities Department,
said Tuesday the find was very likely ``a church built in the late
third century. But we need to study it closely before we come out
with a resolute conclusion.''
	   Still, the building is significant no matter what because it
serves as a starting point for the succession of Roman, Byzantine
and Islamic civilizations along the Red Sea.
	   ``It shows the evolution of the town in terms of antiquity over
1,000 years, ending with the Islamic culture,'' said Rami Khoury, a
Jordanian writer on archaeology.
	   Older churches have been found _ at Dura Europa on the Euphrates
River in eastern Syria and along the Sea of Galilee in northern
Israel _ but they were constructed and used as houses before being
converted to churches.
	   ``If the Aqaba (building) does in fact prove to date to the late
third century, it would be not only the oldest church in Jordan,
but (the oldest) in the world designed and built as a church,''
said Thomas Parker, a history professor at North Carolina State
University.
	   He is leading the 53 Jordanian and American archaeologists and
historians excavating the site.
	   Many of the best-known Christian shrines, such as Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulcher and Bethlehem's Church of the
Nativity, were built later or underwent major reconstruction during
medieval times.
	   Experts outside Jordan welcomed the find, but asked for more
evidence to date the building.
	   ``I certainly think it is very possible,'' said Alice Christ of
the University of Kentucky. ``At that period, there should be
buildings built specifically as churches.''
	   Glen W. Bowersock at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, New Jersey, was more skeptical.
	   ``I hear nothing that would persuade me that it has to be third
century,'' he said. ``I would need to have coins that were third
century and did not run into the fourth century, or inscriptions
with a date.''
	   Fakhiri said the mud-brick building in Aqaba, 210 miles (340
kilometers) south of Amman, has the architectural characteristics
of Roman and Byzantine churches that sprang up in Jerusalem and
other parts of the Middle East in the third and fourth centuries.
	   The building, located within the walls of an ancient Roman city
called Aelana, is 28 yards (26 meters) long and 16 yards (14.5
meters) wide, with its walls, ceiling and five-aisle basilica still
intact, she said.
	   On the floor of one tiny room, diggers found 100 coins, dating
from about 280 A.D. to 360 A.D., Fakhiri said.
	   The building itself likely goes back to the late third century
because diggers also found splintered glass that looked like the
remains of oil lamps commonly used to illuminate churches in the
early Christian era, she added.
	   A few yards (meters) from the building, the archaeologists
uncovered one grave with a stone cross, Fakhiri said.
	   Fakhiri and Parker believe the building was buried by desert
sand during a 363 A.D. earthquake that is documented in Byzantine
texts.
	   ``It was not touched since and, therefore, the entire structure
is still standing close to its original height, with complete mud
brick walls'' about 13 feet (4 meters) high, Parker said.

With or without NBA players, Tomjanovich chases gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background; fixes to `Continental
Basketball Association' in fifth graf &QL; 
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Rudy Tomjanovich still remembers the hurt he felt
at being left off the 1968 Olympic team, and how badly he wanted to
win a gold medal for his country.
	   Thirty years later, as coach of the U.S. world championship
team, he's finally getting that chance. And nothing, not even the
absence of the National Basketball Association all-stars he was
supposed to be coaching, is going to spoil it.
	   ``Heck no, it's a great honor. And to me, what a challenge,''
Tomjanovich said Wednesday, a few hours before training camp
opened. ``We're not going to have the high-profile guys, but we
feel American basketball is the best in the world.''
	   Spooked by the threat of an NBA lockout-related boycott by its
latest version of the Dream Team, USA Basketball dumped its 12 NBA
all-stars six weeks before the July 29 start of the world
championships in Athens, Greece.
	   Instead of Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Gary
Payton, the United States will be represented by current college
players, Continental Basketball Association players and Americans
playing professionally overseas.
	   USA Basketball had hoped to lure some former NBA stars such as
Dominique Wilkins, but Wilkins said he didn't want to betray former
teammates or their stance in labor negotiations with the NBA.
Tomjanovich, coach of the Houston Rockets, declined comment on
anything related directly to the lockout.
	   Thirty players were invited this week's training camp at Moody
Bible Institute. One, Evan Eschmeyer of Northwestern, declined. The
roster will be pared to 12 before camp ends next Tuesday.
	   ``It would have been a lot easier if we came in here from the
beginning with the team so we could start working on our system,''
Tomjanovich said. ``Not only do we have to start teaching things,
but we've got to make evaluations.
	   ``This is the hand that we're dealt, and we've just got to make
the most of it.''
	   The biggest names at training camp are Duke's Trajan Langdon and
Mateen Cleaves, the Big Ten player of the year. Richard Hamilton,
the Big East player of the year, also made the list, as did Jimmy
King, who was part of Michigan's Fab Five and now plays in the CBA.
	   There also are 12 players who played overseas last season,
experience that Tomjanovich said will be invaluable.
	   ``(The international game) is a different game,'' he said.
``They're big, they're talented, so we've got to be a defensive
team. It's a lot more physical, so we're looking for guys who are
able to really initiate some physical contact and be able to absorb
and take some hits without getting flustered and lose their
concentration.''

Baseball record on Sept. 6, 1995, and has bolstered the mark
despite advancing age and declining offense. His critics say enough
is enough, insisting there is no reason to extend a streak that now
stands at 2,566.
	   Columnists from both The New York Times and The (Baltimore) Sun
last month cited Ripken's shrinking power numbers as an indication
that the Baltimore Orioles' third baseman was swinging a tired bat
and hurting the team by extending the streak.
	   But Ripken insists he's fine and has no intention of asking for
a day off.
	   ``I'm considered the everyday baseball player, the regular third
baseman for the Orioles,'' Ripken said during the All-Star break.
``I come to the ballpark with the simple approach that as long as
the manager thinks I can be one of the guys that can help us win,
I'll play.''
	   He helped the American League on Tuesday night. He made his 15th
straight start in an All-Star game, going 1-for-4 with two RBIs in
a 13-8 victory over the National League.
	   Ripken, who turns 38 next month, is hitting .258 with seven
homers and 36 RBIs _ numbers that project to well below his yearly
average. But he's made only three errors and certainly is more of a
commodity than backup Jeff Reboulet.
	   ``Whatever Cal has on any given day is good enough for me,''
Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``I have a tough enough time
getting guys to play two weeks in a row, let alone every game.''
	   Miller isn't the only manager with that point of view.
	   ``Cal Ripken is a great player and still a very productive
player,'' said Jim Leyland, manager of the World Series champion
Florida Marlins. ``If Cal Ripken is healthy, he's like any other
great player _ you want him in the lineup. I'll never believe that
Cal Ripken is hurting his team by playing.''
	   Ripken's backers insist that his performance and persistence
over 17 seasons give him the right to extend the streak. Besides,
in an era where many stars bounce from one team to another and miss
games because of minor injuries, seeing Ripken in the Orioles'
starting lineup each day is a reassuring sight.
	   ``The one thing that seems right about baseball is Cal playing
every day,'' Baltimore center fielder Brady Anderson said.
	   And it's not as if one day off is going to completely revitalize
Ripken's bat.
	   ``Do you mean to tell me that a guy who's played that many games
is supposed to rested after taking off one day?'' Leyland said.
``If he's slowed up, isn't feeling good and needs to take off three
or four days at a time, that's one thing. But that's obviously not
the case.''
	   So how will the streak end? Gehrig was batting .143 for the New
York Yankees when he asked the manager to remove him from the
lineup on May 2, 1939. It turned out Gehrig was already
experiencing the effects of a deadly disease, and the man called
the Iron Horse never played another major league game.
	   Ripken figures it's only a matter of time before his own streak
comes to an appropriate conclusion.
	   ``The situation will present itself, which will make sense, and
it will happen,'' he said. ``I can't tell you how.''

	   After two games in which its strikers had failed to score, the
French forwards put together a sweetly-constructed move in the
fourth minute to open up the Croatian defense at the Stade de
France.
	   Youri Djorkaeff fed Stephane Guivarc'h down the right and the
striker neatly back-heeled the ball to Zidane on the edge of the
area but the midfielder's first-time shot was straight at 'keeper
Drazen Ladic.
	   Five minutes later the Juventus star climbed above two Croatian
defenders to head a cross from Emmanuel Petit over the bar.
	   With the French creating the better openings, Zidane and Didier
Deschamps both moved into long range shooting positions but fired
into the crowd instead of the net.
	   Zidane tried his luck from 25 meters (yards) again in the 20th
minute but Ladic dived low to his left to take the ball confidently
at the foot of the post.
	   A minute later the Croatian 'keeper had to make a far more
difficult save, plunging quickly to his right to block a powerfully
struck 30-meter free from Guivarc'h.
	   The first danger to the French defense came in the 34th minute
when Aljosa Asanovic collected a short pass forward, turned a
defender and fired wide of the near post from 15 meters.
	   Five minutes before halftime Zidine let fly with a powerful
30-meter volley which was curling wide when the diving Ladic dived
to turn it behind for a corner.
	   For a spell before half time, the French seemed to lose their
early dominance but the two goals early in the second half sparked
them back into life.
	   Just after Thuram's equalizer, Croat defender Igor Stimac
blocked a firm, goalbound volley from Zidane and recovered to stop
the follow up shot from Djorkaeff.
	   Then substitute Thierry Henry, who replaced ankle injury victim
Christian Karembeu in the first half, broke away down the right
after the French cleared a Croatian attack. The Monaco forward cut
inside to fire a low shot that Ladic gathered at the second
attempt.
	   Then Thuram came up with his spectacular second to send the
French fans wild and dreaming of a final with Brazil.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Thierry Henry, 31st),
Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Stephane
Guivarc'h (David Trezeguet, 69th, Youri Djorkaeff (Frank Leboeuf
76th).
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Slaven Bilic, Igor Stimac, Dario Simic;
Mario Stanic (Robert Prosinecki, 89th), Zvonimir Soldo, Zvonimir
Boban (Silvio Maric, 65th), Aljosa Asanovic, Robert Jarni; Davor
Suker, Goran Vlaovic.
	   Referee _ Jose Manuel Garcia, Spain.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's Parliament will vote Friday
on allowing the opposition People's National Congress to regain its
seats, one month after the party's lawmakers were barred because of
high absenteeism.
	   The party had boycotted Parliament because it claimed President
Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party rigged the Dec. 15
elections. Jagan's party won 36 of the body's 65 seats, while the
People's National Congress garnered 25.
	   The People's Progressive Party invoked a rule June 11 barring
the party's lawmakers because they had missed six consecutive
sessions in eight weeks without the permission of the Paliament's
speaker.
	   Caribbean leaders persuaded National Congress leader Desmond
Hoyte to return to Parliament during a Caribbean Community summit
in St. Lucia last week. The agreement also ended two weeks of riots
and firebombings.
	   People's National Congress lawmakers said they would be ready to
return to Parliament on July 15. Legislative leaders said they had
put the bill on Friday's agenda.
	   Leaders of smaller parties Alliance for Guyana and The United
Force said Wednesday they would support the bill.

Kournikova say she's recovered from thumb injury
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMY WESTFELDT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ Anna Kournikova's thumb is feeling
better and she feels ready to start climbing up the tennis ladder
to No. 1.
	   ``I really don't think anything separates me right now,'' from
No. 1, the 17-year-old Russian said in a conference call Wednesday.
``I think I've beaten every person in the top 10, including Steffi
Graf. It's just a matter of time.''
	   Kournikova and Graf are both playing at the A and P Classic,
beginning July 13 in Mahwah. Kournikova was a finalist there last
year, losing in three sets to Chanda Rubin. Graf has won the event
five times.
	   Kournikova likes her chances, having beaten Graf in the
quarterfinals of Eastbourne, Wimbledon's warmup tournament.
	   Of Graf, who is attempting a comeback after reconstructive knee
surgery last year, Kournikova said, ``She's a great athlete. ...
But I think it'll be really difficult for her to be coming back.''
	   Kournikova said she is recovered after injuring ligaments in her
thumb when she fell on her hand during the match with Graf. The
injury forced Kournikova, the 12th seed at Wimbledon, to withdraw
from the tournament.
	   She began playing a few days ago, and ``it feels perfect,'' she
said. ``Right now, I don't feel any pain, and hopefully it's going
to stay that way.''
	   She kept her thumb in a splint and iced it frequently, but
mostly ``what my thumb needed was rest,'' she said.
	   Mirjana Lucic and Amanda Coetzer are among the other featured
players at next week's Classic, which will announce its draw
Thursday.
	   Kournikova, asked about her friendship with Sergei Federov of
the Detroit Red Wings, said he may not attend the U.S. Open this
year. Instead, she said, she's invited Scotty Bowman, coach of the
Stanley Cup champions.
	   ``I'm a fan of the Red Wings,'' she said, adding that several
other players might be her guests.
	   Bowman's invitation came as news to the Red Wings.
	   ``At this point, he hasn't been invited,'' Red Wings spokesman
John Hahn said. ``He hasn't spoken to Anna.''
	   But Hahn said Bowman, an acquaintance of Kournikova, might enjoy
watching her play.
	   ``Scotty is a very big sports fan,'' Hahn said. ``I know he is
interested in tennis.''

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Two goals by defender Lilian Thuram
put France into the World Cup final for the first time Wednesday
after a 2-1 victory over outsider Croatia set up a showdown with
defending titlist Brazil.
	   Davor Suker fired the Croatians ahead in the opening minute of
the second half but Thuram leveled a minute later before scoring
the winner with a 25 meter (yard) shot 20 minutes from the end.
	   The result means that the host, which was knocked out at the
semifinal stage in 1958, '82 and '86, meets the four-time titlist
at the same Stade de France stadium on Sunday.
	   The Croats went ahead only 26 seconds into the second half when
Suker collected a carefully-measured pass from the left from Aljosa
Asanovic.
	   With Thuram playing him onside, the Real Madrid striker broke
clear of Bixente Lizarazu and slid the ball under the body of
'keeper Fabien Barthez from 12 meters.
	   A minute later, Thuram made up for his mistake in the best way
possible.
	   The defender won the ball back from Zvonimir Boban just outside
the Croatian area, swapped passes with Youri Djorkaeff and ran
clear to side-foot the ball home from almost on the penalty spot.
	   Thuram hit his second in the 70th minute and created it himself.
	   After his pass into the danger area had gone astray, the
fullback won the ball back from Robert Jarni and curled a low
left-foot shot from 25 meters between 'keeper Drazen Ladic and the
far post.
	   Four minutes later French defender Laurent Blanc was expelled
for pushing Slaven Bilic in the face after the Croatian defender
had tugged his shirt in the buildup to a free kick.
	   Blanc, scorer of the first ever World Cup extra time ``Golden
Goal'' in the 1-0 victory over Paraguay, will miss the final
against Brazil.
	   Croatia almost snatched an equalizer when Goran Vlaovic came up
with a shot in the fourth minute of injury time but 'keeper Barthez
acrobatically tipped over the bar with French fans' hearts in their
mouths.
	   After two games in which its strikers had failed to score, the
French forwards put together a sweetly-constructed move in the
fourth minute to open up the Croatian defense at the Stade de
France.
	   Youri Djorkaeff fed Stephane Guivarc'h down the right and the
striker neatly back-heeled the ball to Zidane on the edge of the
area but the midfielder's first-time shot was straight at 'keeper
Drazen Ladic.
	   Five minutes later the Juventus star climbed above two Croatian
defenders to head a cross from Emmanuel Petit over the bar.
	   With the French creating the better openings, Zidane and Didier
Deschamps both moved into long range shooting positions but fired
into the crowd instead of the net.
	   Zidane tried his luck from 25 meters (yards) again in the 20th
minute but Ladic dived low to his left to take the ball confidently
at the foot of the post.
	   A minute later the Croatian 'keeper had to make a far more
difficult save, plunging quickly to his right to block a powerfully
struck 30-meter free from Guivarc'h.
	   The first danger to the French defense came in the 34th minute
when Aljosa Asanovic collected a short pass forward, turned a
defender and fired wide of the near post from 15 meters.
	   Five minutes before halftime Zidine let fly with a powerful
30-meter volley which was curling wide when the diving Ladic dived
to turn it behind for a corner.
	   For a spell before half time, the French seemed to lose their
early dominance but the two goals early in the second half sparked
them back into life.
	   Just after Thuram's equalizer, Croat defender Igor Stimac
blocked a firm, goalbound volley from Zidane and recovered to stop
the follow up shot from Djorkaeff.
	   Then substitute Thierry Henry, who replaced ankle injury victim
Christian Karembeu in the first half, broke away down the right
after the French cleared a Croatian attack. The Monaco forward cut
inside to fire a low shot that Ladic gathered at the second
attempt.
	   Then Thuram came up with his spectacular second to send the
French fans wild and dreaming of a final with Brazil.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Thierry Henry, 31st),
Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Stephane
Guivarc'h (David Trezeguet, 69th, Youri Djorkaeff (Frank Leboeuf

Canada urged to withdraw from nuclear deal with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The nuclear rivalry between India and Pakistan
should prompt Canada to back away from a proposed sale of nuclear
technology to Turkey, an opposition leader said Wednesday.
	   Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party,
said a bid by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to sell a pair of
Candu reactors to Turkey should be scrapped.
	   She noted that Canada had indirectly contributed to a nuclear
race in the Asia subcontinent through past sales of nuclear
technology to India and Pakistan.
	   ``We hardly need a more instructive example of how the sale of
civilian nuclear technology can be perverted,'' she told a news
conference.
	   ``The Middle East is already fraught with tension and distrust.
Israel is an undeclared nuclear state, Iran is developing a
civilian nuclear industry, and Iraq's ambitions have been well
documented.''
	   She said Turkish assurances to use nuclear technology only for
civilian purposes should be ``treated with guarded skepticism.''
	   India, which has not signed the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, used Canadian technology to build a bomb it detonated in
1974. Canada has refused to maintain the technology in India ever
since.
	   Larry Shewchuk of Atomic Energy of Canada said Turkey is a
signatory to the treaty _ a condition for the sale _ and that
should put any fears to rest.
	   ``Nuclear non-proliferation treaties work, they do what they
were designed to do _ to safeguard and to make sure that reactors
are designed to be used to make electricity,'' he said.
	   Argentina, South Korea, China and Romania have purchased Candu
technology since the treaty was signed and there have been no
problems, Shewchuk said.
	   In addition to political instability, geological turbulence in
Turkey is also cause for concern, according to McDonough.
	   An earthquake last month hit a region less than 200 kilometers
(120 miles) from the proposed site for the two Candu reactors.
	   Shewchuk said studies have shown the area is safe to build
nuclear generating stations.
	   Two other consortiums, from Europe and the United States, also
are vying for Turkish reactor deal. A decision is expected later
this year.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 19 people are believed to
have been killed.
	   Uncertainty was added to turmoil Wednesday afternoon when
Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a mix of civilian
and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar left the
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling junta,
intact.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said, adding Abubakar was on the brink of
release.
	   He made no mention of the cabinet though, he said that returning
Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Meanwhile, supporters of Moshood Abiola were in the streets of
Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, setting alight piles of tires, pelting
cars with stones and attacking the homes of junta officials.
	   Calm had been returned to all three cities by Wednesday evening.
In Lagos, office workers who had been trapped by the violence were
rushing back to their houses.
	   Abiola _ who apparently won annulled 1993 presidential elections
and was imprisoned in 1994 _ died Tuesday after suddenly falling
ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats. He was 60.
	   He was enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, where a
growing number of people are blaming the military for his death.
	   By mid-afternoon Wednesday, violence in Lagos appeared to be
waning, with police clearing away burned cars and other wreckage
and fanning out in ever-greater numbers
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Marwa closed the state's schools through Friday.
	   Police in several parts of central Lagos used tear gas to try to
break up the protests.
	   At least 12 people were killed in demonstrations that began
overnight in this sprawling commercial capital, said police
officials speaking on condition of anonymity. At least some of the
violence in Lagos was ethnic-based, with Yorubas from Nigeria's
southwest attacking Hausas are from the north. Hausas, along with
the northern Fulanis, are the majority in the military and the
junta.

World Cup: France wins 2-1 to meet Brazil in final

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Two goals by defender Lilian Thuram
put France into the World Cup final for the first time Wednesday
after a 2-1 victory over outsider Croatia set up a showdown with
defending titlist Brazil.
	   Davor Suker fired the Croatians ahead in the opening minute of
the second half but Thuram leveled a minute later before scoring
the winner with a 25 meter (yard) shot 20 minutes from the end.
	   The result means that the host, which was knocked out at the
semifinal stage in 1958, '82 and '86, meets the four-time titlist
at the same Stade de France stadium on Sunday. Wednesday's victory
sparked celebrations all over France after the nation became the
first host in 20 years to reach the final.
	   ``It is truly the most beautiful day in the history of French
sport,'' said French President Jacques Chirac, who was in the crowd
as well as Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman.
	   ``We played our hearts out and that made the difference,'' said
French coach Aime Jacquet, who paid tribute to Thuram.
	   ``It is a worthy reward after everything he has been doing
throughout this World Cup,'' said Jacquet.
	   The Croats went ahead only 26 seconds into the second half when
Suker collected a carefully-measured pass from the left from Aljosa
Asanovic.
	   With Thuram playing him onside, the Real Madrid striker broke
clear of Bixente Lizarazu and slid the ball under the body of
'keeper Fabien Barthez from 12 meters.
	   A minute later, Thuram made up for his mistake in the best way
possible.
	   The defender won the ball back from Zvonimir Boban just outside
the Croatian area, swapped passes with Youri Djorkaeff and ran
clear to side-foot the ball home from almost on the penalty spot.
	   Thuram hit his second in the 70th minute and created it himself.
	   After his pass into the danger area had gone astray, the
fullback won the ball back from Robert Jarni and curled a low
left-foot shot from 25 meters between 'keeper Drazen Ladic and the
far post.
	   Four minutes later French defender Laurent Blanc was expelled
for pushing Slaven Bilic in the face after the Croatian defender
had tugged his shirt in the buildup to a free kick.
	   Blanc, scorer of the first ever World Cup extra time ``Golden
Goal'' in the 1-0 victory over Paraguay, will miss the final
against Brazil.
	   ``It will make it real tough for us,'' said Jacquet.
	   Croatia almost snatched an equalizer when Goran Vlaovic came up
with a shot in the fourth minute of injury time but 'keeper Barthez
acrobatically tipped over the bar with French fans' hearts in their
mouths.
	   After two games in which its strikers had failed to score, the

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A bus screeches around the corner,
almost crashing into a middle-aged man in dark glasses yelling
orders to a SWAT team hidden behind an army tent.
	   Within seconds, the team has boarded the bus, disarmed the
``terrorists,'' saved the ``hostages'' and thrown in a smoke bomb
for good measure.
	   ``An environmentally friendly smoke bomb,'' notes the man in
glasses, coughing his way out of smoke range.
	   In real life, the hostages, terrorists and SWAT team are all
employees of the Silver Shadow company _ one of dozens of private
firms selling Israel's much-vaunted security expertise worldwide.
(If this had been an actual terrorist encounter _ rather than a
demonstration for the media _ the ringleader in the dark shades
would not have been in plain view.)
	   If a military or paramilitary unit in South America wants to
prepare itself for a hostage situation, a Silver Shadow team flies
in to train them. If a group in central Africa or central Asia
wants to learn how to break up a prison riot, the Israelis will be
there too.
	   Silver Shadow is one of 120 firms displaying their wares this
week at a defense and security exhibition in Tel Aviv. Demand for
Israeli know-how is high _ some 1,500 visitors and buyers from more
than 30 countries are expected to attend.
	   The Israeli exhibitors are showing everything from personal
telephone scramblers to armor-piercing shells, bomb-sniffing robots
and mini-submarines.
	   While the Silver Shadow teams headed off to lunch, Amos Golan
lowered his shades and explained how he and his partner, Asaf
Nadel, created the company three years ago to sell what they call
``a security concept.''
	   Before founding the company, Golan worked for an anti-terrorist
army unit in the West Bank. Nadel worked for the Shin Bet, Israel's
renowned domestic security agency. Most, if not all, of Silver
Shadow's employees come straight from military combat units.
	   ``We will train any group how to combat terror. We have
experience, we have the knowledge, we have the newest methods, and
we care,'' Golan said as he unloaded a dozen mini-Uzis from the
back of his beat-up Chevrolet.
	   Israel's approximately 600 private security companies export
about dlrs 500 million of goods yearly, exhibition organizer Zeev
Omer said. That is about one-fourth of the total annual exports of
the country's three top defense contractors.
	   Private Israeli security firms must get Defense Ministry
approval to sell weapons and training overseas. The ministry would
not respond to queries about its criteria for approving projects.
	   In any case, a global market and modern communications make it
easy for firms to get around any restrictions. While private
security firms won't reveal their client lists, some of their more
questionable activities have come to light in recent years.
	   Yair Klein, a lieutenant colonel in the army reserves who ran a
private security firm, was convicted by an Israeli court in 1991 of
illegally exporting military arms and information. The court did
not elaborate on the charges, but Colombian officials accused him
of arming and training drug traffickers. He denied all the charges.
	   Mike Harari, a former operative for Israel's Mossad spy agency,
was accused of providing bugging devices and weapons systems to
former Panamanian strongman Manual Noriega.
	   Other firms are suspected of training anti-government soldiers
in Zaire and Basque fighters in southern Spain.
	   ``When I was in the army, I fought to make sure the Palestinians
did not get their state,'' said one Silver Shadow employee,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But that was because that was
my job, not because I hate the Palestinians, or can't understand
their cause.
	   ``If people in Spain, or Africa or where have you want to fight
against the government ... and they are willing to pay, then those
people are freedom fighters in my eyes and I will do everything to
help them.''

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Wednesday announced a new 10 million real (dlrs 8.7 million)
program to protect the Amazon from forest fires like the ones that
ravaged the region earlier this year.
	   Cardoso said the fires, which in February and March claimed as
much as 15 percent of the remote Amazon state of Roraima, forced
the government to prepare ``coordinated action that would allow
faster responses.''
	   The fires in Roraima burned out of control for nearly two months
before rains quenched them.
	   The new program focuses on preventative measures and better
enforcement of laws against unauthorized burning _ the most common
method of clearing land for agriculture in the Amazon. The program
also seeks to better coordinate fire fighting efforts.
	   Farmers in the region will also be educated in fire-prevention
and fire-control procedures.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The continuing drop in world oil prices
forced Mexico to announce budget cuts this year totaling 5.5
billion pesos (dlrs 618 million), the third cut this year, the
Treasury department said Wednesday.
	   The budget for the state monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos will be
cut 2.5 billion pesos (dlrs 280.9 million) with the remaining 3.0
billion pesos (dlrs 337 million) coming from other programs, said
Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria.
	   Lower oil prices will leave the 1998 federal budget with a
revenue shortfall of 9.8 billion pesos (dlrs 1.01 billion) Gurria
told a news conference.
	   Gurria said the rest of the shortfall would be covered from
special trusts and funds, additional privatization revenues and tax
revenues.
	   The three rounds of budget cuts total 36.247 billion pesos (dlrs
4 billion), or 0.96 percent of the gross domestic product, Gurria
said.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Penguins, sea gulls, albatrosses,
and other birds were among 214 animals found dead along an
Argentine coast, ecologists said Wednesday.
	   The cause of the deaths is, which occurred over the weekend in
Miramar, 265 miles (420 kms) southeast of Buenos Aires, is still
under investigation, authorities said.
	   Another ecologist, Gil Conners, told Perfil he believed
pesticides dumped in the ocean caused the deaths. He said the
levels were low enough not to affect most aquatic life, but would
be devastating to birds who he said have lower immune systems.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday that
an arms shipment seized by Argentine officials was legally
purchased and should be sent on to Peru.
	   The arms, which were en route to Peru from South Africa, were
temporarily held up at Argentina's Ezeiza International airport by
air force police late Tuesday.
	   Argentine authorities said the shipment's paperwork was in
order, but that they had decided to retain the arms because of
Peru's recent wars with Ecuador, its northern neighbor.
	   Ecuador and Peru have fought three wars in the past 57 years,
including one in early 1995. Argentina is a guarantor of a 1942
agreement that demarcated the border between the countries.
	   Peru's government has charged that Argentine officials
clandestinely sold arms to Ecuador during the 1995 war with Peru,
straining its relations with Argentina.

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Who needs strikers?
	   Defender Lilian Thuram fired France into the World Cup final for
the first time in its history Wednesday with two goals in a
come-from-behind 2-1 win over outsider Croatia.
	   In a second half for the history books, France ended its World
Cup semifinal jinx on its fourth attempt and became the first host
nation in 20 years to reach the final where it faces defending
titlist Brazil on Sunday.
	   French president Jacques Chirac cheered with hands aloft while
Croatia's counterpart Franjo Tudjman applauded his nation's
fairy-tale run that stopped one game short of the unbelievable.
	   ``It is truly the most beautiful day in the history of French
sport,'' Chirac said.
	   The defense has taken France to the final. Centerback Laurent
Blanc fired the quarterfinal winner in extra time against Paraguay
and rightback Thuram was the scoring star here after his forwards
again failed to find the net.
	   On top of that, Blanc, Thuram and the others at the back have
defended superbly too. Pity Blanc will miss the final after being
expelled here for pushing Croat defender Slaven Bilic in the face.
	   ``We played our hearts out and that made the difference,'' said
French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   Brazil beat the Netherlands in a penalty shootout Tuesday and
Jacquet can't wait for the final.
	   ``It will be a great night of soccer,'' said Jacquet.
	   Croatia, in its first World Cup as a seven-year-old nation,
almost scored the biggest upset of all, even taking the lead before
finally falling to French flair.
	   ``We needed all the push and energy we could get,'' said
Jacquet.
	   The game came alive with two lightning-quick strikes early in
the second half.
	   First Croatia stunned the 80,000 crowd at the Stade de France in
the 26th second of the half when Aljosa Asanovic split the French
defense and Davor Suker scored his fifth World Cup goal, slipping
the ball under Barthez.
	   The Croats didn't get time to enjoy it.
	   One minute later, Thuram stole the ball from captain Zvonimir
Boban near the Croat penalty area and sent a return pass that the
defender slotted past goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   In the 70th minute, Thuram was even bolder, surging up the left
and setting up a one-two with Thierry Henry, that seemed to go
straight to Robert Jarni. But Thuram was not to be denied, winning
back the ball and then unleashing a curling 20-meter shot that went
wide of Ladic and released a whole nation.
	   ``It is a worthy reward after everything he has been doing
throughout this World Cup,'' said Jacquet.
	   France had already been a losing semifinalist in 1958, 1982 and
1986 but finally earned soccer's biggest stage. It will be the
first time the defending champion will meet the host nation in a
final.
	   Those opening two minutes of the second half packed more action
than the whole first 45 minutes and it was the wakeup call France
needed.
	   In the tense minutes after France's second goal, defender
Laurent Blanc tugged at Slaven Bilic's shirt and slammed the palm
of his hand in his face. Referee Jose Manuel Garcia sent the
standout defender off and he will miss the final.
	   ``It will make it real tough for us,'' said Jacquet.
	   Down to 10 men, France went into a defensive shell, beefed up
the last line with Frank Leboeuf. Suker and Goran Vlaovic came
close three times in the last minutes but failed to break France's
embattled defense.
	   France started out as usual, attacking on both flanks and
playmaker Zinedine Zidane could hardly put a foot wrong in
midfield. As usual, everything unraveled though when that final
shot had to come.
	   ``Zizou'' was in the thick of things early on, heading and
shooting from long range, trying to answer critics that the team
wanted to run the ball into the net too much during the World Cup.
	   Deschamps tried the same and Stephane Guivarc'h took a 25 meter
freekick that took a good save from Ladic.
	   Croatia's defense remained undaunted even when France tried the
intricate skills, smothering a chance from Djorkaeff in the center.
	   Slowly Zidane started to fade and Croatian confidence rose.
Stanic used the space on the right and Suker and Vlaovic were
always on the lookout. Happy to lay back early on, Croatia put the
French midfield to sleep and took over. The negative tactics
quickly turned into dangerous counters.
	   In the 35th minute, Asanovic found some space in the penalty
area, swiped a ball out of reach of a defender and his right-foot
shot came close to target. Three minutes later, Mario Stanic
crossed from the right and defender Bilic half-volleyed it over.
	   Again it showed the lightening transition the Croats are capable
of.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Christian Karembeu (Thierry Henry, 31st),
Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Emmanuel Petit; Stephane
Guivarc'h (David Trezeguet, 69th, Youri Djorkaeff (Frank Leboeuf
76th).
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic; Slaven Bilic, Igor Stimac, Dario Simic;
Mario Stanic (Robert Prosinecki, 89th), Zvonimir Soldo, Zvonimir
Boban (Silvio Maric, 65th), Aljosa Asanovic, Robert Jarni; Davor
Suker, Goran Vlaovic.
	   Referee _ Jose Manuel Garcia, Spain.

End of the road: Nicklaus to miss a major
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ From Hogan and Palmer, through Watson
and Miller and into the era of Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus had a
golf game that endured for nearly a half century.
	   But 41 years after he played the 1957 U.S. Open as a chubby
17-year-old amateur, Nicklaus decided Wednesday that the next major
championship will have to go on without him.
	   Nicklaus said he will not play in the British Open next week,
ending a streak of 154 consecutive majors for which he was
eligible, and 146 straight from his first year as a pro at the 1962
Masters.
	   ``I wanted to end the streak on my own terms,'' Nicklaus said.
	   Reaction at the TPC of Michigan, where Nicklaus was preparing
for the Senior Players Championship that starts Thursday, was
stunned disbelief.
	   ``I think he can still win the British Open, honest to God, I
do,'' said South African Simon Hobday. ``He gets his dander up, you
know he can still do it.''
	   Nicklaus said he planned to end the streak in April at his 40th
consecutive Masters, where he cried when Augusta National honored
with a plaque as its most decorated champion.
	   But Nicklaus, as only he can do, left the gallery breathless
once again with another Sunday charge, getting within two strokes
of the lead before finishing tied for sixth.
	   He then accepted a special exemption to play in his 42nd
consecutive U.S. Open, where he finished tied for 43rd. Only six
players who made the cut at The Olympic Club were even born when
Nicklaus played his first U.S. Open.
	   But nagged by an ailing hip, which flared up the day after the
Open, Nicklaus felt it was time to walk away.
	   ``After 42 years of playing major championship golf, I feel that
my ability to compete at the highest level on a continuous basis is
marginal at best,'' Nicklaus said. ``I feel this is the time to end
my streak of consecutive majors.''
	   Nicklaus threatened before to end the streak. At the 1995
British Open at St. Andrews, he said he got emotional after the
72nd hole, realizing it was his last Open.
	   But the streak went on, starting with Eisenhower and ending with
Clinton.
	   Nicklaus always seemed find more magic in his game. A year later
at Royal Lytham and St. Annes, he opened the British Open with
rounds of 69-66 and was one stroke off the lead before he faded on
the weekend.
	   ``On the one hand, it was a great streak, probably never to be
duplicated,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``On the
other hand, I think there is a lot of years of quality competitive
golf left in Jack Nicklaus for all of us to enjoy, and I wish him
well as he chooses how he wants to construct that.''
	   Nicklaus' performance in the four majors set a standard for
years to come.
	   As a 20-year-old amateur at the U.S. Open in 1960, he went
head-to-head with Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan, finishing second.
And at 58, having won 18 professional majors, he challenged Fred
Couples, David Duval and winner Mark O'Meara at the Masters.
	   He endured the meteoric rise of Johnny Miller in the 1970s,
staged unforgettable showdowns with Tom Watson and doled out
heartache to Greg Norman by winning the 1986 Masters, his last PGA
Tour victory, at age 46.
	   ``When I got to the mountaintop, I kind of looked at the scenery
and said, `Now what?''' Miller once said of a career that brought
him 24 victories and two majors.
	   ``When Jack got there, he said, `Where's the next mountain?'''
	   Nicklaus is one of only four players to win the career Grand
Slam, but only he has won all four majors more than once:
	   _a record six Masters, 23 years behind the first and the last.
	   _four U.S. Opens, sharing the record with Ben Hogan, Bobby Jones
and Willie Anderson.
	   _three British Opens, along with a record seven runner-up
finishes.
	   _five PGA championships; only Walter Hagen, who played in the
match-play era, won that many.
	   ``I know Jack is smart enough to know when it is time,'' said
Larry Nelson, winner of two PGA Championship titles and the 1983
U.S. Open. ``I also respect his opinion enough to know he figures
it's probably best for him and for the game.''
	   The longest streak of majors now belongs to 40-year-old Nick
Faldo, who has played in 44 straight dating to the 1987 British
Open. But Faldo injured his elbow and withdrew Wednesday from the
Loch Lomond tournament in Scotland, and could miss the British Open
next week.
	   Even if he plays, Faldo would have to make every major through
the PGA Championship in 2023 _ when he's 66 _ to match Nicklaus'
streak. Tiger Woods, may have the best chance at approaching the
streak.
	   He would have to play every major for the next 35 years.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French fans poured out of cafes and bars, screaming
with triumph and sheer delight Wednesday after their beloved
``Blues'' made history by reaching the World Cup final with a 2-1
victory over Croatia.
	   ``It's a complete euphoria taking over France,'' yelled
Geraldine Lessieux, 20, as she and hundreds of others ran into a
small bar-lined street in Paris' Left Bank. ``Each time France wins
it's like a shot from a cannon.''
	   ``And I don't even like soccer that much.''
	   France may not have the most diehard soccer fans in the world,
but with the amazing success of its team, it has definitely caught
World Cup fever. On Sunday, it will play in the final for the first
time ever against defending champion Brazil.
	   ``We're going to the final!'' shouted hordes of fans pouring out
of the stadium at Saint-Denis, a northern suburb, their faces
smeared with paint.
	   But first, they said they were headed for a night of partying.
	   ``I'm going to the Champs-Elysees,'' shouted Thierry Menetrier,
his face in red, white and blue of the French flag. ``We're gonna
party all night!''
	   The famous boulevard was already clogged with revelers minutes
after the victory.
	   On the field, President Jacques Chirac raised his arms and
cheered delightedly. ``This is truly the most beautiful day in
French sports _ France in the final!'' he said.
	   For France, the country that invented the World Cup, it was an
exquisite moment of soccer history.

Four seeds go down in second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Second-seeded Mark Woodforde
dropped a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 match to Belgium's Laurence Tielman on
Wednesday, one of four defeats by seeded players in the second
round of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.
	   Also falling were No. 3 Jeff Tarango, who lost to Justin
Gimbelstob 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4); No. 6 Scott Draper, defeated 7-5,
6-4 by Leander Paes of India; and No. 8 Grant Stafford, who fell to
Mark Knowles 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
	   All of Tieleman's 14 career ATP victories have come on grass.
	   ``One month out of the year you play on grass and I look forward
to that month,'' Tieleman, 25, said. ``It's not that I practice on
it any more than anyone else, it's just my game is well-suited for
it.
	   Woodforde is perhaps the biggest name in this tournament because
of his five Wimbledon doubles titles.
	   ``His serve was getting him a lot of free points,'' Woodforde
said. ``I know I can play better than that.''
	   Tieleman said he grew more confident as the match went on.
	   ``The first set I tried to do too much,'' he said. ``Then I
realized I didn't need to do that much.''
	   Knowles is the lowest ranked player remaining in the tournament
at No. 744, and had to win a qualifier to get in.
	   Gimbelstob's victory was a big one because he missed more than
two months of play earlier this year due to back problems and has
been struggling to regain his game.
	   ``I've played good, but I've lost a lot of close ones,'' said
Gimelstob, explaining why he showed so much emotion after his win.
	   Paes has reached the semifinals here each of the last two years.
	   Also in second-round action, defending champion Sargis Sargsian,
seeded fourth, had his match with Rainier Schuttler suspended due
to rain prior to the third set, and Neville Godwin knocked off
Sabastien Lareau 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
	   The rest of the day's matches, including the featured match
between Australian 17-year-old Lleyton Hewitt and top-seeded
countryman Jason Stoltenberg, were postponed due to rain.

Sale of first edition of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' sets record
</HEADLINE>
at book auction
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, prices for other books in auction

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales,'' printed by England's earliest typographer, sold at auction
Wednesday at a price which auctioneers Christie's said was a world
record.
	   The red leather-bound edition, printed by William Caxton in
either 1476 or 1477, sold for 4,621,500 pounds (dlrs 7.53 million).
	   ``This has become the most expensive book ever sold,'' said
Victoria Coode, spokeswoman for Christie's. Coode said that the
previous highest auction price for a book was dlrs 5.3 million paid
at auction in New York in Oct. 1987 for a Gutenberg bible printed
in 1455.
	   The work was one of eight rare books offered at the auction, and
was bought by London book dealer Maggs Brothers.
	   The 17,000 line tale, a classic of English literature, tells the
story of a group of pilgrims traveling from London to Canterbury
Cathedral to visit St. Thomas a Beckett's shrine.
	   An edition of the first book printed in English, ``Recuyell of
the Historyes of Troye'' translated from French by Caxton and
printed in either 1473 or 1474, sold at the auction for 771,500
pounds (dlrs 1.23 million).
	   Caxton's 1481 ``The Myrrour of the Worlde,'' the first
illustrated book in English, and also the first scientific
publication in the language, sold to a U.S. dealer for 529,500
pounds (dlrs 845,000). Among its pictures are the first two printed
maps of England.
	   The books were part of a collection owned by Olive, Countess
Fitzwilliam, and housed at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire,
northern England. The collection was started in the 15th century by
Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford.
	   Other valuable family possessions were also in the auction,
including a painting by George Stubbs, ``Bay Malton with John
Singleton Up,'' which sold for 3,026,500 pounds (dlrs 4.84
million). The painting is one of only three equestrian portraits of
a horse at full gallop by Stubbs, a master of equestrian painting.
	   A Van Dyck portrait of ``Lady Lucy Percy, Countess of
Carlisle,'' was withdrawn from sale after a request from London's
Tate Gallery to negotiate privately for the picture.
	   Felix de Marez Oyens, director of Christie's international book
department, said he was surprised at the price fetched by
``Canterbury Tales.'' The book was once bought for 6 pounds (dlrs
10) at a Christie's sale in 1776. Christie's had estimated its sale
price between 500,000 pounds (dlrs 800,000) and 700,000 pounds
(dlrs 1.12 million).
	   ``It's a large price but well deserved because the book is
extremely rare,'' said de Marex Oyens of Wednesday's sale. ``It is
the greatest piece of Middle English poetry printed by England's
first printer, and perhaps the finest copy of the nine that still
exist.''
	   ``A Book of Hawking, Hunting and Heraldry,'' printed by Wynkyn
de Worde was bought by a London book dealer for 106,000 pounds
(dlrs 169,000).
	   ``Proprytees and Medicynes for Hors,'' which explained the
treatment of horses, was sold for 194,000 pounds (dlrs 310,000) to
a New York dealer.
	   ``York Manuale,'' one of earliest books printed for church
services by de Worde in 1509 for the northern English diocese, sold
to the same dealer for 67,500 pounds (dlrs 110,000).
	   Caxton's ``Le Doctrinal de Sapience,'' and ``De Sencetute,''
printed in 1489 and 1481, both sold for 144,500 pounds (dlrs
237,000).

US archaeologist claims historic find of 17th-century Dutch fort

<TEXT>
	   BRANFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ An archaeologist from Wesleyan
University and his graduate students have unearthed what they
believe is a Dutch fort dating to the early 1600s.
	   In the yard of Angelica and Chester Bentley's home on Long
Island Sound, Wesleyan visiting lecturer John Pfeiffer and his team
of seven students have been using tiny trowels to dig all week. So
far, they have discovered about 15 feet (4.5 meters) of an
intricate wall structure made of mortar derived from a mix of clam
shells, clay and sand.
	   ``This is a logical place to put a fort. This is the highest
land in the whole area, and it's a pretty defendable piece of
land,'' Pfeiffer said Wednesday, looking out over the Sound. ``The
philosophy at the time was to withstand siege.''
	   Carefully sifting through the dirt, the team also has found
pieces of what they believe is an old European gun. The researchers
estimate the fort is approximately 100 feet (30 meters) long and
100 feet (30 meters) wide, stretching from the Bentley's property
to the raised area of a neighboring tennis club.
	   The search for the fort began about three years ago when
Pfeiffer, who specializes in local archaeology, was at Yale
University to do research on local native Americans. Yale's second
president, Ezra Stiles, was known to be fascinated with the Indian
people, so Pfeiffer was examining his journals.
	   Among Stiles' papers, Pfeiffer found a detailed map of the local
area and a notation of the remains of an old fort. Stiles' map and
his corroborating notes date back to the mid-1700s.
	   ``Without this document, I wouldn't have come here,'' said
Pfeiffer, pointing to a large X on a photocopy of Stiles' map.
	   Pfeiffer also has a historic document noting that a structure in
the area was abandoned in 1620. That would make sense, Pfeiffer
said, because the local Indians, the Totokets, were no longer
considered a threat. Most of them apparently died two years earlier
from small pox _ a disease brought to the Americas by Europeans.
	   The researchers are basing their decisions about where to dig on
a map of Fort Orange in Albany, New York, which the Dutch inhabited
from 1624 to 1676. Pfeiffer believes the Branford fort was probably
similar in design, with horizontal beams, and housed 15 to 20
people.
	   ``If we are right and they abandoned it in 1620, that would
clearly make this the earliest European settlement,'' said Pfeiffer
of Old Lyme.
	   The Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock, Massachuetts, in 1621.
	   ``This is the kind of site that can have us reevaluating
history,'' Pfeiffer said. ``I think there was a lot of Dutch
activity here.''
	   According to the Museum of Connecticut History, the earliest
documented European settlement was a temporary fort called the
House of Good Hope erected by the Dutch in 1633 on what is now
Hartford. Dutch explorer Adriaen Block first sailed up the
Connecticut River in 1614. A permanent settlement was erected by
the Dutch later in 1633 in Windsor.
	   David Poirier, staff archaeologist for the state Historical
Commission, said he would withhold judgment until he sees more
evidence that the site is Dutch.
	   ``It certainly would be highly interesting to have a confirmed
Dutch archaeological presence in the state, but without
corroboration, I'd be hesitant to confirm it without further
study,'' he said.
	   Mrs. Bentley, 79, said she is not entirely clear about the
history of the land, except that her great-grandfather bought it
about 1850. She, herself, is part-Dutch, hailing on her mother's
side from the Van Rensselaer family.
	   ``When he asked if he could dig up the yard, we didn't hesitate.
This just seems right. This is more important than any personal
concerns,'' Mrs. Bentley said.
	   She and her 83-year-old husband, Chester, said they are not at
all bothered by the gaping holes in their yard or the number of
scientists coming through to inspect the find.
	   ``I feel as if I am in the middle of a fantastic dream. It's
very exciting,'' Mrs. Bentley said.

Nightly riots the norm as Northern Ireland bears sectarian showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in graf 10 gun attack on police, trucks blocking road to
port, graf 12 removes reference to Orange Order undecided whether

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Another night, another
nightmare for the peace-loving people of Belfast, many of whom are
staying in their homes rather than brave the hostile streets.
	   Protestant protests by day and riots by night this week over a
blocked Orange Order march showed little sign of abating Wednesday,
and the most hard-line Catholics are threatening their own trouble,
too.
	   The toll as of Wednesday afternoon, according to official
statistics: A dozen shootings, two dozen grenade blasts, 73 homes
of Catholics or police officers vandalized, 93 businesses and
schools damaged by fire, 136 vehicles stolen and burned and another
279 damaged, 44 officers and an unknown number of rioters wounded,
91 rioters arrested _ but so far, somehow, no deaths.
	   ``Every night, it's more of the same,'' said a policeman clad in
flame-retardent jumpsuit, his club tucked in his boot, his
plastic-bullet gun by his side, the visor up on his helmet to
reveal smoke-streaked cheeks and bloodshot eyes.
	   He stood guard early Wednesday at Donegall Pass, a Protestant
district in the divided heart of Belfast, where rioters have turned
the roadway into a sea of fire each night since Sunday and tried to
beat up Catholic residents of the nearby Lower Ormeau neighborhood.
	   ``This could go on another month,'' said the officer who,
because interviews with Royal Ulster Constabulary members are
supposed to be cleared with its press office, didn't want his name
published. ``We're just taking our punishment for blocking that
march. We'd be taking it in Roman Catholic areas now if we hadn't
stopped it.''
	   The march in question by Northern Ireland's Protestant
brotherhood, the Orange Order, ran into the British army's
barbed-wire barricades Sunday at the Drumcree Anglican church
outside Portadown, the order's birthplace 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of Belfast.
	   A civilian Parades Commission ruled the Orangemen should not be
allowed to continue down nearby Garvaghy Road, where Catholic
residents have tried to stop the annual march since 1995.
	   Orange leaders say they're determined to prevail no matter how
long it takes, and have maintained round-the-clock camps at the
Drumcree barricades and outside the castle residence of Britain's
Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam.
	   They are organizing near-constant illegal parades and human
roadblocks, but deny responsibility for the violence of Protestant
mobs. Hijacking and burning of vehicles continued Wednesday evening
in Portadown, north Belfast and the coastal town of Carrickfergus.
Police moved two trucks which were blocking the road to Northern
Ireland's main port at Larne. In Newtownabbey, north of Belfast,
police came under fire from gun and grenade attacks. There were no
reports of injuries.
	   After dark, many parts of Northern Ireland have become eerily
empty as shops close early, bus and train services are canceled and
even most taxi drivers refuse to ply their trade.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would meet Orange Order
leaders Thursday in London, but their public positions suggested
little room for negotiation.

King's trial prompts another delay in junior bantamweight title
</HEADLINE>
rematch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ Former IBF junior bantamweight
champion Danny Romero's wait for a rematch with champion Johnny
Tapia will go on for a while longer.
	   Bob Lee, president of the International Boxing Federation, has
given the two camps at least another seven days to try to work out
a deal. Two weeks ago, Lee said the promoters for Tapia and Romero
had until Wednesday to at least reach a tentative agreement on a
date for the rematch.
	   Tapia holds the WBO and IBF titles. He took the IBF crown from
Romero with a unanimous decision in Las Vegas last year and is
required to defend it against the No. 1 contender _ in this case
Romero _ or vacate it.
	   Lee said he decided to push back the deadline because of the
trial of Tapia's promoter, Don King.
	   Lee said King's trial has so complicated the issue of a rematch
that more time is needed. Lee said he has granted King and Romero's
promoter, Cedric Kushner, another seven days.
	   ``Cedric is hoping to have an intelligent conversation with Don
once all the weight (of the trial) is off Don's shoulders, and then
maybe we can put this thing to bed.''
	   Romero is scheduled to fight Tomas Cordova in Lake Charles,
Lousiana on July 19. Tapia was supposed to fight June 6 in New
York, but that bout was canceled.
	   Lee said the IBF could forbid either boxer from fighting prior
to a title rematch. But Lee said he would make no decision on that
possibility until he has heard back from Kushner and King.

Everyone interested in Tyson license but the former champion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The anniversary of Mike Tyson's ban from boxing
seems to be drawing interest from everyone but the former
heavyweight champion.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission was swamped with phone calls
Wednesday, most from various media outlets wanting to know whether
Tyson had asked for his license back.
	   No one called from the Tyson camp, though, and commission
executive director Marc Ratner said he had heard nothing from the
former champion about a license.
	   It was a year ago Thursday that Tyson had his boxing license
revoked and was fined dlrs 3 million for biting Evander Holyfield's
ears during their heavyweight title fight.
	   Tyson can reapply for a license beginning Thursday, but his
advisers said earlier they were in no hurry to do so. Tyson is
expected to apply sometime later in the month, meaning a hearing
would be scheduled sometime in August to hear his appeal for a new
license.

Brazil's largest publisher to acquire stake in leading financial
</HEADLINE>
daily &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's largest magazine group
agreed Wednesday to would acquire a 50 percent stake in the
country's leading financial newspaper, the companies said.
	   Grupo Abril and the financial daily Gazeta Mercantil announced
the deal in a joint statement saying it would provide for ``an
association between the companies, which does not involve the
transfer of control.''
	   The companies said they would only announce the purchase price
after an evaluation of Gazeta's assets.
	   The agreement should help to alleviate the financial newspaper's
debt burden, which has been reported to be a growing problem.
	   Abril publishes more than 200 magazines, including Veja, the
world's fourth largest news weekly in circulation terms.
	   The group also has stakes in cable television, on-line services
and direct marketing.
	   Gazeta Mercantil is Brazil's leading financial daily. The paper
also publishes a host of specialized market reports and has an
on-line service called InvestNews.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French fans poured out of cafes and bars, screaming
with triumph and sheer delight late Wednesday after their beloved
``Blues'' made history by reaching the World Cup final with a 2-1
victory over Croatia.
	   ``It's a complete euphoria taking over France,'' yelled
Geraldine Lessieux, 20, as she and hundreds of others ran into a
small bar-lined street in Paris' Left Bank. ``Each time France wins
it's like a shot from a cannon.''
	   ``And I don't even like soccer that much.''
	   France may not have the most diehard soccer fans in the world,
but with the amazing success of its team, it has definitely caught
World Cup fever. On Sunday, it will play in the final for the first
time ever against defending champion Brazil.
	   ``We're going to the final!'' shouted hordes of fans pouring out
of the stadium at Saint-Denis, a northern suburb, their faces
smeared with paint.
	   But first, they said they were headed for a night of partying.
	   ``I'm going to the Champs-Elysees,'' shouted Thierry Menetrier,
his face in red, white and blue of the French flag. ``We're gonna
party all night!''
	   The famous boulevard was already clogged with revelers minutes
after the victory, with their numbers growing by the minute.
	   The avenue was closed off to traffic as thousands of fans
marched triumphantly toward _ what else _ the Arc de Triomphe.
Small clusters of riot police stood by.
	   Draped in flags, the fans yelled in both French and English:
``We won!'' They were drowned out by a cacophony of honking horns.
	   ``It's amazing! said Jerome Vivie, 27, covered with war paint.
``The most beautiful final we could have hoped for _ France and
Brazil.''
	   After the final whistle at Stade de France, President Jacques
Chirac strode onto the field, raised his arms and cheered
delightedly. ``This is truly the most beautiful day in French
sports _ France in the final!'' he said.
	   For France, the country that invented the World Cup, it was an
exquisite moment of soccer history.
	   But some saw it as more: the most unifying thing that's happened
here in a long time, bringing together old and young, men and
women, and different social groups in a burst of patriotic
enthusiasm.
	   Roaming Paris Wednesday, it was hard to imagine that at the
beginning of the tournament, some French were less than thrilled
about the extravaganza that would bring unruly crowds, high prices
and even worse traffic than usual.
	   On the metro, there were no bands of kilted, singing Scots or
chanting South American fans. But there were lots of Parisians with
cheeks painted the red, white and blue of the French flag _ even if
for some, the rest of their attire was more suited for the office.
	   Philippe Vallot, 36, a computer executive, was headed for the
game after work, in an elegant business suit but with painted
cheeks.
	   ``I don't know how long this feeling will last, but let's enjoy
it now,'' he said, acknowledging that many French are not the
diehard fans found in South America or some European countries,
like Italy.
	   ``At least we're all behind the French team for now,'' he said.
``Let's hope they win. It may pass, but we'll have our memories.''
	   The fever seemed to be spreading to women, too.
	   Danielle Trepant, a 46-year-old housewife from northern France,
looked as properly French as they come, with carefully coiffed hair
and a soft voice. But she was dressed head-to-foot in tricolor-flag
jacket and pants, all saying ``Allez la France!'' _ and a jester
hat with pom-poms and bells. Her cheeks, needless to say, were
multicolored.
	   ``I have to admit, I didn't really watch soccer much before
this,'' she said, her husband nodding in amused agreement.
``Actually, hardly at all. But this is different _ it's in France,
and the World Cup. It's just another spirit.''
	   Vincent Rey, a wine seller from Clermont-Ferrand in the south,
paused on a train ride to the stadium to explain how he got his
tickets: a lottery at his bank, six months ago.
	   ``It's not true, that we don't love soccer like the others,'' he
said, offering the theory that the French taste in soccer is
somewhat similar to its taste in wine: discriminating.
	   ``We appreciate the beauty of a good game,'' Rey said. ``We are
less interested in who wins. In fact, tonight all I wish for is a
beautiful match. I don't really care who wins.''
	   Disagreeing heartily was James Balen, 20, a student in London
who is half Croatian and half English. Balen has spent most of the
money he has in the world coming to France four times to support
the Croatian team _ without tickets.
	   ``The French people have been really great, I think,'' he said.
``Everybody's nice to me, hotel keepers, people in the street,
everybody.''
	   France has suffered three heartbreaking defeats at the semifinal
stage, in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Many saw Wednesday's match as the
best chance ever to make history.
	   ``This would be historic,'' blared the headline of the sports
daily L'Equipe.
	   But would the feeling last after the World Cup? Not everyone
thought so.
	   ``There will be happiness for a few days,'' said textile worker
Nicolas Tchicedemian, 25, riding home on the subway to watch the
game on TV. ``Then, everything will go right back to normal.''

	   France has suffered three heartbreaking defeats at the semifinal
stage, in 1958, 1982 and 1986. Many saw Wednesday's match as the
best chance ever to make history.
	   ``This would be historic,'' blared the headline of the sports
daily L'Equipe.
	   But would the feeling last after the World Cup? Not everyone
thought so.
	   ``There will be happiness for a few days,'' said textile worker
Nicolas Tchicedemian, 25, riding home on the subway to watch the
game on TV. ``Then, everything will go right back to normal.''

French defense powers France into World Cup final with two goals

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Who needs strikers?
	   Defender Lilian Thuram fired France into the World Cup final for
the first time in its history Wednesday with two goals in a
come-from-behind 2-1 win over outsider Croatia.
	   ``This is fabulous,'' Thuram said. ``I don't even score during
training.''
	   In a second half for the history books, France ended its World
Cup semifinal jinx on its fourth attempt and became the first host
nation in 20 years to reach the final where it faces defending
titlist Brazil on Sunday.
	   French president Jacques Chirac cheered with hands aloft while
Croatia's counterpart Franjo Tudjman applauded his nation's
fairy-tale run that stopped one game short of the unbelievable.
	   ``It is truly the most beautiful day in the history of French
sport,'' Chirac said.
	   The defense has taken France to the final. Centerback Laurent
Blanc fired the quarterfinal winner in extra time against Paraguay
and rightback Thuram was the scoring star Wednesday night after his
forwards again failed to find the net.
	   On top of that, Blanc, Thuram and the others at the back have
defended superbly too. Blanc, however, will miss the final after
being expelled for pushing Croat defender Slaven Bilic in the face.
	   ``We played our hearts out and that made the difference,''
French coach Aime Jacquet said.
	   Brazil beat the Netherlands in a penalty shootout Tuesday and
Jacquet can't wait for the final.
	   ``We have the masters of world soccer and the best players ahead
of us. This is incredible happiness,'' Jacquet said.
	   ``Tonight we had everything to lose. On Sunday we have nothing
to lose,'' French captain Didier Deschamps said.
	   Croatia, in its first World Cup as a seven-year-old nation,
almost scored the biggest upset of all, even taking the lead before
finally falling to French flair.
	   ``We needed all the push and energy we could get,'' Jacquet
said.
	   The game came alive with two lightning-quick strikes early in
the second half.
	   First Croatia stunned the 80,000 crowd at the Stade de France 26
seconds into the second half when Aljosa Asanovic split the French
defense and Davor Suker scored his fifth World Cup goal, slipping
the ball under Barthez.
	   ``They caught us dead cold,'' Deschamps said.
	   The Croats didn't get time to enjoy it.
	   One minute later, Thuram stole the ball from captain Zvonimir
Boban near the Croat penalty area and sent a return pass that the
defender slotted past goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   ``It was fatal to get the equalizer in the same minute,''
Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``The French got their
strength from that.''
	   In the 70th minute, Thuram was even bolder, surging up the left
and setting up a one-two with Thierry Henry, that seemed to go
straight to Robert Jarni. But Thuram was not to be denied, winning
back the ball and then unleashing a curling 20-meter shot that went
wide of Ladic and released a whole nation into euphoria.
	   ``It is a worthy reward after everything he has been doing
throughout this World Cup,'' Jacquet said.
	   France already had been a losing semifinalist in 1958, 1982 and
1986 but finally earned soccer's biggest stage. It will be the
first time the defending champion will meet the host nation in a
final.
	   The first two minutes of the second half packed more action than
the whole first half and it was the wakeup call France needed.
	   In the tense minutes after France's second goal, defender
Laurent Blanc tugged at Slaven Bilic's shirt and slammed the palm
of his hand in his face. Referee Jose Manuel Garcia sent the
standout defender off and he will miss the final.
	   ``Blanc has put us in a terrible position,'' Jacquet said.
	   Down to 10 men, France went into a defensive shell, bolstering
the last line with Frank Leboeuf. Suker and Goran Vlaovic came
close three times in the final minutes but failed to break France's
embattled defense.
	   France started out as usual, attacking on both flanks and
playmaker Zinedine Zidane could hardly put a foot wrong in
midfield. As usual, everything unraveled though when that final
shot had to come.
	   ``Zizou'' was in the thick of things early on, heading and
shooting from long range, trying to answer critics that the team
wanted to run the ball into the net too much during the World Cup.
	   Deschamps tried the same and Stephane Guivarc'h took a 25-meter
free kick that took a good save from Ladic.
	   Croatia's defense remained undaunted even when France tried the
intricate skills, smothering a chance from Djorkaeff in the center.
	   Slowly, Zidane started to fade and Croatian confidence rose.
Stanic used the space on the right and Suker and Vlaovic were
always on the lookout. Happy to lay back early on, Croatia put the
French midfield to sleep and took over. The negative tactics
quickly turned into dangerous counters.
	   In the 35th minute, Asanovic found some space in the penalty
area, swiped a ball out of reach of a defender and his right-foot
shot came close to target. Three minutes later, Mario Stanic
crossed from the right and defender Bilic half-volleyed it over.
	   Again it showed the lightening transition the Croats are capable
of.

Annan urges creation of criminal court, saying time running out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that time is running out, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged negotiators Wednesday to
finalize work on creating the world's first permanent war crimes
tribunal.
	   Negotiators from over 150 countries have been attending a
conference in Rome since June 15 to try to create the court that
would try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The
marathon conference is set to end July 17.
	   In a letter to the president of the conference, Giovanni Conso,
Annan said he appreciated that everyone was working hard and would
spare no effort to make the court a reality.
	   ``Time is nevertheless running short,'' Annan said.
	   ``I would therefore like to convey to you and to the conference
my sincere hope that the participating states will find the
necessary spirit of cooperation in order to be able to finalize the
statute on July 17 with a view to creating a court which is strong
and independent enough to carry out its task,'' Annan wrote.
	   One especially deep divide among the negotiators is whether the
court should have a prosecutor free to open investigations on his
or her own. The United States is firmly opposed to the idea,
arguing that cases should come from individual states or the
Security Council.
	   In his letter, the U.N. chief outlined what he said should be
the goals of a permanent court.
	   ``The overriding interest must be that of the victims, and of
the international community as a whole,'' Annan wrote.
	   ``The court must be an instrument of justice, not expedience. It
must be able to protect the weak against the strong. It must
demonstrate that an international conscience is a reality.''
	   The idea of an international criminal court dates back to the
Nuremberg war crimes tribunals of World War II. The idea was
revived a few years ago amid the horrors in Bosnia and Rwanda _ for
which ad hoc courts have been formed to prosecute war criminals.

Pak, Robbins headline field for Jamie Farr LPGA stop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ It's already been a long week for Se Ri
Pak.
	   The 20-year-old LPGA Tour rookie went an extra playoff round on
Monday and then two more sudden-death holes to beat Jenny
Chuasiriporn for the U.S. Open title. Now she's on hand for this
week's Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   ``I'm just a little tired,'' the South Korean phenom said during
preparations for Thursday's opening round. ``I'm really happy, so I
forget that I'm tired.''
	   Pak is the hottest name in the 144-player field that includes 24
of the top 30 money winners on the tour. But the top three on the
list _ Liselotte Neumann, Donna Andrews and Annika Sorenstam _
passed on the trip to Toledo, leaving Pak as the top check-casher
in the field.
	   Pak has a warm spot for the Farr, since it was her first
professional tournament in the United States.
	   ``Last year was the first time I play the LPGA,'' she said. ``I
got a sponsor invitation. I want to play here this year as a thank
you.''
	   She came even though the Highland Meadows Golf Course doesn't
fit her game.
	   ``I have a chance to win, but I don't want to push myself too
much,'' Pak said. ``This course is tough for me because I can't use
my driver. I am a long driver, but that's not much help here. But I
know the course, so that is good.''
	   Defending champion Kelly Robbins blitzed the field last year
with a 19-under 265 for an eight-stroke victory.
	   Robbins trailed Karrie Webb by two strokes after the opening
round before matching the course record with a 7-under 64 to take a
two-shot lead over Webb and a three-stroke advantage on Hall of
Famer Nancy Lopez.
	   An estimated 15,000 fans turned out for what everyone thought
would be a shootout, but it was Robbins who had all the weapons.
Another 67 gave her a six-shot lead before she lowered the boom in
the final round.
	   ``The only thing I really remember is it was probably the best
four days of golf in a row I've put together since I've been on
tour,'' Robbins said. ``I didn't make any bad shots, I hit the
shots when I needed to and I putted well all week.''
	   At the time, her 265 was the lowest 72-hole total in LPGA
history.
	   Her heroics were enough to earn her top billing on large
tournament signs at the city limits of this Toledo suburb.
	   ``I had a couple of people ask me about the signs,'' said
Robbins, who lives on Lake Isabella near Mount Pleasant, Mich., and
carries a huge following to the tournament. ``They're pretty
neat.''
	   Webb and Lopez also are back, along with a strong list of
players with an Ohio background, including former Ohio State
players Meg Mallon and Rosie Jones and Zanesville native Tammie
Green.
	   The winner of the 72-hole tournament collects dlrs 120,000 from
the dlrs 800,000 purse.

World Cup: Deschamps has now outdone Platini
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with qualification and new quotes, changes dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Michel Platini vs. Didier Deschamps.
Two French captains for the history pages. Platini is France's
all-time star and on Wednesday Deschamps led Les Bleus to their
first World Cup final.
	   Platini led France to two World Cup semifinals in 1982 and 1986
but failed to get to soccer biggest stage. Deschamps captained his
team to a 2-1 semifinal win over World Cup rookie Croatia at the
Stade de France.
	   Now comes Brazil on Sunday.
	   ``Now we will rest up as well as we can and we will do all to
achieve something historic,'' said Deschamps.
	   Wednesday was tough enough in itself as France ended its World
Cup semifinal jinx on its fourth attempt, coming back from behind.
	   ``The crowd's enthusiam and our inner faith allowed us to
qualify. It is an enormous satisfaction,'' he said.
	   Playing his 75th international Wednesday, Deschamps has already
outlasted regal playmaker Platini by three appearances and at 29,
he still has some good years ahead of him. Yet he is little known
outside of Europe.
	   Mainly because Deschamps shares the defensive midfielder's lot.
Run yourself ragged for the whole match, rob the opponent of the
ball, give it to a star playmaker who feeds a star striker. Who
remembers the man who won the ball?
	   He is happily resigned to that. What could be better than
winning balls for Zinedine Zidane for France during the World Cup
and for Juventus during the Italian season.
	   ``The midfield battle is always important,'' said Deschamps and
it wasn't any different Wednesday. He had to fight and win the ball
from the likes of Zvonimir Boban and Aljosa Asanovic.
	   A huge threat hung over his performance Wednesday. He collected
one yellow card against Italy in the quarterfinal for a bodycheck
on Juventus teammate Alessandro Del Piero.
	   Yet he perfectly managed his match and avoided another card that
would have cost him the World Cup final.
	   A lot has worked out for the stocky Basque of 1.74 meters
(5-feet-8) and 71 kilos (157 pounds).
	   He captained Olympique Marseille to the European Champions Cup
triumph in 1993, a watershed title in French soccer history.
	   He moved to Juventus Turin, where he won the European Champions
Cup, the European Supercup and the Intercontinental Cup, all in
1996.
	   ``I've had the luck to win quite a few things in my career,''
Deschamps said. ``But the only thing that counts now is the World
Cup.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales,'' printed by England's earliest typographer, sold at auction
Wednesday at a price which auctioneers Christie's said was a world
record.
	   The red leather-bound edition, printed by William Caxton in
either 1476 or 1477, sold for 4,621,500 pounds (dlrs 7.53 million).
	   ``This has become the most expensive book ever sold,'' said
Victoria Coode, spokeswoman for Christie's. Coode said that the
previous highest auction price for a book was dlrs 5.3 million paid
at auction in New York in Oct. 1987 for a Gutenberg bible printed
in 1455.
	   The work was one of eight rare books offered at the auction, and
was bought by London book dealer Maggs Brothers. The Times reported
Thursday that the dealer bought the book on behalf of Sir Paul
Getty, the American-born billionaire philanthropist and Anglophile.

National Hockey League to play opener in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a successful visit last year, the North
American National Hockey League is returning to Japan to open its
season.
	   Calgary and San Jose will get the 1998-99 season started in
Tokyo with games on Friday and Saturday, Oct. 9-10.
	   The Flames and Sharks will play in Yoyogi Arena, where the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Vancouver Canucks opened with two
games a year ago. Both games were sellouts, attracting crowds of
10,500 each night.
	   Two other games are scheduled on opening night, with the Florida
Panthers opening the new Broward County Arena against the Tampa Bay
Lightning and the Philadelphia Flyers visiting the New York
Rangers.
	   The new Nashville Predators get started on Oct. 10, facing the
Panthers at home, the start of a two-game homestand for the
expansion team. The Predators follow that with a game against the
Carolina Hurricanes on Oct. 13.
	   The Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, who drew more than 1
million fans at home for the third straight season, open defense of
their title on Oct. 10 in Toronto. The Wings will raise their
championship banner at the Oct. 16 home opener against St. Louis.
	   With the addition of Nashville, the first of four expansion
teams to join the NHL over the next three seasons, the league will
have three divisions in each conference.
	   The Predators will play in the Central Division of the Western
Conference with Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. The rest of the
conference has Calgary, Colorado, Edmonton and Vancouver in the
Northwest Division and Anaheim, Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix and
San Jose in the Pacific.
	   The Eastern Conference has New Jersey, the New York Islanders,
the New York Rangers, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the Atlantic
Division; Boston, Buffalo, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto in the
Northwest; and Carolina, Florida, Tampa Bay and Washington in the
Southeast.
	   The regular season runs through April 18, with 16 of the 27
teams qualifying for the playoffs, which begin April 21.

Defense demands mistrial as judge questions jurors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY NEUMEISTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defense lawyers for flamboyant boxing promoter
Don King demanded a mistrial Wednesday after a juror admitted
seeing a newspaper article suggesting King could face a long prison
term if convicted of insurance fraud.
	   ``You just can't go forward. I'm not happy about it, but you
just can't do it,'' said Peter Fleming Jr., King's attorney.
	   U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna said he needed to learn if
the newspaper article had influenced the jury in deliberations so
he spoke to jurors individually in chambers and then sealed the
transcript. Jurors had been warned not to read or listen to news
accounts of the trial.
	   McKenna said he did not yet know enough to determine if a
mistrial was warranted.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss said the disclosure on
Tuesday that a juror had seen a newspaper article saying King faced
up to 45 years in prison should not result in a mistrial even
though the jury has indicated it is deadlocked.
	   If convicted, King actually would face a maximum prison term far
less than the 45 years that is created when the maximum five-year
prison term for each of his nine wire fraud counts are added
together, lawyers said.
	   ``If the jurors suspect there's going to be a ridiculous
sentence, they're all going to be prejudiced against the
government,'' Weiss said.
	   McKenna said the dilemma had created ``a little bit of a
minefield'' for the court as it tries to allow the jury to proceed
to a verdict that would not be clouded by legal issues.
	   Jurors were ordered to appear back in court at 10 a.m. Thursday.
	   For King, it is the second time a jury has said it was
deadlocked on insurance fraud charges. McKenna declared a mistrial
in 1995 when a jury would not reach a verdict on the charges that
he faked a contract after a canceled bout to cheat Lloyd's of
London out of dlrs 350,000.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Fugitive Australian businessman
Christopher Skase has 15 days to get out of Spain after an
application to renew his residency permit was denied, the
Australian government said.
	   Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said on Wednesday
that while the decision means substantial inconvenience for the
failed tycoon, it was no guarantee Skase would return to Australia.
	   Since 1994, Australia has been seeking Skase's extradition from
the Spanish resort island of Majorca, where he fled after being
charged in 1992 in relation to the U.S. dlrs 930 million (1.5
billion Australian dollar) collapse of his Qintex group of
companies.
	   He avoided the 1994 extradition attempt when a Spanish court
ruled that he was not well enough to return to Australia.
	   Vanstone said Skase had been informed of Spain's decision
Tuesday, giving him 15 days from Wednesday to either leave the
country or launch an appeal.
	   ``It is very important to stress that Mr. Skase does have
judicial appeal processes available to him,'' Vanstone told
reporters.
	   Skase's Spanish lawyer, Antonio Zoll, said Skase would appeal
the decision and would also seek to extend the period of grace to
90 days, the domestic news agency Australian Associated Press
reported.
	   Zoll said Skase was told his application was turned down because
he no longer held a passport. It was handed to the Australian
government in May when he re-applied for residency.
	   An appeal, Zoll said, would be made to an administrative appeals
tribunal on the grounds that Skase was denied his fundamental
rights.
	   Skase was said to be angry and nervous about the deportation
decision as he remained at his mansion hideaway on the Spanish
resort island of Majorca.
	   Two weeks ago, Skase launched proceedings against Spain's
earlier refusal to grant him Spanish identity documents. That
appeal followed Spain's delivery of Skase's Australian passport to
the Australian government.
	   Vanstone said Skase is not obliged to return to Australia if he
can find another country to go to, and that ``presumably ... he has
made plans.''
	   She added, ``I would hope that Mr. Skase would simply decide
that enough is enough and come home and face Australian justice.
After all, he claims he's innocent of any wrongdoing.''

Owners set to elect commissioner and _ no surprise _ it's Selig
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Most baseball fans won't be surprised, shocked or
even speechless Thursday when owners their install their first
commissioner in six years.
	   The announcement itself will be anticlimatic.
	   That's because the new commissioner is the old commissioner _
Bud Selig.
	   He'll no longer be the ``acting'' head of baseball.
	   He'll be the real thing.
	   ``A commissioner is not czar sitting above the law,'' Selig said
as his election approached. ``Yes, a commissioner has a lot of
power, but it must be confined to certain areas.''
	   Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers since 1970, was part
of the group that helped force Fay Vincent to resign on Sept. 7,
1992. He was angered that both Vincent and Peter Ueberroth deemed
themselves impartial and immune to owners' wishes.
	   That won't happen with Selig, called baseball's champion
vote-counter by several owners. Even though he'll have the title
and a five-year term, he'll still rule by consensus. Don't expect
another Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Or even another Peter Ueberroth.
	   ``I don't think people realize how the office of the
commissioner has changed since 1921,'' Selig said.
	   His term as acting commissioner, which began two days after
Vincent's resignation, already has gone on longer than the span of
four of his eight predecessors: William Eckert, Ueberroth, A.
Bartlett Giamatti and Vincent.
	   He's presided over the start of interleague play, the
introduction of three-division leagues and wild cards and vastly
increased revenue sharing between the large- and small-market
clubs.
	   He also was in charge during the 230-day strike that led to a
sharp dropoff in attendance and popularity. But with that behind,
he hopes the next five years will be calmer than the last five.
	   Three issues figure to dominate his agenda during the remainder
of the year: Marge Schott, the Minnesota Twins and Pete Rose.
	   Schott, the Cincinnati Reds owner, was forced to give up
day-to-day control of the team in the middle of the 1996 season
because of inflammatory remarks that angered women, blacks and
Jews. The sanctions against her expire after this season, but
baseball officials informally have discussed whether the team
should continue to operate largely without her influence.
	   ``We'll deal with that in due course,'' Selig said.
	   The Twins, angered that Minnesota's government won't fund a new
ballpark, have threatened to move to North Carolina, but voters
there voted down one stadium proposal and it's unclear if Charlotte
will fund a stadium.
	   Rose figures to be the easiest issue for him. Baseball's career
hits, banned for life in 1989 following a gambling investigation by
Giamatti, has applied for reinstatement, which would make him
eligible for the Hall of Fame. Selig shows no inclination to
reverse the ban.
	   ``I think Bart did the right thing,'' Selig said earlier this
year. ``There's no reason to change that.''

On deck: the chase by McGwire, Gonzalez, Yanks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If the second half of the season is anything
like the All-Star game, big numbers are on deck. Really big
numbers.
	   Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa taking aim at Roger
Maris' home run record. Juan Gonzalez going for the RBIs mark. The
New York Yankees trying to become the winningest team ever.
	   The races all resume Thursday, which also happens to be the day
Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig is set to become baseball's first
permanent commissioner since 1992.
	   For now, baseball is still buzzing about the batty All-Star game
Tuesday night. Coors Field was simply offensive, with the American
League beating the National League 13-8 in the highest-scoring
All-Star game ever.
	   MVP Roberto Alomar and Alex Rodriguez homered for the AL. But
the biggest blow was a three-run homer by Barry Bonds, a 451-foot
(135-meter) drive to right field. The Giants star's shot hit the
``SF'' banner draped from the third deck.
	   Now, once again, the home runs count for real as McGwire and Co.
continue their pursuit of Maris' 61 in 1961. McGwire leads the
majors with 37 homers, with Griffey (35) and Sosa (33) also on a
pace to break the record.
	   ``Everything people are talking about is a projection,'' McGwire
said. ``There's always projections at the All-Star break and nobody
realizes the second half is the toughest part of the year.''
	   Gonzalez also may give history a run. He had 101 RBIs at the
break, and he has 80 games left with Texas to challenge Hack
Wilson's record of 190 set in 1930.
	   ``The thing is staying healthy all season,'' Gonzalez said.
``I'm trying to drive in my RBIs. I'm trying day by day, one at a
time.''
	   That's the same attitude the Yankees are taking as they approach
records for the most wins.
	   These Yankees already are 61-20, a winning percentage of .753.
For those wondering, the famed '27 Yankees _ billed as the best
team ever with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig _ went 110-44 for a winning
percentage of .714.
	   The American League record for wins is 111 by Cleveland in 1954,
and the major league mark is 116 by Chicago Cubs in 1906. Both
marks were accomplished in a 154-game season, though no one is
about to insist the Yankees need an asterisk this year.

Shock, suspicion at death of top Nigerian political prisoner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. Under Secretary of State that
doctors did everything they could; more comment from Anyaoku;
UPPICKS graf 10 pvs &QL; 
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amid suspicion and recriminations Wednesday over
the death of Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, the Commonwealth secretary-general said the military
regime is about to announce a firm program for restoring civilian
rule.
	   Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the 54-nation
Commonwealth of Britain and its ex-colonies, said he expected a new
deadline of six months from now instead of Oct. 1, the date set by
the predecessor of Nigeria's new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
	   ``This is a watershed moment,'' Anyaoku said. ``I believe if
this is not handled properly, Nigeria may be in for very severe
trouble.''
	   Anyaoku said he spoke Tuesday night to Abubakar, who he
described as ``determined to usher in democracy.''
	   ``So I expect him in the next day or so to make a pronouncement
to this effect,'' said Anyaoku, adding that five political parties
sponsored by Abubakar's predecessor Sani Abacha, who died June 8,
likely would not survive.
	   Two of Abiola's daughters and opposition groups contend the
military regime was responsible for Abiola's death through
ill-treatment during four years in jail and by ignoring doctors'
warnings that his health was deteriorating.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said the conditions under which Abiola was held
probably contributed to his death, and called for an independent
pathologist to be involved in Abiola's autopsy.
	   Abiola, 60, the presumed winner of 1993 elections, died Tuesday
after suffering an apparent heart attack during a meeting with
visiting U.S. diplomats.
	   U.S. Under Secretary of State Tomas Pickering, who was meeting
with Abiola when he died, told reporters Wednesday night that the
Nigerian doctors had done everything in their power to revive him.
	   He said the U.S. delegation felt Abiola was in good health at
the start of their meeting.
	   ``He suddenly became disturbed, coughed, was very uncomfortable,
wanted to collect his thoughts then asked for cough drops,'' he
recalled, saying Abiola then said he was in pain and aksed for more
air. ``The Nigerians officials that were with us immediately went
in search of a physician. The physician came in maybe seven, ten,
twelve minutes.''
	   ``We watched while they struggled for an hour and a half to try
to save his life,'' he said. ``I am not the expert in that you
would cearly want to have an offical report, but we felt that they
made all of their best efforts.''
	   The Commonwealth secretary-general, in a British Broadcasting
Corp. interview, said he did not suspect foul play _ although he
noted that Abiola had looked well, smiled and joked when he met him
last month as part of Commonwealth monitoring of Nigeria, a
suspended member.
	   ``My message to the people of Nigeria is to endure this tragic
loss with equanimity, let's hope to build a democracy for which
Abiola suffered, with years of detention,'' Anyaoku later told
APTV.

Gilbert's memory hangs over championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ Larry Gilbert is gone, yet his memory
is very much in evidence this week at the Senior Players
Championship.
	   The cigar-chomping Gilbert, who died of lung cancer in January,
won the championship at the TPC of Michigan last summer.
	   ``It hit our tour hard,'' said Dave Stockton, a two-time winner
of this tournament. ``It was a senseless death.''
	   Gilbert, who spent most of his life as a club pro in Kentucky,
won the Senior Players Championship last summer. It was the stuff
of high drama as Gilbert, 54, closed with a 5-under-par 67 for 274
and a three stroke victory over Stockton and three others.
	   The victory was worth dlrs 270,000, a lot of money to a guy who
has spent most of his life giving lessons and selling sweaters out
of the pro shop. He had earned dlrs 902,816 for the season when the
cancer was diagnosed.
	   An emotional Gilbert fought back tears during his victory
speech.
	   ``This is incredible,'' he said. ``The dreams, the pretending
when you're putting on the 18th hole needing a birdie to beat Jack
Nicklaus in the U.S. Open _ All those times, they finally paid off.
I thought of my mother and father, how proud they would be of me.''
	   Six months later, Gilbert was dead.
	   ``There are two things that are inevitable on the Senior Tour,''
said Stockton, a non-smoker who lost both his parent to lung
cancer. ``We ride carts, and a lot of the guys smoke cigars.
	   ``As a non-smoker, like I am, when I see players smoking, I just
look at that and shake my head. Why would someone want to kill
themselves? It makes absolutely no sense to me.''
	   Stockton will be among the favorites again when the tournament,
sponsored by Ford Motor Co., begins Thursday. Despite being winless
in 1998, he ranks fifth on the Senior Tour money list behind Hale
Irwin, Gil Morgan, senior rookie Larry Nelson and Jay Sigel.
	   ``I love to win on this course, just to give Jack Nicklaus
something to think about,'' Stockton said with a laugh.
	   Nicklaus, who designed the 6,876-yard (6,257-meter), par 72
course near Detroit, generated most of Wednesday's news with his
announcement that he will end his streak of 154 consecutive majors
by skipping the British Open next week. He also said he will not
play the PGA Championship next month.
	   Nicklaus, winner of 18 majors and two U.S. Amateur titles, has
played in every major for which he has been eligible since the 1957
U.S. Open, when he missed the cut as an amateur.
	   He has been bothered by a sore left hip for several years.
	   ``After 42 years of playing major championship golf, I feel that
my ability to compete at the highest level on a continuous basis is
marginal at best,'' Nicklaus said. ``I feel this is the time to end
my streak of consecutive majors, for which I have been eligible.''
	   Morgan, winner of three Senior tournaments this season,
complained of being rusty after taking the last three weeks off.
	   ``You probably heard me squeaking as I was coming in,'' Morgan
said. ``I'm not in the best of shape as far as my play is
concerned. Still, I'm excited about being back. Hopefully, I'm
rested a little bit.''
	   Irwin also is seeking his fourth title this season.
	   Irwin, who tied for second last week at the State Farm Senior
Classic, collected dlrs 100,000 to pass Greg Norman and become the
leading career money winner among PGA players. He has amassed dlrs
12,030,109 over his professional golf career.

Report: Japan to provide Russia with dlrs 800 million loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Russian government will sign a contract with
the Export-Import Bank of Japan to obtain dlrs 800 million worth of
untied loans, a major newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The signing will take place during Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko's visit to Tokyo starting Monday, the Nihon Keizai
business daily said.
	   The funding is part of a dlrs 1.5 billion untied loan promised
by Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi when he visited Russia in
February, the report said.
	   The dlrs 800 million component will go to modernize Russia's
coal mining operations, a priority in Russian industrial
reorganization.
	   To date, Moscow has already received loans totaling dlrs 400
million from the World Bank, and will obtain half of the dlrs 800
million loan from the Export-Import Bank by the end of July, the
Nihon Keizai reported.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Big-name technology and financial stocks rallied
Wednesday, lifting the Dow industrials to the highest level in
nearly two months and boosting the Nasdaq market to record levels
for the first time since April. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 89.93 points _ or 1 percent _ to 9,174.97, the blue-chip
barometer's highest finish since its record close of 9,211.84 on
May 13. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators have approved
the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S. telecommunications groups
MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc. on condition that MCI's
Internet business is sold. Wednesday's approval from the European
Commission had been widely expected after the companies accepted
its demand that they divest overlapping businesses, primarily the
MCI's Internet interests. Without the sale of MCI's Internet
businesses, the merged company would control around 50 percent of
the market, which the EU said would be an unfairly dominant
position. (EU-MCI-WORLDCOM)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Labor unrest spread Wednesday and the stock market
slid in a gloomy prologue to the expected announcement of a
multi-billion-dollar loan package from the International Monetary
Fund. Thousands of unpaid defense workers demonstrated in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, among other cities, and coal miners halted
traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway for the sixth straight day.
The Russian stock market dropped 2.65 percent on modest volume,
with investors discouraged by the results of the weekly government
bond auctions. The Russian economy has been in a tailspin for much
of this year after showing its first signs of growth since well
before the Soviet collapse. The government, desperately in need of
cash, has been negotiating with the IMF for a bailout loan.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's top central banker on
Wednesday told countries set to join the single currency next year
that they had to work harder to reduce their budget deficits. At a
news conference a day after governors of the new European Central
Bank met, bank president Wim Duisenberg expressed concern that some
countries chosen to inaugurate the ``euro'' currency in 1999 were
not trying hard enough to meet treaty requirements on budget
deficits and national debt. The treaty setting out terms for
monetary union calls for member states to get their budget deficits
below 3 percent of gross domestic product and their total
outstanding debt below 60 percent. (GERMANY-EUROPEAN BANK)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators set
conditions Wednesday for a controversial alliance between American
Airlines and British Airways, including a demand that they fly
fewer trans-Atlantic flights to maintain competition. But the EU
angered a rival group by saying it should also fly under
restraints. European Commission officials told American and BA they
must make room for competitors at London's crowded Heathrow and
Gatwick airports if they want their often-delayed partnership to
take off. The Commission also slapped conditions on United
Airlines' coalition with Lufthansa German Airlines and Scandinavian
Airlines System, prompting a furious reaction. (EU-AIRLINE
ALLIANCES)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cuba's booming tourism industry and a more
diversified economy are enough to offset the worst sugar crop in
perhaps a half century and the ongoing U.S. embargo of the island,
the country's economics minister said Wednesday. Jose Luis
Rodriguez said a jump in the tourism, fishing, and tobacco sectors
allowed the Cuban economy to grow at a 4 percent annual rate during
the first three months of 1998, despite the sugar industry's woes.
``Even with the sugar drop, the economy is growing, something that
was not a traditional characteristic of the Cuban economy,''
Rodriguez told The Associated Press, adding the government expects
growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for the entire year. (US-CUBA
ECONOMY)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday postponed a decision on rules for
negotiating free trade agreements with five Latin American
countries. The decision was delayed for two weeks after the EU's
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler appealed for more time to
study the impact for European farmers of free trade accords with
Chile and the Mercosur group _ Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. The EU and Mercosur signed an agreement on trade and
economic cooperation in 1995. A similar agreement was signed with
Chile, an associate member of Mercosur, in June 1996. (EU-LATIN

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence erupted Wednesday in cities
across Nigeria's southwest, triggered by the death of the country's
best-known political prisoner. At least 19 people are believed to
have been killed. Political uncertainty increased Wednesday
afternoon when Nigeria's military ruler dissolved his cabinet _ a
mix of civilian and military advisers. But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar
left the Provisional Ruling Council, the core of Nigeria's ruling
junta, intact. Abubakar, in a nationwide television address
Wednesday night, called the death of Moshood Abiola on Tuesday a
``national tragedy'' and appealed for calm. He made no mention of
the cabinet, though, beyond saying that returning Nigeria to
democracy was imperative. (NIGERIA-ABIOLA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police launched their heaviest
attack yet on Wednesday against a long-besieged guerrilla enclave
on the Albanian border, killing five people and wounding several
more, said ethnic Albanian sources. The escalation of fighting
around the mountainous border village of Morina was accompanied by
Serb shelling of at least four other area villages, said the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Information Center. The reported Serb assault
appeared an attempt to cut off Kosovo Albanian militants from
Albania, which serves both as a refuge and the main source of
weapons used by them in their battle for independence from Serbia.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched the crackdown. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The newest edict from the hard-line
Islamic Taliban army bans televisions, video cassette recorders,
videos and satellite dishes. ``These video recorders and television
are the cause of corruption in this society,'' Mohammed Qalamuddin,
deputy head of the Taliban's religious ministry said Wednesday. The
Taliban shut down Afghanistan only television station when it took
control of the beleaguered capital in September 1996. Since then
they have issued a ban on video cassettes, but it has not been
strictly enforced. Qalamuddin said owners have 15 days to get rid
of their television sets. After that time religious police, bearded
men with automatic rifles, will conduct spot searches and smash any
television they find. The Taliban army has imposed a harsh brand of
Islamic law since taking control of 85 percent of Afghanistan.
(AFGHANISTAN-TELEVISION BAN)
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Heavy runoff from melting glaciers
swelled rivers along the border of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan,
killing at least 38 people in the Central Asian nations, officials
said Wednesday. The melting, caused by hot weather topping 42
degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit), has caused flooding in
two rivers: the Ak-Suu in Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan-Sai in
Uzbekistan, according to the Uzbek Emergencies Ministry. The
flooding caused a dam on Kuban-Kel lake to break, the Interfax news
agency reported. Many of the deaths were in the mountainous
Kadamzhai district in western Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan
district in eastern Uzbekistan, the report said. (CENTRAL
ASIA-FLOOD)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Drunken teen-agers rioted early
Wednesday, inspired by a massive labor protest that began with a
blockade of the Puerto Rico's main airport and lapsed into mundane
picketing. Some stores opened, defying labor demands to stay closed
until the end of a two-day general strike to protest the sale of
the state telephone company is to end. However, the island's major
shopping malls remained closed Wednesday because of a rash of bomb
threats. Buses and taxis stayed off the roads, and small commuter
airlines and cargo companies at regional airports remained
grounded. The youths smashed shop windows and flung bottles and
cans at police early Wednesday at a shopping mall near the Puerto
Rico Telephone Co. headquarters in San Juan. Police arrested 17
people. (PUERTO RICO-STRIKE)

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Puccini's ``Turandot'' will be performed in
September in a lavish, dlrs 15 million production amid the golden
roofs of China's former Imperial Palace.
	   It will be the most expensive opera ever staged, producer
Michael Ecker said Wednesday.
	   Conductor Zubin Mehta and Chinese film director Zhang Yimou are
helping stage the opera in a courtyard of the Forbidden City.
	   The opera is the tale of a daughter of a Chinese emperor who
promises that she will marry any suitor who solves three riddles,
but that those who fail will be executed.
	   Casting plans include Sharon Sweet as Turandot, Barbara
Hendricks as the slave Liu and tenors Lando Bartolini, Kristjan
Johansson and Sergei Larin.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Smashing Pumpkins want their latest tour to
smash some Generation X stereotypes.
	   ``There is a common feeling that the world is falling apart, and
we're one of the bands of our generation accused of playing into
that nihilism,'' said lead singer Billy Corgan. ``I'm sick of being
accused of feeding into that.''
	   The band hopes to raise dlrs 2.3 million for local charities
during its summer tour, which opened Tuesday.
	   ``As a band we've achieved our wildest dreams,'' he said.
``What's important now is putting our values ahead of our
pockets.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cameron Diaz says acting with her boyfriend Matt
Dillon in ``There's Something About Mary'' required extra
concentration.
	   ``I takes an incredible amount of maturity to work with your
boyfriend,'' Ms. Diaz said in the August issue of Details magazine.
``I tried to look at him totally as an actor, tried not to allow
the baggage that you have in relationships to interfere.''
	   Dillon said he and Ms. Diaz survived the working relationship
intact.
	   ``It probably wouldn't have worked earlier in our relationship,
but we got it together now,'' he said. ``I mean, as much as you can
get it together, you know what I mean?''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire and 25
other country artists want their legal fees paid by a California
man they sued for linking their names to a pornography site on the
Internet.
	   A federal judge ruled in the musicians' favor last week on their
claim that Jim Salmon improperly used their ``domain names,'' or
Internet addresses, as a link to the porn site.
	   But instead asking for damages, the country stars just want
their legal expenses covered.
	   Salmon bought the domain names in 1996 for $100 each for two
years' use, saying he planned to use them to build a country music
Web site.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The moon landing, a civil right's advocate's
speech, the peace sign and the Peace Corps, are among the 1960s
topics voted memorable enough to be commemorated on U.S. postage
stamps.
	   The first choice of the voting public was the moon landing, the
Postal Service reported Wednesday. Finishing second was the
beginning of professional football's Super Bowl, and third was the
peace sign that seemed to be printed and painted everywhere during
protests of the Vietnam War.
	   ``The results of the balloting reflect what is most memorable
about the 1960s among adults and children across the country,''
said Postmaster General William Henderson.
	   In the ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke
powerfully of his vision of racial harmony in the United States. He
was later assassinated.
	   The post office is issuing sets of 15 stamps to commemorate the
top people and events of each decade of the century.
	   The stamps will be issued in September 1999. The public will be
asked to vote on subjects for the 1970s starting in June.

Moody's: Widespread bank closings likely in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER ALAN HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Widespread bank closings are likely in China, a
leading Western credit-evaluating service says in an analysis that
contends financial reforms are long overdue and will prove
extremely costly to the country.
	   The annual review by analysts at Moody's Investors Service said
China's financial institutions lack supervision and regulation by
the central bank and that the banks themselves have little control
over their major provincial branches.
	   ``China has long had, by most measures, the weakest banking
system among major Asian countries,'' analyst Nicholas Krasno said
in the report published in this week's issue of ``Moody's Credit
Perspectives.''
	   While China has significantly greater financial resources than
crisis-ridden countries in the region, it has greater obstacles to
overcome in reforming a banking system with huge insolvencies, the
Moody's report said.
	   Krasno said widespread bank closings are likely.
	   Borrowing is the likely source of funds to reform the banks and
deal with insolvencies, but ``the decision to issue the extremely
large amounts of debt that will be required, thereby placing an
enormous burden on future public revenues, may prove repugnant to
the Chinese leadership,'' Krasno wrote.
	   The Moody's report said that 17 Chinese banks it tracks have
ratings averaging between those of India and Russia.
	   The banks are underregulated and local political authorities
have control in many areas, not the central bank, Moody's said. It
complained of a ``lack of any coherent strategy for resolving the
huge insolvency of the state banks (which hold over 90 percent of
they system's assets).''
	   The pressures on China's banking system and economy have led to
worries that it will devalue its currency, the yuan. Currency
devaluations triggered the Asian economic meltdown that began a
year ago.
	   Analysts, economists and the White House have worried about a
currency devaluation because China is seen as one of the remaining
pillars preventing the Asian crisis from dramatically spreading
around the world.
	   The giant brokerage Merrill Lynch recently said in an analysis
that the risk of devaluation is remote and that statements by
Chinese officials suggesting a devaluation were part of a strategy
to get Japan, the world's second-largest economy, to straighten out
its banking system.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Massive labor protest lapses into mundane picketing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Drunken teen-agers rioted
Wednesday, inspired by a massive labor protest that began with a
bang and lapsed into mundane picketing.
	   Some stores cautiously opened, defying labor demands to stay
closed until 11 p.m., when a two-day general strike to protest the
sale of the state telephone company is to end. The island's major
shopping malls remained closed because of a rash of bomb threats.
	   Buses and taxis stayed off the roads. Small commuter airlines
and cargo companies at regional airports remained grounded.
	   Early Wednesday, youths smashed shop windows and flung bottles
and cans at police at a shopping mall near the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. headquarters in San Juan.
	   Police fired tear gas to halt the rampage and arrested 14 young
men and three women.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Phone sale plan rings wrong bell in New York
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a New York neighborhood where Puerto Rican
flags flutter on fire escapes and swing from car mirrors, the
Puerto Rican government's dlrs 1.9 billion plan to sell the
island's state-owned phone company isn't much more popular than it
is in Puerto Rico.
	   There, fear of layoffs prompted the island's first general
strike since 1934 on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``I'd rather leave it just the way it is,'' said Eric Alvarez, a
27-year-old car detailer sitting in a Brooklyn barber shop wearing
a bicycle cap with ``Puerto Rico'' written on it.
	   ``I've got a funny feeling that what they want to do is cut the
workers down,'' he said. He doesn't know much about GTE Corp., the
company that is leading a group of buyers that plans to buy the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co., but Alvarez said he has little faith in
any outsider's interest in spending money on educating and training
Puerto Rican workers.
	   His sentiments are typical of many Puerto Ricans who live in New
York, some of whom staged a demonstration of their own against the
sale last week.
 &UR; GUYANA: Parliament to vote Friday on re-admitting opposition party
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's parliament will vote Friday
on allowing the opposition People's National Congress to regain its
seats, one month after the party's lawmakers were barred because of
high absenteeism.
	   The party had boycotted Parliament because it claimed President
Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party rigged the Dec. 15
elections. Jagan's party won 36 of the body's 65 seats, while the
People's National Congress garnered 25.
	   The People's Progressive Party invoked a rule June 11 barring
the party's lawmakers because they had missed six consecutive
sessions in eight weeks without the speaker of parliament's
permission.
	   Caribbean leaders persuaded National Congress leader Desmond
Hoyte to return to Parliament during a Caribbean Community summit
in St. Lucia last week. The agreement also ended two weeks of riots
and firebombings.
	   People's National Congress lawmakers said they would be ready to
return to Parliament on July 15.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: President cancels Asia trip to focus on
economy
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ President Leonel
Fernandez canceled a trip to Asia to concentrate on pushing a
series of economic austerity measures through Congress.
	   Last week, Fernandez devalued the Dominican peso by 9 percent
and ordered a government-wide hiring freeze.
	   ``There are a series of measures pending, and I should dedicate
myself now, here, to pushing them forward,'' he said.
	   Fernandez has also proposed using gasoline taxes to pay external
debts and creating a commission to investigate budget overruns. The
government has a dlrs 4 billion public debt, much of it to private
electricity providers and vendors who claim unpaid bills are
driving them to bankruptcy.
	   Fernandez had planned to travel to Japan and Taiwan at the end
of July.
	   The devaluation set the official exchange rate at 15.33 pesos to
the U.S. dollar, up from the set rate of 14.02 in March.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Court strikes welfare rule for Puerto Rican family
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ A state appeals court Wednesday
struck down a provision of New Jersey welfare law that forced some
families moving into New Jersey to accept lower welfare payments.
	   The case involved a woman and her three children who moved in
from Puerto Rico. Such a family would qualify for dlrs 488 a month
in New Jersey but only dlrs 204 a month in Puerto Rico, and state
officials capped her benefits for 12 months at the rate paid in
Puerto Rico.
	   Appellate Judge Barbara Wecker said this penalty violated the
state and U.S. constitutions.
	   The cap was intended to discourage welfare families from moving
to New Jersey to get better benefits.
	   The ruling is the first legal setback for the state's welfare
law, but not an unexpected one. When the case was filed last
October, former Human Services Commissioner William Waldman had
said federal judges have been striking down such provisions in
other states.

World Cup: Dutch look to overcome gloom after semifinal heartbreak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROQUEBRUNE CAP-MARTIN, France (AP) _ In the aftershock of its
dramatic semifinal shootout loss to Brazil, the Netherlands camp -
like most of the nation back home - is under a cloud of gloom.
	   Yet the young squad's battling displays, and acceptance of a
tactical overhaul, bring hope for the future of Dutch soccer.
	   ``We didn't play as well as we did against Argentina. We are
feeling terribly sad,'' said a depressed Ronald de Boer, who missed
one of the Netherlands' penalties in the shootout against Brazil.
``There were occasions when we could have clinched the game but we
lost and it's a terrible disappointment.''
	   That likely won't go away before the team plays in the
third-placed playoff in Paris on Saturday. But, as the Dutch
remember the penalty shootout defeat from their luxurious hideaway
overlooking Monaco on Wednesday, there's much to be proud of from
France 98.
	   Having come top of its group, the Netherlands went on to win
tough games against Yugoslavia and Argentina, before falling to the
world champion.
	   In doing so, the Dutch - so often accused of lacking the
necessary temperament for the very top level - showed fighting
spirit and team unity that has been absent over recent years.
	   Dutch teams of the past might have folded after going behind.
But, after Ronaldo's 46th minute strike for Brazil, it was the
Dutch who dominated for long periods.
	   That never-say-die attitude, which brought late goals against
Yugoslavia and Argentina, paid off again with Patrick Kluivert's
late equalizer.
	   Similarly, despite having Arthur Numan sent off in the
quarterfinal against Argentina, the Netherlands kept their
composure and stayed on top for much of the match.
	   ``The players realize that they don't get the chance to play in
many World Cups in their career. There is no division among the
players anymore,'' said coach Guus Hiddink, in a reference to a
dramatic blacks vs. whites fallout among the players during the
1996 European Championship.
	   Hiddink introduced new tactics at the World Cup, abandoning the
team's conventional 4-3-3 formation in favor of a more solid 4-4-2.
	   Under the new system, the two wingers are ordered to tackle back
and get behind the ball as soon as possession is lost.
	   ``The 4-4-2 that we play now is a bit different from our
traditional style. Perhaps it's a bit more defensive, but maybe we
have attacked too much in the past,'' said captain Frank de Boer
whose team has scored 12 goals in six games, but added defensive
stability.
	   Davids, the Juventus midfielder, has been one of the Netherlands
big successes so far at the World Cup, and was one of the stars
Tuesday. Hiddink will be pleased that the player with a reputation
as a rebel has slotted so impressively into his plans.
	   The PSV Eindhoven utility man Phillip Cocu, who will play for
Barcelona next season, has starred in three different positions -
striker, left-sided midfielder and, against Brazil, leftback -
scoring a pair of goals in the process.
	   Kluivert, 22-years-old this month, showed against Brazil that he
still has the potential to be a player for the big occasion,
despite such an unhappy season in Italy with AC Milan.
	   For most of the team, there will be another chance of World Cup
success; 11 of the 14 players used by Hiddink in Marseille are aged
28 or under, while the injured Marc Overmars, who has terrorized
many defenses in France, is also only 25-years-old.
	   ``We are still a young team,'' said Frank de Boer. ``We have two
or three more big tournaments together.''

World Cup: Croats feel they let victory slip away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ They tried to keep their heads high.
Yet, as Croatian players came out of the locker room, there was a
look of deep disappointment in their eyes.
	   Croatia let a 1-0 lead slip away and crashed out of the World
Cup semifinal with a 2-1 defeat against host France on Wednesday.
Instead of playing the final against Brazil on Sunday, the World
Cup rookie will contest the third-place match against the
Netherlands on Saturday.
	   ``We beat ourselves,'' said defender Igor Stimac. ``We gave away
the goals as gifts to France.''
	   Still, it was a magnificent achievement for the small nation of
4.8 million people, which in the quarterfinals knocked out Germany,
which has 6 million registered players, with a 3-0 victory.
	   ``The only difference was that this time we could not hold to
our lead even two minutes. Had we managed to hold the lead for a
little while, we would have won,'' Stimac said. ``Who knows if
we'll have another chance like this to play in the final.''
	   Davor Suker fired his fifth goal of the tournament 26 seconds
into the second half. But defender Lilian Thuram replied just a
minute later and then clinched the winner in the 70th.
	   ``We gave our maximum. We scored the goal and we were already in
the final,'' said Suker, the Real Madrid striker. ``But we conceded
the equalizer too early.
	   ``We really wanted to play the final, but now we have to
concentrate and try to be third.''
	   Defender Slaven Bilic, who was slammed in the face by French
defender Laurent Blanc to earn the Frenchman a red card and give
Croatia a man advantage for the last 20 minutes, also felt his team
had the victory for the taking.
	   ``We had a fantastic opportunity. Everything was going he way we
predicted before the match,'' said the Everton defender.
	   ``If we had been able to hold on to our lead for just five
minutes ... their fans would have been down, the French team would
have been down. We didn't pressure them enough,'' Bilic said.
	   ``I felt the way we played, they wouldn't be able to score all
night. They were tiring, they had two matches with extra time
behind them. But then we made a stupid mistake,'' he said.
	   On the first goal, Thuram robbed Croatian captain Zvonimir Boban
of the ball on the edge of the penalty area just before scoring.
	   Boban was later substituted, suffering from a muscle injury that
he took into the game. ``My leg was really hurting and I wasn't
ready to play tonight,'' said Boban, the AC Milan midfielder.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic said France in the end merited the
victory.
	   ``But I can't get away from the impression that we could have
achieved more,'' he said.
	   ``With a little bit more caution, we could have been the lucky
ones. At halftime, we thought the French were without strength. I
thought we would win.
	   ``We scored and then the worst thing in soccer happened _ we
conceded a goal in the same minute,'' Blazevic said.
	   ``I think we can be really proud of what we achieved in this
World Cup. But still I can't get rid of the impression that we
could have done more.''

World Cup: For France, the dream continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ A banner hanging from the bleachers
of the magnificent Stade de France begged ``Les Bleus'' to let the
nation dream on.
	   The French team was ever so obedient.
	   France beat Croatia 2-1 Wednesday night to reach the World Cup
final for the first time in its history, setting off wild
celebrations throughout the nation, including thousands marching
triumphantly toward, naturally, the Arc de Triomphe.
	   ``We played our hearts out and that made the difference,''
French coach Aime Jacquet said.
	   ``It is truly the most beautiful day in the history of French
sport,'' French President Jacques Chirac added.
	   Perhaps only until Sunday, when, at the same stadium, France
will try to lift the trophy in the competition invented by
Frenchman Jules Rimet when it meets four-time champion Brazil.
	   Croatia, disappointed for missing the final in its rookie run,
will play the Netherlands for third place Saturday.
	   The French victory did not come easy. France had to come back
against the clever Croatian team and played the last 20 minutes
with 10 men after the ejection of defender Laurent Blanc, who will
automatically miss the final.
	   With French forwards still struggling to find the target, it was
defender Lilian Thuram who fired France into the final by scoring
both goals, his first for the national team.
	   ``This is fabulous,'' Thuram said. ``To think I don't even score
in training. It's 200 percent luck. It's not that I am a hero
because I scored; to be a hero, that's for the final.''
	   His goals ended France's semifinal jinx on its fourth attempt
and allowed his team to become the first host nation in 20 years to
reach the final. No host has met the defending champion for the
title.
	   Chirac cheered with hands aloft while Croatian counterpart
Franjo Tudjman applauded his nation's stunning march. Croatia, in
its eighth year of existence, almost scored the biggest upset of
the tournament, even taking the lead before finally falling to
French flair.
	   ``If we had held the lead for five minutes, they were going
down,'' Slaven Bilic said. ``The players, the fans. They had played
two matches of 120 minutes each. They looked tired.''
	   The second half was not for the faint-hearted.
	   First, Croatia stunned the crowd 26 seconds into the second half
when Aljosa Asanovic split the French defense and Davor Suker
scored his fifth World Cup goal, slipping the ball under goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez.
	   One minute later, Thuram stole the ball from captain Zvonimir
Boban near the Croat penalty area, played a 1-2 with Youri
Djorkaeff and sent the ball past goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   In the 70th minute, Thuram was even bolder, surging up the left
and setting up a 1-2 with Thierry Henry. The ball seemed to go
straight to Robert Jarni, but Thuram won it back and then unleashed
a curling 20-yard shot that went wide of Ladic and into the corner
of the net.
	   As tempers flared after France's second goal, Blanc tugged at
Slaven Bilic's shirt and slammed the palm of his hand in his face.
Referee Jose Manuel Garcia sent the standout defender off.
	   ``The expulsion of Blanc was terrible,'' Jacquet said.
	   ``We knew that we would have difficulties, because Croatia is
difficult to parry. The goal we conceded was shocking, but it
produced a great response.''
	   Croatia, which had several opportunities to tie it late in the
match _ Barthez made a lunging save at the crossbar in the dying
seconds _ let the game slip out of its control.
	   ``We were not careful enough,'' said Croatian coach Miroslav
Blazevic. ``We scored and then the worst thing in soccer happened _
we conceded a goal in the same minute.''
	   ``This energized France and they deserved to win.''
	   Now, they get Brazil, the defending champion.
	   ``It will be a wonderful game,'' Jacquet said, ``a festival of
football.''

World Cup: Star-studded Brazil attack faces strong French defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's the final Michel Platini and the organizers
have been yearning for for six years.
	   Host France has made it to the World Cup final for the first
time ever and, waiting there, is defending champion and four-time
titlist Brazil.
	   The Brazilians, the most exciting team in the world, play as if
they have a divine right to a fifth title while the French want to
win it for the first time in front of their own fans.
	   One is sure to get their way.
	   On Sunday, before 80,000 spectactors at the gleaming Stade de
France, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Rivaldo, Denilson and Roberto Carlos will
attack probably the strongest defense in the entire 32-team
championship.
	   Except that the French back four will be a little weaker because
Laurent Blanc is missing.
	   The stylish and dependable Olympique Marseille defender is out
of Sunday's final because he was expelled from Wednesday's 2-1
semifinal win over Croatia for pushing Slaven Bilic in the face.
	   It's a big loss for the French because the Blanc-Marcel Desailly
partnership has protected goalkeeper Fabien Barthez so well he has
conceded only two goals in six games on the way to the final.
	   Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf likely will replace Blanc in the French
defense and face up to the formidable Brazilians who still haven't
really caught fire in the championship.
	   Although Ronaldo, Bebeto, Rivaldo and Cesar Sampaio have scored
13 goals among them, they have not been as bewildering as everyone
expected them to be.
	   Roberto Carlos has struggled to find the target with his
trademark long range free kicks and Denilson, the substitute who
tries to dance around defenders with his fancy footwork, has left
his teammates frustrated by holding onto the ball too long.
	   Perhaps this is the time for the Brazilians to show why they are
the world's best.
	   Mario Zagallo's men are odds on to win a fifth title. But there
have even been rumblings from within Brazilian soccer that they're
not playing the traditional way.
	   The critics say Brazil is sacrificing its flamboyant
fan-pleasing style of slick interpassing, long-range swerving shots
and mesmerising dribbles for a more practical European style of
closing down the opposition and relying on breaks from deep
positions.
	   If the Brazilians decide to attack the strong French defense,
the match could be a thrilling duel of different styles. If they
don't it could become a something closer to the dour 0-0 final
between Brazil and Italy four years ago which the Brazilians won
after a penalty shootout.
	   While the French are losing one of their key players, the
Brazilians welcome back one of theirs.
	   Cafu will return to the right side of the Brazilian defense in
place of the inexperienced Ze Carlos to add speed and guile to the
attack and stability to a back four which has looked shaky at
times.
	   Dunga and Cesar Sampaio look solid in midfield and will allow
the creative players to wreak havoc in the French penalty area
while at the same time take pressure off Junior Baiano and Aldair
in the Brazilian defense.
	   They will also do battle with the gifted French midfielders _
the hard working and efficient Didier Deschamps, smooth running and
ever-accurate Emmanuel Petit and one of the best playmakers in
world soccer, Zinedine Zidane.
	   Zidane holds the key to unlocking the Brazilians. The
strongly-built Juventus player will run at the heart of the defense
and open up spaces for his team-mates to shoot for goal.
	   Inter Milan's Youri Djorkaeff, a club colleague of Ronaldo,
teams up well with the midfield three to keep the flow of moves
going towards goal but that's where the French fall flat.
	   A French striker hasn't scored since the 2-1 victory over
Denmark in the group games two weeks ago. Blanc was the matchwinner
against Paraguay with the World Cup's first extra time ``Golden
Goal'' and rightback Lilian Thuram hit the two semifinal strikes
against Croatia.

Mexico grants citizenship to 200 Guatemalan refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHETUMAL, Mexico (AP) _ Scores of Guatemalan Indians who fled
their homeland during civil war were granted Mexican citizenship
Wednesday in a ceremony.
	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa presented
naturalization papers to 200 Guatemalans and immigration documents
to another 33 in Chetumal, a port city 710 miles (1,150 kilometers)
east of Mexico City.
	   About 36,000 Guatemalans who sought refuge in camps in Mexico
have returned to their country since peace accords were signed in
1996, Labastida said. Another 20,000 remain in Mexico and wish to
adopt Mexican citizenship, he said.
	   Of these, about half are children who were born in the refugee
camps in Mexico, he said.
	   The European Economic Community's representative in Mexico,
Jacques Lecomte, presented a check Wednesday for dlrs 780,000 to
help some of the refugees develop agriculture and forestation
projects.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Many Nigerians had hoped they would soon
witness the release of Moshood Abiola. Instead, they have taken to
the streets in anger over the death of the imprisoned opposition
leader, sparking riots that killed at least 19 people.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner and the
presumed winner of 1993 elections that were annulled by Nigeria's
junta, died on Tuesday. The death _ and the widespread suspicion on
the streets that Abiola had been killed _ sparked rioting in parts
of three southwestern cities that was not quieted until Wednesday
evening.
	   On Wednesday, Nigeria;s new military leader added to the
tumultuous situation by dissolving his Cabinet. However, Gen.
Abudulsalam Abubakar left untouched the country's Provisional
Ruling Council, the core of the junta that rules this oil-rich but
poverty-wracked nation.
	   He had inherited the Cabinet from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. who
died June 8 of a heart attack.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said.
	   He made no mention of his plans for the Cabinet, though he said
that returning Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Meanwhile, Abiola's supporters took to the streets of Lagos and
two other cities, setting piles of tires on fire, pelting cars with
stones and attacking the homes of junta officials. Police responded
with tear gas. All three cities were calm by Wednesday evening.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections later
annulled by the military leadership, had been in prison since 1994.
He died Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with
U.S. diplomats who were appealing for his freedom. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group, where a growing number of people are blaming the
military for his death. The government said Abiola died of a heart
attack.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Authorities said at least 12 people were killed in overnight
demonstrations in Lagos. Some of the violence was ethnic-based,
with Yorubas from Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas. Hausas and
Fulanis, both from the north, make up a majority in the military
and the junta.
	   Riots also were reported in Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta, about
45 miles (70 kilometers) north of Lagos. At least two demonstrators
were killed, local media reports said, though the circumstances
were not immediately clear. State radio said police had restored
calm but a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed.
	   Protests in the southwestern university town of Ibadan also were
calmed down, though at least five people were killed, according to
local media reports. No further details were available.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.
	   The U.S. State Department said there was no reason to believe
that Abiola's death was from anything other than natural causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``I suspect that he was poisoned, that he was murdered,'' his
daughter Hafsat said in an interview.
	   Abubakar said in his speech that an autopsy would be conducted
in cooperation with the Abiola family, and that pathologists were
being flown in from the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Thursday
after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto failed to provide
details on the implementation of expected tax cuts. Tokyo share
prices declined.
	   The dollar bought 139.59 yen in early trading, up 0.55 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
139.27 yen overnight.
	   Traders said they reacted warily to Prime Minister Hashimoto's
announcement late Wednesday of plans to carry out permanent tax
reduction amid uncertainty over the size of the tax relief and how
it will be funded.
	   ``The market is cautious because he failed to mention specifics,
including the size of the cuts and how they would be financed,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   Hashimoto's remarks came just days after he appeared to embrace
a permanent tax cut, then backed away by denying having ever made
such a pledge.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average lost 55.05 points, or 0.33 percent, to 16,475.92
points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, it rose
114.69 points, or 0.70 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.77 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,266.63. The
TOPIX closed up 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond dipped to 1.360 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.365
percent, driving its price up to 110.73 yen from 110.70 yen.

San Fermin: Four centuries old and as frantic as ever

	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Some runners exchanged bear hugs and
kisses, others kept to themselves, but when the stampeding bulls
bore down on them, everyone ran for their lives.
	   Minutes later, the runners headed for the bars to celebrate the
first of nine days of bull runs that have made Pamplona's San
Fermin Festival a magnet for the daring and foolhardy.
	   On Wednesday, an estimated 3,000 people tested their speed and
bravery to run with six bulls along the 850-meter (935-yard) course
through the cobblestone streets to the town's bullring.
	   The morning race was virtually incident free and finished in
under three minutes.
	   ``Not the greatest run I've ever done but certainly good,'' said
Joe Distler, a 55-year-old literature teacher from Brooklyn, New
York, who claimed not to have missed a San Fermin since 1967.
	   Two people were treated in hospital for light bruises and
released, news reports said.
	   Experienced runners keep the bulls behind them by holding a
rolled up newspaper in the animals' field of vision.
	   The only real scare came where some 50 people were momentarily
trapped in a pileup at the entrance to the bull ring where the run
concludes.
	   In the melee, one of the steers used to try to keep the bulls in
a pack scrambled over the mound of humanity to make its way into
the ring.
	   Each year tens of thousands of people attend one of Europe's
most popular festivals. The event was made world famous by Ernest
Hemingway's 1927 novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''
	   And every morning during the festival, hoards of people join 16
bulls and steers as they race through the town's cobbled streets to
the bullring.
	   The bulls used in the run are killed by matadors in the
afternoon bullfight, another of the major attractions of the
festival which began Monday.
	   In the first run Tuesday, one Spaniard was gored in the groin
and another was injured when he was trampled by crowds.
	   A total of 13 people have died at San Fermin since Spanish
officials began keeping records in 1924. The last fatality was a
22-year-old American in 1995.
	   Most foreigners would never have heard of San Fermin had it not
been for Hemingway.
	   The best rooms at the Hotel La Perla, where the author stayed on
several of his nine visits to San Fermin, triple in price during
the festival, running 40,000 pesetas (dlrs 270) a night.
	   Hemingway wrote about the run, but was just as impressed by the
reveling.
	   ``All the carnivals that I have ever seen paled in comparison,''
he wrote in a 1923 dispatch for the Toronto Star.
	   Over the last decade, Australians and New Zealanders have taken
to jumping off the top of a fountain in the town center. Their
falls are broken by a cushion of outstretched arms below.
	   ``If they want to pretend they can fly that's their business,''
said Jose Luis Perez, a 56-year-old local taxi driver, ``as long as
they are here just to have fun.''

Amid labor strife and market slump, Russia awaits IMF loan

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian officials say they are close to striking a
deal with the International Monetary Fund on a loan package aimed
at reviving the country's troubled economy.
	   Russian officials on Tuesday announced agreement with the IMF on
major issues. Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to
international lenders, said he hoped to iron out the rest of the
key issues Thursday for a loan of dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15
billion.
	   Russia's economy has been in a tailspin for much of this year
after showing its first signs of growth since well before the
Soviet collapse. The government, desperately in need of cash, has
been negotiating with the IMF for a bailout loan.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said it was encouraged
by the discussions.
	   ``The IMF and Mr. Chubais announced yesterday an agreement in
principle on certain steps that they're going to take and we think
they need to be rapidly implemented,'' White House press secretary
Mike McCurry said.
	   In a gloomy prologue to the expected loan package, labor unrest
in Russia spread Wednesday and the stock market slid nearly 3
percent.
	   Thousands of unpaid defense workers demonstrated in Moscow, St.
Petersburg and other cities, while coal miners halted traffic on
the Trans-Siberian railway for the sixth straight day.
	   Many economists say the IMF loan is essential to restore
confidence to Russia's faltering markets and halt the exodus of
foreign investors.

Digital mapping may revamp tax, real estate law in West Virginia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICKI SMITH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MORGANTOWN, West Virginia (AP) _ Got a boundary dispute with a
neighbor or a spat with the tax man?
	   Log on to the Internet and find out who's right. A virtual
flyover will show the nearest coal seam or mineral deposit and who
can lay claim to it.
	   It may sound farfetched, but it's only a few years from reality.
	   The map of the future is already online at West Virginia
University's Geographic Information System Technical Center.
	   Gov. Cecil Underwood dedicated the technical center last month,
praising it as the eventual solution to 40 years of controversy
about how coal and other natural resources in this southeastern
U.S. state are mapped and taxed.
	   ``We're rapidly coming to the place where maps can serve all
purposes. And the nice thing about this one is we don't have to
learn how to fold it,'' Underwood said.
	   Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, is a dlrs 10 billion
industry in the United States, with growing use by the private and
public sector, Underwood said.
	   West Virginia is one of three states converting all of its old,
printed maps to digital, online versions. Florida and Ohio are the
others.
	   Trevor Harris, chairman of the university's Department of
Geology and Geography, believes West Virginia's task is the most
daunting because of the contour of the land. There are extreme
changes in elevation and mountains are close to one another.
Florida, by contrast, is largely flat with a clearly defined
coastline, he said.
	   The digital maps are far more accurate then their predecessors,
making them valuable to both the private and public sectors, Harris
said. They also will help the state Department of Tax and Revenue
develop more detailed tax maps.
	   ``Traditionally, we depended on verbal descriptions: Go to this
nearest tree, find this big stone and follow the stream,'' Harris
said. ``Now those trees and stones are gone.''
	   The U.S. Geological Survey drills into the ground for samples
and help plot the location of minerals, Harris said. Their
findings, including the thickness and quality of deposits, are
overlaid onto landscapes and maps that show elevations and all
other aspects of the terrain. The end result is a
three-dimensional, moving map.
	   The maps also will incorporate economic and census data.
	   They will change the state tax system because ``people will be
able to see the area they're responsible for and what their tax
rate is based on,'' Harris said.
	   And the Internet makes them accessible to almost everyone.
	   ``No longer will data sit in one room or in one computer,'' he
said.
	   Some private companies are already taking advantage of the
center, with one pipeline firm seeking advice on how to minimize
the visibility of its line to nearby communities.
	   Paper maps from the 1960s and 1970s are replete with mistakes,
so technical center staff also rely on satellite images, Harris
said.
	   By 2000, complete GIS data will be available for 33 West
Virginia counties, and over the next decade, tax officials can
coordinate that information with their records, he said.
	   The technical center was created under the administration of
former Gov. Gaston Caperton in 1995 and is funded with nearly dlrs
3 million in state money through 2000. The university and the
federal government also pay for the project.

Nightly riots the norm as Northern Ireland bears sectarian showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be led after 1000 GMT, following Orange meeting with
Blair &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of the Orange Order say
violence is likely to get worse unless the government lets a march
go through a hostile Catholic neighborhood. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair says there will be no change of heart, despite the
disruption caused by supporters of the Protestant marchers.
	   Nonetheless, a delegation from the Orange Order said it would be
in London Thursday to meet with Blair.
	   Northern Ireland endured a fourth night of violence with police
coming under gunfire and bomb attacks at a Protestant housing area
in Newtownabbey, 5 miles (8 kilometers) north of Belfast. No
injuries were reported and police arrested one man.
	   Police said they seized gasoline bombs in Carrickfergus, 12
miles (20 kilometers) northeast of Belfast, and bottles of
concentrated nitric acid in Glarryford, 30 miles (50 kilometers)
northwest of Belfast. Police said they believed the acid was
intended to be used against them.
	   As of midday Wednesday, police reported a dozen shootings, two
dozen grenade blasts, 73 homes of Catholics or police officers
vandalized, 93 businesses and schools damaged by fire, 136 vehicles
stolen and burned and another 279 damaged, 44 officers and an
unknown number of rioters wounded.
	   ``I think we are moving into a very, very dangerous situation
whereby we could even come to the stage of a complete confrontation
between the Orange and the army and police,'' David Jones, a
spokesman for the Orange Order in Portadown, said Wednesday.
	   ``That is a situation no one wants to see but the closer we come
to the weekend and the 12th of July makes it a lot more difficult.
That's why Tony Blair needs to be aware the clock is ticking and it
is ticking fast and he doesn't have much time left.''
	   The 12th of July, the anniversary of the Protestant King
William's victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690, is one of the most volatile and contentious
dates in Northern Ireland. Across the province, members of the
Orange Order march with fife and drum _ marches which many
Catholics regard as swaggering demonstrations of Protestant
dominance.
	   Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell said Wednesday that there was
no possibility that the prime minister would reverse the decision
of Northern Ireland's Parades Commission. It barred the Portadown
Orangemen from marching on the Garvaghy Road, which is flanked by
Catholic neighborhoods.
	   Orange leaders say they have a right to follow the same route
they have used since 1807, and they have refused to meet with the
leader of the Garvaghy Road protesters, a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner.
	   The numbers of Orangemen and supporters at the Anglican church
at Drumcree, where the march was stopped Sunday, had grown to
several thousand.
	   ``A little bit of tolerance could have been shown here and that
parade could have gone down in 10 minutes and this would have all
been over by now,'' said Connie Tedford, whose husband is among the
marchers. She joined about a hundred women and children in a
demonstration in Portadown Wednesday, before walking to the church.
	   Catholics opposed to Protestant marches along south Belfast's
Ormeau Road took the Parades Commission to court Wednesday to
challenge its decision permitting a small Orange parade next
Monday.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, met
Wednesday with British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, and
said he was assured that ``they will not force a march down
Garvaghy Road,'' as happened in 1996 after four nights of
Protestant mayhem.

Head-contact microphone may save lives in military, civilian use
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY194 &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL KACZOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY BEACH, Florida (AP) _ When Navy commandos needed a
waterproof microphone during the Gulf War, they turned to a
research engineer they call ``Q.''
	   Until then, SEAL boat drivers improvised by putting condoms over
the plastic mike booms on their aviator-style helmets. It was a
desperate effort to keep water from ruining the mikes and, in turn,
costing lives.
	   ``You get into an environment where you've got people shooting
at you and you cannot communicate. You can get in trouble,'' Frank
Downs said.
	   Downs, 45, who works at the Navy's Coastal Systems Station near
this Florida Panhandle resort city, lived up to his nickname taken
from the fictional James Bond character ``Q,'' who outfitted
British Agent 007 with exotic spy gadgets.
	   Not only did Downs adapt an underwater microphone he had
developed for Navy divers to fit the SEALs' helmets, but he took
the invention a step beyond after the war.
	   The result is a hands-free, head-contact microphone that masks
wind and background noise in addition to being waterproof. A SEAL
in a speeding boat with engines roaring simply talks through his
hat and is heard clearly.
	   Looking something like a small tile _ an eighth-inch (3
millimeter) thick and an inch (2.5-centimeter) on each side _ the
white, epoxy-covered microphone rests against the user's forehead,
inside a helmet or a hat.
	   The microphone is plugged into a radio, often worn on the user's
belt. As the user speaks, the microphone picks up the sound _ even
as low as a whisper _ as it travels through the skull and relays
it.
	   For listening, the user relies on standard earphones.
	   The head mike is available only in small numbers for the SEALs,
Marine Corps ``urban warriors'' and the Army's Special Forces.
Anticipated mass production, however, would lead to a wide variety
of other military and civilian applications.
	   It already has caught the interest of fire chiefs searching for
just such an invention after the deaths of three Pittsburgh
firefighters in 1995. They had two radios but never called for help
when trapped in a burning building.
	   ``If that device had existed back then, it may have helped,''
said Battalion Chief Arthur George of the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau,
although no one knows for sure.
	   The head mike shows promise for saving lives because of its
no-hands operation and ability to block noise from pump motors,
chain saws and other fire equipment, George said.
	   ``Up to this point, regardless of the device, regardless of the
radios, there was always a problem hearing the radios and
understanding what was being said,'' he asserted.
	   The Navy has licensed the head mike to Unconventional Concepts
Inc., an engineering and consulting firm in nearby Fort Walton
Beach. UCI is negotiating with potential manufacturers and hopes to
have it in production by the end of the year, according to Michael
Hopmeier, the company's chief of innovative and unconventional
concepts.
	   The price should be dlrs 100 to dlrs 200, well within the means
of fire departments, motorcyclists, construction workers and others
in situations ``where verbal communication is both important and
problematic,'' Hopmeier said.
	   Downs recently demonstrated the mike at an international
conference of fire chiefs in San Diego. First, a firefighter in
full gear, including a face mask, spoke into a conventional
microphone next to a noisy pumper.
	   ``We heard nothing, just noise,'' Downs said.
	   Then the firefighter used the head mike. ``He came across
crystal clear, so much so that ... the fire chiefs gave us an
overwhelming ovation.''
	   The SEALs also applauded, at least figuratively, when Downs sent
them five helmets with waterproof boom mikes during Operation
Desert Storm. The Florida State University physics graduate had
estimated he could do the job for dlrs 9,000 in two months.
	   ``They said, `We want it in two weeks,''' Downs recalled. ``I
said, `Oooh-kaay, we can do that.' And we did it.''
	   Downs and his associates worked around the clock. Two F-15 Eagle
fighters from nearby Tyndall Air Force Base were at their disposal
to fetch parts and run errands, but the jets weren't needed.
	   Downs, who also has developed exotic diving gear and is working
on a gun that can shoot around corners, still doesn't know exactly
what the SEALs' mission was.
	   ``If they felt it was important to tell me, they'd tell me,'' he
said.
	   The waterproof boom mike still had a problem with background
noise. The SEALs let Downs use dlrs 1,000 left from that project to
look for a solution.
	   ``I moved it around and found out that this thing picks up sound
from the head,'' he said. ``It resonates through your sinus
cavity.''
	   Moving the microphone to the forehead still failed to cure the
noise problem. Downs won't say how he eventually solved the problem
except that it was a combination of materials and design.
	   ``I just resorted to some analysis, looking at the physics of

materials.''
	   Just as importantly, he added, it was done with only dlrs 1,000
_ money left over from Operation Desert Storm.

Traces of industrial chemicals found in whales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: `IJmuiden' in 2nd graf is cq. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Traces of two kinds of industrial chemicals
appear in sperm whales, indicating the substances have penetrated
deep in the Atlantic Ocean, Dutch researchers report.
	   The concentrations were probably too low to harm the animals,
said environmental chemist Jacob de Boer of the DLO-Netherlands
Institute for Fisheries Research in IJmuiden, Netherlands. But if
the pollution continues, ``an environmental problem may be on its
way,'' he and colleagues write in the July 2 issue of the journal
Nature.
	   They tested the blubber and liver of sperm whales stranded on
the Dutch coast, and found traces of polybrominated biphenyls and
polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The substances are used as flame
retardants in electronic equipment and other products. At high
levels, they might interfere with reproduction in sea animals and
promote the cancer-causing potential of other chemicals, de Boer
said.
	   The whales apparently picked up the substances while feeding
deep in the Atlantic, the researchers said. They generally stay
between the latitudes of Spain and Iceland, de Boer said.

 &UR; Substance hinders formation of Alzheimer-related brain deposits in
rats
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a study of rats that hints at a possible
therapy for Alzheimer's disease, an experimental substance hindered
the formation of brain protein deposits implicated in the disorder.
	   The brains of Alzheimer's patients show many of these amyloid
beta-protein deposits. Scientists aren't sure whether the deposits
or the fibers that form them cause the disease, but there is
evidence that they do. So researchers have long looked for
substances that will inhibit their formation.
	   The new work is reported in the July issue of the journal Nature
Medicine by Claudo Soto and colleagues at the New York University
Medical Center. They injected amyloid beta-protein into the brains
of rats along with a man-made substance called iA-beta-5.
	   In these rats, the injected amyloid beta-protein failed to form
fibers. Some non-fibrous brain deposits appeared, but they were
only about half as big as the deposits found in rats that got
injections of the amyloid beta-protein alone. In later studies,
larger doses of the inhibiting agent prevented any deposits from
forming, Soto said.
	   Researchers have developed a different form of their inhibitor
that can enter the brain from the bloodstream, a key ability for
any therapeutic use. Its effects are being tested now, Soto said.
	   Experts said the approach should be tested in mice that develop
the brain deposits spontaneously, a better simulation of
Alzheimer's. Soto said such studies have begun.

 &UR; Typical bike seats can cause impotence, experts say
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Riding a typical bike seat can lead to
impotence, researchers say.
	   As that word gets out, sales of nontypical bike seats have been
increasing.
	   Sitting on an ordinary narrow, pointed seat can crush an artery
that controls the ability of the penis to fill with blood, said
researcher Pedram Salimpour of Boston University School of
Medicine.
	   ``When you sit on a bicycle seat, you are sitting on the
artery,'' Salimpour said. ``God did not mean for you to sit on a
bicycle seat.''
	   And although impotence is not common, his research shows that
impotence happens more often to cyclists than to runners, Salimpour
said.
	   Researchers examined cyclists who suffer from impotence and
believe they know how it happens. When someone sits on a narrow
seat, too much weight is borne by the perineum, the area between
the anus and the scrotum in which the cavernosal artery is located,
Salimpour said. The researchers checked this by examining patients
as they sat on bike seats.
	   ``Imagine a straw. Flatten it and let it go back. Eventually you
are going to flatten it, and it is not going to bounce back,''
Salimpour said.
	   To get an idea how common impotence is among cyclists,
researchers analyzed questionnaires sent to 1,025 members of
running or cycling clubs in the Boston area. The runners and
cyclists were about evenly divided in number and were in about the
same physical condition _ with the exception of the incidence of
impotence, Salimpour said. Impotence was defined as an inability to
develop or maintain an erection for intercourse in the past six
months.
	   Of the runners, only 1.1 percent reported impotence, compared
with 4.2 percent of the cyclists, Salimpour said. ``If anything,
these numbers are low,'' he said. ``These people are self-reporting
impotence. That is not something you like to report.''
	   Many victims can be treated, Salimpour said. Viagra, the new
anti-impotence pill, helps some; injections of older drugs into the
penis can help others, and still others can benefit from a bypass
operation that routes blood around the damaged artery, he said.
	   But the problem can be avoided through the use of newer bike
seats with oval gaps, which look something like a toilet seat,
Salimpour said.

Johnson focusing on winning races, not setting world records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Michael Johnson just wants to win his races.
Not necessarily breaking the world record. Not even on the ''world
record track'', Oslo's Bislett Stadium.
	   ``My goal is to win the race, and that's my goal for the season,
to win all the races I'm participating in,'' the American sprint
star said.
	   ``I don't focus on world records, and I didn't focus on the
world record in the 200 meters,'' added Johnson, whose world record
in that distance is 19.32, set in August 1996 during the Atlanta
Olympics.
	   Going into Thursday's race at the Bislett Games, Johnson only
has the 11th fastest time of the year, a 20.31 at Arlington in his
native Texas early May.
	   Ato Boldon, last year's 200-meter world champion from Trinidad,
is fastest this year (19.88) with 100-meter world champ Maurice
Greene of the United States second (20.03). Boldon will be
Johnson's chief rival at Bislett Stadium. Greene will run the 100.
	   Johnson knows what an appreciate crowd can do for athletes,
especially at Bislett Stadium, where 51 world records have been set
since 1924.
	   ``It's a great crowd and one of the best,'' he said. ``A big
reason for the great performances here is that there is so much
energy in the stadium.
	   ``It's important for us athletes to have that kind of
environment. I'm very appreciative of the fans who come to watch us
compete and cheer us home. I don't think I would run as fast as I
do without the fans in the stands.''
	   Sergei Bubka, the only man to win six consecutive world
championship gold medals, can't remember exactly the last time he
competed at the Bislett Games. But he remembers that the famed
wooden stadium in downtown Oslo is not so good for his event.
	   ``I've always had problems here,'' Bubka said. ``I just came
back from the stadium (for practice). The wind never seems to be
stable here. It's not good for pole vaulting.''
	   Bubka, 34, competing for the first time in a big meet this
season, is hoping for perfect weather Thursday.
	   ``If it's sunshine like today and good tail wind ... well, then
we have the most important things for good results tomorrow.
	   Soccer's World Cup in France forced some major European track
organizers to switch their traditional dates in June to a later
date in the summer and ``it's only now that the season begins,''
said Bubka, who set his outdoor world record of 6.14 meters at
Sestriere, Italy, in 1994.
	   ``I still think it's possible to make 6.10, 6.15,'' he said.
``Now there are more and more pole vaulters going over six meters,
so they don't have this psychological pressure, and I hope to see
more people over six meters.
	   ``Still there is six meters and 6.15 are two different levels''
added Bubka, who's cleared at least six meters an unprecedented 43
times in his career.
	   ``When I started pole vaulting, it was just for me and I enjoyed
it, but after perestroika and the other changes, it started really
being my job''
	   Bubka's name is missing on the long list of world records set at
Bislett Stadium.
	   The Ukrainian legend _ he has broken more world records (17
outdoors and 18 indoors) than any other track and field athlete in
history _ doesn't even have the Bislett Stadium record.
	   Thaat mark (5.90 meters) was set by Rodion Gataullin in 1989 and
since then equalled by another Russian, Maxim Tarasov, and Okkert
Brits of South Africa.
	   Jeff Hartwig of the United States and Dimitry Markov of Belarus
have both cleared six meters, tops this season. Jean Galfione of
France, who won the 1996 Olympic gold medal after Bubka withdrew
injured from qualifying round in Atlanta, cleared 5.97 last month.
	   The Bislett Games is the first meet of the inaugural edition of
the Golden League, which also counts toward the established Grand
Prix competition. The Golden League offers dlrs one million for
anyone who can win at all six meets plus the final.
	   American sprint star Marion Jones will be the favorite in the
women's 100. She recorded the five fastest times of the year this
season, including 10.71 seconds in Chengdu, China, in May and the
U.S. Championships in New Orleans last month.
	   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who set the 51st world record at
Bislett last year in the 10,000 meters, will enter the 3,000. He's
the man in form, having set world records in both the 5,000 and
10,000 last month.

Japan's foreign minister welcomes British warhead cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday
applauded Britain's decision to reduce its nuclear warhead arsenal,
calling it ``a courageous action.''
	   ``We hope the British decision will encourage other countries
with nuclear capabilities to accelerate disarmament,'' Obuchi said
in a statement.
	   ``This is a courageous action that we welcome from our hearts,''
he said.
	   The British government announced Wednesday that it will slash
the number of operationally available nuclear warheads on its
Trident submarines by one-third to 200 as part of a major defense
review.
	   Japan, the only country in the world to suffer a nuclear attack,
recently proposed an international forum on preventing nuclear arms
proliferation in the wake of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.

Dollar rises in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
morning after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto failed to
provide details on the implementation of expected tax cuts. Tokyo
share prices declined moderately.
	   The dollar bought 139.87 yen in late morning, up 0.83 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
139.27 yen overnight.
	   Traders said they reacted warily to Prime Minister Hashimoto's
announcement late Wednesday of plans to carry out permanent tax
reduction amid uncertainty over the size of the tax relief and how
it will be funded.
	   ``The market is cautious because he failed to mention specifics,
including the size of the cuts and how they would be financed,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   Hashimoto's remarks came just days after he appeared to embrace
a permanent tax cut, then backed away by denying having ever made
such a pledge.
	   Japan's major trading partners, including the United States,
have urged Japan to implement permanent tax cuts as part of steps
to stimulate the country's sagging economy and thus help boost more
imports, especially from other ailing Asian economies.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks fell on profit-taking as
investors were disappointed over the lack of details in Hashimoto's
announcement on tax reform.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 140.71 points,
or 0.85 percent, to 16,390.26 points at the end of the morning
session. On Wednesday, the Nikkei closed up 114.69 points, or 0.70
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 8.31 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,260,09. The
TOPIX closed up 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.335 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.360 percent, driving its price up to 110.91 yen from 110.70 yen.

World Cup: Thuram unlikely goal hero for France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Lilian Thuram has long been great at
the things he does well. Now, the defender is truly exceptional at
the things he does badly, leading France to the World Cup final
with two extraordinary goals.
	   France came from behind to beat Croatia 2-1 Wednesday night and
with the strikeforce sputtering as usual, the defense came to the
aid in this moment of dire need.
	   Thuram had a score to settle with Croatian coach Miroslav
Blazevic, but no one could have thought he would do it with two
goals. Least of all, the Parma defender himself.
	   ``This is fabulous. I don't even score during training,'' he
said after France qualified for its first World Cup final. On
Sunday, it plays Brazil at the Stade de France.
	   ``I cannot really start to realize what I did,'' the 26-year-old
said after scoring his first goals for France.
	   Less than a minute after Croatia opened the score in the 46th
minute, Thuram stole the ball from captain Zvonimir Boban near the
Croat penalty area, kept the ball in the team and received a deep
pass that he slotted past goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
	   In the 70th minute, the Parma defender surged up the left and
set up a one-two with Thierry Henry, that seemed to go straight to
Robert Jarni. But Thuram was not to be denied, winning back the
ball and then unleashing a curling 20-meter shot that went wide of
Ladic.
	   ``How to explain: I had 200 percent luck to be in that goal
area. Truly exceptional. Normally I just black out. This time, I
had the luck to score,'' he said.
	   Thuram also proved Blazevic wrong. The coach had predicted that
the surging runs from the right back would expose the French
defense too much and be the weak spot of Les Bleus.
	   Thuram is already versatile enough in defense. In Italy's Serie
A, he plays in the center of defense for Parma, while he is on the
right side for France.
	   Don't get carried away though, he warned.
	   ``It's not because I scored twice that I'm a hero. To be a hero,
that's more for the final,'' he said.

Official: Malaysian banks need to improve efficiency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has to restructure its
financial sector to make banks more competitive and efficient, a
senior finance ministry official said Thursday.
	   ``Without painful (financial sector) reforms, we will not be
able to overcome this current economic crisis,'' said Deputy
Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar.
	   Affifuddin's comments in a speech were a rare official
acknowledgement of the need to improve the domestic financial
industry.
	   While independent analysts have said the shaky financial sector
was responsible for the Malaysian currency's sharp decline,
government leaders have accused Western investors of orchestrating
speculative attacks on the ringgit for quick profit.
	   ``In the face of these challenges, both external as well as
internal, it is also important that domestic banks undergo various
forms of restructuring to enhance their efficiency and
competitiveness,'' Affifuddin said.
	   Many Malaysian banks, which once lent liberally to the real
estate companies, are worried that many of these loans will never
be repaid and are refusing to extend new loans.
	   The Malaysian ringgit has lost nearly 40 percent of its value
against the dollar in one year. The economy shrank 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998, compared to a 6.9 percent growth in the
previous year.
