<HEADLINE> New ICC Leader Warns Against Protectionism in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The new president of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has called on governments
to resist protectionist pressures generated by the current harsh
economic climate in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on taking over the ICC presidency on January 1
from Helmut Maucher, chairman of the Swiss Nestle SA, Adnan Kassar
said protectionism was one of the biggest dangers facing the world
economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The lesson of history is that such tendencies must not only be
resisted but that when they appear, governments should strive with
renewed vigor to open markets and further strengthen the
rules-based multilateral trading system," said the chief of the
world's top business grouping.
</P>
<P>
Kassar, a prominent Lebanese banker, said that liberalization
of international trade and investment was the surest way to secure
economic growth, more jobs and prosperity for all nations.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that further progress in freeing up markets would
create business confidence, the ICC chief said that such a policy
would go a long way towards "restoring growth and stability."
</P>
<P>
Kassar said that one of the main objectives of his two-year
presidency would be to mobilize the worldwide influence of the ICC
to ensure that developing countries were not left on the margins
of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based ICC consists of 63 national committees and over
7,000 member companies and business associations in more than 130
countries throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> UK's Prisoner Suicides at Record Levels in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 83 prisoners in
Britain took their own lives in 1998, the highest number in a
single year, Prison Service officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Prison Service Richard Tilt said he was
"greatly concerned" about the 22 percent rise, comparing with 68
suicides in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new figures show that for every 100,000 people held in
jail, there were 127 suicides last year.
</P>
<P>
"I am greatly concerned by the numbers of self-inflicted deaths
in prisons over the past 12 months," Tilt said.
</P>
<P>
"This is in part a consequence of a large increase in the
prison population in England and Wales," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tilt said he hoped a report into prison suicides due to be
published shortly would help staff build on existing work to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
The Howard League prison campaign group, publishing its own
report on prison suicides, said two-thirds of the people who took
their own life in jail last year had not been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
It also said that nine were aged under 18, including one
16-year-old and three were women.
</P>
<P>
Their report suggested that 11 percent of those who committed
suicide were black or Asian.
</P>
<P>
League director Frances Crook said, "The very fact that 83
people have felt so distressed and isolated that they have taken
their own life is an indictment on the whole penal system."
</P>
<P>
Based on figures for 1995, the Prison Service said England and
Wales came midway on a table comparing suicide rates in other
European countries, headed by Scotland with 284 deaths per 100,000
inmates, with Greece at the bottom with 57.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israel for New Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday condemned Israel for its
plan to construct a new Jewish settlement in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said Israel's plan, together with its attacks on eastern
Lebanon, is a reflection of the expansionist and aggressive policy
pursued by its government.
</P>
<P>
The plan also demonstrated that the peace-seeking claim by
Israel is nothing but a gesture, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Israeli move will undoubtedly disturb the
security and stability of the region and heighten tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Asefi called on all international organizations to take action
against "the blatant violation of the international law and
agreements by the Israeli regime."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also appealed to the international bodies to
prevent Israelis from continuing such inhuman acts.

<HEADLINE> Blair Spokesman Denies Internal Rift in Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government denied
rifts in the cabinet Monday as a key aide to Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said there was
no division between Blair and Brown over the abrupt departure of
the chancellor's controversial press spokesman Charlie Whelan.
</P>
<P>
Whelan had been widely blamed for leaking information about
Blair's close political friend Peter Mandelson, who was forced to
resign last month after failing to disclose a large loan from
another minister.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said at a news briefing that Whelan "has
become the focus of excessive media attention and that is not a
good position to be in."
</P>
<P>
He denied any problem between Brown and Blair, saying "Gordon
and the prime minister have probably got the closest working
relationship of any chancellor and prime minister that any of us
have ever known."
</P>
<P>
Whelan was the third political casualty in a damaging row over
the financial affairs of Mandelson, Blair's closest political
friend and the architect of his transformation of the Labor party
into a business-friendly centrist party.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson resigned on December 23 after he admitted he had
taken a secret loan of 373,000 pounds (610,000 U.S. dollars) from
Geoffrey Robinson, a wealthy Labor MP, to buy a luxury house in
west London.

NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Monday accepted resignations by Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou and Education and Culture Minister Lykourgos
Kappas.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers rendered their resignations Monday after the
Socialist Edek Party on Saturday decided to leave the government
in protest against Clerides' earlier decision not to deploy the
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Omirou told the press that "political credibility, ethos and
honesty made us take this decision".
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government ordered the missiles in January 1997 in a
bid to bolster the island's defense and thus triggered threats by
Turkey to launch preemptive strike against the missiles if they
were deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister described the decision as "a national
humiliation" and "a blow to the sovereignty of the state".
</P>
<P>
Omirou, first vice-president of the Socialist Edek Party, and
Lykourgos Kappas, a senior party member, served in the government
since Clerides was re-elected for a second five-year term in
February 1998.

BAGHDAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will never accept any

League in accordance with its charter and norms, said Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf was commenting on a five-way meeting by the foreign

It is reported that the meeting, which started in the Egyptian

Arab countries had planned to hold a foreign ministers meeting
to discuss a Yemeni call for an emergency Arab summit on the Iraqi
issue after the December 16-19 U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the planned meeting was put off due to objections

At the meeting, RCC Vice Chairman and Commander of the Northern

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes Early Elections Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 4 (Xinhua) - The Israeli parliament Monday
voted overwhelmingly to ratify the final two readings of a bill
calling for the dissolution of the parliament and holding early
elections.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by a large majority of over 80 yes votes
both in its second and third readings. And 85 members of the
120-seat parliament voted for the bill in its last reading, 27
voted against and one abstained. The rest did not show up.
</P>
<P>
The final approval of the bill was a foregone solution since
the coalition has decided to back it after Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu failed last month to secure a broad support
for his peace policy with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed in its first reading by a vote of 81-30 on
December 21. Netanyahu and other coalition members voted for it
on that session.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Inflation Likely to Fall Rapidly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation was expected
to fall rapidly in the first half of this year, pushing interest
rates substantially lower in the last six months of the year,
according to a report released by Greece's National Economy
Ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hard drachma policy, which was necessary to contain
inflation below 2.0 percent by the end of 1999, would continue in
the next two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The drachma's rate against the euro was expected to stabilize
around its central parity of 353.109 drachmas per euro by 2000
when inflation was expected to fall 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greece is now the only member of the 15-nation bloc wanting to
be part of the single currency but unable to meet fiscal
standards.
</P>
<P>
EU single currency criteria set an inflation ceiling based on
the top-performing countries, expected to be about 2.5 percent
next year. Greece has taken a number of measures in an attempt to
cut its inflation, which currently stands at around 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greece's monetary policy would also focus on combating
inflation while this year's incomes policy, both in the public and
the private sectors, would remain strict for an expected real
average wage increase of 1.5 percent in 1998 and 1.6 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate was forecast at 10.1 percent in 1998 from
10.3 percent in 1997, falling to 9.8 percent in 1999 and 9.5
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the country was
forecast at 3.8 percent in 1998, 3.7 percent in 1999 and 3.9
percent in 2000.

<HEADLINE> \n\rTanzania to Reform Major Firms Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to take drastic
reform steps this year by privatizing a series of crucial companies.
</P>
<P>
Divestiture of railways, electricity, telecommunications, water, banks,
ports, airports companies and marine firms has been designated in the
Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) 1999 action plan, Daily Mail
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, quoted former PSRC executive chairman, George Mbowe, as
saying that the phase to touch the sensitive divestiture of infrastructure
and utility companies will not be easy because efficient, modern private
commercial operation and larger and complex investments are required.
</P>
<P>
Mbowe, who retired last week, explained that each of the major
companies has a redundant work force of more than 4,000 employees, large
conglomerate operations and a number of big investments.
</P>
<P>
PSRC was set up in 1993 to supervise and co-ordinate divestiture of the
country's parastatal sector. It listed 395 firms for privatization.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1998, PSRC has succeeded in divesting 252 public firms,
more than 60 percent of those slated for the privatization exercise. Some
52 of the entities were privatized during the 1997/98 fiscal year between
July 1997 and June 1998, Mbowe said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that among the 252 firms, 112 were sold out, 23
were leased and 50 liquidated.
</P>
<P>
According to the action plan, Tanzania Telecommunications Company
Limited (TTCL) joint venture partner will be in place by August this year.
</P>
<P>
Bids submission and evaluation for Tanzania Electric Supply Company
Limited (TANESCO) will start by the end of this year and be completed by
early 2000, the action plan said.
</P>
<P>
 It said the National Shipping Agencies Co Ltd. (NASACO) is being
abolished with the formation of five new shipping agency companies,
which will be subsequently divested.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Central Freight Bureau will have its role changed to be more
of a regulator, thereby relinquishing its monopoly in shipping space and
freight setting, the plan said.
</P>
<P>
Signing of the memorandum of understanding for the takeover of Dar es
Salaam Water and Sanitation Authority (DAWASA) is set for April, and four
foreign companies have submitted bids to run DAWASA, two from Britain and
the others from France.
</P>
<P>
Tender for concession of Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) will be
launched in the year to enable agreement to be signed before March next
year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania made a decision to reform parastatals in 1992 to make the loss-
making public firms commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
By 1990 the companies accounted for less than 10 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and are indebted with some 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars.
The parastatal sector also faces under-capitalization, outdated technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Euro Poses No Threat to Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States responded
cautiously Monday on the launch of euro, saying that it does not
see the euro could pose a challenge to the U.S. dollar's dominance
in the world.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reiterated the U.S.
position. "As we've said many times, if it's good for Europe then
that's good for the United States. A strong Europe is good for the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a currency like all other currencies," Rubin told
reporters after a speech at the National Press Club here.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, asked about the euro's strong debut, stuck to his
routine of not commenting on day-to-day market movements and said
it was normal for markets to fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
"That is not where our focus needs to be. Our focus needs to be
on keeping our house in order. If our house is in order then we'll
be in fine shape," he said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also took a cautious line on
the euro, insisting there was no fear the currency would pose any
danger to the primacy of the dollar in foreign exchange
transactions around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the United States has always supported an integrated,
stable Europe and steps forward to that goal are supported by the
United States government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin and his deputy Lawrence Summers said the dollar's future
would depend crucially on the pursuit of sound, growth-oriented
economic policies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The euro just reemphasizes how important it is that we focus
on our own policies and continuing to make the United States a
place where people want to invest their capital by having sound
policies here -- particularly by maintaining our fiscal
discipline," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Summers told a U.S. TV show, "As long as we
keep our fundamentals strong, I think the dollar (and) U.S.
borrowing costs will do just fine."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Aid for Long-Term Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday proposed billions of U.S. dollars in new help for the
long-term disabled and the family caregivers who support them,
including a 1,000 U.S. dollar tax credit for families struggling
to tend to relatives.
</P>
<P>
The tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for such
expenses as adult day care, respite care and reduced work hours,
is part of a five-year, 6.2 billion U.S. dollar package that the
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled at a
White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Today we announce a critical new initiative to give care to
the caregivers," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
None of the Clinton plan becomes reality without Congress,
which last year rejected the president's attempt through a
"patient's bill of rights."
</P>
<P>
Hillary said the president's proposal is meant to help those
who struggle to balance their own careers and child-rearing
obligations with the burden of caring for a disabled or infirm
parent or other relative.
</P>
<P>
According to White House estimates, the 1,000 dollar tax
credit, which phases out at 110,000 dollars for upper-income
couples and at 75,000 dollars for unmarried taxpayers, would be
available to about 2 million Americans. The grant program would be
expected to serve some 250,000 families.
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million Americans need long-term care due to
chronic or serious illness, disability or simple old age. That
population is growing as the baby-boom generation nears
retirement.
</P>
<P>
By 2030, the number of Americans age 85 and older -- nearly
half of whom need assistance with daily activities -- will jump
from 4 million to 8.4 million.

<HEADLINE> New Coins Issued in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda (BOU) issued four new
 legal tender coins in the denominations of 50, 100, 200 and 500 Shillings
(one U.S. Dollar equals some 1,360 Shillings) Monday to help paper money in
small denominations.
</P>
<P>
Walugembe Musoke, spokesman of the BOU, told Xinhua Monday afternoon
that the issue of new coins will facilitate trade because they are more
frequently used.
</P>
<P>
The new coins, which have a feature of the Uganda Coat of Arms on the
obverse while on the reverse (at the tail) the coins have a horned kob, a
horned cow, a tilapia and a head of a crested crane.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the business community have expressed interest in the
new coins, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Coins were re-introduced in Uganda after the 1986 currency reforms in
the denominations of one, two, five and 10 Shillings but they did not last
long.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say that the Ugandans were not comfortable with the
coins because of their bulky nature.
</P>
<P>
According to BOU statistics, by June 1994 the notes in denominations of
50, 100, 200 and 500 Shillings accounted for 57.5 percent in volume and 28.
9 percent in value of the notes in circulation.
</P>
<P>
By June 1995, the notes accounted for 49.5 percent in volume and 18.2
percent in value of money in circulation and three years later, they only
constituted 49.2 percent in volume and 9.4 percent in value of the total
money.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Suffers Critical Shortage of Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A high court judge disclosed Monday that
Zambia suffers critical shortage of lawyers and this has adversely affected
the pace at which cases are moving in courts, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
When chairing the ceremonial opening of high court sessions in Lusaka,
Ireen Mambilima noted that the critical shortage of lawyers at both
Directorate of Legal Aid and Director of Public Prosecution's chamber has
made advocates travel from one town to the next, always leaving unfinished
cases to the frustration of the courts.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the legal aid directorate appears to be worse which
has caused grave concerns on the part of the poor accused persons who could
not afford to pay fees to hire private lawyers, said Mambilima.
</P>
<P>
She added that there has been an increase in crimes throughout the
country, especially violent crimes which have increased the workload of the
courts.
</P>
<P>
The high court judge also said the congestion and prevalence of
infectious diseases in prisons are a worrying trend and there is need for
more facilities in prisons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is need to critically examine and improve the
institutional linkages between the various stakeholders if the county's
machinery of the whole criminal justice system is to work smoothly,
Mambilima stressed.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Slams Rockets Near Israeli Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's key anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah Monday fired three Katyusha rockets
near the Israeli border area, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The rockets landed near two Israeli tanks at Houla in south
Lebanon, less than five kilometers from the Israeli border, but
did not cause any casualties, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came apparently in a retaliation for the Israeli
air raids on Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley on Sunday, during
which a Lebanese mother and her four children were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary-General
Sheik Naim Qassem claimed that his group will respond to the
Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a commander of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA), a pro-Israeli militia, was wounded by a roadside bomb in
Jezzine, just outside the Israeli-occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was believed to be planted by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
This is the first casualty the SLA militia suffered for the
year of 1999. Last year, a total of 34 SLA militiamen were killed
in south Lebanon while 24 Israelis and 42 Lebanese guerrillas lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movements spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupying forces and
its proxy SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Administration Issues Security Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The office of the governor of Mogadishu
has issued a decree imposing an emergency rule in Somalia's capital
beginning from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The recently announced administration of Mogadishu Sunday night
announced its first and strongest statement relating to the stability of
the Somali capital as the security situation especially in southern Somalia
is getting beyond the tolerable limits.
</P>
<P>
According to the ten-article decree, the people of Mogadishu are
notified of the imposition of a night curfew from 22:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
during which all kinds of movements, pedestrians and vehicles, are
restricted without the knowledge of the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The decree bans the carrying of guns and all kinds of explosive items
by ordinary civilians and the outlawed militiamen.
</P>
<P>
It also bans the people from carrying knives, swords, daggers, axes
and etc. from the time the curfew comes into effect within a week.
</P>
<P>
The governor is given the right to issue weapon possession permission
for the aid workers, agencies, business people and other notable
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Whoever is found carrying weapons without permission will be imprisoned
for nine months and the weapon will be confiscated, while those found
moving around in defiance to the curfew will be imprisoned for nine months.
</P>
<P>
The decree also announces the beginning of a large campaign by the
police force in eradicating the widespread banditry and lawlessness in the
capital within this week.
</P>
<P>
Whoever tries to obstruct the security campaign will be imprisoned for
six months for punishment.
</P>
<P>
The decree signed by acting governor of Mogadishu, Muhidin Siyad, also
says the penal cases not mentioned in the decree will be referred to the
penal codes of 1963, prepared during the first elected civilian government
of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Rampant banditry remains one of the challenging factors against the
faction leaders who announced the administration.
</P>
<P>
There are also other groups of gunmen scattered around the capital who
are supporting either the opposition leaders or the Islamic courts which
control pockets of land in Mogadishu. The Islamic courts will as well
oppose this decree especially if their areas of control are intervened by
the administration police and militia forces.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Youths Demonstrate Against Oil Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Nigerian youths took to the
streets in some parts of Lagos Monday to protest against the recent price
increase for petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that demonstrators, believed to be members of a pan-
Yoruba organization known as the Odua Youths Organization, made bonfires
along the streets, disrupting traffic with barricades.
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, the demonstration had spread to densely populated
Mushin areas with motorists and passers-by fleeing to avoid contacts with
the protestors who were chanting anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot policemen were seen patrolling the troubled areas in trucks,
trying to prevent the demonstration from spreading in the commercial hub of
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The price increase which came into effect two weeks ago has provoked
angry reactions from a cross-section of the population in the oil producing
country.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the deregulation of the oil market in the
country, marketers have increased the price for petroleum products from
11Naira (about 0.13 U.S. Dollars) to 25 Naira per liter.
</P>
<P>
The price increase which was said to solve the perennial fuel crisis in
the most populous African country has unfortunately failed to end the
crisis with long queues still visible in Lagos Monday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the government officials and labor leaders just
before the Christmas holidays failed to reach an agreement on the issue
of oil price increase.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted Information and Culture
Minister John Nwodo as saying that the negotiations would continue this
week in order to resolve the hike in fuel pump price and other issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that an understanding would certainly be reached
to ensure that the deadlock between the two parties would amicably be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the Nigerian government is fully aware of
the sufferings of the people and would ensure that it fulfills its
responsibility and obligations to the citizenry.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Stalling Peace Efforts in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African High Commission to
Zimbabwe Monday denied suggestions in the Zimbabwean press that its
government was stalling efforts to end the conflict by insisting on greater
participation of Congo (K) rebels in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, it said that the government of South Africa remained
totally committed to assisting all international efforts aimed at bringing
a peaceful and lasting solution to the current war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Since the outbreak of the current conflict in the DRC during August
1998, the South African government has taken a consistent and clear
position, based on its belief that only all inclusive negotiations
involving all parties to the conflict can ensure lasting peace in the DRC,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said South Africa believed that the rebels in the DRC were an
important element which could not be excluded from a cease-fire if an end
to the hostilities was to be ensured.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a report in Zimbabwe's daily newspaper The Herald said that
South Africa was being accused of stalling efforts to end the DRC crisis by
insisting greater participation of rebels in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The daily said major parties to the conflict including the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) were opposed to South Africa's position.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have intervened in the war in the DRC to
fight the Tutsi-led rebels who are allegedly being assisted by Rwanda and
Uganda to remove DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Broad-based Government in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Monday stressed the need to establish a broad-based
government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran views a broad-based government representing all Afghan
groups as the only way to bring peace and progress to the country,
Khatami told visiting Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad
Khan.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
Khatami expressed hope that hostility and violence will give
way to peace and friendship in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami condemned the Afghan Taliban militia for failing to
punish those responsible for the killings of nine Iranian
diplomats and journalist in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban had acted in a rebellious way and had not
taken serious measures to bring those suspects to trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Taliban forces stormed the Iranian consulate
in Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan and killed its staff
members.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the close Iranian-Pakistani ties can be helpful to
the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Iran and Pakistan should always look for ways of
consolidating their relations through direct and constant
contacts," he said, adding that Iran considers security and calm
in Pakistan as important as that in its own territory.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Iran condemns any type of terrorism in either
Iran or Pakistan, hoping that terrorism will be eradicated from
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Ahmad Khan submitted a message from
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is ready to cooperate with Iran at both regional and
international levels and in restoring peace to Afghanistan, the
Pakistani official said, adding that his government is determined
to follow up the case of the assassination of Iranian nationals in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, a number of Iranian citizens were
gunned down in Pakistan and Tehran urged Islamabad to bring those
killers to justice.

LUANDA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Undersecretary-General
Sevan Bennom urged both the Angolan government and the rebel UNITA movement

</P>
<P>
As the U.N. special envoy, the undersecretary-general for defense and

<P>
Bennom said that the world organization hopes that the Angolan
government and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
would agree to a 48-hour cease-fire and helping the U.N. to implement its
search-and-rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
Carrying with him a letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Bennom will have contacts with both the Angolan government and the UNITA
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy noted that the U.N. "hopes that the issue could be
resolved as soon as possible because we believe that there are survivors
and they need emergent help."
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire call was positively answered by the Angolan government,
but there is still no response from the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the U.N. observer mission to Angola, the U.N.
has given a deadline for UNITA to reply before January 11.
</P>
<P>
So far, the fate of the passengers and crew aboard the two planes is
still not known.
</P>
<P>
The two U.N.-chartered C-130 transport planes went down within eight
days near Huambo, a central city locked in conflict between Angolan
government troops and UNITA rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The first aircraft, with 14 people aboard, was down some 45 kilometers
north of Huambo on December 26 and the second, carrying four crew and four
passengers, crashed in a near place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government accused the UNITA of shooting down the two planes
because the crash sites are in control of the rebel troops.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Telecom. Improves Revenue Greatly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) - The state-owned Tanzania
Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL) contributed 70 billion
Tanzanian Shillings (103 million U.S. Dollars) revenue collection in 1998,
a senior TTCL official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Managing Director Jones Kilimbe said in a statement that this
contribution was in contrast with the 34.5 billion Shillings revenue
collected in 1994 when it split from the former Tanzania Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation.
</P>
<P>
He said major development has been achieved by the modernization of the
exchange transmission and external plant facilities to increase the
capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Currently over 75 percent of the national network is digital which
boosts the exchange capacity greatly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilimbe added that the TTCL line capacity rose to 182,511 as of last
October from 129,988 lines in 1994 whereas the exchange connections went up
by 26 percent from those recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said the TTCL has also cooperated with foreign partners like Datel
and Payphone Tanzania Ltd. in a bid to improve its capability to explore
new areas like cellular phone and internet services.
</P>
<P>
Kilimbe expected the TTCL will sell 30 percent to 35 percent of its
shares to strategic partners by the end of this year as part of its effort
to undergo privatization.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone: Peace-keepers Repel Rebel Attack on Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Artillery fire shook Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown Monday as the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG said
it had repelled a rebel attack on the city's Hasting Airport.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted ECOMOG spokesman Jimoh Okunlola as saying
that "The rebels attacked Hastings at about 3:00 this morning, but we have
now beaten them back into the hills around the town."
</P>
<P>
He said the ECOMOG, back by a loyalist militia, was mopping up the area
around Hastings, on the eastern outskirts of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said dozens of rebels were killed but gave no casualty
figure of the peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports also quoted the United Nations spokesman in Sierra
Leone Francis Okello as saying Sunday that about 10 members of the U.N.
military observer mission have returned to Freetown on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission, composed of about 80 observers and staff, was
evacuated to neighboring Guinea in late December, following a major
offensive launched by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Though the rebels are reportedly in control of the whole northern part
of the country, they failed to launch the offensive on Freetown as they
have threatened to, as the ECOMOG has called in massive reinforcements from
Nigeria and other west African countries, boosting its total troops to
about 17,000.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Sierra Leone is improving steadily," the U.N.
official said, adding that the rest of the staff were expected to return in
the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Reopen Embassy in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi representative arrived
here Monday to reopen the Iraqi embassy in Lebanon after almost
five years of closure, Lebanon's independent Central News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi representative, Nabil El Jinati, will be commissioned
with licensing commercial transactions and entry visas into Iraq
and issuing as well as renewing passports for Iraqi expatriates in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will also be in charge of licensing commercial transactions
for Lebanese businessmen trying to export their merchandise to
Iraq, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Lebanon assigned a civil servant to administer
its embassy's affairs in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The two countries closed their embassies on a reciprocal basis
in 1994 after bilateral diplomatic relations were severed as a
result of the assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure Taleb
Tamimi in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Three Iraqi diplomats in Lebanon were convicted of killing
Tamimi and were arrested by Lebanese police. One of them died in
prison from a brain haemorrhage and the other two were later
released.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the embassies will promote and eventually
lead to the formal resumption of diplomatic ties between the
two countries, especially amid the rising bilateral business
exchange, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has gained a 50 million U.S. dollars contract under
the Iraqi oil-for-food deal with the United Nations and is keen
to increase the amount to 100 million dollars.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka High Court Monday ordered the
state to compensate an opposition party leader and a former senior official
of the ruling Movement for Muti-party Democracy (MMD) for wrongfully
detaining them over treason charges.
</P>
<P>
High court judge Japhet Banda ordered that Dean Mung'omba, president of
opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) and Nakatindi Wina, former
chairperson in charge of MMD women affairs should be paid the costs they
incurred during their defence.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA quoted Banda as saying that there were no
reasonable grounds for the state to have commenced criminal proceedings
against the duo who were charged with treason on December 21, 1998 in
connection with the country's foiled military coup in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that the police should have diligently investigated the
matter before detaining and charging the duo with treason without proper
evidence.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered lawyers representing Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina to
submit a bill of costs on the quantum within seven days so that the court
could determine how much would be awarded to the two persons.
</P>
<P>
Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina had been detained for about one year
before they were released last month after the state entered a nolle
prosequi on the treason charges they were facing together with 77 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Drought-Hit Tanzania Blessed with Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Four regions in Tanzania, gripped
by a severe drought, have received rains since January 1, the
Meteorological Department in Dar es Salaam confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nassor Mnanike, an official at the department, said 32.6 millimeters
were recorded on January 1 in Mbeya Region.
</P>
<P>
Ruvuma Region recorded 11.7 mm of rainfall on January 1 and 14.3 mm on
the following day. "No further records were compiled since then," said
Mnanike.
</P>
<P>
He said Iringa Region recorded 11.2 mm of rainfall on January 1,
followed by 9.8 mm and 5.3 mm respectively in the following two days.
</P>
<P>
"In general, southwestern areas have started experiencing rains since
the new year began," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said rains poured down in western Kigoma Region in the
midnight last Saturday and was continuing Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rains have been a blessing to Tanzania which is suffering a severe
drought. The east African country has experienced below-average
precipitation during the short rains season starting last October, except
for Kigoma and the Lake Zone in the north.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the central Dodoma Region even feed on wild fruits,
grasshoppers and small birds.
</P>
<P>
The country is short of 450,000 tons of grain, which forced the
government to waive maize import duty to solve the food problem.
</P>
<P>
 In capital Dar es Salaam, three million residents are threatened by an
imminent water shortage as water level in the Ruvu River, the water source
of the city, has fallen to an alarming level.

<HEADLINE> Israel Enters Election Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) - Israel was ushered in a
election campaign period Monday as the Knesset, or the parliament
gave final approval to a bill on early elections to be held on May
17.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which calls for the dissolution of the Knesset and
early elections, was passed by overwhelming majorities in its
final two readings.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also approved May 17 as the date for elections
which was set by two major parties, the Likud and the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The final approval of the bill was a foregone conclusion since
the coalition has decided to back it after Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu failed last month to secure a broad support
for his peace policies with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The coalition threw its support behind the bill in its first
reading on December 21 after Netanyahu's last-minute call for a
unity government with the Labor was rejected. It was passed by a
vote of 81-30, with four abstentions, in that reading.
</P>
<P>
Five politicians have already declared to challenge the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has kicked off his campaign by pledging that Israel
will not give more lands to the Palestinians until they fulfill
new conditions he set for them.
</P>
<P>
His cabinet suspended last month the latest interim peace deal
with the Palestinians which calls on Israel to withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, while vowing to advance the
peace talks with the Palestinians, focused his campaign on
Netanyahu's political style and his personality, accusing him of
giving in to extremists opposed to the peace process only in
order to survive.
</P>
<P>
Likud defectors Dan Meridor and Benny Begin were forming their
independent parties to compete in the upcoming elections. While
Meridor is planning a centrist list, Begin is launching a far
rightist party with a platform to halt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Another Likud member Uzi Landau has also announced to
challenge Netanyahu for the premiership, but from inside the
party.
</P>
<P>
The Likud will hold primary elections later this month to
choose a chairman for the party, who will also become the
candidate for prime minister on behalf of Likud.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said earlier
that he will not announce his candidacy until the Knesset
passes all the readings of the early election bill.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Meridor to coordinate their campaign
efforts. He is also under pressure to join the Labor and not to
split votes of the Left-Center.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Knesset passed the first reading
Monday of a bill which makes it harder for any new government to
relinquish the Golan Heights, the Syrian territories seized by
Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was initiated by the coalition party The Third
Way, stipulated that any government decision to hand over the
Golan to Syria has to be approved by the Knesset by at least 61
votes and then has to go to a referendum.

<HEADLINE> S. African Moslem Groups to Protest During Blair's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
would be hounded by protests wherever he goes during his visit to Cape Town
this week, two Moslem groups warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to arrive in Cape Town Friday as part of his first
visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Moslems Against Global Oppression (MAGO) said it would hold a mass
demonstration, first at the U.S. embassy and then at the British consulate
Thursday to show their disapproval of Britain's participation along with U.
S. forces in the recent air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We don't agree with the bombing of Iraq and we are disgusted at the
killing of innocent women and children," South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted MAGO spokesman Moaim Achmad as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow Blair wherever he goes, we will have placard
demonstrations and our people in Gauteng (province) and Durban (city) will
do the same when he is there."
</P>
<P>
Abduragmaan Khan of Moslems Against Illegitimate Leaders (MAIL) said
they would support MAGO in the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any allies of America. We want to make it clear that all
British and Americans in our country are not welcome here, they are
unwanted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British consulate said Monday that it was not aware of the planned
demonstrations and did not want to comment on security planning for Blair's
visit, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Blair is expected to co-chair with South
African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki the second meeting of the British-
South African Bilateral Forum, which was established in November 1997 when
Mbeki visited London.
</P>
<P>
Blair will also meet President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Britain remains South Africa's number one trade partner and investor.
Total trade between the two countries amounted to 31.8 billion Rand (5.4
billion U.S. Dollars) in 1997. In the first 10 months of 1998, the trade
volume stood at 21.4 billion Rand (3.6 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
British companies have invested nearly 10 billion Rand (1.7 billion
Dollars) in South Africa since the birth of new South Africa in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Warns Rebels Against Staging Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday warned the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
against staging a fight.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the Presidential Palace, Estrada said the
Armed Forces of the Philippines have long been prepared to counter
possible attacks by the MILF once the Ramadan season ends.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best to exhaust all remedies for the peace
process," he said, adding his administration would "never refuse a
challenge" by any rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Aguirre, the National Security Adviser of
the Philippines, said the statement that the armed forces are
ready to fight with rebel groups was not an outright declaration
of war.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the armed forces were merely conveying the message
that its men are ready to fulfill their mandate to respond to any
armed threat from any group.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the armed forces declared that it would have long
wiped out the rebel forces had it not been for ongoing peace
negotiations with them.
</P>
<P>
The government is still negotiating with the MILF and the
National Democratic Front and is hoping to accelerate the peace
process this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Palestine and Israel Discuss Anti-Incitement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua)-- The Committee on the Prevention
of Incitement, Terrorism and Violence, which comprises the United
States, Israel and Palestine, met Tuesday in Ramallah over
anti-incitement, Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time the three sides met since the committee
was set up following the signing of the Wye River Memorandum last
October.
</P>
<P>
Uri Dan, head of the Israeli team, reiterated Israel attaches
great importance to the incitement matter and views it as one of
the agenda issues vis-a-vis Palestinian commitments, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes to make progress in its dialogue with the
Palestinians on this matter, including the formation of a joint
mechanism to monitor expressions of incitement, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord, Israel carried out the first stage
troop redeployment in the West Bank last November, but stopped
further pullback in mid-December, hence freezing the
implementation of the deal.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Warns Of Capital Flow Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong monetary official
Tuesday urged the international community to deal with the
aggressive flow of international capital which could continue to
affect small and open economies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a symposium at the Central Bank of the
Philippines, Joseph C. R. Yam, chief executive of Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, warned that the world faces a crisis created
by cross-border speculation.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the management of the global financial system
has become "grossly inadequate in coping with the demand of global
finance."
</P>
<P>
He said there are solutions, including immediate response and
long-term initiatives, to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He cited such responses as rescue packages, tactical counter
measures such as government buying stocks and futures and raising
interest rates, and imposition of capital controls.
</P>
<P>
Yam also suggested long-term initiatives such as reforming the
international financial system to better regulate the volatile
capital flows that contribute to market instability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gabriel C. Singson, governor of the Central Bank of
the Philippines, reiterated his opposition to any form of capital
or currency control.
</P>
<P>
Based on the experience of the central bank, such controls
would not work in the long run, he said.

Luo expressed hope that the new force will play an important
role in China's campaign against smuggling. He said the purpose
for establishing the force centered on strengthening the authority
and power of customs departments to combat rampant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He called on officers engaged in the anti-smuggling campaign to
conduct law enforcement activities in a just and fair manner. He
also encouraged them to investigate major cases and arrest
smugglers regardless of the status of the individuals or
departments involved.
</P>
<P>
He warned that members of the force should scrupulously avoid
corruption and graft.

<P>
Relevant departments should support the force in efforts to
improve the anti-smuggling campaign, said Luo.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen branches of the new bureau will operate in a number of
cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai and
Nanjing. Twenty-three additional customs offices will establish

<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Bayelsa State Administrator
Paul Obi has lifted the dusk-to-dawn curfew in oil-producing Niger
Delta areas imposed under a state of emergency declared last week following
a confrontation between Ijaw youths and government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday by the administrator's chief press
secretary Norman Morris, Obi said that the ban on public processions and
gatherings was still in force.
</P>
<P>
He noted that anyone or group that wants to take part in
any of public gatherings must seek clearance and permit from police
authorities in Bayelsa, eastern Nigeria, The Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ijaw youths of the Niger-Delta Volunteer Force (NDVF),
which has been regarded as the unofficial armed wing of the Ijaw activists ,
calld a truce following an appeal by traditional rulers and the Ijaw
National Congress leadership at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, a demonstration was held in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa
State, upon the expiration of a ultimatum given to multi-national oil
companies operating in Ijaw areas to quit.
</P>
<P>
The Demonstration resulted in more than 20 deaths.
</P>
<P>
 Normalcy has returned to Bayelsa State since Sunday when the Nigerian
government deployed warships and more troops in Niger Delta areas to quell
violent protests by restive Ijaw youths, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NDVF co-ordinator and spokesman Bellow Oribebe said Sunday night that
NDVF called a truce as traditional rulers and other leaders promised that
the government was addressing the Niger Delta question.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government and oil companies should evolve strategies
and policies to foster meaningful development in the Niger Delta areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks India to Specify Nuclear Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has asked
India to specify in "concrete terms" its requirements of nuclear
deterrence so that it is not seen as an "open-ended threat" to its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India (PTI) here
Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to India Richard F. Celeste said India's
nuclear tests last May "marked a kind of punctuation point" in the
relations between Washington and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Some expression of what India really wants and needs and
strives to achieve in a reasonably specific time, not specific in
numbers, but a range, is important to not only help the U.S.
understand but also specific neighbors to understand...So that
there isn't an open-ended threat," the PTI quoted Celeste as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Describing India's assurances on no-first use of nuclear
weapons and not indulging in any arms race as "encouraging but
positive general statements," he said New Delhi should be more
"transparent and clear" in defining what nuclear deterrence is as
it is vital to de-escalating tensions and not getting caught in an
unintended arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Celeste said the Indian government should make it clear as to
"how many missile systems and warheads does India need to have a
minimum nuclear deterrence."
</P>
<P>
The American ambassador felt that it was a transition period
for the Indo-U.S. relations in 1998 which he termed as a
"difficult year."
</P>
<P>
He said "substantial progress" had been achieved in the
on-going dialogue between the two countries but cautioned that
"there is still substantial work to be done."
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott are scheduled to hold a new
round of talks here later this month.
</P>
<P>
No tangible results were achieved in the previous seven rounds
of talks between the two countries in 1998.

<P>
A spokesman for the world football ruling body confirmed that a
ll the paper work concerning the bid reached FIFA headquarters in
Zurich, Switzerland Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eight countries have earlier make known their intention to bid
for the 2006 World Cup. They include South Africa, Morocco,
Ghana, Egypt, Brazil Argentina, England and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a sports program of the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) Monday, Nigeria's Sports Minister Air Commodore
Emeka Omeruah said he believes that Nigeria stands a good chance
to win the hosting rights.
</P>

the hosting right should have eight to 12 stadia, while Nigeria
has developed eight stadia for the hosting of the World Youth
Championship scheduled for April this year.

He admitted that Nigeria was encouraged to join the bidders by
FIFA President Sepp Blatter's words that Africa should host the
World Cup, but added that Nigeria's feat on the pitch of football
particularly the golden medal it won at the '96 Atlanta Olympic
"has exposed to the world that we can get to the top of the
ladder".
</P>
<P>
On the competition among African countries, the minister said
"Africans are a group of people that can sit down and sort out
their problems. We would sit down with ourselves and find out
those who can really accommodate it."

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises in Southwest China Bridge Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Casualties continue to mount
in the wake of the bridge collapse in Qijiang County in the
southwest China municipality of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports show the accident killed 23 and injured 16,
with 11 soldiers and two civilians listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Bridge collapsed at 18:30 (Beijing time) on Monday
evening dumping over 23 armed police soldiers and an undetermined
number of civilians into the Qijiang River.
</P>
<P>
The steel structure collapsed when the armed police unit ran
across it.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities launched immediate rescue efforts and more
than 350 armed police soldiers, militiamen and civilians have
joined in the rescue efforts over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that the five degree centigrade water
temperature limits the chances for survivors.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing authorities have organized an investigation team of
architects from seven local engineering institutions.
</P>
<P>
Local disciplinary inspection departments and procuratorates
are also investigating the cause of the accident and the
construction quality of the bridge which was built by the
Chongqing Bridge Construction Corp. in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports that the bridge was built by a private company
were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Municipal Party Secretary Zhang Delin and Mayor Pu Haiqing have
ordered extensive checks of all public utilities to avoid similar
tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Chang Sets Sights on World No. 1 Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sixth-seeded American took three sets to eliminate French
qualifier Sebastien Grosjean in a drawn-out affair at Memorial
Drive at Adelaide of Australia as the late-afternoon temperature
hovered around 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
After the match, the 1989 French Open winner named his four
remaining tennis goals as rising to the No.1 position, a spot he
nearly claimed in 1996, and winning the remaining three grand
slam titles.
</P>
<P>
Chang also quashed any suggestion that he might quit the tour
after a devastating 1998, in which knee and wrist injuries kept
him out of the top 20 for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"I think last year was a kind of unfortunate year but I've
learned a lot," said Chang, who became the youngest player to win
a grand slam with his 1989 French Open win.
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes people forget that I'm only 26 years old. I
was looking in the paper and Pat Rafter is 26, hey, same age," he
told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says Pat's best tennis is still ahead of him. I feel
like my best tennis is still ahead of me ... as far as calling it
quits, it's never crossed my mind unless somebody's asked me."
</P>
<P>
Chang said he would decide later in the week whether to play
in the Colonial Classic at Kooyong in Melbourne next week,
depending on his form in the Adelaide tournament.
</P>
<P>
His win over Grosjean on Tuesday sets him up for a second
round meeting with Australian Scott Draper on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwean Davis Cup star Byron Black advanced into
the second round on Tuesday by defeating American Vincent Spadea
1-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The prosecution in former
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's corruption trial
in the High Court here closed its case Tuesday after 39 days of
hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I have no further witnesses. I intend to close my case as of
now," senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail told the
High Court after the 23rd witness Suryani Sungit, an investigating
officer from the federal police headquarters, completed her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
But Anwar's counsel Gurbachan Singh said the defense reserved
the right to further cross-examine government chemist Lim Kong
Boon after his DNA expert from overseas arrives on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 51, who was sacked on September 2 last year, is facing
four charges of corrupt practices by using his position to
interfere in police investigations into his alleged sexual
misconduct. The High Court started the trial of the charges on
November 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar faces a maximum 14 years of jail or a fine of 20,000
ringgit (5,263 U.S. dollars), or both, on conviction.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The design of Hong Kong Park
has won the American Institute of Architects Hong Kong Chapter's
Honor Award for Urban Design 1998, the Provisional Urban Council
(PUC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor for Hong Kong Park to receive the honor
award in recognition of its design which is compatible with the
urban environment," said a spokesman for the Urban Services
Department (USD).
</P>
<P>
Built on a former army barracks site in Central District, the
Hong Kong Park, which is a PUC leisure facility managed by the
USD, has become a landmark in Hong Kong and attracted over one
million visitors each year since its opening in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
The park covers an area of about 10 hectares and has a wide
range of active and passive facilities as well as innovative
features to cater for the needs of people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
Major facilities of the park include a conservatory; an aviary;
a visual arts center; a garden plaza; a terraced garden with water
features; children's playgrounds; a clock tower; a vantage point;
a restaurant; an indoor games hall and a squash center.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Park was a joint development project between the
Council and the Hong Kong Jockey Club with a total construction
cost of 390 million HK dollars (50 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club contributed a generous donation of 170 million
HK dollars (21.79 million U.S. dollars) towards this project and
managed the development project on behalf of the Council.

<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Carter
Center of the United States, led by Charles E Costello, director
of the center's democracy program, arrived in Beijing this evening
to observe the election of township-level people's deputies.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the National People's Congress (NPC) Foreign Affairs
Committee, the delegation is scheduled to discuss grass-roots
democracy issues with officials from both the NPC and the Ministry
of Civil Affairs, and observe the direct elections of people's
deputies in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality during its
10-day inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for an overseas non-governmental
organization to inspect elections of China's local power organs,
since the Carter Center's two previous inspections of villagers'
committee elections in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his
wife, the Carter Center has been devoted to observing many
countries in respect of democracy and development, human rights
issues and public health.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Carter Center has monitored elections in at least
12 countries, and the inspection of China's villagers' committee
over the past two years has proven to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Pastor, who headed the center's two inspection
delegations to China, said on his last trip,"Our entire delegation
was impressed by what we saw and by the commitment of the
villagers to have free and fair elections, by the competition, and
by the sincerity with which the Chinese officials try to make this
election successful."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S. Statement on No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday slammed a
statement by the United States White House spokesman that the
U.S. would continue imposing no-fly zones in Iraq, calling it a
defiance of the international will.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Iraqi Ministry of Information and Culture
was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that the
U.S. statement "is an expression of the U.S. intransigence to
attack Iraq once more."
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman announced on Monday that the
U.S. would continue preventing Iraq from violating the no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain imposed the two no-fly zones in Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War to protect the Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south "from the oppression of the Iraqi
regime."
</P>
<P>
"When the U.S. declared that it would continue imposing the
no-fly zones, it in fact declares its continuation of the
violation of Iraqi air spaces... as the imposition of such air
embargo is illegal and out of the Security Council's resolution,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. statement came at a time when Russia and
China, two permanent members of the Security Council, said the air
ban had been done out of the Security Council's mandate and it
was irrelevant to the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and British warplanes are themselves that impinge on
Iraq's sovereignty and breach Iraqi air spaces in the north and
the south," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq will continue to reject and resist the no-fly
zones.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of December 16-19 U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq, Iraq announced that it would fire on
warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in the north and south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
In late December, 1998, Iraqi air-defense force fired
surface-to-air missiles at American and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones. The U.S. and British warplanes fired
back and killed five Iraqis and injured nine others.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Textile, Garment Exports Show No Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's textile and garment
sector obtained an export turnover of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, showing no increase over 1997, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the narrowing of foreign markets as a result of
the regional financial turmoil, the fluctuation of imported
material prices and the cutting-off of export contracts, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnam Textile and Garment Corporation,
almost all businesses had fulfilled their export quotas to the
European Union by the end of 1998's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports to non-quota markets dropped significantly
from 900 million dollars in 1997 to 700 million dollars in 1998,
causing unemployment in many export businesses.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to achieve a textile and garment export turnover
of 1.5 billion dollars in 1999.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Does Euro Mean to Asia? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- With the bells ringing for the
first day of the last year of the 20th century, a new currency was
introduced to the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The euro, the European single currency, made its debut in the
Asian markets Monday, bringing new challenges and new hopes for
the continent, which has been suffering from the financial crisis
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Asia gave the euro a warm welcome in the first
trading day of the new year on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The euro was trading at 1.18 U.S. dollars or more on all
markets, compared with the starting level of 1.16675 dollars
established on December 31 when the rates of the currencies were
irrevocably fixed by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the launch of euro will alleviate the pressure
which Asian currencies felt from the strong U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
They had predicted that a higher euro against the dollar will
strengthen the yen against the greenback and lend support to the
other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the euro rose against nearly every
currency in Monday's trading while the U.S. dollar fell against
every other currency. In Thailand, the baht appreciated to 36.55
baht to the dollar from 37.30 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the euro, some central banks in Asia have
been considering the reallocation of their reserves since there is
under-representation of European currencies in reserve holdings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some Asian central banks were buying the
euro against the dollar on Monday to diversify their
greenback-dominated reserves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from balancing their reserves, Asia would also face
greater demand for the euro and decreased demand for the dollar in
the medium term as transaction costs in Europe will be denominated
in the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have long been dependent on the greenback in
their trading. In Thailand, more than 80 percent of total trade is
denominated in dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Union has the largest share of the global
economy, with 29 percent of the world's gross domestic product, as
well as a 20-percent share in global exports.
</P>
<P>
With the back of the market of the 11-nation "Euroland", the
euro is expected to play an important role in future market
activities.
</P>
<P>
But the euro also caused some worries among Asian economic
policy makers.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that relatively weak currencies could make the region's
export more competitive, Asian leaders would not be so happy to
see the rapid appreciation of their currencies as a result of the
strong euro.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Asian central banks would enter the market to
ensure that their currencies do not appreciate rapidly to guard
the region's competitiveness in exports, the key to reviving the
recession-hit economies.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean central bank already acted last month to
cushion the won's rapid rise against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders also worry that their traders would face stiff
competition in European markets.
</P>
<P>
Reduced foreign exchange and transport costs could push more
European importers to seek goods from European sources, instead of
from Asian exporters.
</P>
<P>
"The greater efficiencies which come with the common currency
will help Europeans produce cheaper products, and thus make them
more competitive in relation to Thai businesses," Apinan
Pavanarit, director-general of the Thai Foreign Ministry's
European Affairs Department, said.
</P>
<P>
And if the euro is stable and does help the European countries
to lower their interest rates and production costs, more
investments will be lured to the European markets, which is by no
means good news for the cash-strapped Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it would take up to five years before the euro's
direction could clearly emerge, as well as the new role the
currency would play in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Though posing no real threat to the dominance of the greenback
in the market, the message the euro delivered is much more
important to the Asian countries, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro is a big push for some regional
organizations in Asia, particularly the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, which is planning for an economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries have realized that closer economic
cooperation within the region is crucial in a highly competitive
world market today.

BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
attended a military achievements exhibition today at National
Defense University.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
attended the exhibition along with a number of senior military
leaders, including Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian, Fu Quanyou, Yu
Yongbo, Wang Ke, Wang Ruilin and Cao Gangchuan.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese military schools to strictly adhere to the
requirements of the new period and deepen educational reform.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese military carried out a 1998 streamlining program
which included downsizing forces by 500,000 men, and withdrawing
from business activities. Military force also played a major part
in the nation's victory over record summer flooding during the
year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for using science and technology to strengthen
the military, as well as extending greater efforts to improve the
quality of military training.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Says Anwar's Injuries Caused by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Attorney-General Mohtar
Abdullah said Tuesday that injuries on certain parts of former
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's body were caused
by police officers when he was in police custody.
</P>
<P>
"I am also of the opinion that the Royal Malaysia Police is
fully responsible for the injuries to (Anwar) whilst in the legal
custody of the police," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, investigations which have been carried
out so far have not identified the person or persons responsible
for such injuries.
</P>
<P>
He said if there is prima facie evidence after further
investigation has been fully carried out, he as the public
prosecutor "will not hesitate to consent to the institution of
prosecution against any individual proved to have committed or
abetted the commission of such offense."
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said the report of a panel of doctors
showed that there were several injuries suffered by Anwar before
his arrest by the police.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the medical report and the investigation file of the
Special Investigation Team as a whole, I am satisfied that several
injuries alleged by the complainant (Anwar) are not true, while
there are injuries which are proved to have been caused by police
officers while he was in police custody," he said.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said that in his view the police
investigation file submitted to him on November 19 was not
complete to enable him to make a final decision on the case.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and detained on September 20 last year,
lodged a report on September 27 on the injuries he sustained while
in detention at the police headquarters here. His eyes appeared
swollen when he was brought to court on September 29 to face
several charges.

The two sides' leaders exchanged visits frequently last
year. State or government leaders of eight European countries and
of the European Commission (EC) also visited China in 1998 and the
president of the EC, Jacques Santer, came to China for the first
time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, including then-Premier Li Peng, Chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan and Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing visited a number of European nations early in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In April, China's newly-elected Premier Zhu Rongji flew to
London for the first China-EU summit, during which both sides
agreed to establish a long-term, stable partnership for the 21st
century and to adopt an annual meeting mechanism between leaders
of the two sides.

Following the summit, the EU decided to remove China from the
list of "non-market economies." In another document on the EU's
relationship with China, the EU said it will raise its China
relations to the same level as those it enjoys with the United
States, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"That move is an indication that China-EU relations have
entered a stage of mature and stable growth," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Chinese customs show that Sino-EU trade volume
reached 42.32 billion US dollars between January and November last
year, up 13.9 percent from the same period the year before. The EU
remained China's third largest trade partner, excluding Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zheng stressed that while China's exports to neighboring
regions dropped remarkably under the influence of the Asian
financial turmoil, exports to the EU surged during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports to the EU in the first 11 months of 1998
reached 24.83 billion US dollars, up 17.3 percent, compared with
the rise of 14.2 percent for exports to the United States. The
year's total exports to the EU is estimated at 27 billion US
dollars, up at least 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China and the EU signed new investment contracts
involving 5.02 billion US dollars between January and October
1998, accounting for 12.75 percent of China's total overseas
investment. The materialized investment from the EU reached 3.48
billion US dollars, accounting for 9.7 percent. The EU was China's
second largest investor next to Hong Kong.

The EU was also China's main technology exporter. China had
bought nearly 7,000 technology products from the EU by last
June, involving a contractual volume of 38.6 billion US dollars,
accounting for 44 percent of China's total spending on technology
imports.
</P>
<P>
The closer economic and trade relations between China and the
EU are expected to be further enhanced next year as China's export
market is faced with a severe situation following the Asian
financial crisis, said the director.
</P>
<P>
"China will be increasingly dependent on the EU in terms of
exports, capital, technology and management training in 1999 as
its exports to and overseas investment from Asia both declined in
1998," he said. "To explore the western European market deeper so
as to expand exports and attract more investment will be the core
of China's cooperation policy in its trade and economic relations
with the EU in the new year."
</P>
<P>
Zheng admitted that although there are many favorable factors
for the growth of bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
unfavorable factors do exist.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Euro will bring more challenges to China's
exports to Europe rather than opportunities, and there are still
"unharmonious factors" such as the EU's discriminatory trade
policies in some export commodities involving China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, China is determined to expand trade
and economic cooperation with the EU under the principle
of 'equality, mutual benefit and meeting each other's needs' in
1999," Zheng stressed.

The fighting started at 4:50 am local time, with UNITA maneuvering
armored cars, rockets and cannons and unfolded fierce clashes in the
suburbs of the Malanje with government army guarding the area.

<P>
The fighting has inflicted great losses to innocent residents, with over

<HEADLINE> UAE Government Revenues to Continue Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Government revenues of the
United Arab Emirates, which started to decline in mid 1990s, are
expected to continue declining in the near future, according to a
report released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Troublesome productivity and stagnant real wages, a declining
trade surplus and large government deficits all implied a reduced
capacity to save and subsequently to invest, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on the initial findings of an economic
study conducted by the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and
Research (ECSSR), which aims to explore ways to relieve the
country's national income of the over-dependence on crude oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The study was launched in early 1997, and is scheduled to be
completed by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the development and diversification of
industries beyond the oil and gas sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Clever Software (Group) Co.,
China's leading education software producer, is set to promote one
"Chinese learning software" in Singapore this year and will not
have to worry about seeking the help of professional foreign-trade
companies.
</P>
<P>
Clever and 19 other private businesses have been granted
licenses to import and export products directly.
</P>
<P>
The approval represented the first time related private
businesses have been permitted to engage in direct foreign
trade. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) announced the change on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clever previously imported environmental education software
from the United States. However, the private firm was denied the
right to engage in foreign trade until earlier this year and at
the same time has been unable to freely convert foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Receiving authority to trade directly will raise our
efficiency in developing overseas market and provide us greater
initiative to consummate contracts," according to Jiang Xin, deputy
manager of the company's development department.
</P>
<P>
Clever has also developed software in standard Chinese, or
putonghua, for the Hong Kong market, and is currently negotiating
a deal to introduce education software for children developed by
Davidson
</P>
<P>
Various other private firms are preparing for related trade
activities.

The Xiwang (Hope) Group, China's largest animal feed producer
located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, has also received
approval to engage in direct foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Xiwang President Liu Yonghao said the group plans to import
various amino acids and soybean dregs, and will export various
animal feed products to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-based Zhonglu Industrial Co. Ltd., the nation's major
producer of bowling equipment, has signed letters of intent to
export bowling lanes valued at over 10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 20 private enterprises that have been granted trade
licenses are engaged in a whole range of industries including
animal feed, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, construction
materials, textiles and garments, the light industry, electronics,
machinery and computer software.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, president of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, said the change offers "great encouragement" to
non-state businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said various types of businesses should enjoy equal
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Vice-minister Sun Zhenyu said that the foreign trade
handling system will be changed from a licensing system to a
registration system. He also noted that private firms will be
granted much greater authority.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Surges One U.S. Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was on a
roll Tuesday, holding fast to Monday night gains and getting a
boost from continued pressure on the U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen and the euro.
</P>
<P>
At the close of local trade the Australian dollar was buying
62.43 U.S. cents compared with 61.47 late Monday.
</P>
<P>
It sustained a range from 62.06 - in early business - to close
near the high of 62.48.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar probed Tuesday below 111 Japanese yen in Tokyo,
for the first time in six months, while the euro enjoyed more
strength in its second day of trading.
</P>
<P>
The euro was buying 1.8924 Australian dollars from 1.9163 at
the close Monday, and the Australian currency was trading at 69.52
Japanese yen from 69.72 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a search for diversification, now that 11 European
currencies have become subsets of the euro, could prove to be a
bull point for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"It's been basically quite bullish," Tim Sholl, currency
advisor with Bell Commodities said of trading on the day.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics published the balance on
goods and services trade, revealing a November deficit of 980
million Australian dollars (602.7 million U.S. dollars),
seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Sholl said there was minimal impact on the currency from the
figures which were within expectations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Deputy PM Leaves for Jordan to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel left here for Jordan
Tuesday on a ground-breaking visit to repair strained bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel, who is also minister of state for Cabinet Affairs,
is the highest-ranking Kuwaiti official to visit Jordan since the
1991 Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
Kuwait's official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two Arab states soured after Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait because Amman, along with a few other Arab states, sided
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A rapprochement process began in May 1997 when Kuwait declared
it "likes to improve ties with all Arab countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Since then the two countries have exchanged a number of
middle-level visits.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Al-Dekheel said that during his one-day visit, he
will meet Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal and deliver him
a message from Kuwaiti Prime Minister Crown Prince Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on bilateral relations and regional
developments.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said Sunday he had extended invitation
to his Jordanian counterpart Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib to visit
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Not to Lessen Indonesia's Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis will not
lessen Indonesia's role and commitment in making a new world order
economy, which will be more just and equal for all countries in
the world, said President B.J. Habibie here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his state address to the House of Representatives, Habibie
said Indonesia has tried to put cooperation on a firm footing in
order to avoid a similar (economic crisis) experience in the
future.
</P>
<P>
In this case, he said, the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
summit in Durban, South Africa, in September last year proposed
the idea to hold an International Conference for Development
Financing.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at reviewing the global financial
crisis and efforts to prevent a further bad effect. In addition,
NAM keeps its commitment for economic cooperation as its agenda in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),
which held a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on November 1998,
agreed upon efforts to recover the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed to improve financial aid for the social
safety net, provide job opportunities, trade facilities, and
efforts to increase foreign capital and strengthen the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the president said, leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held a summit in
Hanoi, Vietnam, in December 1998 and through the Hanoi Declaration
they agreed to accelerate economic reform in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian head of state said efforts aiming at
consolidating international cooperation through global and
regional cooperation forums should be maintained in a bid to
remain actively involved in the global economy, and the
liberalization process as "we enter the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
In line with the mandate of the state constitution preamble,
Habibie said, efforts aimed at improving international cooperation
would still be a priority in implementing the country's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
In this globalization era, cooperation among countries is a
basic need, as there is no single country which is able to settle
all its problems alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world's problems tend to be more complex and no longer
acknowledge boundaries, and achieving settlements requires joint
management and cooperation among countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
With such a background, South-South cooperation has a central
role in international relations, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation forums, Indonesia will be able to keep on
playing an active role in boosting the realization of the mutual
cooperation principle, and make the NAM an actual and responsive
movement, he added.

MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso surged to a
new high of 38.00 against the U.S. dollar at the close of trading

</P>

other regional currencies, such as the Japanese yen, which

<HEADLINE> Criminal Suspects Can Be Informed of Rights: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese audiences have often
seemed rather puzzled when watching foreign movies they heard
police saying to arrested suspects, "You have the right to remain
silent, otherwise whatever you say will be used in court as
evidence."
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Chinese prosecutors are to introduce such
practices when dealing with suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree issued by the Supreme People's
Procuratorate (SPP), prosecutors must verbally inform criminal
suspects, witnesses, and victims of their legitimate rights when
interrogating them, and at the same time make available for
scrutiny related legal documents and certificates.
</P>
<P>
"This reform is a major judicial step to facilitate the
development of a democratic political system, better protect the
human rights of citizens and curb violent and rude behavior in
prosecutors," said Zhang Qiong, deputy procurator-general of the
SPP.
</P>
<P>
"As an example," he said at a press conference, "when a
prosecutor tells a suspect that he is entitled not to have a
confession forced out of him, how can the prosecutor, therefore,
torture him?"
</P>
<P>
He went on to give another example, pointing out that it is
provided under the Criminal Procedural Law that a suspect has the
right to legal counsel when he is under investigation, but the law
does not say that he should be informed of this right.
</P>
<P>
But under the new decree, it is the prosecutor's duty to
mention this right to a suspect.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also explained that based on the criminal procedural law,
defense attorneys have the right to consult, make extracts of and
copy related documents and technical proofs. And the new order by
the SPP says that prosecution offices are obliged to provide
necessary conditions for defense attorneys to exercise their legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
The order says that all parties involved may appeal against
prosecutors not fulfilling their duty to inform, and those who
violate this rule and obstruct justice shall themselves be brought
to answer in a court of law.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Profit taking, weak Asian
markets and arbitraging combined Tuesday to send the Australian
share market on a late tumble into negative territory, brokers
said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries came off a more-than-20-point lead
earlier in the day to close 17 points lower at 2,815.6.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Michael Baker said the sharp

<P>
Dealers also said weakness in Japan did have an impact Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei 225 index closed down 183.15 points at 13,232.74,
reflecting rising concern over how the yen's current strength will
negatively affect the market, dealers said.

HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (HKIFA) said here Tuesday that the unit trust industry
registered net inflows of 170.67 million U.S. dollars in November,
the third month in a row for the industry to register net inflow.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Targets Zero Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is set to realize
the zero poverty objective, especially among peninsular
Malaysians, by the year 2000 for which the government would
intensify poverty eradication measures, Rural Development Minister
Annuar Musa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Malaysians who are below the poverty line dropped
to 70,000 at the end of last year from 120,000 in 1995 and of the
number, only 59,000 were registered with his ministry, Annuar told
a news conference after launching the ministry's smart card system
here.
</P>
<P>
"We've allowed for a difference of 11,000 unregistered poor
taking into account the current economic downturn," he said.
</P>
<P>
By attaining zero poverty means recording 0.5 percent poverty
level out of the country's population by taking into account the
aged and handicapped who could not afford to look after
themselves, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, citizens are deemed to be below the poverty line
if they earn less than 250 ringgit (66 U.S. dollars) a month, an
income level the government fixed for the hard-core poor.
</P>
<P>
Annuar said the slow progress in improving the lot of the
hard-core poor in Sabah and Sarawak, the two states in East
Malaysia, was because they were mostly living in the interior and
not involved in viable economic activities and his ministry
planned to overcome this by opening up oil palm estates specially
for the hard-core poor.

Emirates (UAE) was 47.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, down 36
percent from 1997, it was announced by the UAE Minister of
Planning Sheikh Hameed Bin Ahmed Al Moalla.
</P>
<P>
The minister also revealed a decline in the UAE trade balance
surplus to 2.3 billion dollars in 1998, down from 6.1 billion
dollars in 1996, due to the drop in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian exports in the first nine months of 1998 was
1.7 billion dollars, down 29 percent from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official sources, reported Tuesday's "Al Hayat" daily,
attributed the decline to the drop in world oil prices. Syria's
revenues from oil exports alone fell from 1.1 billion dollars to
85.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Eleven of Saudi Arabian banks have initiated current
accounts in euros. Likewise, the Saudi banks started to issue
letters of credit in euros to traders and importers.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's "Al Hayat" quotes Saudi banker Hassan Al Shamri as
saying that businessmen in Saudi Arabia have made early
preparations to deal with the new currency, particularly those
having business links with European states.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the exchange rate in Saudi Arabia would be
calculated on the basis of transferring the Saudi rials to dollars
or any other European currency, and then into euros.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Aluminium Bahrain (Alba) became one of the world's
few smelters to have reached the milestone of producing
half-a-million tonnes of aluminium in a year, the Khaleej Times
reported on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Defuses 58 Duds Dropped by U.S., Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi experts have defused 58
duds dropped on state and private facilities by the U.S. and
Britain in last month's air strikes against Iraq, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Director of General Civil Defense Directorate
Qasem Mohammed Nori as saying that Iraqi experts have defused 39
duds in Baghdad, one in Qadissiya province, three in Wassit
province, eight in Basra province, five in Thi-qar province and
two in Babaylon Province.
</P>
<P>
Nori urged children not to play with strange objects and to
inform concerned authorities of any suspected materials they find.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain fired over 500 missiles in their four
consecutive nights of air strikes against Iraq on December 16-19
with the declared aim of punishing Iraq for non-cooperation in
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, set off by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to ensure Baghdad's elimination
of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that many of the bombs the U.S. and Britain
dropped are duds that posed threat to civilians.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Financial Policy Is Crucial to China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An efficient financial policy
played a crucial role in helping China's achieve its 1998 economic
growth target, according to a recent issue of Guangdong and Hong
Kong Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the issuing of an additional 100 billion
yuan in treasury bonds and the decision to invest in
infrastructure construction played a key role in reversing the
downslide of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
From a long-term point of view, the effectiveness of the
financial policy should be evaluated by whether it can build up
people's confidence and by how much it can arouse the initiative
of private investors rather than by how much government investment
can spur the economy, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent central work conference on economy,
China will continue to implement a positive financial policy in
1999, which is aimed at boosting the economy, building up
confidence and accumulating experience.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal, China should continue to expand its
financial expenditure this year and increase the ratio of
financial revenues to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
But economists suggest less direct investment by the government
would be more beneficial and to encourage small government
investment with discounts, which may bring in much larger social
investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economists say that the financial policy may play a
greater role in promoting the growth of exports by further raising
the export rebate rate and simplifying rebate procedures.

<HEADLINE> UNAIDS Expresses Sorrow Over Killing of SAfrican AIDS Activist. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The head of a United Nations
agency on HIV/AIDS has expressed his condolences to the family of
a South African woman beaten to death after she admitted she had
HIV last December.
</P>
<P>
"It is with great sorrow that I learnt about the tragic death
of Ms Gugu Dlamini, a volunteer of the National Association of
People living with HIV/AIDS," said Peter Piot, Executive Director
of UNAIDS in a letter to South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"She was one of the many unsung heroes of the daily struggle
against HIV," said the chief of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS, in the letter made public here Tuesday. "The
death reminds us how stigmatizing a disease AIDS still is, and
how much courage it takes for people with HIV to be open about
their condition."
</P>
<P>
According to UNAIDS, Dlamini was beaten on December 12 and
died the following day after revealing her HIV status during a
commemoration of World AIDS Day on December 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
For all the palpable effects of AIDS, UNAIDS said, a silence
born of shame and blame continues to shroud the epidemic in many
of even the hardest-hit countries.

torn down and that the anonymous construction site he was standing
next to was where it once had been.
</P>
<P>
Many Beijingers now often say that the city is no longer the
one they were familiar with, for many of the "hutongs", which
housed communities of close-knit families for many generations
have been flattened and the sites were used to build department
stores, metro stations, and commercial and financial streets.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing Municipal Place Name Office
admitted that hutongs are disappearing, but added that if such old
fashioned buildings are not demolished there will be no space in
the city for building new sky scrapers and modern facilities.
</P>
<P>
The word "hutong" has been widely used in Beijing ever since
the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and another official said that its
original meaning was "well".
</P>
<P>
He explained that in ancient times Beijing was short of water
and people usually lived near "wells" where a source of water
could be found. When building houses, a passage was often left
between them and hutongs gradually formed as more and more people
came to live alongside them and the passageways became longer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qingchang, a linguist, said that "hutong" in Chinese
originated from "huto" in Mongolian which also means "well". But
over a long period of time the word changed to mean "streets and
lanes".
</P>
<P>
Most of the hutongs, the typical urban lanes of Beijing, were
built around the famous Forbidden City, and there were several
thousand of them in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties.

<HEADLINE> Will Beijing's "Hutong" Vanish? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that there were 3,200 hutongs in Beijing in
1944, but the figure has dropped to 990 today. In the Xicheng
District, more than 260 hutongs have disappeared since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The existing hutongs still account for one-third of Beijing's
urban area, where nearly half of the urban population lives.
</P>
<P>
A section chief with Beijing Municipal Place Name Office said
that the "disappearance" of the hutongs is a reflection of the way
in which the ancient culture of Beijing is vanishing. Moreover, he
revealed, that the situation has created many difficulties for the
postal services, as well affecting the existence of certain place
names in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yong, general manager of the Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency,
said that while Beijing can boast of world-famous historic sites
such as the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the Temple of
Heaven, it also has, although nowadays only to a certain extent,
the magic of "hutongs" and "quadrangles", which he believes are a
major part of the city's traditions and culture.
</P>
<P>
Xu launched a "hutong sight-seeing" tour in 1994, which has
proved to be a great success.
</P>
<P>
Now the local government has drawn up a series of plans to
protect and modernize the remaining hutongs and quadrangles.
</P>
<P>
However, some residents who have lived in them for a long time
do not want to leave, for they say they will miss the happy life
they enjoyed there, with great harmony and communal care.
</P>
<P>
But there are others who want to move into new apartment
buildings as soon as possible because they hate the poor living
conditions and old fashioned water supplies and heating facilities
in hutongs.
</P>
<P>
Fan Yaobang, a senior planner of the Beijing Institute of City
Planning and Design, disclosed that with the approval of the State
Council, Beijing has now listed 25 historic culture protection
zones, 19 of which are hutongs and quadrangles.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that protecting hutongs and quadrangles also maintains
the integrity and historical traditions of the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's 1999/2000 fiscal
year budget for the health sector has reached 3.5 trillion rupiah
(467 million U.S. dollars), up 400 million rupiah from that of the
previous year, President B.J. Habibie said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget will be used to support social safety net programs
that improve public health, the president said when submitting the
draft state budget at the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
The total budget for 1999/2000 fiscal year is 218.2 trillion
rupiah (29 billion U.S. dollars).

<P>
Health programs, he said, are aimed at developing public health
through basic health services and support for poor people, such as
aid for the costs of surgery, maintenance of public health centers
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
For midwife services, the budget will be used to provide a
supply of medicine and vaccines. There is also the prevention of
communicable diseases through the immunization of 4.4 million
babies, 4.8 million pregnant mothers, and 25 million school
children.
</P>
<P>
In addition, prevention for non-communicable diseases,

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Falling in Tokyo on Yen's Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua)-- Stock prices continued dropping in
Tokyo Tuesday, dragged down by the Japanese yen's further
appreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 183.15 points, or 1.37
percent, from Monday's close to end at 13,232.74.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering
all First Section issues, dropped 16.59 points or 1.56 percent to
1,048.33.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 340.86
million shares from Monday's 118.40 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The stronger yen weighed down particularly on exporters, such
as electrical equipment makers and automakers, while banks also
lost ground due to investors'concern that the Japanese currency's
rise will negatively affect the foreign currency-denominated
assets of financial institutions, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar slipped below 111 yen temporarily and was
traded at 111.37-40 yen at 3 p.m. (local time), down from
113.85-88 yen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they expect the key Nikkei index to approach the
October 9, 1998 close of 12,879,97, the lowest close since
December 10,1985, if the dollar further falls against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 829 to 299, with 147 issues ending unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The majority of stock holders in
Shanghai, China's largest economic and financial center, made
losses in 1998, with only 19 percent making money and 20.5 percent
breaking even.
</P>
<P>
A survey carred out by a number of provincial securities
companies, including Hubei Securities, Jiangsu Securities and
Sichuan Securities, found that only 0.05 percent of shareholders
saw their investments appreciate by over 30 percent while a
quarter watched them fall in value by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey discovered that very few held onto their stocks for
more than two years and that 14.92 percent of the holders polled
held onto them for about a year.
</P>
<P>
While a small minority, 0.08 percent, held onto stocks for less
than a week, 51.5 percent keep them from one to three months, and
a further 14.92 percent for about six months.
</P>
<P>
When the decision has to be made whether to hold, buy or sell
stocks, 15 percent of the traders surveyed said they relied on
technical analysis and information disclosed by the listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 31 percent of traders depend on media reports
and analysis of the stock markets while some 20 percent actually
don't trust media reports, preferring to believe in their own
judgement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Unveils Budget for 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Tuesday unveiled a tightened and balanced draft state
budget for the 1999/2000 fiscal year starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
In his address to table the draft state budget to the House of
Representatives here, Habibie submitted a 218.2038-trillion-rupiah
(29 billion U.S. dollars) draft budget, a 17.3 percent decline
from the current budget.
</P>
<P>
The government foresees zero economic growth for the 1999/2000
fiscal year, compared with the drastic contraction of 12 percent
estimated for the current fiscal year ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
He predicted inflation at 17 percent compared with the 77.63
percent forecast for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government's draft state budget assumes that the rupiah
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is 7,500 rupiah, compared
with 10,600 in the current fiscal year, and the market price per
barrel of oil will be 10.50 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who replaced former president Soeharto following his
resignation from office on May 21, said the assumptions that his
administration used in preparing this draft budget seem
conservative.
</P>
<P>
"The assumptions are conservative because we can possibly
achieve a better condition of life (this year) if we can restore
stability and order as a result of hard work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state further said the draft budget still reflected
"gloomy economic conditions" because, with the zero economic
growth factor, the government might not be able to create job
opportunities for the people.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged economic recession that Indonesia has been
undergoing since mid-July 1997 has caused decreasing oil and gas
revenues, but non-oil and non-gas revenues are expected to go up
to 20.3 percent or similar to 119.8 trillion rupiah this year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing non-oil and non-gas revenue came from the rise
of income tax by 57.2 percent and value added tax by 19.9 percent,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The government allocated 2.27 trillion rupiah for security and
defense. The budget for the Armed Forces will be used for the
improvement of its defense capability, the skill of its personnel,
and other activities relating to state security.
</P>
<P>
The government also showed its strong commitment to dealing
with the social impact of the current financial crisis by
increasing its budget for the social-safety-net program. That
amount is to reach 3.5 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The social-safety-net program, the president said, would cover
additional food for school children, rural development, primary
school, and public health center maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed his plan to establish the People's
Economic Institute in charge of coordinating the people's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The new budget also put priority to the development of small
industry and cooperatives which could absorb a huge labor force.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives will then deliberate the draft
budget and pass it into law.
</P>
<P>
Unlike during the 32-year rule of Soeharto, the Jakarta Post
said, the government is likely to face a challenge from the house
before the budget is approved.
</P>
<P>
Under Soeharto, the legislative body gained notoriety as the
government's rubber stamp, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The country's fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends on March
31 next year.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided through the state budget plan 1999/2000 to allocate 17.07
billion rupiah (2.26 million U.S. dollars) for international
cooperation in the field of politics, economy, society and
culture.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie in his state address announced here
Tuesday that the budget aims to regain Indonesian stature in the
international community and also to prevent a negative perception
about the country, particularly on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the budget will finance bilateral, regional and
multilateral cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's total balanced budget for 1999/2000 fiscal year
was 218.2 trillion rupiah (29 billion U.S. dollars), a 17.3
percent decrease from that of previous year.
</P>
<P>
The budget for international affairs is also to finance
technical cooperation among developing countries, and to increase
national endurance through active participation in international
forums that seek to stop nuclear testing and ban chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the information, communication, and mass media
sector, the government allocates 129.8 billion rupiah, Habibie
added.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Sales in Zambia Drops Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The sales of Coca-Cola produced by Zambia
Bottlers, the manufacturer of the soft drinks of the transnational Coco-
Cola Company, have fallen by 75 percent in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Monday in Lusaka by Ian Ackerman, managing director
of Zambia Bottlers, who attributed the fall in sales to the uncompetitively
high price of the locally produced Coca-Cola compared to the same beverages
manufactured in the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A leading independent newspaper, The Post, Tuesday quoted Ackerman as
saying that drinks from Zimbabwe and Malawi have been flooding the Zambian
market, disadvantaging those locally produced.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the development has led to the non-functioning
of his company depots in some border areas where foreign drinks are
flooding into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In some most affected areas such as the southern tourism city
Livingstone and Chipata, an eastern town which borders Malawi, the selling
of local products has completely stopped due to cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
The depressed business has also resulted in the scaling down of the
company's production by 75 percent, said the managing director.
</P>
<P>
Ackerman said his company is still awaiting the Zambian government's
consideration of a favorable duty structure on carbonated drinks.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zambian government awarded the company a duty reduction
from 25 percent to five percent on its production on condition that it
would invest 78 million U.S. Dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
The incentive was withdrawn soon after Edith Nawakwi was appointed
finance minister. She maintained that the offer to the Coco-Cola company
was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
This enabled Zambia Bottlers to hike the price of Coco-Cola from 500 to
900 Kwacha (one U.S. Dollars equals to about 2500 Kwacha at present) last
September. But the company has not benefited from the move and it's
business is shrinking rapidly due to increased prices.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Banks Alert over Euro Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's banking sector and businesses
have remained alert to the possible effects of the newly launched Euro
currency.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening money markets Monday after the long holidays,
many of the local bank operators opened trading with more caution against
the Euro, the East African Standard reported Tuesday .
</P>
<P>
National Bank's senior finance officer Susan Muthune said commercial
banks and other players in the local financial sector had taken the
necessary actions to ensure that the change to the European single currency
did not have adverse effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are monitoring how the new currency is picking up in Europe and
although we have our expectations, we would only be able to give a more
informed opinion by mid this week," she said.
</P>
<P>
 The Euro, which became the common currency for 11 European nations
last Friday, was expected to start trading Monday at about 1.665 U.S.
Dollars or 133 Japanese Yen and 70 British Pence.
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe the change, if not properly managed, may adversely
affect the economy although the magnitude and direction of the change would
depend on whether Kenya's trading position with the Euro area is
classified as a net importer or net exporter.
</P>
<P>
 Another fear is that Kenyan businesses may as yet not known much of
the effects of the currency change with the European buyer or supplier
having more information.
</P>
<P>
 According to Town and Country Securities executive director Douglas
Wekhomba, the impact of the new currency on Kenyan businesses will not be
great in the short term.
</P>
<P>
 Although the currency immediately came into use for non-cash
transactions ranging from government bond issues to credit card and check
purchases, it will not be until 2002 that Euro notes and coins will be
issued to replace individual European currencies.

<HEADLINE> China Resorts to New, Renewable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China is to give priority to
developing new and renewable energy from solar, wind, geothermal
and tidal sources in a bid to meet the fast-growing demand for
energy.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country's annual demand and usage of new and
renewable energy has reached 300 million tons of coal, accounting
for a quarter of the total national consumption of primary energy
and over 47 percent of energy consumption in rural areas,
according to Shi Dinghuan, director general of the High- and New-
Technology Development Department of the Ministry of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the China-EU Energy and Sustainable Development
Conference, which opened here today, Shi revealed that China has
been acclaimed worldwide for its adoption of small-hydro power
plants. Nearly 7,000 such stations have been set up with a total
generating capacity of 20 million kw, generating more than 50
billion kwh of electricity, accounting for 25 percent of the total
that can be exploited.
</P>
<P>
In terms of making better use of sunshine, China now has 5
million sq m of solar heaters, 6 million sq m of fixed solar
panels on houses, 40,000 sq m of solar-heated greenhouses and
140,000 solar-heated stoves.
</P>
<P>
Wind energy has also been used widely for major electricity
generating projects. Currently, 160,000 small domestic and rural
wind generators are in use with a combined capacity of 50,000 kw,
mostly located in remote agricultural areas, mountainous regions
and coastal islands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has imported medium to large wind generators
from Denmark, the Netherlands, and the USA to equip 15 power
plants, which have 120 sets of generating units with a total
capacity of 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Shi told the conference that China is also rich in tidal
energy, with 90 percent being sourced off the coastal areas of
Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. Ten tidal power stations have been
built nationwide with a total capacity of nearly 20,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China has now drawn up a series of laws and
rules to support the development of new and renewable energy
sources.
</P>
<P>
He added that China and the EU have cooperated widely in
developing energy projects. Already, they have jointly held over
100 training seminars about energy saving and development as well
as looking into new coal technology. They have also published more
than 40 research papers dedicated to energy technologies and
policies.

<HEADLINE> Shoppers Spend $1.2 Billion On AOL System During Holidays. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- About 1.25 million of 15
million subscribers shopped through American Online (AOL) during
last year's holiday shopping season that ran from the day after
Thanksgiving to December 27, reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Subscribers spent about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars shopping on
line during the holidays as consumers increasingly shifted from
mall shopping to Internet surfing to find perfect gifts, said
Wendy Goldberg, spokeswoman of AOL, the world's largest Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
Based on the number of hits on its shopping Web pages, the AOL
spokeswoman said its "Toys, Kids and Babies" category was the
most popular, followed closely by apparel, the most popular
online shopping destination last year.
</P>
<P>
"Online shopping is really becoming a key part of the way
people shop," Goldberg said, "It's a new way for people to shop,
and it's really only beginning."
</P>
<P>
Internet Research Group estimated that the average AOL shopper
bought two items a week online during the holiday season while
online sales for clothing more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
With the holidays over, AOL hopes its subscribers can still
surf the Mega-Clearance Sale. The company expects the strong
holiday sales to translate into steady business for its retail
partners through the coming year.

overcoming it and making every effort to control it. Many
countries appreciated their efforts fighting against the drugs,"
said Woon Sui Kut, member of FINA Technical Committee who is here
to attend a two-day World Cup short-course leg.
</P>
<P>
Woon has also welcomed the Chinese swimmers who served
two-year bans after the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994 and came
back to the international level competitions.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guoming, 25, was back in winning form to claim victory
in the men's 200 meters individual medley and his teammate Fu
Yong won a gold medal in the men's 200 meters backstroke at
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"They served the two-year punishment, and have learned a
lesson. We are happy that they can still make good results in a
healthy way, without cheating," the Singaporean said.
</P>
<P>
China, who dispatched a young line-up to last month's Asian
Games, won 13 gold medals, trailing by two golds behind their
Japanese rivals who atopped the swimming gold tally with 15 golds.
</P>
<P>
"The young generation in Chinese swimming is very good, but I
think there were still many good swimmers not come to Bangkok
Asian Games," Woon said. "China is preparing its young swimmers
for the 2000 Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Women's freestyle expert Le Jingyi and backstroke veteran He
Cihong, both world record holders, did not compete in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Woon said FINA's decision to introduce the semi-finals at
Sydney Olympics followed the "right trend."
</P>
<P>
"The semi-finals is good for development. FINA is always
trying to improve the standard of swimming, not only for the
swimmers, but also for the public and of course television."
</P>
<P>
Woon said all the international and regional championships
should follow the suits. FINA hopes more countries can produce
champions under the new schedule of semi-finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian, in
a meeting here today with the former United States Assistant
Defense Secretary Joseph Nye, discussed bilateral relations and
security issues in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chi appreciated Nye's efforts in promoting Sino-U.S. relations,
saying that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries and it
is a general trend for the two countries to establish and develop
their friendly ties that conform to the fundamental interests of
the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 20-year diplomatic ties testify to the fact
that only by observing the rules of the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques can bilateral relations have healthy, stable and
smooth development.
</P>
<P>
Nye said that he is optimistic about the long-term development
of the bilateral ties and the two countries have more common
interests than differences and that the smooth development of
bilateral relations can be assured if the two countries handle
their differences with frankness and friendliness.
</P>
<P>
Nye is now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University, which has had over 100 students from China, thanks to
the Nina Kung China Project, and is about to receive a third group
of Chinese army officials in March.
</P>
<P>
He said that multi-level exchanges between the two countries
and their military services are of vital importance to solving any
possible contradictions that may occur.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Trade Deficit Suggests Gloomy Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Another one billion Australian
dollars (615 million U.S. dollars) trade deficit and a fall in
business expectations Tuesday raised expectations of a gloomier
economic outlook for Australia this year.
</P>
<P>
Balance on goods and services (BOGS) trade data published by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed a November
deficit of 980 million Australian dollars (602.7 million U.S.
dollars) seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Exports for November fell four percent to 9.427 billion
Australian dollars (5.80 billion U.S. dollars), while imports
dropped five percent to 10.408 billion Australian dollars (6.40
billion U.S. dollars), due mainly to lower imports of gold and
motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The ABS data also found that businesses expected profits to
fall by 7.3 percent in the March quarter, and businesses forecast
operating income to drop by 0.9 percent and employment by 0.7
percent during the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Continuing high deficit was likely to focus financial markets
on Australia's growing current account deficit and could influence
a further cut in official interest rates by the Reserve Bank,
which last month lowered rates by a quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said low
commodity prices and the relative strength of imports over exports
would continue to put further pressure on the trade deficit,
"Australia's trade position shapes as the bogey for 1999," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said the
November BOGS figure was "not out of the ordinary". He also said,
"It shows there can be no complacency and that we need to push on
with export diversification."
</P>
<P>
The ABS said exports to Japan, Australia's largest market, fell
13 percent to their lowest level in seven months, exports to
Singapore were up 43 percent on the previous month, but were still
down 19 percent in the first 11 months of last year compared with
the corresponding period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Overall exports to the 10 major trading partners in the Asian
region were down seven percent for the first 11 months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But exports to the European Union reached an eight-year high of
13.7 percent in the year to November, highlighting the importance
of export diversification.

<HEADLINE> 5 Die in Kenya for Lacking Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Five people were reported to have starved
to death as famine occurred in Ibrahim area in Wajir District,
northeast Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened Monday, after which the Kenyan government pledged
that it would not allow any Kenyan to starve to death, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 civic leaders in the district claimed that famine had
killed people, saying that many other residents of the area faced
starvation caused by the failure of rains for more than one-and-a-half
years.
</P>
<P>
 The Wajir leaders also said drought and diseases were taking their
toll on livestock and large herds of cattle were dying in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
 Many people in the accessible interior were threatened by starvation
and thirst, the leaders said, urging the government for urgent supplies of
food, water and drugs to save lives.
</P>
<P>
 Permanent Secretary Peter Matui in the Office of the President said
the government had started distributing relief food to areas threatened by
famine.
</P>
<P>
 The most drought-affected are parts of Eastern, North Eastern, Rift
Valley and Nyanza provinces in the country, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
 Kenya last suffered a major drought in 1994 after the long and short
rains turned out poorly. Experts said famine looms in parts of Kenya after
the El-Nino weather phenomenon which is always followed by a long dry
season referred to as the La Nina.

<HEADLINE> Brother of Ugandan President Attacks MPs on Bank Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's
younger brother Salim Saleh, who had reportedly bought the Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) through illegal means, attacked members of parliament
 for coming out with a biased report on his UCB deal.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who resigned recently as senior presidential advisor on defense
and security, made the remarks during an interview Monday with the New
Vision daily, the paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The investigation report released on December 8, 1998, by
parliament had branded him a thief and grossly tarnished his reputation,
the 38-year-old major general was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was also critical of the New Vision, saying it had lost vision by
publishing so many negative stories about him. He accused the paper's
editors of colluding with politicians and using reporters to fight their
war.
</P>
<P>
He said he was busy doing business now and waiting for the results of
his Senior Four Examinations.
</P>
<P>
Saleh had helped Museveni fight for liberation during the bush war
for years and has been regarded as a big hero among the general public.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of being lack of the academic qualifications required
for a minister when the president tried to appointed him to be the state
minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that he was involved in several military equipment
purchase scandals and bought UCB through the back door.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: Former Govt Neglects Supremacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said here Tuesday that the law has not been upheld well by
the former government headed by Soeharto, so that lawlessness,
such as corruption, collusion and nepotism, has prevailed.
</P>
<P>
It is thus high time for all Indonesians to restore the law,
the president said when presenting the proposed State Budget for
fiscal year 1999-2000 before the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
In his address, Habibie warned the people of intervention from
the executive level in the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
Lawlessness will affect the behavior of all sectors, he said,
adding that people should be aware that they must uphold the law
in their social and national life.
</P>
<P>
"We should uphold national discipline which is in line with
present circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie stressed five factors of the judicial system -- the
subject matter of laws and regulations, the means and
infrastructure of law, human resources in the security sector,
public awareness of the law and the leadership of a president who
should improve the function of the law for the sake of the people.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 230.1 billion rupiah (306 million
U.S. dollars) from a total budget of 218.2 trillion rupiah (29
billion U.S. dollars) for the program to develop and uphold the
law during 1999-2000 fiscal year, marking a 38 percent increase
compared with that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The budget will give priority to the implementation and
upholding of the law, human rights and security.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports EU Enlargement: Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said here Monday that Germany supports the enlargement of
the European Union (EU) as a major task of the bloc following its
launch of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with his Austrian counterpart Wolfgang
Schuessel, Fischer told reporters that Germany, as always, is an
"advocate" of the idea of expanding the EU to include some
Central and East European nations.
</P>
<P>
As Germany is to take over from Austria the rotating EU
presidency in the year's first half, Fischer and Schuessel
discussed the handover issue and the EU's financing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Saying it's necessary to readjust financial contributions
among the 15 EU member states, Fischer expressed Germany's wish
to lower its net financial contribution to the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 2000 for the EU's reform will be a priority issue
in the first half of 1999, he said, adding that financing and
restructuring are crucial to the EU's capability to enlarge.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said Germany and Austria will push forward the EU's
enlargement process for their own sakes, as it will not only
benefit the two economies, but also help achieve Europe's
political stability.

<HEADLINE> India Increases Duty on Gold Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to collect additional
revenues and reverse the trade imbalance, the Indian government
has increased customs duty on gold imports by 60 percent effective
from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Through this measure, official sources said, the government
hoped to raise additional revenue of 2.5 billion rupees (595
million U.S. dollars) in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
Customs duty on the yellow metal was increased from 250 to 400
rupees (from 5.95 to 9.52 U.S. dollars) per 10 grams.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said Monday that increasing
gold import was the main reason for the widening trade deficit
which had reached 6.7 billion U.S. dollars from April to November
last year.
</P>
<P>
Gold import in the country was officially projected to touch 7
billion U.S. dollars, next only to oil imports of 7.5 billion U.S.
dollars, by the end of March, the last month of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of quantity, gold imports through official channels
from January to November 1998 crossed 575 tons, or a 28 percent
hike in the inflows that were experienced in the corresponding
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said this unprecedented rise in gold import had
caused some worry as it would further widen the trade deficit and
cause an outflow of precious dollars in a year of slower capital
inflows from abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, with the increase of import duty, investigating
agencies fear that smuggling in gold or inflows through unofficial
channels would shoot up.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the premium on gold imports is hovering anywhere
between 2 and 3 percent as against 12 percent in 1997.

<P>
GUIYANG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China has begun monitoring the
air quality at scenic Huangguoshu Waterfall, the largest waterfall
in Guizhou Province's Anshun Prefecture, the first time that the
country has monitored air quality at a state-level scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
The country has been monitoring the air quality at 40 large and
medium-sized cities and publishes the results of big city reports
weekly of the air pollution index of suspended particles, sulfur
dioxide, and water quality.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say they believe that the monitoring of air and water
quality at the scenic spot will encourage environmental protection
and development.

<HEADLINE> New Military Service Law Frees Up Age Limitations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent amendment to China's
Military Service Law means that those between the ages of 29-35
can be included in the first-class reserves which previously only
accepted former service personnel and militiamen between 18 and 28.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, introduced at the end of last year, has made
more flexible the Military Service Law first passed in 1984, which
stipulated that the older army reserves would be designated as
second class.
</P>
<P>
It will also help China's armed forces meet modern day
requirements.
</P>
<P>
In the past a large number of ex-servicemen, though very
proficient and competent, were excluded from the reserves once
they had passed 28 years of age, which was having an impact on
China's ability to cope with the needs of today's high-tech
warfare.
</P>
<P>
Now the first-class sector of the reserves can also include
those former personnel below the age of 35, such as highly
qualified technicians whose specialities are vital, and those
below 28 who would automatically be listed in active army reserves.
</P>
<P>
Military officials say that the change will improve standards
throughout all of the reserve forces, in particular with the use
of trained technicians, as well as ensuring that any mobilization
for war can be carried out smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Price Stopper on Oil Find in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Testing has proved that the
Maari-1 offshore oil well off Taranaki in the western part of New
Zealand's North Island can produce flow rates of 4,400 barrels a
day, more than seven times that of previous wells in the area,
according to recent reports in the local media.
</P>
<P>
"We are tickled pink. All our pre-drill expectations have been
exceeded," said Don Beard, managing director of Australian
explorer Cultus Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Although the Maari-1 oil well has the potential to be New
Zealand's biggest oil find yet, it is unlikely Cultus and its New
Zealand partners, the Shell-Todd petroleum mining companies, will
hurry development decisions given that world oil prices are near
22-year lows, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Shell Petroleum Mining technical manager Peter Hazledine was
quoted as saying, "Certainly those sort of flow rates, three or
four years ago, with a higher oil price, for sure, it would be
developed."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed a final decision on development would be made some
time this year, depending mainly on the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The well is being suspended in the meantime, though not
abandoned, he said, adding the well could be opened up again.
</P>
<P>
With any development likely to take two years or longer,
Maari-1 oil may not be flowing until 2001 at the earliest, the
local media said.

WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- While the total road toll for
 1998 was 503 people, the lowest since 1964, the road toll during
the Christmas-New Year holidays From December 24 to January 5
reached 22.
</P>
<P>
According to the local media, speed and alcohol were mainly
blamed for car crashes. Not wearing seatbelts was also a factor
of causing death.
</P>
<P>
Last year's holiday road toll was 26, the same as in the
1995-1996 holiday season.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, Tuesday also quoted
Executive Director Alan Muir of the New Zealand Water Safety
Council as saying that 10 people drowned during the holiday
period, ending a bad year for swimmers and boaties.
</P>
<P>
According to Muir, 136 people drowned last year, down on the
average of 143 for the 1990s, and 84 percent of the victims were
male.
</P>
<P>
January is traditionally the worst month for drowning and New
Zealand has one of the highest drowning rates in the developed
world and twice that of Australia, Muir said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Introduces Faster Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Intel Monday unveiled two
faster Celeron chips.
</P>
<P>
The two chips, which run at 400 megahertz and 366 megahertz,
were priced at 158 dollars and 123 dollars respectively,
according to a report of the company.
</P>
<P>
The new chips, which use a system of pins to connect to the
PC's innards instead of the single-edged slot design of the
Pentium II, are designed for the low-priced end of the computer
market.
</P>
<P>
The sales of PCs costing less than 1,000 dollars accounted for
59 percent of machines sold at retail in November, according to
PC Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest computer-chip maker has cut the price of
its Celeron chip running at 300A megahertz by 21 percent to 71
dollars and the one running at 333 megahertz by 16 percent to 90
dollars. Intel made small cuts on Pentium II chips running at 350
and 400 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer Corporation and Quantex Microsystems, Inc.,
which use Intel chips in their products, announced late Monday
that they will incorporate the new processors into their products
as soon as possible, offering customers the latest technology at
the best prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is almost a thing of the
past for 123 rural families in Dongfang City in the island Hainan
Province, thanks to the help of the United Nations Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
The families in Datian Township have been chosen to
establish one of the 10 "science and technology poverty-relief
experimental areas" in China under a new UNDP program.
</P>
<P>
It has been designed to provide low-income farmers with the
opportunity to learn modern management techniques, including the
use of technology, in farming their land.
</P>
<P>
Each of the families involved have received small loans from
the UNDP to grow sugarcane and bananas.
</P>
<P>
After a short training scheme they have learned the best ways
for planting and growing such crops. It is estimated that one mu
(15 mu equals to a hectare) of bananas costs 2,000 yuan (some 241
US dollars) to plant and can generate about 3,000 yuan in
profit.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Temperatures Getting Warmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Young girls in the city of
Shanghai love the warmer winter because they can still wear short
skirts, but they may not know that the warmer weather is harmful
to their health.
</P>
<P>
This winter, temperatures in Shanghai haven't dropped below
zero, making it the warmest winter this century, according to
today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Tao Kanghua, a professor of urban ecology at Shanghai Normal
University says that the unusually warm weather can help spread
the flu virus and help insects survive the winter and lead to more
disease outbreaks next year. The layer of warm air above the city
will cause further deterioration in the environment because of the
difficulty in dispersing pollutants.
</P>
<P>
From 1960 to 1990, temperatures in Shanghai in July and August
averaged 28.1 degrees centigrade, with the highest reaching
38.2. But last year, the average temperature for the two-month
period was above 30, and reached 39 degrees at the highest.
</P>
<P>
Scientists warn that the warm winter is as harmful as the
intense heat of summer and that this "greenhouse effect" should be
given closer attention.

<HEADLINE> Infant Death Rate In Liaoning Province Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The infant death rate in rural
areas of northeast China's Liaoning Province has dropped from 35.31
per thousand in 1990 to 28.19, according to the Provincial Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women in rural areas used to give birth with the help
of midwives, resulting in a higher death rate among mothers and
infants. But midwives are going out of business and rural families
prefer to see doctors in township hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Public health departments in the province also provide training
classes for nurses and doctors in gynaecology and maternity wards
and have sent specialists in the field at regular intervals to
analyze the situation.
</P>
<P>
Officials plan to train 1,000 people in midwifery and maternal
and child hygiene in 5 years and 10,000 staff members for rural
areas in one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Governments in the province have also allocated more funds for
maternal and child hygiene in rural areas, with a total of 17

<HEADLINE> What Snacks Urban Residents Eat? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China Consumer's News reported
recently that a survey of 50,000 people conducted in 12 major
Chinese cities shows that those in Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province, are the keenest eaters of snack foods.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the wide availability of various kinds
of snacks and the culture of the city, which is known across the
nation for its leisurely style.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Shenyang, a major industrial city in northeast
China, have the least interest in snack foods, consuming only 65
percent of the average of the 12 cities.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 47 percent of those surveyed bought
candies last year.
</P>
<P>
The percentage for chocolate was 42.7 percent, and ice cream,
66.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the choice of what they eat, Chengdu and Shanghai
people are more inclined to eat savory foods.Cookies are not
very popular in Guangzhou and Kunming although people there like
almost anything. In Beijing and Tianjin, the market for cookies
is big and fewer people prefer candies and savory foods.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing that Wuhan and Nanjing people particularly
like or dislike, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Experts say geographical diversification of the snack market
calls for different marketing strategies by food manufacturers
and distributors to cater for the needs of different regions.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Exports Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite the lingering financial
crisis, Philippines' export revenue grew by 17.3 percent in the
first 11 months of 1998, the National Statistics Office said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report released here, the office said that
aggregate receipts from merchandise exports for the 11-month
period from January to November 1998 grew by 17.3 percent to
26.973 billion U.S. dollars from 22.997 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the office said, receipt for November 1998 increased
only 12 percent to 2.586 billion dollars, an apparent slowdown
from the previous months in the year.
</P>
<P>
The office did not explain the cause of the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Electronics exports accounted for 52.9 percent of the aggregate
revenue in November, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands remained the
Philippines' major export markets in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province's Tax Revenues Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Last year industrial and
commercial tax revenues in central China's Henan Province reached
20 billion yuan, topping the target of 19.9 billion set by the
state had been reached.
</P>
<P>
Taxes on value-added goods and consumer goods were up 15
percent from the 1997 figures to 18.9 billion yuan, a rise of 2.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed Henan's success to stronger
management, the plugging of loopholes, the punishment of
corruption, and getting payments in a more timely manner.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Bureau reported on Monday that China
collected 855.1 billion yuan in tax revenues from the industrial
and commercial sector, up 100.3 billion yuan, or 13.3 percent,
on 1997.
</P>
<P>
The successful report quelled earlier fears that China would
have difficulties in reaching its tax collection goal because of
the negative effect of the financial crisis in Asia and the
devastating summer floods.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Want To Stop Copper Drum Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police plans to get
tough with a new type of crime in the 1990s, the smuggling of
ancient copper drums in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
This comes in response to the large number of drums that have
been taken illegally to Hong Kong or Europe, where they command a
high price.
</P>
<P>
Some copper drums were made as long as 2,000 years ago by
ethnic minorities like the Zhuang, Yao, and Miao for use in
religious ceremonies and social activities and provide information
about the origins of ethnic groups in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ancient copper drums have been found in various parts of the
world, 1,400 of them in Hechi Prefecture of China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, where China's opening up to the outside world
has brought increased attention.
</P>
<P>
The local government has said that no one can sell the ancient
copper drums to smugglers and the police have offered a reward for
any information about drum thefts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Trade Surplus in November 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
surplus of 6.5 billion ringgit (about 1.71 billion U.S. dollars)
in November 1998, the 13th consecutive month that the country is
recording a trade surplus since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the month under review is bigger than the
surplus of 0.7 billion ringgit (about 184.21 million U.S. dollars)
registered in the same month a year ago, but lower than the
surplus of 6.7 billion ringgit (about 1.763 billion U.S. dollars)
recorded in October 1998, the Statistics Department said in a
statement Tuesday when releasing the "Malaysia External Trade
Statistics" for November.
</P>
<P>
For November 1998, total exports grew 14.3 percent to 24.7
billion ringgit (about 6.5 billion U.S. dollars) while imports
declined 13 percent to 18.2 billion ringgit (about 4.789 billion
U.S. dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1998, Malaysia recorded a surplus of
51.5 billion ringgit (about 13.552 billion U.S. dollars) in
contrast to a deficit of 1.0 billion ringgit (about 263.157
million U.S. dollars) during the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the January-November period 1998, total exports grew 31.9
percent to 261 billion ringgit (about 68.684 billion U.S. dollars)
and the imports registered a lower growth of 5.3 percent to 209.6
billion ringgit (about 55.157 billion U.S. dollars) over those in
the same period in 1997, according to the Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's major trading partners continued to be the United
States, Singapore and Japan, which collectively accounted for 51
percent of Malaysia's total trade registered in the first 11
months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia GDP Falls Below Target in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's gross domestic
product grew less than three percent in 1998, short of the 3.5
percent targeted, the Cambodia Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Finance Minister Keat Chhon as saying that
the decrease was caused by both international and external
factors, including the drought, poor rice yields, political
instability and a drop in demand for industrial goods from
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
The government is aiming for a four-percent GDP growth for
1999. But according to a London-based magazine's report,
Cambodia's economic growth in 1999 will be modest at only 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Keat Chhon said the government needs one billion U.S. dollars a
year from foreign direct investment and international aid to
kickstart Cambodia's economy.
</P>
<P>
On February 25 and 26, Cambodia's donor countries are scheduled
to meet in Tokyo to discuss aid for the coming year. At the last
Consultative Group, or CG meeting in Paris in July 1997, donors
pledged 450 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew by 6.5 percent in 1996 and looked set to reach
similar levels in 1997 before the factional fighting in July 1997
and the Asian economic crisis. In 1997, Cambodia had just a
two-percent economic growth.

<HEADLINE> 319 Garment Factories Lose Export License in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
canceled the export licenses of 319 garments and knitwear
factories that provided false documents, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The factories were charged with providing false documents
regarding bonded warehouse, Generalized System of Preference
certificates and fake papers for obtaining export visa, the paper
quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), which prepared the list of
the factories recently after two year's of investigation, has sent
the list to the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters
Association, and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and
Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
Most of the licenses were canceled for producing false
declarations regarding bonded warehouse, which was necessary for
every export-oriented garment factory to get an export license
from the government, and some factories obtained the licenses when
the rules were not properly enforced, an EPB official was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These factories will never be able to export garments to any
country," he said, adding "It is a routine matter for the EPB to
take actions against a factory if it provides any false document
regarding registration or other such formalities."
</P>
<P>
There are over 3,000 garments and knitwear factories in
Bangladesh, which contribute to about 70 percent of the country's
total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> hke010517 - Roundup: Thailand Banks on Millennium to Woo Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, encouraged by the
successful "Amazing Thailand Campaign," is launching new tourism
programs to lure more tourists in the New Year and the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The programs have the full backing of the government, said
sources in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Pitak Intrawityanunt, minister of the Prime Minister's Office,
said Thailand is planning for a new millennium ceremony in March
which will incorporate different elements from the existing
Amazing Thailand 1998-99 campaign. Pitak is responsible for Thai
tourism affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Asia Tourism Association (PATA) states in its 1998
annual report that the Pacific region was still high on the
travelers' wish lists for destinations despite negative factors,
especially the high level of uncertainty over the short-to-medium
term economic situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Pitak, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has
agreed in principle with the Sydney Olympic Games exhibition
organizers to join its exhibitions worldwide. This is TAT's
attempt to promote Thailand as a gateway and stop-over point to
Australia for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has called for a major effort to boost revenue earnings
from tourism in order to facilitate the national economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The TAT is targeting 309.6 billion baht (8.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in tourism revenue for this year, compared to the
projected revenue of 272.3 billion baht (7.5 billion dollars) for
last year.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has been granted an extra allocation of 255 million
baht (7.1 million dollars) to be spent on attracting visitors from
specific niche-markets, especially in the low summer season of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Chosen as targets of the special promotion are the productive
markets of Japan and the United States, and the emerging yet
potentially productive markets of Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.
</P>
<P>
Together, they are expected to generate an additional 150,000
visitor arrivals in 1999 and 5.3 billion baht (147 million
dollars) in increased revenue, or roughly a return of 20 baht for
every baht spent on promotion.
</P>
<P>
The TAT predicted that the special budget promotions will
generate an additional 90,000 visitors from Japan, 50,000 from the
United States and 10,000 from the CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
TAT governor Seree Wangpaichitr said Thailand will try its best
to "maintain quality of services, ensure tourist safety and
assistance, provide for good and efficient tourism products,
destinations and resources."
</P>
<P>
The TAT said in a statement that merely creating opportunities
for visitors to buy products through sales and gimmicks is not
enough. That has to be matched by an equivalent effort to upgrade
product quality and crack down on various shopping rackets that
tarnish the image and reputation of both the industry and the
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the TAT, in its capacity as the
country's chief tourism marketing and promotion body, can
certainly create a wide variety of opportunities to publicize the
rich diversity of Thailand's tourism attractions.
</P>
<P>
However, because tourists spend most of their money on
shopping, the statement called on other government departments
such as the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry to
play their respective roles in doing their duty in ensuring that
tourists are not cheated.
</P>
<P>
To turn Thailand into a regional shopping center, the TAT is
trying to ensure that customs regulations, duty-free shopping and
value-added tax refund schemes be comprehensively executed under
the provisions and responsibilities of the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has also been engaged in many ongoing tourist safety
and assistance campaigns such as the provisions of the Tourist
Service Center 1155 number.
</P>
<P>
"Without proactive provisions and regulations, it becomes
difficult to deliver on the promise we make in our international
promotions. Government offices have to work harder at shouldering
their responsibilities if the full potential of the earnings power
of the travel and tourism industry is to be realized," Seree
said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expects 5 pct Economic Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Sri Lanka
has projected the country's economy would grow by 5 percent in
1999 while the projection would depend on a host of internal and
external developments, according to the bank sources Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The projection is based on a targeted real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rate of a modest 5 percent, an inflation rate
of 8 percent and an improvement in the fiscal deficit to 6.5
percent of GDP, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that economic prospects this year would depend on the
strength of macro-economic policies, developments in the global
commodity and financial markets, the general investor sentiments
in the economy and the security situation, in particular the war
and military expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate of 4.5 percent to 5 percent in 1998 was
commendable in a difficult global environment. The bank expects
the Sri Lankan economy to sustain the same growth levels in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The overall services sector is expected to lead growth with
telecommunications, construction and transportation making
substantial contributions.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is expected to post a recovery in 1999.
Developments in tea prices, however, are somewhat uncertain given
the economic problems in Russia, an importer of Sri Lanka tea.
</P>
<P>
A healthy growth is expected from the manufacturing sector. The
apparel industry and the food processing industry are expected to
be major contributors to this growth.
</P>
<P>
The generation of power is expected to grow by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit is however predicted to widen to 10 percent
of GDP from 8 percent in 1998 with import outlays increasing to 12
percent more than the projected export growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign capital inflows are expected to double to around
1,000 million U.S. dollars while debt service payments will
increase to 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation Reaches 8.1 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Inflation last year
reached 8.1 percent closing to the final target the government had
set for the year, according to the Commerce Ministry
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Business Economics Department has forecast that
inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), would be
between 3 percent and 4 percent this year. It based its estimate
on world oil prices, currency exchange rates, minimum wages and
other economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, food and beverage prices included in the CPI rose
by 9.6 percent, and non-food items by 7.3 percent, Karun
Kittisataporn, director-general of the department was quoted
Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the products showing price increase were rice, meat, fish
products, dairy products, eggs, vegetables, vegetable oil, coffee
and cooked food. Prices also rose for utilities, gas, petrol,
garments, construction materials, tuition fees, medicines and
transport.
</P>
<P>
karun said the 1998 inflation figure was close to the adjusted
target of 8.0 percent stated in the most recent letter of intent
that Thailand signed with the International Monetary Fund in
December. Forecasts earlier in the year had been for an inflation
rate of nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand maintained a relatively low inflation rate because
people did not panic about the impact of the weaker baht,-- and
because the country was self-sufficient in food, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thai people did not hoard products. They also cut their
spending on unnecessary products, so there was no demand-pull
inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The only factor that caused the rise in the
inflation rate was the increase in production costs. However, the
situation has eased since the baht has strengthened against the
dollar."
</P>
<P>
he said food and beverage prices in December dropped by 0.1
percent and non-food prices fell by 0.5 percent compared with
November.

<HEADLINE> Henan Increases Fiscal Support for Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Provincial fiscal support has
enabled some three million rural residents in central China's
Henan Province to escape absolute poverty over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Henan initiated a program to increase fiscal support for
poverty-stricken farmers in 1994, with annual relief funds for
development in 34 poor counties reaching 224 million yuan in 1996
and rising even further to 526 million yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Increased financial aid has raised the annual per capita income
of farmers in related counties from 501 yuan in 1993 to 1,466
yuan. In addition, the poor population has dropped from 5.22
million to 2.21 million.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal departments at various levels have also increased
investments in infrastructure facilities such as reservoirs, power
plants, highways and bridges in poor areas, with total investments
for 1996 and 1997 hitting 370 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners Reject Union's Final Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- NBA owners turned down the
union's final proposal Monday night, putting the remainder of
season in real danger.
</P>
<P>
After studying the players' latest proposal for a few hours,
deputy commissioner Russ Granik announced that the owners' labor
relations committee had unanimously rejected it by a 9-0 vote and
recommended that the rest of the season be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the deadline for reaching an agreement, and
chances are slim that a deal can be reached.
</P>
<P>
"There's always hope, but right now we don't have any meetings
scheduled," Granik said. "Based upon how far apart we are,
there's a lot more needed to be done than simply tweaking the
offers."
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern again called for the players to vote
on the owners' final offer.
</P>
<P>
"The majority has a right to control the destiny of an
organization, and that's between them and their leadership,"
Stern said.
</P>
<P>
"I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours. Instead I
saw one that went backwards," Stern said, adding that another
full bargaining session "doesn't seem likely at all."
</P>
<P>
He also added: "Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we
are. In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of
where we are, we're going to have to lose a season.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate making a deal. It's not necessarily a
pretty sight early one, but obviously if we have to rebuild the
league, we'll rebuild the league."
</P>
<P>
Stern said if a new league was formed, it would probably take
the top 100 players and leave the rest out of work.
</P>
<P>
If no deal is reached, the league's Board of Governors could
vote Thursday to scrap the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expected to Spend More on Research and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Total expenditures in
research and development (R&AMP;D) in the United States are expected
to reach 236 billion U.S. dollars this year, seven percent higher
than the estimated 221 billion dollars spent in 1998, according t
o a forecast report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the U.S. independent science and technology
institute Battelle predicted that barring major economic
downturns, the increase in 1999 will be part of a trend that will
continue into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Battelle attributes the increase to a strong economy, a
federal budget surplus and a clear interest in breakthrough
innovations for commercial products.
</P>
<P>
According to the prediction, the U.S. industry, which
continues to dominate the amount and growth of R&AMP;D spending, will
increase spending to 157 billion dollars this year, an increase
of more than nine percent from last year. The expenditures,
accounting for 65.5 percent of the national total, are growing at
a rate that significantly exceeds inflation.
</P>
<P>
The federal government will spend 68.1 billion dollars, up
slightly from last year and barely keeping pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
Universities and other non-profit organizations will spend
10.8 billion dollars, about five percent more than the amount
committed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Increases in R&AMP;D will not be uniform throughout the industry,
the report said. Areas expected to show notable increases in R&AMP;D
expenditures are electronic components, pharmaceuticals and
medicine, office computing and communications equipment. R&AMP;D
investments will tend to support projects that lead to new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1980, more than 50 percent of all R&AMP;D was funded by
the federal government and spread throughout many agencies, the
report said. In the past 18 years, however, the government's
share of R&AMP;D has dropped to about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is little evidence that this trend will be reversed in
the near future," the report said. This year's increase in
federal support will be more widespread with additional funding
going to almost all areas of basic research, applied research and
development.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Small Businesses Bankrupt in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 28,000 small and
medium stores closed last year in Argentina due to a drop of
nearly 25 percent in sales over 1997, the Commercial Centers and
Chambers Federation said in a statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the drop to the unfair competition from foreign
supermarkets and large discount stores.
</P>
<P>
In local provinces, small store sales fell 30 percent due to
the growing competition of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Heavier taxes and hikes in electricity, water, gas and service
prices, as well as expensive loans, also contributed to the
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The banks have increased the requisites to grant loans to the
stores as a safety measure for the financial system.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade in euros was light during
the first day of the official appearance of the European currency
on the Bulgarian interbank market, dealers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"People are still rather confused. On the whole, however, the
market is calm, the system is re-adjusting smoothly, there are no
problems," said Evelina Miltenova, an ING Bank Sofia dealer.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the interbank market Monday, she said, the
euro was bought at 1,655 leva and sold at 1,665.88, the
respective central bank rates being 1,652.2 leva and 1,655.8 leva.
</P>
<P>
Slack trade in Bulgaria was no surprise compared to trade on
foreign markets where "ridiculously small sums" totaling 70
million euros (102.9 million U.S. dollars) were sold, Bulbank and
Postbank dealers said. People are still temporizing and the next
few days will show the real position of the euro on the market,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The first euro transfer was received at Expressbank from
Germany for a private person, said Simeon Gospodinov, chief of
the International Currency Transaction Department of the bank.
There were a total of six euro transfers on the first working day
of Bulgarian banks.
</P>
<P>
Gospodinov said that such transfers will become routine and by
mid-year will account for a considerable percentage of
Expressbank payments. Gospodinov said the international market
was somewhat nervous on January 4 due to the changes in the
euro/dollar, the euro/yen and the euro/British pound correlations.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the current four major currency deposits (in U.S.
dollar, Deutsche mark, Swiss franc and British pound), clients
will be able to open accounts in euro and receive euro
denominated cheques.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Takes Stricter Steps to Curb Car Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of Beijing has
adopted stricter measures to curb car pollution, a major source of
its deteriorating air that has caused concerns among the residents.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 cars not conforming to Beijing's new local
standards for tail-gas emissions have recently had their licenses
and number plates suspended for a month.
</P>
<P>
Within a month of the suspension, the car owners must reduce
the level of their car's tail-gas emission by equipping it with
purification devices, and pass another inspection before getting
back on the road.
</P>
<P>
The new local standards, which took effect on January 1, on
light-duty cars' discharges are stricter than the state ones and
designed to tackle the deteriorating air quality in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The 100 falling vehicles are of different brands ranging from
Charade to Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
Along with mobile checks on cars driven within the city, 14
tail-gas inspection stations were set up at the main road
entrances from other provinces and cities into Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that that nearly two-thirds of the 60,000
vehicles driven from the provinces and cities into Beijing every
day were not up to the emissions standards.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the city's air quality has
worsened, with air pollution indices lingering around grade 4,
which means that exposure to the open air may cause healthy people
to develop symptoms like coughing and sneezing, while people in
poor health may suffer more from respiratory illnesses.

<P>
Lampreia was quoted by the local press as saying that a single
currency would crown the integration process, but it will take at
least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Argentine President Carlos Menem's proposal on the
creation of a single currency for Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
But before the launching of a single currency, the Mercosur
countries need to complete integration in several sectors,
including legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry will cooperate to boost exports and
foreign trade with the new Development, Industry and Commerce
Ministry, headed by former World Trade Organization
representative Celso Lafer, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Free Trade Area of the Americas will not come into effect
before 2005. The United States and Canada, however, are urging a
preliminary reduction of tariffs on electronic and computer
products, Lampreia said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur was created in march 1991 and is made up of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Entrepreneurs Encouraged to Invest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government is
encouraging domestic private entrepreneurs to turn part of their
investment in agriculture, which is the mainstay of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
In response to the government's call, many are already engaged
in reclamation of vacant, fallow and virgin lands as well as
wetlands which are abundant in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, investors have reclaimed tens of thousands
of hectares of such lands in Ayeyawaddy, Yangon and Magway
divisions and started large-scale farming there.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 enterprises had cultivated summer paddy beans and
pulses on 85,318 hectares of vacant and fallow lands in Ayeyawaddy
and Yangon divisions, while 12 other enterprises have taken 6,156
hectares of similar lands in Magway division and make efforts to
grow cotton and beans and pulses there.
</P>
<P>
The number of enterprises engaged in the new scheme is growing
and reclaimed farmlands are stretching.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has formed a special group under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to assist the private
entrepreneurs to undertake the large-scale farming, disseminating
to them technology for the transformation efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
fallow land in Myanmar came to 1.1 million hectares and cultivable
wasteland 7.89 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country expanded cultivated land under crops to 12.51
million hectares in the year, 185,540 hectares more than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production in 1997-98 was registered at 17.3
million tons, of which 28,300 tons of rice were exported. The rice
export figures for the first eight months of 1998 were 53,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export in value, grew by
2.9 percent in output value in the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Cuba Policy Review, Seeks More Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration has
rejected setting up a bipartisan commission to make a review of
policy toward Cuba but will seek more contact between Americans
and Cubans.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton plans to approve the opening of direct
mail service to the island and an expansion of both direct
charter flights to Cuba and the sale of food to entities
independent of the government, said a senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement was expected Tuesday, said the official,
who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The measures are not intended to improve relations with the
Cuban government, but to show support for the Cuban people, the
official said. She added that the U.S. embargo against Cuba,
imposed 37 years ago, will remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
She said a bipartisan consensus on Cuba already exists in the
United States and therefore such a bipartisan commission was not
needed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, strongly opposed by conservatives, has been
supported by three former secretaries of state, all Republicans,
and more than 20 senators, including more than half the
Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration will also allow any U.S.
residents to post cash to their relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
At present, cash transfers to needy Cubans can be sent only by
family members in the United States. The limit is 1,200 U.S.
dollars annually. Under the administration proposal, the limit
would remain the same but the cash transfers could be made by any
U.S. resident.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embargo forbids the sale of food to Cuba by U.S.
firms, but the new proposal would revise that prohibition so long
as the recipient is an entity independent of the government, such
as the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
Also contemplated is the licensed sale of fertilizer,
pesticides and farm machinery to independent farmers in Cuba.
The official said steps must be taken to ensure that any such
transactions do not end up benefiting the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned
lawmakers particularly interested in the Cuba issue to advise
them of Clinton's plans.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Meets With KLA Political Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko on Monday urged the ethnic Albanian political leaders in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to resolve their differences and
"speak with a single voice."
</P>
<P>
In a closed-door meeting with Adem Demaci, political
representative of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), Majko asked him
to spare no effort to ensure that the Albanian political
community in Kosovo "finally speaks with a single voice."
</P>
<P>
This was a necessary step towards establishing a cohesive
political force in Kosovo, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Demaci said the KLA would agree to a proposed meeting of rival
political leaders in order to work out a joint strategy.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would welcome similar initiatives by the
Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
Albania's new government has been trying to play a more active
role in helping to solve the crisis in the Albanian-dominated
Kosovo. Unifying the rival Albanian factions in Kosovo was one of
the main issues of a resolution passed by Albanian parliament
last month.
</P>
<P>
Since the conflict between Kosovo Albanians and Serbian forces
broke out in February last year, the KLA has distanced itself
from the moderate leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who is also seeking
independence for Kosovo.

Lorenzo Rook, researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences

Lorenzo called the discovery "crucial" for the study of
anthropology, paleontology, medicine and even the philosophy of
science.

For the past three years, he and two Spanish colleagues have
studied the fossilized bones of the hand of an Oreopithecus
Bambolii, a monkey which stood a meter and 10 centimeters tall
and weighed around 30 kilos.
</P>
<P>
The bones were discovered in Italy's central region of Tuscany

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Direct Election of People's Deputies in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The 7th direct election of
deputies to township-level people's congress, China's local
law-making body, currently taking place in China's 45,000 or so
villages and townships, is expected to be completed by the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the direct election of the local law-makers has
essentially come to an end in more than 2,800 counties across
China, according to sources at the National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
The election of county- and township-level deputies, which
involves some 800 million voters, is a major political event for
people in China, as well as in the building of political power at
the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution and electoral laws stipulate that county
level people's deputies have a tenure period of five years, while
township-level deputies generally serve three years.
</P>
<P>
The election procedure includes the following steps: dividing
up the constituencies, voter registration, candidate nomination,
consultation of formal candidates, casting ballots, announcing
election results, and sponsoring people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
Each constituency will select one to three deputies, with each
urban deputy representing approximately the same number of city
voters and each rural deputy representing roughly the same
number of rural voters.
</P>
<P>
Before each election, the electoral committee checks the
constituency's list of voters. People who have reached the age of
18 or have resumed their political rights will be added to the
list, while those who have died or have been deprived of their
political rights will be removed.
</P>
<P>
The voting list will be made public 20 days before the date of
formal elections, and those who disagree about its composition are
entitled to appeal to the electoral committee or even lodge a
complaint with the people's courts five days ahead of the formal
election date.

</P>
<P>
In Monday's meeting, Fujimori and Mahuad said that the last
boundary stone would be placed within three months.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that the two presidents would meet in Washington

head Enrique Iglesias, who will be in charge of a two billion
U.S. dollar loan for border development.

<HEADLINE> Private Banks Gaining Profit in Myanmar: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- All domestic private banks in
operation in Myanmar are generating profit, said a latest issue of
 the local "Golden Myanmar" magazine.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 private banks are operating in the country,
providing domestic commercial banking services.
</P>
<P>
However, the magazine, said non-performance loans have become
problematic for some of the banks following the occurrence of
assets price deflation which in turn causes deferment of debt
service payments associated with real estate development.
</P>
<P>
To counter this development, the Central Bank of Myanmar has
advised the private banks to maintain contingency funds derived
from their annual profits, distributing less dividends for their
shareholders at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Some banks have already been implementing the practice to their
benefit and they are now reportedly in a better position to tide
over their problematic loans thus extended.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of April 1998, a total of 52 branches had been
opened throughout the country to enhance the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The private banks hold 42.3 percent of saving deposits of the
banking sector while their loans account for 44.9 percent of the
sector's loans to private sector.
</P>
<P>
Private banks in Myanmar have been allowed to operate again
since 1990, 27 years after all private banks in the country were
nationalized in 1963.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 19 private banks, there are three other
state-owned banks and 38 foreign bank representative offices in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Private banks in the country are not allowed to conduct foreign
exchange transaction business.

Voters use their identity cards to access the ballots and may

The electoral committee supervises every step of the election
process, and the results can be announced as valid only when more
than half of the constituency turn up, and the deputies receive
more than half of the approved votes.
</P>

A major difficulty encountered in China's county and
township-level elections is the increasingly large floating
population resulting from the rapid development of China's
socialist market economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Little Time Left for Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Monday that little time remains for a negotiated settlement of
the conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin stressed
that several hundred international cease-fire monitors will
remain in place in Kosovo despite an upsurge in fighting in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation in Kosovo were to deteriorate to a point
where it was no longer possible to provide adequate security
guarantees, the NATO extraction force based in Macedonia stands
ready to assist in the extraction and evacuation of the
monitors," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO is deploying some 1,800 troops in
neighboring Macedonia to help to pull out the unarmed observers
if fighting between Yugoslav government forces and ethnic
Albanian secessionists resumes.
</P>
<P>
"The current security environment, although of concern, does
not warrant re-evaluating that mission," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people died and some 200,000 were left homel
ess in fighting last year between the two sides. The conflict
ended in a tenuous ceasefire negotiated in October by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
"We think both sides need to understand that there is not that
much time left for a negotiated solution which can give the
legitimate rights to the people of Kosovo and protect the
national interests of the Serbs before we face the prospect of
renewed and very dangerous conflict this spring," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. upholds that Belgrade gives Kosovo more autonomy and
opposes the independence of the province, where over 90 percent
of the population are ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Top NBA Pick to Play in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Michael Olowokandi, the No.
1 pick in last June's NBA draft, has decided to sign with a top
Italian club but could return to the NBA if the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi will join Kinder Bologna immediately, the deadline f
or the Euro League's playoff rosters is Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait as a whole bunch of people who already have
millions in their bank accounts discuss my fate for what I'm
supposed to do in the future," Olowokandi, whose NBA rights are
held by the Los Angeles Clippers, said Monday at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian center has a clause in his contract allowing him
to come back to the NBA on February 15 if the lockout is over.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the lockout is taken care of, I'll be on the next
plane back," he added.
</P>
<P>
He signed US$3 million, with $1 million payable even if he
returns to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"But with the ability to return on February 15, I think we've
eliminated the risk of him not being able to play in the NBA this
year," Billy Duffy, Olowokandi's agent, added.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi averaged 22.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks
last year.
</P>
<P>
Vinny Del Negro of the San Antonio Spurs signed last week with
Kinder's Italian League rival, Team System Bologna.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Chile-Pinochet Chile Defends Its Jurisdiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza once again disputed a British tribunal's ruling to
detain Gen. Augusto Pinochet by saying on Monday that only
Chilean courts can judge crimes committed in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Cesar Gaviria, Secretary General of
the Organization of American States, Insulza said "the Chilean
government considers that only its own tribunals have
jurisdiction over actions taking place on its territory."
</P>
<P>
A 1978 amnesty law "would not necessarily be applied in the
trial of Pinochet," since some of the crimes took place before
Pinochet promulgated the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chile warned on Monday that its courts could sue
British authorities for "obstructing justice" by holding Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained last October on the request of Spanish
courts probing alleged organized killing of Spanish citizens in
Chile between 1973 and 1990, when Pinochet ran the country.

<HEADLINE> Euro may Boost Indonesia's Exports, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The launching of the euro on
January 1 may boost Indonesia's exports to the European countries,
particularly those using the single European currency, a director
of the Indonesian central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The use of the new currency in the 11 member countries of the
European Union gave Indonesia an opportunity to boost its exports,
the country's leading newspapers Tuesday quoted Bank Indonesia
(BI) Director Miranda Goeltom as saying here Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said that since no intermediate currency is now used in
import and export deals, transaction costs would be more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
However, she said Indonesia's central bank will not immediately
diversify its external reserves to include the new currency and
reduce U.S. dollar holdings.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that although the value of the euro had the
potential to strengthen against the dollar, BI would make
extensive calculations before including the euro in its reserves.
</P>
<P>
She added that the central bank would hold only enough euro for
hedging purposes.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Asian central banks, which hold about 40
percent of the world's reserves, are expected to diversify their
reserves to include the euro and trim their U.S. dollar holdings
because regional currencies pegged to the greenback had been badly
hurt during the current 18-month financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said the there was a huge potential demand for the euro
because it would likely become an invoicing currency that could
contend with the domination of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"However, during the transitional period there will be
uncertainty," she noted.
</P>
<P>
She held that the euro had to meet several criteria, including
acceptability, liquidity and stability, before it could become the
primary global currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an economist said euro is expected to bring a
positive wind to Indonesia as this will provide a large market
opportunity in a more efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
"With the one single currency, Indonesia's trade with European
countries will be more efficient in terms of negotiations and
calculations even though the implementation will not start until
two or three years later," said economist Nina Sapti.
</P>
<P>
She said that the euro will become the rival to the U.S. dollar
and Japanese yen but in positive terms, leading to a better world
economic condition in the future.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the euro will contribute to the
strengthening of Asian currencies, similar to the case in which
Asian currencies surged following the surge by the yen against the
U.S. dollar, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
welcomed the launch of the euro on Monday, stressing a successful
monetary union that contributes to a dynamic Europe was in the
United States' interest.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the launch of the euro, an historic step that 11
nations in Europe have taken toward a more complete Economic and
Monetary Union," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"A successful economic union that contributes to a dynamic
Europe is clearly in our long-term interests," Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has long been an advocate for European
integration, and we admire the steady progress that Europe has
demonstrated in taking the often difficult budget decisions that
make this union possible," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"A strong and stable Europe, with open markets and robust
growth, is good for America and for the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The euro got off to a flying start on Monday as politicians
and investors gave a vote of confidence to the culmination of a
50-year drive to bind Europe's economies as one.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
that it does not see the euro could pose a challenge to the U.S.
dollar's dominance in the world.
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated the U.S. position. "As we've said many ti
mes, if it's good for Europe then that's good for the United
States. A strong Europe is good for the United States."
</P>
<P>
"It will be a currency like all other currencies," Rubin told
reporters after a speech at the National Press Club here.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, asked about the euro's strong debut, stuck to his
routine of not commenting on day-to-day market movements and said
it was normal for markets to fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
"That is not where our focus needs to be. Our focus needs to
be on keeping our house in order. If our house is in order then
we'll be in fine shape," he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Restrict Import from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is considering to
restrict its import from Japan to reduce the huge trade deficit
occurring in its balance of trade with the country.
</P>
<P>
A latest issue of the local "Golden Myanmar" magazine quoted
the Directorate of Trade of the Ministry of Commerce as saying
that Myanmar's import from Japan, which has already constituted
about 25 percent of the country's total import, could not be
increased further very much.
</P>
<P>
However, there is greater potential to expand the export sector
as Myanmar's export to Japan was about 5 percent of its total
export.
</P>
<P>
The magazine calls on Myanmar and Japanese businessmen to
explore unexploited export sectors of Myanmar and consider
collaboration in the issue.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that with Myanmar's vast cultivable land and
rich water resources combining with the infusion of capital and
technology from Japan, production can be significantly increased
so that export could also substantially rise.
</P>
<P>
It calls for improving the quality of traditional items of
export, while introducing non-traditional items to Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
The magazine sees appreciable long-term mutual benefits
deriving from incoming foreign investment and technical assistance
from Japan for the export sectors. In this way, persistent trade
deficit in Myanmar-Japan trade could be reduced through more
Myanmar products penetrating into Japanese market, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
Myanmar's export to Japan amounted to 39.97 million U.S. dollars,
while its import from Japan was 360.46 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's total export in the year indicates 1 billion
dollars, while its total import shows 2.24 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Weak Demand Predicted for Rubber in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The natural rubber market is
predicted to face weak demand this year, the reason cited being
that the world tire industry will prefer synthetic rubber due to
its lower price, resulting from the low price of oil.
</P>
<P>
"The oil price drop will make the production cost of synthetic
rubber cheaper. Besides, synthetic rubber also has one more
superiority: reliable continuity of its supply," said Harry
Tanugraha, chairman of the Indonesian Rubber Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation would worsen if the economic
crisis continues.
</P>
<P>
The price of natural rubber kept declining in 1998, reaching
less than 0.70 U.S. dollar per kilogram, while in 1997 the price
was at 1.25 U.S. dollars. The decline caused the Indonesian
government's foreign exchange earnings from the commodity last
year to drop by 20 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The bleak economic situation worldwide is predicted to
continue this year which will be difficult to lift the price of
the commodity," Tanugraha was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted traders as saying that potential buyers from
Europe, Asia and the United States are tending to reduce their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
"The tough competition in the rubber market is because of the
weak demand, especially from the main buyer countries," said a
trader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Daud Husni Bastari, chairman of the Indonesian
Rubber Producers Association, said he was optimistic that natural
rubber would regain ground in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In that year, we expect the consumption of the commodity will
grow 2 percent. The growth will increase to 2.5 percent a year
from 2001 until 2020," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the growth of world production of
natural rubber is assumed to decline due to limited planting areas
in the producer countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Bastari, in 2005 Indonesia will be able to produce
2.7 million tons of natural rubber based on the growth of
production and the opening of new plantations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 2.5 million hectares of rubber plantations which
last year produced 1.7 million tons, compared to 1997's production
of 1.5 million tons. The country now ranks as the second biggest
producer behind Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Strengthens Control over Floating Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has recently adopted new regulations to standardize the
management of 11.5 million non-local residents.
</P>
<P>
The regulations contains detailed stipulations governing the
control of floating population in terms of temporary residence
status, employment, family planning, epidemic prevention and
providing refuge, as well as protection of their rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Transients conducting business or otherwise working in
Guangdong should apply to public security bureaux for one-year
temporary residence permits.
</P>
<P>
Children of transients who reside in the same location for at
least five consecutive years enjoy the same education rights as
permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that transients who reside in the
same locations for seven consecutive years and have permanent
housing can apply for permanent residence status.
</P>
<P>
The floating population has certainly contributed to
Guangdong's economic development, but has at the same time
affected social order, according to one provincial official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show transients were involved in more than 10,000
criminal cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong unveiled its first set of regulations governing the
control of transients in 1995.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Monday urged sports organizations to begin
preparations for qualifying events for the Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, many of which will be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
Mochamad Hindarto, the council's athletes development chief,
told reporters after a meeting to evaluate the country's
performance at the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok in December last
year, that athletes, especially Asiad medalists, should be
trained at designated sports association training camps.
</P>
<P>
"We'll advise all sports organizations to begin preparing
(Asiad) medalists for Olympic qualifying events by March at the
latest," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won six gold, 10 silvers and 11 bronzes at the
recent Asiad. The medals came in badminton, beach volleyball,
boxing, karate, rowing, taekwondo, tennis track and field,
weightlifting, windsurfing and wushu events.
</P>
<P>
"We'll also advise sports organizations to prepare second
string athletes for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei and the Arafura Games in Darwin, Australia," said Hindarto.
</P>
<P>
"Sports organizations must work harder and prepare better for
the Olympics and the Asiad in Pusan, South Korea. If we won six
golds with only one year's preparation (last year), then we'll
train athletes for two years and win more golds at the next
Asiad," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- President of the Lao People's
Revolutionary Party (LPRP) and the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (LPDR) Khamtay Siphandone arrived here Monday for a
four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The Lao leader was greeted warmly by Vietnamese Communist Party
General Secretary Le Kha Phieu and State President Tran Duc Luong.
</P>
<P>
The visit was described by Vietnamese leaders as "a new
milestone in the consolidation and enhancement of the special
friendship, solidarity and comprehensive cooperation between
Vietnam and Laos, especially on the threshold of the third
millennium."
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam News Agency, top leaders of Vietnam and
Laos held talks here in which they discussed renewing forms of
cooperation to improve the quality and efficiency of their
bilateral ties by bringing into full play the strength and
potential of each country on the basis of equality and mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to give priorities and preferential treatment as
well as facilitate the exchange of goods and assist each other in
the regional and global integration of their respective economy in
the interests of each country, for peace, stability, cooperation
and development in the region and the world as a whole, VNA said.
</P>
<P>
On regional and international issues of common concern, the two
sides noted that despite complicated developments in the world,
peace and stability for development is still the common aspiration
of the people in the world and the prominent trend in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their concern over the profound adverse impacts
of the financial-monetary crisis in southeast Asia and stressed
that regional and non-regional countries should enhance their
cooperation and mutual assistance to overcome the aftermath of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
They believed that once the crisis was surmounted, regional
countries will again become dynamic and prosperous ones.
</P>
<P>
The leaders affirmed that the two countries would continue
cooperating with other ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) member countries in the implementation of the Hanoi
Declaration, the Hanoi Plan of Action and other agreements signed
at the sixth ASEAN summit held here last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday
officially asked the Untied Nations to replace its American and
British humanitarian staff working in the country, citing anger
from citizens after last month's U.S.-British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to the United Nations, Iraq said it could not
guarantee the safety of personnel from these two nations and
therefore the United Nations should make other arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"We have accordingly requested that the personnel in question
be replaced in view of prevailing circumstances arising out of
the Anglo-American aggression and our concern to fulfill our
undertakings," Iraq said in the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has some 420 humanitarian staff in Iraq,
administering the "oil-for-food" program that permits Iraq to
sell up to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months
to buy basic humanitarian goods for its people. Iraq has been
under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council is expected to discuss the
memorandum on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Stern, Hunter Meet in Effort to Save NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- With the deadline for
canceling the season just three days away, NBA commissioner David
Stern received a proposal from Players Association executive
director Billy Hunter at a face-to-face meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Stern and Deputy commissioner Russ Granik met with Hunter and
union president Patrick Ewing for an hour at a midtown hotel in
an effort to end the lockout that is in its 188th day, according
to a league spokeswoman. Stern and Granik will speak in a
teleconference tonight.
</P>
<P>
Stern, due back in the NBA's offices today following a
vacation in Colorado, previously set Thursday as the date he
would advise the Board of Governors to vote to cancel the entire
season - a first for major pro sports - if an agreement cannot be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Stern sent the league's "final" proposal directly
to over 400 players, urging the union to put it to a vote. The
union's 19-memeber negotiating committee unanimously voted not to
put the proposal to a vote of the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
In the league's most recent proposal, the basketball-related
income was increased one percent point in each of the last three
years to 53 percent, 53.5 percent and 54 percent. This is still
far from the union's request for 55, 56 and 57 percents.
</P>
<P>
The union has told all 19 players on its negotiating committee
to be in New York by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, signed
Monday with Kinder Bologna of the Italian League for US$3
million. The center can return to the NBA on February 15 if the
lockout is lifted and still would receives $1 million.
</P>
<P>
Free agents such as Vlade Divac and Arvydas Sabonis have
signed to play in Europe and have the option of returning to the
NBA if an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Even if an agreement were reached, the earliest the season
could start is February, with a maximum of 45-50 games.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Steven Woods, the agent for Toronto's Kevin
Willis, refiled an unfair labor practice charge with the National
Labor Relations Board against the union for allegedly breaching
its duty of fair representation.
</P>
<P>
Herb Williams of the Knicks, a member of the union's executive
committee, thinks the deadline of canceling the remainder of the
season might be extended.
</P>
<P>
"If a deal was done on the 9th or 10th, I'm sure David
wouldn't say that just because we didn't do it on 7th the season
is over. It's a business, and sometimes you have to posture."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Launches Major Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) Monday launched a major reshuffle involving 100
high-ranking officers as the country gears up for general
elections scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif told reporters
that Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Sugiono was promoted to
the post of ABRI Chief of General Affairs, replacing Lt. Gen.
Fachrul Razi.
</P>
<P>
Fachrul becomes secretary-general to the Ministry of Defense
and Security, replacing Lt. Gen. (ret) Soeyono, who has reached
the mandatory age of retirement.
</P>
<P>
Sugiono's post as Deputy Army Chief of Staff is now held by
Commander of Armed Forces Staff and Command School Lt. Gen. Johny
Lumintang. The Assistant for General Planning to the Armed Forces
Commander Maj. Gen. Agus Wijaya will fill the post left vacant by
Lumintang.
</P>
<P>
Lumintang made headlines early last year when he replaced then
commander of Army Strategic Reserves Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto,
son-in-law of former president Soeharto, amid the country's worst
political crisis in decades. Lumintang was transferred to another
position one day after the appointment, sparking rumors of rift in
the country's political elite.
</P>
<P>
Syamsul stressed that the reshuffle was a regular change in
tours of duty.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a regular change in tours of duty within ABRI," he
was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The powerful ABRI has come under unprecedented pressure since
Soeharto's downfall in May last year, the Indonesian Observer
said, adding that all sights have been set on human rights abuses
conducted by ABRI since Soeharto took power 33 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Foreman, Holmes Fight May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- If George Foreman agrees to
a different form of payment, his fight against Larry Holmes might
still happen.
</P>
<P>
The bout between the aging former heavyweight champions is
scheduled for January 23, but Foreman would like to call off the
fight because promoter Roger Levitt has not met his financial
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Levitt said Monday he has secured an insurance bond that will
guarantee Foreman the remaining US$9 million of his $10 million
purse.
</P>
<P>
"If George Foreman wants to fight, then it will happen," said
Russ Sauer, Holmes' lawyer. "If Mr. Foreman agrees to proceed
with the financial agreement in place, I don't see any problems
working out an alternative arrangement for Larry in which he'll
be guaranteed his money."
</P>
<P>
Holmes is owed $3.6 million of his $4 million share, and
Levitt said the fighter will be paid.
</P>
<P>
Foreman didn't get a letter of credit after two sponsors
pulled out in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Levitt has already given Foreman $1 million and Holmes
$400,000-- both of which are nonrefundable.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, the fight is still on and was
never off," Levitt said. "George has now got exactly what he
needs. Now all he needs to do is get in the ring and fight. He
has no moral or legal way out. We've met the demands of the
contract with no exclusions."

<HEADLINE> EDS-Chile-Pinochet Chile Defends Its Jurisdiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chile's foreign minister Jose
Miguel Insulza stressed on Monday that only local courts can
judge crimes committed in the country, referring to a British
tribunal's ruling to detain Gen.Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the
Organization of American State, Insulza said that "The Chilean
government considers that only its own tribunals have
jurisdiction over actions taking place in its territory."
</P>
<P>
A 1978 amnesty law promulgated by Pinochet "would not
necessarily be applied in the trial of Pinochet", since some of
the crimes took place outside the period mentioned, Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chile also warned on Monday that its courts could
sue British authorities for "obstructing justice" for holding
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained last October on the request of Spanish
courts probing alleged organized killing of Spanish citizens in
Chile between 1973 and 1990 when Pinochet ran the country.

<HEADLINE> FIFA President Slams Criticism of Biennial World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- International football governing
body FIFA president Sepp Blatter rebutted on Monday criticism
from other soccer leaders over his call for biennial World Cup
finals, according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are living in fast and rapid times and therefore should
adapt our World Cup to our times," Blatter said in an interview
with Reuters Television.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has said it was firmly opposed to the idea, which would
force the European championships to follow suit, and they were
backed by their counterparts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said in the interview that at present it took 16 years
for the finals to be staged in each of the four continents and
the proposed plan would also be a boost for national team
football.
</P>
<P>
"There are enough dates available. What we need is a
coordination of the calendar," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
He said with proper organization it would not mean even more
games for soccer players.
</P>
<P>
"We want to protect our players and have less games," he said.
"There should not be so many matches outside national matches.
All national leagues should be of only 16-18 teams."
</P>
<P>
English hero Sir Bobby Charlton gave a cautious reaction to
the proposal, saying the change might devalue the event, but
World Cup-winning captains Franz Beckenbauer and Dino Zoff and
some leading current players were in favor.
</P>
<P>
Blatter had said in a Swiss newspaper on Sunday that he wanted
to change the World Cup to a biennial tournament.
</P>
<P>
And on Monday he claimed there could be a taste of the new reg
ime as early as 2004 with a scaled down World Cup held to
celebrate FIFA's centenary.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA, who have just emerged victorious in the fight for
control of the club game in Europe, said they were surprised by
Blatter's plan.
</P>
<P>
UEFA president Lennart Johansson pointed out that 2004 was
also UEFA's 50th anniversary and they were soon to announce the
host for that year's European championship.
</P>
<P>
"I find the idea of a World Cup in the same year
unacceptable," said Johansson.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal to organize a World Cup every two years has not
been officially submitted to the FIFA executive, and the
confederations, who would be strongly affected by it, were
certainly never informed or consulted," added the Swede.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Start Use of Euro in July: Bank President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will start the use of euro
for transaction on July 1, Cuba's central bank president
Francisco Soberon said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soberon said, however, that it is still too early to precisely
evaluate the euro, which after its appearance on January 1 is
already quoted on international stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Soberon stressed Europe's importance as the island's main
market and its main source of loans, lauding the appearance of
the euro as a currency which will affect the dollar's hegemony
"for the good of mankind."
</P>
<P>
He said that the euro will strengthen the economy of countries
using it, giving more price transparency to Cuban companies,
decreasing financial costs, eliminating risks linked to exchange
rates and making payments easier.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is legally banned from using the U.S. dollars for its
transactions since Washington imposed in 1961 an economic embargo
against the island, which Cuban sources say have cost it between
about 60 and 80 billion dollars loses over the past 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Wiseman Resigns as FA Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Keith Wiseman admitted he had
made a mistake and apologized when he announced his resignation
as chairman of the English F.A. on Monday in the wake of a
cash-for-votes scandal.
</P>
<P>
Wiseman had been under pressure to quit after revelations he
had arranged an unauthorised 3.2 million pounds (about 5.4
million U.S. dollars) payment to the Welsh F.A. and had hoped in
exchange to secure backing for a place on FIFA's executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly resigned over the issue last
month but, despite receiving a unanimous vote of no confidence
from the executive committee, Wiseman preferred to stay on until
a meeting of the full F.A. council.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour council meeting on Monday, Wiseman, a
director of premier league Southampton, resigned.
</P>
<P>
The F.A. said in a statement following a news conference that
Wiseman "conceded he had made a mistake in his handling of some
aspects of his contacts with the Welsh F.A. He insisted there had
been nothing sinister. He apologised.
</P>
<P>
"Today's events closed a chapter, a turbulent and personally
painful one for all those who had been involved," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The F.A. said it would start looking for a new chief executive
in the next few days and the job would be advertised. It said a
new chairman would be elected at a summer meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
The F.A. said it was also seeking urgent meetings with UEFA
and FIFA to explain the events of recent weeks and how the
F.A.proposed to take matters forward.
</P>
<P>
F.A. acting chief executive David Davies told the news
conference: "We are going to FIFA, we are going to UEFA, and the
outgoing chairman said sorry this morning. This is behind us. Now
we are going to move on."
</P>
<P>
An earlier statement announcing Wiseman's resignation said:
The chairman of the Football Association, Keith Wiseman, told the
F.A. council he did not believe he had sufficient support to
continue in his position.
</P>
<P>
"He offered his resignation with immediate effect. A motion
accepting that resignation with no aspersions on his honesty and
integrity was then passed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
"A proposal that the vice-chairman Geoff Thompson should
assume the role of acting chairman was also passed unanimously.-
</P>
<P>
There was a rebuke for Chelsea chairman Ken Bates after he was
quoted in the Daily Mirror newspaper last Friday as saying F.A.
staff had been given cheap loans for holidays or home insurance.
</P>
<P>
Bates, who has offered himself as F.A. caretaker boss, said
the F.A.'s staff committee had been awarding loans to its own
members without security or approval from the F.A.'s finance
committee.
</P>
<P>
Frank Pattison, a member of the F.A. Council, said: "Some of
Bates' comments were unfortunate, disclosing information that was
not accurate and that should not have come into the public domain
as it did."

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Favor United Nations, Poll Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven in 10 American
voters have a favorable opinion of the United Nations although
nearly half are not sure what it does aside from peacekeeping,
according to a new survey released here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted by Zogby International at the request of
the United Nations, 70.2 percent of American voters look
favorably at the 185-member world body, while only 27 percent
hold an unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
Even Republican voters, whose party leaders are the most
critical of the world body, gave the organization a 57.3 percent
approval rate.
</P>
<P>
And among all ages and racial, education and other groups
polled, women showed themselves far more appreciative of the
United Nations than men -- 78 percent to 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll said that nearly 62 percent of American voters said
the United States should pay the 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in dues
and peacekeeping expenses Washington owes to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Washington, long under fire in the United Nations for its
reluctance to pay its arrares, just saved its voting in the
General Assembly this year by paying the minimum sum of dues
required by the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which canvassed 1,003 likely voters across the
country, has a margin of error of 3.2 percent. Zogby said he
conducted it without charge for the United Nations, which is
trying to coordinate its messages to the public.
</P>
<P>
On individual questions, 69 percent agreed that the United
Nations was effective "in keeping the peace, promoting human
rights and helping developing countries climb out of poverty."
Only 32 percent agreed that the United Nations had a "bloated
bureaucracy which weakens U.S. sovereignty."

<HEADLINE> Euro Holds Steady in First Trading Day in U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The new European common
currency held steady against the U.S. dollar in its first trading
day in the United States on Monday as dealers welcomed the euro's
debut for its potential strength.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in New York, the euro was quoted at 1.1806
dollars, up from 1.18 dollars when trading was opened this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that worries about a slowdown in U.S.
economic growth this year have an impact on the dollar's position
against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The greenback was quoted at 112.07 Japanese yen in New York on
Monday, down from 113.57 last Thursday, the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Reserve official warned today that the U.S. economy
may not continue growing at its present pace, widely predicted at
around 3.5 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Unrealistic expectations" could have a negative impact on the
economy, said Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank president Jack Guynn.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government officially welcomed the launch of the euro.
President Bill Clinton said on Monday that a successful monetary
union contributing to a dynamic Europe was in the U.S. interest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local analysts say the euro may pose a challenge to
the U.S. dollar dominance of international trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
"The advent of European economic and monetary union, or EMU,
doesn't just change the world's financial landscape, it also could
alter the global balance of power," said the Wall Street Journal on
Monday.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Stocks captured strong gains
in the morning but suffered a substantial drop this afternoon
following a warning given by a bank executive that the U.S.
economy could not continue to grow at the current pace.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average inched only 2.84 higher to
9,184.27 today. Optimism boosted mainly by the launch of the
euro drove the blue chip index up as much as 168.64 to 9,350.07
in the morning, close to its record closing high at 9,374.27 on
November 23, last year.
</P>
<P>
Investors retreated in the afternoon after Atlanta Federal
Reserve Bank President Jack Guynn said consumers, businesses,
investors and policymakers should not proceed as though the
U.S. economy could keep growing at its current pace. The
economy's recent performance is exceptional, he said in a speech
at the Atlanta Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 1.13 to 1,228.10 and
Nasdaq Composite Index rose 15.36 to 2208.05 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks could not make strong gains if U.S. economy slows
down this year and the economy has shown a slowing, J.P. Wu,
a stock analyst said.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Work with Egypt in Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday reaffirmed its
readiness to work with Egypt to promote common development and
march hand in hand into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Egyptians in the Egyptian Foreign Ministry,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said that China and Egypt,
both with a long history, have made important contributions to
human civilization, and are now working for economic development
and deepened reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We, too, follow closely and with admiration the remarkable
achievements Egypt has made since its economic reforms," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991, loosening control over
and privatizing state-run enterprises. Since then, Egypt's gross
domestic product (GDP) has grown from 2 percent to more than 5
percent, inflation fallen from 20 percent to under 5 percent and
foreign currency reserves climbed to 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed confidence that "the Egyptian people, under the
leadership of President (Hosni) Mubarak and through unremitting
efforts and resolute reform, will attain the economic development
objectives."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister arrived here Sunday on a three-day
visit within an African tour, which will also take him to Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tang Jiaxuan said that China will "continue to
establish and develop friendly relations and cooperation with all
other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and seek a long-term international environment of
peace for China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization
drive."
</P>
<P>
It is the "established policy" of the Chinese Government to
further carry out cooperation with Arab and African countries in
the economic, technological, cultural and other fields, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are firm in opposing hegemonism, safeguarding world peace
and are working hard for the establishment of a just and rational,
new international political and economic order," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said that in the past two decades, the
Chinese economy registered an annual growth rate of 9.8
percent, and the goal of quadrupling the 1980 GDP by the end of
the century was accomplished ahead of schedule in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tang underlined that China, the biggest developing country in
the world, has succeeded in maintaining political stability and
sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
"This in itself is an important contribution to the world peace
and stability," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here on Monday that China appreciates its long-term
friendly relations with Egypt, and is ready to further boost the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa, Tang
said China and Egypt, two key developing countries, have many in
common, and the Sino-Egyptian relations are time-honored with
solid basis.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived in Cairo on Sunday for a three-day visit within an
African tour, which will also take him to Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed satisfaction with the development of the
bilateral ties, saying that in the face of the rapidly changing
situation and new challenges in the world, the two countries
should enhance cooperation in economy, trade, agriculture, tourism
and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued and close consultations and
coordination between the two countries in international affairs,
including issues in Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Tang Jiaxuan also held talks with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. They exchanged views on
the Middle East situation, especially the latest developments in
the Mideast peace process and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid spoke highly of China's continued support for the
Arab world and its principled stands regarding the Mideast peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Tang voiced China's opposition to the use of force in dealing
with the international affairs, referring to the recent military
attacks on Iraq by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In what the U.S. said a retaliation for Iraq's defiance of the
United Nations weapons inspections, the U.S. and Britain launched
a four-day military attack on Iraq on December 16.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt Appoints New Paymaster-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Treasury minister Dawn Primarolo
was appointed as the new paymaster-general on Monday, replacing
Geoffrey Robinson who resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
Robinson left the government over a 373,000 pounds (610,000
U.S. dollars) loan he gave the former Trade Secretary Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
The new paymaster-general moves up from her position as
Financial Secretary, while Trade and Industry minister Barbara
Roche moves from Mandelson's old department to join the Treasury
team.
</P>
<P>
Robinson had taken on the post on a voluntary basis and lack of
funds for ministerial work was suggested as one reason for the
delay in appointing his successor.
</P>
<P>
Primarolo, MP for Bristol South, became a member of the
left-wing campaign group shortly after entering the Commons.
</P>
<P>
During Labor's years in opposition she supported many causes
dear to the party's left including nuclear disarmament and the
withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But after Tony Blair became Labor leader Primarolo took up the
new Labor line. She moved to Gordon Brown's shadow Treasury team
in 1994 and was a surprise choice as a minister after Labor's
return to power in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Americans Interested in HomeNetworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 percent of
households with personal computers in the United States are
interested in ways to network PCs, printers and television inside
their homes, according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
This means 13.4 percent of all U.S. households are keen on the
idea of tying household electrical devices so they can be
centrally controlled and shared, said market research firm the
Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
One key factor driving demand for home networks, the Yankee
Group said, is the growing number of homes with high-speed data
access. In other words, high-speed data to the home creates a need
for high-speed data inside the home, such as home networks. This
bodes well for the makers of such networking products.
</P>
<P>
Home networking products will give consumers the ability to
share such data access between devices, which would help drive the
continued growth of the broadband market.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of multi-PC and online households,
the increasing number of digital consumer electronic devices such
as DVDs, as well as the 26.8 million households that do some or
all of their work at home, are the other key factors driving the
consumer demand for home networks.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are going to begin looking for ways to bring all the
isolated devices inside their home together so these devices can
share data," the Yankee Group said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yankee study, early adopted of home networking
products are multi-PC households, of which 96.5 percent also own
printers. Thirty-five percent of these households have annual
incomes of more than 75,000 U.S. dollars.

LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The UK's FTSE 100 had a flat day
Monday in contrast to other European share markets which were
buoyed by the launch of the euro.
</P>
<P>
While the euro appeared to start its life fairly strongly,
dealers were cautiously awaiting further indications of its long
term strength.
</P>
<P>
Markets in the 11 Euroland countries gained strongly, spurred
by the rising value of the euro and expectations that
international investors will be keen to increase their European
investments under the euro.
</P>
<P>
However, the FTSE 100 was a pale shadow of the continental
European markets. Its index ended the session at 5879.4, down just
3 points, despite some good individual performances.
</P>
<P>
Fears that a strong euro would further damage the dollar to
which Asia is closely linked also acted against the market.
</P>
<P>
Today's session also marks the start of links between the
London and Frankfurt stock exchanges with traders in each centers
now able to buy and sell stocks on the electronic trading
platforms of the other.
</P>

"It is just the first step toward a pan-European stock
exchange," said, Reto Francioni, a Deutsche Boerse executive board

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Some U.S Aid Workers would Get Visas to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
dismissed reports that Iraq would ban U.S. and British aid
workers, saying some Americans in U.N. aid programs would get
visas to work there.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq told the United Nations on Monday that it had no plans
to expel any U.N. humanitarian workers and would issue visas to
some Americans in U.N. programs," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said Iraq began the New Year with a threat to bar
U.S. and British humanitarian aid workers after the two powers
bombed the country.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats in Baghdad also said on Sunday that Iraq had
told the United Nations it was concerned for th safety of
Americans and Britons in Iraq because of the aftermath of the
bombing that killed nearly hundred of Iraqis, and said it would
not renew visas for those currently in the country of give entry
permits to those returning from leave.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, however, that an Iraqi representative gave a formal
note on the subject on Monday to the acting head of the Iraq
program at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In his oral presentation the Iraqi official emphasized that
</P>
<P>
... some Americans working in U.N. humanitarian programs will
receive visas and that denial of visas to others is a temporary
measure," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"This is what the Iraqis told the U.N. today," he added.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Seek Help From S. Africa for Lockerbie Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will ask South African President Nelson Mandela this week to
persuade Libya to end the diplomatic deadlock over the 1988
Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Blair would appeal to Mandela on Thursday to convince the
Libyan government to agree to a trial in the Netherlands for the
two Libyans accused by Britain and the United States, the Prime
Minister's spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1988, a Pan Am flight 103 was blasted over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing a total of 270 people. Britain
and U.S. accused that two Libyan intelligence officials were
responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
British officials said Blair hoped Mandela could ease Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi's suspicions and persuade him to hand the
two suspects over.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to visit South Africa from Wednesday to
Saturday. He will have one meeting with Mandela, who had played a
unique role in the Lockerbie case.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair also wanted to brief Mandela and his
successor, Thabo Mbeki, personally on Britain's conflict with Iraq
and seek South Africa's support for the British-American strategy
of containing Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Blair visited South Africa in 1996 when he was opposition
leader. He received and entertained Mbeki in London last year.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister will use his first trip to Africa as
government leader to announce extra British aid to South Africa
and highlight the prospect of wide industrial cooperation and
investment.

<HEADLINE> Blair Prepares For S.Africa Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is scheduled to fly to South Africa in a bid to clinch defense
deals and to say farewell to outgoing President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Blair's visit will begin on Wednesday when he is expected to
arrive South Africa with his family from the Seychelles, where
they are enjoying a holiday, British officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister is also expected to seek to cement his ties
with Mandela's successor, now deputy president Thabo Mbeki.
Several sessions of talks have been scheduled between Blair and
Mbeki after the British leader's meeting on Thursday with Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Blair will seek the aid of Mandela in persuading Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to end the diplomatic stalemate over the 1988
Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had played a unique role in the case. He had persuaded
Gaddafi to agree to consider handing over the two Libyans, who are
accused by Britain and the United States of responsible for the
bombing, to be trialed in an international court established in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that Blair will also announce an aid package for
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The coming visit is Blair's first trip to the continent of
Africa as government leader. He visited South Africa in 1996 when
he was opposition leader.

<HEADLINE> 725 S. Africans Die in Traffic Accidents Since Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 725 people have died in
road accidents since last December, more than 100 of them children of
school-going age, the South African Transport Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that 119 children aged between a few
months and 18 years old were killed in what it described as the year-end
slaughter on South African roads.
</P>
<P>
The statement said pedestrians comprised 32 percent of the total number
of people killed in traffic accidents so far since December 1 of last year.
 Another 240 were drivers and 255 were passengers.
</P>
<P>
Speeding remained a problem, and about 50 percent of all drivers
exceeded the legal limit. About 20 percent exceeded speeds of 130 km/h and
10 percent exceeded 140 km/h.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Arrive Alive Campaign urged parents and school
teachers to promote respect for road safety among school children,
especially those who had obtained their car of motorcycle licenses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned young drivers that being held responsible for
another person's death could mean a jail sentence without the option of a
fine.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Johannesburg Traffic Department arrested 103
motorists for outstanding cases during last Thursday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Tunisian Minister of Agriculture Sadiq Rabih has
disclosed that increase in local wheat production to 25 million
kantars depends on the expansion of the irrigated lands from
60,000 hectars at present to 92,000 hectars over the coming ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, where present wheat crop varies between 10 million and
15 million kantars, is planning to double the crop in ten years to
reach 25 million kantars a year.
</P>
<P>
Today's Arab daily "Al Hayat" quotes the Minister as saying
that Tunisia intends to assign production quotas to all provinces,
though increasing the quotas of the fertile northern provinces to
16 million kantars a year. It also plans to expand irrigated areas
in the central and southern provinces where rainfall is scarce so
as to produce over 5 million kantars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states over the
past year lost 39 per cent of its oil revenues due to the drop in
oil prices to the lowest level since 1986, according to banking
circles in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report released Sunday in Dubai, the "UAE
Industrial Bank" said the GCC states lost 35 billion dollars of
their oil revenues, and that overall revenues fell to 55 billion
dollars, as compared to 90 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that oil revenues of other OPEC member
states have fallen by a lesser degree than in the Gulf
states. This is due to the fact that the Gulf states have
committed themselves to the approved production quotas, whereas,
some OPEC states have increased production to offset part of the
drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
The reporty pointed out that oil revenues of OPEC members
fell by 36 per cent, from 170 billion dollars in 1997 to
109 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen has announced that it will apply for admission in
the World Trade Organisation as observer.
</P>
<P>
In a press interview printed today, the Yemeni Deputy Minister
of Supply and Trade Ali Al Siaghi said the observer status will
allow his country to obtain information and data about the WTO,
its procedures and expertise with regard to all aspects of
international trade.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Monday welcomed the
introduction of Europe's new currency, the euro, and described it
as an important move in political and economic terms.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus believes that the euro will contribute substantially to
the strength of the European family on a European as well as a
global level, said Government Spokesman Christos Stylianides at a
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The link of the Cyprus pound to the euro may not exert any
serious repercussions on Cyprus' economy, because the "pound is
stable", said Central Bank officer Takis Kanaris.
</P>
<P>
He said the link is a natural development because the Cyprus
pound was linked to the ECU, euro's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The flotation margins of the euro will range from minus 2.25
percent to plus 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that the implied parity of 1.7086 ECUs to the
Cyprus pound remains the same for the euro.
</P>
<P>
"We now have to see how the euro trades against the U.S. dollar
and the Japanese yen in the international markets," Kanaris said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on euro's repercussions on the Cyprus Stock Exchange
(CSE), Kanaris said he did not expect any effect on that score
because CSE is to a large extent closed to foreign traders.

<HEADLINE> Summit on Congo(K) Crisis to Be Held in Mid-January: PANA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said
in Lusaka Monday that he is confident a cease-fire accord would be signed
by all parties to the conflict during a meeting scheduled to take place in
mid-January, Panafrican News Agency (PANA) said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, chief mediator in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) , hopes that the summit will be able to take place between
January 12 and 16 in Lusaka, PANA said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with PANA in Zambian capital, Chiluba
confirmed that the rebels fighting DRC President Laurent Kabila would
participate in the forthcoming meeting which he hopes would be a success.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels will come for the talks. We would love that all parties
feel they are obliged to observe the cease-fire," Chiluba was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in
the peace talks has been a key obstacle in finding a solution to the DRC
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's government opposes their participation, preferring to deal with
Uganda and Rwanda who are allegedly backing the rebels.
</P>
<P>
This stance has been largely attributed to the previous postponements of
the Lusaka summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian president noted that parties to the crisis had now
realized the longer they continued to fight, the worse the situation would
become and that only the implementation of a cease-fire would end
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba chairs a Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional
heads of state committee charged with coordinating peace efforts in the
five-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
The president indicated that he is still consulting with other leaders
involved in the discussions to decide on the actual date for the Lusaka
summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit has so far been postponed three times due to "other
commitments" by the leaders involved.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Cyprus Summit Possible: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus Monday
confirmed that a possible meeting between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will welcome such a meeting when there is some concrete
move in the protracted Cyprus issue, said Government Spokesman
Christos Stylinides.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke had
contacted Clerides on the possibility of the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed the discussion was staged before
Clerides decided last Tuesday not to deploy the Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
