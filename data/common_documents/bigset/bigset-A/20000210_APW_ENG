<HEADLINE> Report: Falun Gong Members Detained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities have seized 2,000 members of the banned
Falun Gong sect in the past five days, a human rights group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests began as Falun Gong members staged a protest timed for the start
of the Lunar New Year early Saturday. The Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said that since then, police in
Beijing had seized more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Altogether, authorities had detained 2,000 people in 40 Chinese cities, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said among those arrested were several members of the People's Liberation
Army who had demonstrated in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
	   The Information Center said authorities were using various methods to
pressure members of the sect to recant. Apart from being detained, some are
fined, while others lose their jobs or are denied housing allocations and their
children are prevented from getting jobs, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Chinese offices closed Thursday for the Lunar New Year, officials were
not available to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong members have staged repeated peaceful protests in Tiananmen
Square since the ruling Communist Party outlawed the group as a public menace
last July.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong is a blend of meditation, slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn
from Buddhism, Taoism and founder Li Hongzhi. Followers say it is not a religion
but promotes health and morality.
</P>
<P>
	   The government banned Falun Gong out of fears that its widespread appeal and
organizational ability could threaten Communist Party authority. Thousands of
Falun Gong adherents have since been arrested and some jailed for as long as 18
years.

<HEADLINE> Buick Unveils 1st Truck in 77 Years  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Think of a wingtip shoe with a thick cleated sole and you'll
get an idea at what Buick was aiming for with its first truck model in 77 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buick Rendezvous, to be unveiled Thursday at the Chicago Auto Show, is
General Motors Corp.'s next stab at the lucrative market for vehicles that offer
the cargo capacities of a truck and the smooth, easy ride of a sedan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous, a mechanical sibling of the Pontiac Aztek unveiled earlier
this year, is roughly the same size as the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes M-Class
SUVs, but will likely cost thousands less. Buick hopes the Rendezvous will bring
in a younger group of buyers than its current lineup of conservative sedans when
it goes on sale in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mission for Rendezvous is to go beyond what Buick has been ... to go
beyond where Buick is today in terms of our customer demographics," said
Rendezvous brand manager Jack Bowen.
</P>
<P>
	   GM and other automakers have been rushing to bring car-like SUVs to market.
In addition to the Aztek, Saturn is slated to introduce an SUV soon, and other
models may be in the works for Oldsmobile and Cadillac. Buick hasn't offered a
truck model since 1923.
</P>
<P>
	   While Buick has been one of the more successful GM divisions in the past few
years, the market for its slate of sedans is stagnant. By adding an SUV to its
lineup, Buick also hopes to change the way consumers think about the brand.
</P>
<P>
	   "The challenge that Buick faces is the image of the brand," said Chris
Cedergren, an analyst with Nextrend. "It's not bad, but among younger consumers,
even in their 40s, Buick is associated more with their parents' or grandparents'
generation."
</P>
<P>
	   Cedergren said Lincoln faced a similar problem before it introduced its
Navigator SUV. The Navigator was a hit, and its Lincoln badge did not appear to
hurt it among younger customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous has several Buick design touches, but makes a few alterations
for a beefier appearance. While the front end is distinctively Buick, the rear
pillars borrow the forward-angled look of the Lexus RX 300.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the Aztek, the Rendezvous comes with an 185-horsepower V6 that runs the
front wheels. Buick will offer an optional all-wheel-drive system that engages
automatically when sensors detect a loss of traction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous' most unique feature is a third row of seats that can fold
flat into the floor. With the seats up, the Rendezvous can hold seven people.
</P>
<P>
	   Buick officials would not give a price on the vehicle, but industry analysts
estimate it will cost between $25,000 and $29,000. Although expected production
of 50,000 Rendezvous a year would be a small part of Buick's overall sales --
the division sold 445,611 cars last year -- analysts said the effect on Buick
would be far greater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like the Aztek, it's a niche product, but in neither case are we looking
for huge volume," said Alan Baum, an analyst with IRN Inc. "GM needs products
that appeal, that are distinct. Then consumers will care about them and GM can
sell them at a profitable price."

<HEADLINE> Minority College Enrollment Is Up  </HEADLINE>
   By ARLENE LEVINSON AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Black and Hispanic high school graduates are getting swept up in the tide of
Americans pouring onto college campuses, with enrollment climbing steadily for
both groups in the 1990s, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the rate of blacks finishing high school fell in the late 1990s,
and Hispanics lagged far behind whites and blacks in getting their high school
diplomas, according to the report released Thursday by the American Council on
Education in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The study analyzed Census and Education Department figures for 1996-97, the
latest available. The GE Fund, the charitable arm of General Electric Co., paid
for the research.
</P>
<P>
	   College attendance at any time among all high school graduates ages 18 to 24
reached a record high of 45 percent in 1997. Among whites, the figure was 45
percent, up from 41 percent in 1991; blacks, a record 40 percent, up from 32
percent in 1991; Hispanics, 36 percent, vs. 33 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrollment for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and American Indians rose
4 percent between 1996 and 1997, the study found. Between 1994 and 1995, their
numbers climbed by just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of minorities who went to college represents such a small part of
the total that it had negligible effect on the overall figure of 45 percent,
said Terry Hartle, the council's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   	   The study was too soon to gauge the full effect of California and Texas
dropping affirmative action in college admissions in the two most populous
states.
</P>
<P>
	   The University of California system did away with affirmative action
beginning with the undergraduate class that entered in 1998. After a federal
court ruling, Texas ended racial preferences at state schools beginning with
students applying to enter in the fall of 1997. Washington state voters banned
race and gender criteria in admissions starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the high school graduation figures, the dropout rate represents ``a
very serious problem for African-Americans, for Latinos a catastrophe,'' said
Gary Orfield, professor of education and social policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 83 percent of whites ages 18 to 24 had high school diplomas in 1997,
compared with roughly 75 percent of blacks. In 1990, the rate among blacks was
77 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Whites holding high school diplomas were 8 percentage points ahead of blacks
in 1997, the widest gap since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The gulf between whites and Hispanics was far greater: Only 62 percent of
Hispanics ages 18 to 24 had completed high school in 1997. That was some
improvement, up from about 58 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Orfield blamed high-stakes testing -- ``They don't pass the test. They get
discouraged. They drop out'' -- the push to end social promotion and poverty
afflicting both schools and students. Among Hispanics the problem is also a lack
of English among immigrants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gwendolyn Cooke at the National Association of Secondary School Principals
blamed teachers with low expectations and inadequate training.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Teachers that lack the skills to be responsive, push kids away,'' Cooke
said. Zero-tolerance policies that eject misbehaving students also take a toll,
with blacks receiving the harshest punishment, she said.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Iowa St. 72, Missouri 62  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- An ugly halftime scene didn't ruin Iowa State's
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Fizer matched his season high with 28 points and had 12 rebounds as
the 17th-ranked Cyclones shook off coach Larry Eustachy's emotional outburst to
beat Missouri 72-62 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to say my piece and it's way behind me now, had we won or lost,"
Eustachy said. "Technicals happen, and confrontations happen, and let's not
overreact on anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State trailed by five points at halftime after a controversial
buzzer-beating basket by Keyon Dooling. It appeared that Dooling launched his
shot from mid-air in the lane just after the horn.
</P>
<P>
	   Eustachy was assessed a technical foul for vigorously arguing the call.
There was some jostling as he was hustled off the court by campus police, who
jumped into the situation. At one point, a female officer grabbed Eustachy by
the arm, and he reportedly accused her of assault on the way to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   After the game, he backed off those comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure if I said that," Eustachy aid. "I was walking out of here
upset. Nobody assaulted me. Let's talk about the ballgame, OK? Why don't we do
that?"
</P>
<P>
	   Campus police chief Fred Otto said the officers were courtside to assist the
referees in leaving the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then everything kind of happened at once," Otto said. "I think it was the
heat of the moment, and we were just doing our job."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Grawer hit the two free throws for the technical before the second
half began for a 40-35 lead. Then Iowa State took off.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought that was going to be the turning point," Missouri guard Clarence
Gilbert said. "It went totally opposite."
</P>
<P>
	   Eustachy calmed down during halftime, aside from staring at the officials
during warmups, and Iowa State took control with a 12-0 run. Kantrail Horton hit
two 3-pointers in a span of 55 seconds as the Cyclones went ahead 51-44 with
13:25 to go, and gave his coach an assist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's how intense he is, how bad he wanted to win," Horton said. "He stands
behind us."
</P>
<P>
	   Missouri cut the gap to 57-56 on 3-pointers by Rush and Dooling, the latter
with 7:13 to go. Iowa State answered with 10 straight points.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State (20-3, 8-1 Big 12) has won 17 of its last 18 games and tied
Oklahoma State for first place in the Big 12. The lone loss in that stretch was
in double overtime at Oklahoma on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great, but there's still more games and tough opponents ahead of us,"
Eustachy said. "We'll enjoy it tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Fizer was 11-for-16 and recorded his 20th career double-double -- and second
in as many games. Missouri (14-7, 7-2) had no one to counter Fizer inside as he
tied his season high for points.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's the best player in America," Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a beast," said forward Johnnie Parker, one of several Tigers who tried
to guard Fizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Fizer is playing in pain, with heel and ankle spurs on his right foot.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once it loosens up, I'm pretty good to go," Fizer said. "In a big game like
this I wasn't going to let an injury get me down, so I went out there and played
as hard as I could."
</P>
<P>
	   Stevie Johnson added 10 points and 10 rebounds for Iowa State, and Jamaal
Tinsley had 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Dooling had 18 points and Kareem Rush added 17 for Missouri, which had won
seven straight conference games since losing by five at Iowa State on Jan. 8.
The Tigers shot 35 percent in the second half and 38.5 percent overall; they
shot 49 percent during the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State had held its last 31 opponents below 50 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State is 3-1 on the road in the Big 12 after going 1-15 the previous
two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Kings 5, Coyotes 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Ziggy Palffy scored twice and Rob Blake added a goal and an
assist as the Los Angeles Kings rallied Wednesday night to edge the Phoenix
Coyotes 5-2 for their third road win since November.
</P>
<P>
	   Palffy also added an assist for his third three-point game in Los Angeles'
last four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jozef Stumpel and Bob Corkum also scored for the Kings, 3-10-2 away from
home since opening the season unbeaten in 10 of 12 road games. The victory was
the Kings' fourth in 15 games against Pacific Division opponents (4-10-1) and
their first since a 4-1 win over San Jose on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake scored the game-winner with a power-play goal with 24.3 seconds left
in the second period. Luc Robitaille carried the puck into the right corner,
drawing the Coyotes defenders away from the blue line, before turning and
passing to the trailing Blake. Blake blasted a one-timer over goalie Sean
Burke's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   With the assist, his second of the game, Robitaille moved past Darryl
Sittler into 36th place on the NHL's career-scoring list. Robitaille has 1,122
career points, one better than the former Toronto Maple Leafs forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Carney and Rick Tocchet scored first-period goals for the Coyotes, who
squandered an early 2-0 lead to lose their second straight at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Carney needed only 77 seconds to open the scoring, taking a pass from Dallas
Drake on a 2-on-1 break and shooting past a sprawling Jamie Storr to give the
Coyotes a 1-0 lead. Storr had skated to the bottom of the right faceoff circle
to challenge Drake and could only leap awkwardly at the net when the pass went
across the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix made it 2-0 at 8:06 of the period when Greg Adams redirected a Teppo
Numminen shot from the point off Tocchet's upper torso and past a surprised
Storr for a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Palffy and Stumpel brought the Kings back when each was left alone just
to the side of the net. Palffy scored from Burke's left for a power-play goal at
12:44 of the first and Stumpel scored from the other side just over five minutes
later to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   Corkum and Palffy sealed the victory with goals in the final six minutes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton complains Giuliani letter plays religion card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - As a self-described "person of faith," Hillary
Rodham Clinton says she is outraged by Rudolph Giuliani's claim that she has
displayed "hostility towards America's religious traditions."
<P>
	   But the New York City mayor, after laughing at reporters' questions, said
Wednesday that he stands by his claim. He also said teachers should be able to
post the Ten Commandments in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Senate election in which they are expected to face each other still
nine months away, an angry Clinton leveled her sharpest attack yet against
Giuliani, accusing him of "injecting religion into this race."
</P>
<P>
	   At issue was an eight-page fund-raising letter sent to people to
conservatives by the Republican mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary Clinton further revealed her hostility towards America's religious
traditions when she attacked Gov. George W. Bush's idea that we should look
toward America's faith-based charities more than government programs to address
social problems," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I stand by everything I said in the letter," Giuliani told a City Hall news
conference in New York City Wednesday. He said it had been mailed out in October
and that he would "be more than happy to have everyone in the state read that
letter."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady had never
attacked Bush's proposal and supports using faith-based charities to carry out
social programs if it is done in a constitutional manner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have worked very hard my entire life to support our fundamental religious
values in my own life and in our public life," Clinton, raised in a devout
Methodist family and a former Sunday school teacher, said at a Rochester hotel
after contents of the letter were published by the weekly Village Voice
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is any place in any campaign in America for such
statements," she said later at Syracuse University. "I would ask all New Yorkers
to take a stand against that."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if she wanted an apology from the mayor, Clinton said: "He'll have to
decide what he is going to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor maintained "it's the Clinton campaign that injected it into the
race." And, he told reporters, "You guys get spun sometimes like out of your
mind, its unbelievable ... The reality is nobody attacked her."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Richard Neuhaus, a Manhattan Catholic priest and editor of "First
Things," a magazine about religion in public life, said Wednesday that Clinton's
support for abortion rights and opposition to school vouchers are unacceptable
to certain religious groups, such as Catholics and Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: "I don't think it would be accurate to say that Mrs. Clinton
is anti-religious. I have no doubt she is deeply religious in a certain variety
of very liberal Protestant Methodism that has, in the last 25 years, been very
much in decline and out of favor. She is, in that sense, very much a child of
the 1960s religious social activist movement."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, raising religious or ethnic issues can be politically
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato found himself in hot water after he used
a Yiddish slur, "putzhead," to refer to his Democratic opponent, Charles
Schumer. Schumer, a Jew, won that race.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Republican D'Amato benefitted after his Democratic opponent,
then-state Attorney General Robert Abrams, was forced to apologize for calling
his rival a "fascist." D'Amato said it was a slur against Italian-Americans. He
won a third term.

</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati has 72 hours to work out a contract extension with Griffey that
would make the trade final.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is there has been a window requested and it has been
granted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office. ``The 72-hour clock is running.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alderson would not say what players were involved in the proposed trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Under baseball's rules, teams must first agree on the players involved in a
trade, then ask the commissioner's office for the 72-hour window. During that
time, the acquiring team can attempt to work out a new contract or an extension
with the player.

<HEADLINE> McCall gets the business from the Pataki administration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and his top aides have apparently
concluded that state Comptroller H. Carl McCall is running for governor in 2002
and that it's never too early to give him the business, campaign-style.
<P>
	   Last weekend, the comptroller released a study calling on Pataki and the
state Legislature not to expand, for now, state-sponsored gambling with new
lottery games or to let Indian tribes open new casinos. McCall said a moratorium
is needed to take stock of the gaming the state already allows, to determine
whether compulsive gambling has risen to unacceptable levels and to study the
implications of new technology-driven wagering such as over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   As politicians' pronouncements go, this was not a particularly new or bold
stance by the comptroller. A commission appointed by Congress recommended a
nationwide moratorium on gaming last year, which McCall noted while making his
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   But the response from Pataki's office suggested that those close to the
Republican governor have decided to go into hostile campaign mode against
McCall, a Democrat who acknowledges he is thinking of a run for governor in
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Conway, a Budget Division spokesman, told The New York Times he had
not seen the McCall report but said, "If it's like most of Carl McCall's recent
work products, I'm sure it will be long on political rhetoric and very short on
the facts."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman within Pataki's press office, Suzanne Morris, was telling The
Associated Press at about the same time that she, too, had not seen McCall's
report. But, she added, "If it's from H. Carl, it's the same-old, same-old. Long
on rhetoric and short on facts." (One wonders if McCall's operatives are going
to reciprocate and start referring to the governor by his given names, "George
Elmer.")
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the obviously scripted answers is a campaign theme that Pataki is
likely to use against McCall should the two men become opponents for the
governor's office in 2002: the comptroller is an opportunist whose criticism is
directed at easy, partisan targets, often in shallow and outdated audits. McCall
rarely offers solutions to accompany his complaints, this line of argument goes.
</P>
<P>
	   The studied dismissiveness toward McCall is reminiscent of a tactic Pataki
used against former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. She won office on Pataki's
ticket in 1994, then became a Democrat and ran with the Liberal Party
endorsement against him in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The drumbeat by Pataki and his operatives in McCaughey Ross' case was that
any position she took, even those involving no element of controversy, was
"bizarre." That was based on the Pataki camp's studiously maintained strategy of
painting McCaughey Ross as an erratic personality.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a bit odd of the Pataki camp to accuse McCall of playing politics by
calling for a gambling moratorium. By doing so, McCall scored few points within
his own party.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, Democrats in New York have been tolerant of state-sponsored
gaming because of the revenues it produces for the state. It has been Pataki's
fellow Republicans who have typically taken a harder line, especially members of
the Republican-controlled state Senate. They have repeatedly voted down
amendments to the state constitution legalizing non-Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Marginalizing McCall has been tried before by another major New York
Republican. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani contended that the audits
McCall did of city agencies were hatchet jobs designed to embarrass him
politically. So for two years he simply stopped letting McCall's auditors look
at agencies' books or talk to city personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   A protracted legal battle went all the way to the state's highest court, the
Court of Appeals, which ruled in 1999 that McCall does indeed have the authority
to audit New York City agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Pataki administration has also tried to rub out McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men are jointly responsible for the state's College Savings Program,
which allows people to salt money away in a special account for children's'
college costs. To promote the program, McCall and Pataki had soft-and-fuzzy
photos taken of themselves last year surrounded by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the photo appeared in the annual report of the state Higher
Education Services Corp., McCall had been crudely cut out, leaving the image of
a little girl who McCall had his arm around horribly disfigured.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked to explain this Kremlinesque doctoring of the photo to expunge a
political rival, a spokeswoman for the Higher Education Services Corp. told the
New York Post that it was OK, she expected that McCall's office was going to do
the same thing with Pataki's image in the comptroller's promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall's aides scoffed at that contention.

<HEADLINE> Senate hears of neglect, paternalism for farm workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For years, Adrian Ramirez worked often back-breaking
farm labor jobs seven days a week in daily shifts of three or more hours each
from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., including Christmas and other holidays.
<P>
	   He wasn't in Mexico. He was in New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he wants to help a joint committee of state senators to change laws
enacted in the 1930s that have kept him and 20,000 other migrant and season farm
laborers from getting overtime pay, the right to unionize, to attend religious
services, and some basic rights.
</P>
<P>
	   But farmers say union leaders and other farm worker advocates are using old
statistics and increasingly rare negative anecdotes. Farmers said many of the
state's 20,000 migrant workers are treated as family and friends, where they
work alongside their bosses and their children play video games together.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always going to be exceptions," said Denis Hughes, president of
the AFL-CIO labor organization. However, "there is a moral and ethical
obligation we have as a society to provide these workers with respect," the
respect granted "even our most hated enemies."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of two state Senate committees began gathering facts Wednesday
following recent New York Daily News articles that senators said helped focus
attention on the issue. The hearings could lead to the overhaul of state laws
enacted in the 1930s. Among them is a law that allows no overtime pay and places
these farm workers in a category separate from most other workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The statewide average farm wage is $8.12 an hour - about 20 cents to 30
cents an hour better than most other laborers, according to state statistics.
They get no overtime pay and can't be represented by unions for collective
bargaining of wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   But they also often get free housing provided by the farmer, sometimes
through a state loan program. State and federal programs offer day care and
schooling for students as well as free nursing and dental services, hot meals
for the workforce's 1,900 children, clothing and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   A new law will increase minimum farm wages by about $19 a week to a typical
wage of $314 a week. Increases will be tied to advances in the federal minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki also proposed building eight or nine more daycare centers
around the state for migrant workers' children, said Agriculture and Markets
Commissioner Nathan Rudgers.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers hired every year from Jamaica, Mexico and other countries do
work on a short, seasonal basis that local residents can't do - especially in a
competitive job market, farmers said. Some workers make enough in a few weeks to
live for the year on wages from their annual trip to the United States paid by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   All this comes at a time when dairy farmers are getting the lowest price for
milk in 20 years and a series of storms caused millions of dollars in damage
statewide in recent years, Rudgers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates acknowledge recent improvements, but say much more is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But higher wages and unions would hurt the farm workers, farmers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't go and pay overtime because I'd have to cut down their hours," said
dairy farmer Jon Greenwood, who runs an 800-cow dairy farm with his wife, Linda,
and 14 employees in St. Lawrence County. "I would have to go out and hire
additional employees and our employees would lose."
</P>
<P>
	   His workers are paid from $6.50 to $10 an hour with bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nature of farm work simply works against overtime and union controls
because the crop depends not on work schedules, but weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Hooker of the state Farm Bureau lobby for farmers, said members
considered the union issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers felt it was unnecessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Applegrower Rod Dressel Jr. from Ulster County said more regulations or
higher labor costs will result in "questionable food supply, loss of open space
and no place for workers to work."
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers said only a few farm workers, at most, aren't treated well while
union officials said the number is far higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't matter," said Damaris McGuire, a staffer for the Episcopal
Church and for Justice for Farm Workers in Albany. "The point is you have a
class of workers that are systematically excluded from basic rights."

<HEADLINE> Legislator: give more benefits to families of dead Attica guards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The relatives of the guards killed during the 1971
Attica prison riot tragedy deserve additional death benefits, a state legislator
says.
<P>
	   Daniel Burling, a Republican from Wyoming County, said the state took
advantage of the wives, parents and children of the 11 guards killed during the
Attica riot by offering them death benefits - but not making it clear that by
accepting the money, the relatives could not bring wrongful death suits against
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "They trusted their employer, the state of New York, which for many years
had been their providers," Burling said Wednesday. "But it appears to me that
the state was acting out of concern for its own self and its legal exposure."
</P>
<P>
	   By accepting the benefits, families of the dead officers were essentially
signing a legal waiver that released the state from any further liability,
according to the legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he will introduce a bill offering the 11 families $90,000 each
in additional accidental death benefits. He said he arrived at that number by
taking the average salary state prison guards made in 1971 - about $9,000 - and
multiplying it by 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was just to use as the rule of thumb to come to some feasible amount,"
Burling said. "We had to come up with something."
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the recent announcement of a proposed settlement in a suit by
former Attica inmates against the state makes the climate right to pay
additional death benefits to guards' families. Under that proposed deal, inmates
who contended they were beaten, tortured or denied medical care after the riot
was quelled will get $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the agreement with inmates was unpopular in his district. But
he added he is "not taking issue with that."
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole situation was very difficult and tragic for everyone involved,
whether it be inmates, corrections officers, families and the people who were
involved in the retaking of the prison, because they were victims too,
somewhat," Burling said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 guards were killed in the Attica riot, most in a
hail of bullets when authorities retook the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits would be paid to the surviving children of the dead officers
under Burling's legislation. If there are no children, the spouses of the dead
officers would get the money. If there are both surviving spouses and children,
they would split the money.
</P>
<P>
	   If guards died without children or spouses, their parents would get the
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The death benefits would be payable from funds in the state treasury and the
Local Employees' Retirement System, according to Burling.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said state Sen. Dale Volker, an Erie County Republican who chairs
the Codes Committee in the Senate, will sponsor the measure in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he did not know how much guards' families got in the initial
round of death benefits, but was told that one family received about $90,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Carrier, a spokesman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats would review the Burling legislation when it is filed.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Men Plotted Drugging  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDI GOLDBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Manipulation and deception led to a 15-year-old girl's
date-rape drug death, a prosecutor said in an opening statement Wednesday at the
manslaughter trial of three men.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the men gave Samantha Reid a soft drink secretly spiked with
GHB -- gamma-hydroxybutyrate -- during a party Jan. 16, 1999. Samantha died the
next day.
</P>
<P>
	   Erick Limmer, 26, Daniel Brayman, 18, Nicholas Holtschlag, 18, and Joshua
Cole, 19, are charged with manslaughter in one of the nation's first trials
resulting from a GHB-related death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weapon in this case -- that which brought about the death and near
death of the complainants -- was not a knife, not a gun, but a drug, just as
fatal as any other weapon,'' Doug Baker, a Wayne County assistant prosecutor,
told jurors Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Cole, who will
have his own jury as the only defendant alleged to have confessed, also faces
three counts of felony poisoning, each carrying a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The other suspects are charged with two poisoning counts apiece for
GHB-tainted drinks allegedly given to Samantha and a friend, who was put in a
coma temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker said testimony would show the defendants all knew the odorless, nearly
tasteless drug was being slipped to the girls during the party.
</P>
<P>
	   A person who drinks a soda laced with a few drops of GHB can lose
consciousness within 20 minutes. Victims frequently have no memory of what
happened, and the drug is difficult to trace, often leaving the body within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Brayman's attorney, John Gates, said his client had no idea the drinks were
poisoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Holtschlag's attorney, Brian Dailey, told jurors that Baker was trying to
turn the trial into a case against GHB. He accused Baker of ``trying to create
an emotional reaction to the drug and divert attention and anger to my client.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a case about a young woman who OD'd on drugs,'' Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Limmer's attorney, Cecil St. Pierre, said his client was sleeping when
Samantha and the other sickened girl became ill.

<HEADLINE> Two men convicted in church arson case, plan appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Lawyers for two men convicted of conspiring to
burn a Utica church said they plan to appeal.
<P>
	   Defense lawyers for Jimmy Jackson and Joseph Brown said they will file
motions asking U.S. District Court Judge Frederick J. Scullin to overturn the
convictions due to a lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal jury had deliberated for about six hours over two days before
finding Jackson, 33, and Brown, 22, guilty on Tuesday for the fire that
destroyed the Believers Miracle Deliverance Church.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was not there, I was home," an angry Jackson said after the jury
convicted him of conspiracy to commit arson. "Evangelist W.J. Steele implicated
me."
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was convicted of arson, conspiracy to commit arson and the use of
arson to commit a felony in the October 1997 blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors contended that the two Utica men - and two others - set
fire to the church at the request of Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr. of St. Mark's
Healing and Deliverance Church in Utica.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Ashley ordered the burning of the church in an attempt to
drive out the competition. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr, the
evidence showed that Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Roger Perkins were
involved in setting the fire at Ashley's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against the 25-year-old Savage were dropped last week so that his
wife could testify for the prosecution. Prosecutors were given permission to try
to indict him again later.
</P>
<P>
	   Perkins, now 19 and in the military at Fort Drum, agreed to plead guilty
last week to one count of conspiracy to commit arson. He will be treated as a
juvenile offender, according to U.S. Attorney Daniel J. French.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison. Jackson
could be sentenced to serve up to five years in prison. They were allowed to
remain free on $10,000 bond before sentencing June 7.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Willie Jewel Steele for starting
the rival church. Steele was assistant pastor at St. Mark's for 13 years until
she left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins
met with Savage, Brown and Jackson. Jackson was the musical director at St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins testified
that he forced open the church door and that Savage poured gasoline on the floor
and doors leading to the church sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   The 65-year-old Ashley has not been charged in the case. Neither Carr nor
French would say if there was potential government interest in Ashley, or if the
case against Savage would be picked up.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm totally disappointed. I don't think there was enough evidence to
convict him," said Bruce Benson, Jackson's brother. "How are you going to
prosecute Jimmy and let the main guys go? You can't stop here. The guys that
masterminded this, they should come to justice."

<HEADLINE> Clinton complains Giuliani letter plays religion card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - As a self-described "person of faith," Hillary
Rodham Clinton says she is outraged by Rudolph Giuliani's claim that she has
displayed "hostility towards America's religious traditions."
<P>
	   But the New York City mayor, after laughing at reporters' questions, said
Wednesday that he stands by his claim. He also said teachers should be able to
post the Ten Commandments in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Senate election in which they are expected to face each other still
nine months away, an angry Clinton leveled her sharpest attack yet against
Giuliani, accusing him of "injecting religion into this race."
</P>
<P>
	   At issue was an eight-page fund-raising letter sent to people to
conservatives by the Republican mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary Clinton further revealed her hostility towards America's religious
traditions when she attacked Gov. George W. Bush's idea that we should look
toward America's faith-based charities more than government programs to address
social problems," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I stand by everything I said in the letter," Giuliani told a City Hall news
conference in New York City Wednesday. He said it had been mailed out in October
and that he would "be more than happy to have everyone in the state read that
letter."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady had never
attacked Bush's proposal and supports using faith-based charities to carry out
social programs if it is done in a constitutional manner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have worked very hard my entire life to support our fundamental religious
values in my own life and in our public life," Clinton, raised in a devout
Methodist family and a former Sunday school teacher, said at a Rochester hotel
after contents of the letter were published by the weekly Village Voice
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is any place in any campaign in America for such
statements," she said later at Syracuse University. "I would ask all New Yorkers
to take a stand against that."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if she wanted an apology from the mayor, Clinton said: "He'll have to
decide what he is going to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor maintained "it's the Clinton campaign that injected it into the
race." And, he told reporters, "You guys get spun sometimes like out of your
mind, its unbelievable ... The reality is nobody attacked her."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Richard Neuhaus, a Manhattan Catholic priest and editor of "First
Things," a magazine about religion in public life, said Wednesday that Clinton's
support for abortion rights and opposition to school vouchers are unacceptable
to certain religious groups, such as Catholics and Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: "I don't think it would be accurate to say that Mrs. Clinton
is anti-religious. I have no doubt she is deeply religious in a certain variety
of very liberal Protestant Methodism that has, in the last 25 years, been very
much in decline and out of favor. She is, in that sense, very much a child of
the 1960s religious social activist movement."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, raising religious or ethnic issues can be politically
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato found himself in hot water after he used
a Yiddish slur, "putzhead," to refer to his Democratic opponent, Charles
Schumer. Schumer, a Jew, won that race.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Republican D'Amato benefitted after his Democratic opponent,
then-state Attorney General Robert Abrams, was forced to apologize for calling
his rival a "fascist." D'Amato said it was a slur against Italian-Americans. He
won a third term.

<HEADLINE> McCall gets the business from the Pataki administration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and his top aides have apparently
concluded that state Comptroller H. Carl McCall is running for governor in 2002
and that it's never too early to give him the business, campaign-style.
<P>
	   Last weekend, the comptroller released a study calling on Pataki and the
state Legislature not to expand, for now, state-sponsored gambling with new
lottery games or to let Indian tribes open new casinos. McCall said a moratorium
is needed to take stock of the gaming the state already allows, to determine
whether compulsive gambling has risen to unacceptable levels and to study the
implications of new technology-driven wagering such as over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   As politicians' pronouncements go, this was not a particularly new or bold
stance by the comptroller. A commission appointed by Congress recommended a
nationwide moratorium on gaming last year, which McCall noted while making his
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   But the response from Pataki's office suggested that those close to the
Republican governor have decided to go into hostile campaign mode against
McCall, a Democrat who acknowledges he is thinking of a run for governor in
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Conway, a Budget Division spokesman, told The New York Times he had
not seen the McCall report but said, "If it's like most of Carl McCall's recent
work products, I'm sure it will be long on political rhetoric and very short on
the facts."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman within Pataki's press office, Suzanne Morris, was telling The
Associated Press at about the same time that she, too, had not seen McCall's
report. But, she added, "If it's from H. Carl, it's the same-old, same-old. Long
on rhetoric and short on facts." (One wonders if McCall's operatives are going
to reciprocate and start referring to the governor by his given names, "George
Elmer.")
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the obviously scripted answers is a campaign theme that Pataki is
likely to use against McCall should the two men become opponents for the
governor's office in 2002: the comptroller is an opportunist whose criticism is
directed at easy, partisan targets, often in shallow and outdated audits. McCall
rarely offers solutions to accompany his complaints, this line of argument goes.
</P>
<P>
	   The studied dismissiveness toward McCall is reminiscent of a tactic Pataki
used against former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. She won office on Pataki's
ticket in 1994, then became a Democrat and ran with the Liberal Party
endorsement against him in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The drumbeat by Pataki and his operatives in McCaughey Ross' case was that
any position she took, even those involving no element of controversy, was
"bizarre." That was based on the Pataki camp's studiously maintained strategy of
painting McCaughey Ross as an erratic personality.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a bit odd of the Pataki camp to accuse McCall of playing politics by
calling for a gambling moratorium. By doing so, McCall scored few points within
his own party.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, Democrats in New York have been tolerant of state-sponsored
gaming because of the revenues it produces for the state. It has been Pataki's
fellow Republicans who have typically taken a harder line, especially members of
the Republican-controlled state Senate. They have repeatedly voted down
amendments to the state constitution legalizing non-Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Marginalizing McCall has been tried before by another major New York
Republican. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani contended that the audits
McCall did of city agencies were hatchet jobs designed to embarrass him
politically. So for two years he simply stopped letting McCall's auditors look
at agencies' books or talk to city personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   A protracted legal battle went all the way to the state's highest court, the
Court of Appeals, which ruled in 1999 that McCall does indeed have the authority
to audit New York City agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Pataki administration has also tried to rub out McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men are jointly responsible for the state's College Savings Program,
which allows people to salt money away in a special account for children's'
college costs. To promote the program, McCall and Pataki had soft-and-fuzzy
photos taken of themselves last year surrounded by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the photo appeared in the annual report of the state Higher
Education Services Corp., McCall had been crudely cut out, leaving the image of
a little girl who McCall had his arm around horribly disfigured.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked to explain this Kremlinesque doctoring of the photo to expunge a
political rival, a spokeswoman for the Higher Education Services Corp. told the
New York Post that it was OK, she expected that McCall's office was going to do
the same thing with Pataki's image in the comptroller's promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall's aides scoffed at that contention.

Dozens of Hostages Leave Hijacked Plane
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Dozens of hostages, including women and children,
walked out the back staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, raising
hopes that the crisis may be ending. A large-scale release was under way, with
an intermittent but steady release of people. Police would not immediately
confirm if the hostages had all been freed. Police vehicles were parked at the
foot of the stairs and bright lights shone up the staircase as a steady stream
of people walked down the stairs. Some of those leaving the plane appeared to be
holding their hands in the air. During earlier releases, passengers were not
seen leaving with their arms raised.

<HEADLINE> Senate hears of neglect, paternalism for farm workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - For years, Adrian Ramirez worked often back-breaking
farm labor jobs seven days a week in daily shifts of three or more hours each
from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., including Christmas and other holidays.
<P>
	   He wasn't in Mexico. He was in New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he wants to help a joint committee of state senators to change laws
enacted in the 1930s that have kept him and 20,000 other migrant and season farm
laborers from getting overtime pay, the right to unionize, to attend religious
services, and some basic rights.
</P>
<P>
	   But farmers say union leaders and other farm worker advocates are using old
statistics and increasingly rare negative anecdotes. Farmers said many of the
state's 20,000 migrant workers are treated as family and friends, where they
work alongside their bosses and their children play video games together.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always going to be exceptions," said Denis Hughes, president of
the AFL-CIO labor organization. However, "there is a moral and ethical
obligation we have as a society to provide these workers with respect," the
respect granted "even our most hated enemies."
</P>
<P>
	   Members of two state Senate committees began gathering facts Wednesday
following recent New York Daily News articles that senators said helped focus
attention on the issue. The hearings could lead to the overhaul of state laws
enacted in the 1930s. Among them is a law that allows no overtime pay and places
these farm workers in a category separate from most other workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The statewide average farm wage is $8.12 an hour - about 20 cents to 30
cents an hour better than most other laborers, according to state statistics.
They get no overtime pay and can't be represented by unions for collective
bargaining of wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   But they also often get free housing provided by the farmer, sometimes
through a state loan program. State and federal programs offer day care and
schooling for students as well as free nursing and dental services, hot meals
for the workforce's 1,900 children, clothing and other services.
</P>
<P>
	   A new law will increase minimum farm wages by about $19 a week to a typical
wage of $314 a week. Increases will be tied to advances in the federal minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki also proposed building eight or nine more daycare centers
around the state for migrant workers' children, said Agriculture and Markets
Commissioner Nathan Rudgers.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers hired every year from Jamaica, Mexico and other countries do
work on a short, seasonal basis that local residents can't do - especially in a
competitive job market, farmers said. Some workers make enough in a few weeks to
live for the year on wages from their annual trip to the United States paid by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   All this comes at a time when dairy farmers are getting the lowest price for
milk in 20 years and a series of storms caused millions of dollars in damage
statewide in recent years, Rudgers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates acknowledge recent improvements, but say much more is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But higher wages and unions would hurt the farm workers, farmers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't go and pay overtime because I'd have to cut down their hours," said
dairy farmer Jon Greenwood, who runs an 800-cow dairy farm with his wife, Linda,
and 14 employees in St. Lawrence County. "I would have to go out and hire
additional employees and our employees would lose."
</P>
<P>
	   His workers are paid from $6.50 to $10 an hour with bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nature of farm work simply works against overtime and union controls
because the crop depends not on work schedules, but weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Hooker of the state Farm Bureau lobby for farmers, said members
considered the union issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers felt it was unnecessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Applegrower Rod Dressel Jr. from Ulster County said more regulations or
higher labor costs will result in "questionable food supply, loss of open space
and no place for workers to work."
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers said only a few farm workers, at most, aren't treated well while
union officials said the number is far higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't matter," said Damaris McGuire, a staffer for the Episcopal
Church and for Justice for Farm Workers in Albany. "The point is you have a
class of workers that are systematically excluded from basic rights."

<HEADLINE> Legislator: give more benefits to families of dead Attica guards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The relatives of the guards killed during the 1971
Attica prison riot tragedy deserve additional death benefits, a state legislator
says.
<P>
	   Daniel Burling, a Republican from Wyoming County, said the state took
advantage of the wives, parents and children of the 11 guards killed during the
Attica riot by offering them death benefits - but not making it clear that by
accepting the money, the relatives could not bring wrongful death suits against
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "They trusted their employer, the state of New York, which for many years
had been their providers," Burling said Wednesday. "But it appears to me that
the state was acting out of concern for its own self and its legal exposure."
</P>
<P>
	   By accepting the benefits, families of the dead officers were essentially
signing a legal waiver that released the state from any further liability,
according to the legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he will introduce a bill offering the 11 families $90,000 each
in additional accidental death benefits. He said he arrived at that number by
taking the average salary state prison guards made in 1971 - about $9,000 - and
multiplying it by 10.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was just to use as the rule of thumb to come to some feasible amount,"
Burling said. "We had to come up with something."
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the recent announcement of a proposed settlement in a suit by
former Attica inmates against the state makes the climate right to pay
additional death benefits to guards' families. Under that proposed deal, inmates
who contended they were beaten, tortured or denied medical care after the riot
was quelled will get $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said the agreement with inmates was unpopular in his district. But
he added he is "not taking issue with that."
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole situation was very difficult and tragic for everyone involved,
whether it be inmates, corrections officers, families and the people who were
involved in the retaking of the prison, because they were victims too,
somewhat," Burling said.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 guards were killed in the Attica riot, most in a
hail of bullets when authorities retook the prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits would be paid to the surviving children of the dead officers
under Burling's legislation. If there are no children, the spouses of the dead
officers would get the money. If there are both surviving spouses and children,
they would split the money.
</P>
<P>
	   If guards died without children or spouses, their parents would get the
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The death benefits would be payable from funds in the state treasury and the
Local Employees' Retirement System, according to Burling.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said state Sen. Dale Volker, an Erie County Republican who chairs
the Codes Committee in the Senate, will sponsor the measure in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   Burling said he did not know how much guards' families got in the initial
round of death benefits, but was told that one family received about $90,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Carrier, a spokesman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats would review the Burling legislation when it is filed.

<HEADLINE> Two men convicted in church arson case, plan appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Lawyers for two men convicted of conspiring to
burn a Utica church said they plan to appeal.
<P>
	   Defense lawyers for Jimmy Jackson and Joseph Brown said they will file
motions asking U.S. District Court Judge Frederick J. Scullin to overturn the
convictions due to a lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal jury had deliberated for about six hours over two days before
finding Jackson, 33, and Brown, 22, guilty on Tuesday for the fire that
destroyed the Believers Miracle Deliverance Church.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was not there, I was home," an angry Jackson said after the jury
convicted him of conspiracy to commit arson. "Evangelist W.J. Steele implicated
me."
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was convicted of arson, conspiracy to commit arson and the use of
arson to commit a felony in the October 1997 blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors contended that the two Utica men - and two others - set
fire to the church at the request of Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr. of St. Mark's
Healing and Deliverance Church in Utica.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Ashley ordered the burning of the church in an attempt to
drive out the competition. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr, the
evidence showed that Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Roger Perkins were
involved in setting the fire at Ashley's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against the 25-year-old Savage were dropped last week so that his
wife could testify for the prosecution. Prosecutors were given permission to try
to indict him again later.
</P>
<P>
	   Perkins, now 19 and in the military at Fort Drum, agreed to plead guilty
last week to one count of conspiracy to commit arson. He will be treated as a
juvenile offender, according to U.S. Attorney Daniel J. French.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison. Jackson
could be sentenced to serve up to five years in prison. They were allowed to
remain free on $10,000 bond before sentencing June 7.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Willie Jewel Steele for starting
the rival church. Steele was assistant pastor at St. Mark's for 13 years until
she left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins
met with Savage, Brown and Jackson. Jackson was the musical director at St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins testified
that he forced open the church door and that Savage poured gasoline on the floor
and doors leading to the church sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   The 65-year-old Ashley has not been charged in the case. Neither Carr nor
French would say if there was potential government interest in Ashley, or if the
case against Savage would be picked up.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm totally disappointed. I don't think there was enough evidence to
convict him," said Bruce Benson, Jackson's brother. "How are you going to
prosecute Jimmy and let the main guys go? You can't stop here. The guys that
masterminded this, they should come to justice."

<HEADLINE> More Walk Off Hijacked Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- About 85 men, women and children walked down the
staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, a dramatic release that
buoyed hopes for a peaceful end to a near four-day hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said negotiations were continuing to win freedom for dozens of other
captives still aboard the Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport near London.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest release of hostages so far came about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 p.m. EST
Wednesday) as the heavily armed hijackers let women and children leave the
aircraft then followed by the men.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were taken to a safe location and were to undergo medical
checks, said Joe Edwards, Essex County police assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All those who left are indeed hostages,'' Edwards said. ``There are still
people on board; negotiations continue,'' he said. ``The negotiations are also
at a fairly critical stage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 hostages, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday on a domestic
flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey,
stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby and
bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people leaving
the Ariana airlines jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers left the aircraft for a meeting
with negotiators on the tarmac outside the plane, said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police had expressed hope on Wednesday that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the captives were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a
wedding in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be
bride, said Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media that the plane was seized as part
of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the hostages were
in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators had insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans, were armed with
grenades, pistols and daggers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

	   "It's all about the team," Rodman said. "It's not about Dennis Rodman."
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, who wore No. 70, didn't look like a 38-year-old guy who has been out
of the NBA for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   He was aggressive from the opening tip -- which he caught -- as he snatched
the game's first miss and got fouled by Vin Baker. Then Patterson made the
mistake of trying to drive to the hoop through Rodman. Both went down, but only
Rodman got up. Patterson, who was called for a charge, remained flat on his face
for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman sat out the first few minutes of the second quarter, but he grabbed
the first available rebound when he returned. There was a near blowup soon
after, though, as he was called for two quick fouls -- both of which he
disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, obviously peeved, ran upcourt cupping the ball as if he were going
to heave it, but instead marched to the far sideline and placed it down softly.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman played 16 minutes in each half. He went to the bench for good with
5:23 left to play and Seattle up by 12. As he left the court, he flipped his
jersey to a woman in the stands who may still be screaming with delight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought he came focused to play," Seattle coach Paul Westphal said. "If
he comes serious about basketball, he'll help them."
</P>
<P>
	   Rodmania was in full swing Wednesday night. The crowd of 18,203 was the
second-largest ever to see a Mavericks game in Reunion Arena, 52 fewer than
Michael Jordan drew for his last Dallas appearance two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was surprised," said Rodman, who also played in that game as a member of
the Chicago Bulls. "I felt like Michael Jordan for a minute. This is how people
live in Texas. They're very generous."
</P>
<P>
	   Some had homemade signs, such as "Oh my God, it's Rodzilla" and "Welcome
back Worm. We missed you. Go Mavs." Six shirtless teen-agers wore goofy hats and
wigs and had R-O-D-M-A-N spelled on their chests. Others painted their hair blue
and green and a few had very fake-looking earrings and nose rings.
</P>
<P>
	   The team issued more than 100 extra media credentials, forcing some of the
overflow to be stashed in the hockey press box. Such attention is unheard of for
a team that's last playoff win came before Rodman had his first tattoo.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, though, appeared unfazed by it all.
</P>
<P>
	   He shook hands with singer Montell Jordan during pregame warmups, then
rocked nervously from side to side as Jordan sang the national anthem. When
Rodman was the first starter announced, he danced in place under a spotlight
without even cracking a smile.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman got the evening off to a good note by showing up five minutes earlier
than he had to, getting into the locker room at 6:10 p.m. even though his
teammates had been at Reunion Arena for well over an hour. That's when he
learned he was starting.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's going to start eventually anyway, so we might as well throw him right
in there," coach-general manager Don Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the arena, the frenzy was already in high gear.
</P>
<P>
	   Herb and Wanda Patlis drove about 90 minutes from Waco to see Rodman in
action. In an unintentional yet fitting tribute to Rodman, they were hoping to
cash in on his presence by selling a framed, autographed poster of Rodman as a
Chicago Bull for a couple hundred bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like his showmanship," Wanda Patlis said. "I just think he's always done
a good job of promoting himself. That's why I'm here. I just hope he behaves
himself."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks are risking only about $460,000 on having Rodman the rest of
this season, and they seemed poised to recoup their investment in one night.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the sellout, blue and green road jerseys of Rodman's No. 70
were rushed to the concession stands and going for $43. T-shirts weren't yet
available because there were no action shots of Rodman as a Maverick.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Inspecting Fleet  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. urged airlines Wednesday to inspect their
fleets of MD-80 jetliners after a damaged piece of the tail wing that could have
contributed to the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing recommended that mechanics visually check the jackscrew that moves
the horizontal stabilizer, a tail-mounted wing that is the focus of the
investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 people off the coast of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation covers about 2,000 planes, in the MD-80 series like the
Alaska Airlines plane, as well as MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Boeing bought aircraft builder McDonnell Douglas, which designed
and constructed the MD series.
</P>
<P>
	   Inspection reports will be studied by the Federal Aviation Administration,
which can order further action if it finds evidence of a safety problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been talking to the carriers and strongly encouraging them to make
this inspection as rapidly as possible,'' said FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska, American and Delta airlines said earlier in the day they had begun
inspecting their fleets. Some schedule delays were possible, airline officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska expected to have its 34-plane fleet inspected within hours, American
said it would take a week to look at its 284 series planes and Delta said all
136 of its series planes would be inspected by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots aboard the ill-fated flight spent their final minutes struggling to
control the stabilizer before the aircraft nose-dived into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   A two-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered with the main wreckage of
the MD-83 about 10 miles off the coast. At first Alaska said Wednesday the
jackscrew was found to be stripped, but later the airline changed its statement
and said only that the screw had been damaged, reflecting the description by the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ... that there
was some damage to it,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said. ``It was unclear whether
the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the water.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,100 MD-80 series aircraft are flown by nearly 70 airlines
worldwide, making them some of the most popular commercial jetliners ever built.
Boeing announced in 1997 it would phase out the MD-80 and MD-90 passenger
aircraft models it inherited when it bought McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration has not told airlines to make additional
checks of the tail section of MD-80 series aircraft, but that could change as
the investigation evolves, agency spokesman Paul Turk said. ``We won't hesitate
to do whatever is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators in the Alaska Airlines crash are focusing on the stabilizer, a
wing-like device on the jet's tail, because pilots reported problems with it
after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is powered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew-like
device that opens many automatic garage doors. If the jackscrew was damaged
during flight, the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range,
causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock,
associate director for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots would not be able to control the up-or-down motion of the
aircraft -- which would be consistent with flight data that shows the plane went
into a 3.4-mile nosedive and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen
off the plane as the dive began.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's autopilot was disengaged when the jetliner reached 29,000 feet,
and the jet was flown manually for one hour and 53 minutes. Pilots say it is
unusual to fly manually for that long and could suggest a problem with the
autopilot or any number of other systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the MD-83 involved in the crash had two maintenance write-ups
last fall for problems with the horizontal stabilizer. In October, the system
was checked and the plane returned to service. A month later, mechanics replaced
a switch.

<HEADLINE> Griffey to Reds Trade Tentative  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seattle and Cincinnati agreed Wednesday night to a
tentative trade sending Ken Griffey Jr. to the Reds, a top official told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati has 72 hours to work out a contract extension with Griffey that
would make the trade final.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is there has been a window requested and it has been
granted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office. ``The 72-hour clock is running.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alderson would not say what players were involved in the proposed trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Under baseball's rules, teams must first agree on the players involved in a
trade, then ask the commissioner's office for the 72-hour window. During that
time, the acquiring team can attempt to work out a new contract or an extension
with the player.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN reported earlier that the Mariners and Reds were working on a three-way
deal involving the Anaheim Angels and outfielder Jim Edmonds, but it wasn't
clear if the deal presented to baseball Wednesday night included two teams or
three.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey, eligible for free agency after the season, told the Mariners in
November that he wanted to be traded to a team closer to his home in Orlando,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariners general manager Pat Gillick held talks with the New York Mets the
following month, but Griffey then said he would accept a trade only to
Cincinnati, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   Reds general manager Jim Bowden cut off negotiations at the winter meetings,
saying the Mariners' demands were too steep but talks resumed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, said Tuesday the Mariners had given him
permission to talk directly with the Reds in an effort to break the impasse.
Since there was no deal in place then and no 72-hour window, that appeared to
violate baseball's rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enough occurred for us to look into it,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alderson said whether any penalties would be issued is something ``that
still has to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say this wouldn't take us very long,'' he added. ``Sometime next
week at the latest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis scored 23 points as the Portland
Trail Blazers held onto the NBA's best record by beating the Los Angeles
Clippers 107-100 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith added 17 points for the Blazers, who won their 11th straight
home game and improved to 38-11 overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor led the Clippers with 23 points and Troy Hudson added 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson scored 16 on 4-of-5 3-point shooting in the first quarter as the
Clippers took a 38-20 lead. The Blazers trailed by as many as 18 in the second
quarter and 10 at halftime before starting the third quarter with a 16-2 run.
</P>
<P>
	   A reverse layup by Brian Skinner pulled the Clippers within 93-92 with 3:26
to go. A 22-foot jumper by Taylor pulled the Clippers within 99-96, and a dunk
by Taylor cut it to 101-98 with 44 seconds left, but they couldn't get any
closer.

<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace had 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, and Detlef
Schrempf added 15 points.

<HEADLINE> Lab Technician Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A former lab technician plead guilty Wednesday to
misdemeanor assault and felony unlawful disposal of radioactive material for
smearing a compound on a co-worker's chair.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Andris Blakis, 32, was sentenced to 120 days in jail and three years
probation, Orange County Deputy District Attorney Lance Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blakis also was ordered to stay away from the victim, a postdoctoral
researcher at the University of California, Irvine, and pay any future medical
costs she may incur as a result of the assault.
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen said the July 1, 1999, incident occurred because Blakis believed the
researcher, Jingtong Zuo, had tried to poison him with a radioactive substance,
P32 isotope, a waxy, colorless chemical used in DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Blakis put the compound on her chair, Jensen said. She sat on the chair for
about six hours before she discovered the contamination, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators estimate she was exposed to an average yearlong dose of
radiation during the time. She has not experienced any side effects of radiation
poisoning, Jensen said.

<HEADLINE> More Walk Off Hijacked Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- About 85 men, women and children walked down the
staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, a dramatic release that
buoyed hopes for a peaceful end to a near four-day hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said negotiations were continuing to win freedom for dozens of other
captives still aboard the Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport near London.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest release of hostages so far came about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 p.m. EST
Wednesday) as the heavily armed hijackers let women and children leave the
aircraft then followed by the men.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostages were taken to a safe location and were to undergo medical
checks, said Joe Edwards, Essex County police assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We also have to verify that all those who left are indeed hostages,''
Edwards said. ``There are still people on board; negotiations continue,'' he
said. ``The negotiations are also at a fairly critical stage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 hostages, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday on a domestic
flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey,
stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby and
bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people leaving
the Ariana airlines jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers left the aircraft for a meeting
with negotiators on the tarmac outside the plane, said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police had expressed hope on Wednesday that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the captives were 39 members of one family who were traveling to a
wedding in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif -- including the would-be
bride, said Mohammed Daoud Sharisi, who sells tickets at the Ariana office in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted in the British media that the plane was seized as part
of an elaborate bid for political asylum -- and that some of the hostages were
in on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers,'' the tabloid
Mirror blared on its front page. The Daily Star lamented ``Oh no! They ALL want
to stay (and we'll have to pay).''
</P>
<P>
	   Fueling the asylum speculation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be
providing expertise but would not be joining the negotiating team, said Edwards.
The commission's London office identified the observer as Hope Hanlan.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions about the validity of the asylum theory, Edwards
said: ``Why are they still in there? We've been asking them to come out since
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, the hijackers ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane. His departure
came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second captain, first
officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower themselves from
the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men, presumed to be hijackers, appeared briefly on the ground at the
rear of the plane Wednesday morning to collect fresh supplies. That evening, two
men descended the jet's rear steps and collected an evening meal -- a result of
the continuing negotiations. They appeared to carry out an inspection of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators had insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands,
political or otherwise. The men, believed to be Afghans, were armed with
grenades, pistols and daggers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kabul, an Ariana employee said Wednesday that several airline officials
responsible for security checks on the hijacked flight had been arrested. An
Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
employees were questioned but allowed to go back to work.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Mayor Again Implicated  </HEADLINE>
   By MELANIE BURNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Another convicted drug dealer has testified that Mayor
Milton Milan was involved in the city's illegal drug trade before he was elected
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations emerged in the drug conspiracy trial of two men accused of
running the largest cocaine ring in Camden history before it was toppled in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, 37, a first-term Democrat and the city's first Latino mayor, is not
charged in the case and has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He has denied
any involvement in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just ridiculous,'' Milan said Wednesday. ``I really don't care what
they have to say. I think you have a lot of character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Saul Febo said he was a ``trapper'' for a year for Milan and others, selling
bundles of cocaine in exchange for a portion of the profits. He said Milan sold
drugs in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   In earlier testimony Wednesday, another convicted drug dealer, Ernesto
Padilla, also said Milan sold cocaine around 1987 or 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week at the trail, drug dealer Wilson Torres was the first to testify
that Milan sold cocaine -- $20 bags in the '80s. Two other dealers, Lucas Torres
and Camildo Cruz, have said that Milan purchased kilo quantities of cocaine at
least twice in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose ``J.R.'' Rivera, 40, and Luis ``Tun Tun'' Figueroa, 34, are among 14
people charged with operating the ring that prosecutors say once controlled
Camden's drug market. The 12 others have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Rivera and Figueroa face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Malone Will Play as All-Star  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone's agent says the two-time MVP will play
in Sunday's All-Star game but Malone isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
	   After scoring 30 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in a 113-86 victory over
Chicago Wednesday night, Malone was asked whether he would be in Oakland for the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going home right now to get some rest," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked again whether he was playing in the game, he said, "My decision has
been made," but refused to say what the decision was.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone had said Tuesday that he would announce his plans after Wednesday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, said Wednesday that Malone had been cleared
by a doctor and would play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the last I've heard," Manley said. "I think the doctor gave him
permission to play."
</P>
<P>
	   A league spokesman said he had no information about Malone's situation.
</P>
<P>
	   It would be the 12th All-Star appearance for Malone, who averages 25.4
points a game to rank fourth in the NBA. Malone missed the All-Star game in 1990
with an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone said last week he planned to spend the All-Star break at his ranch in
Arkansas, resting recurrent injuries to his back and the middle finger of his
shooting hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hell, yeah, my body needs a break. And when the proper time comes, I'm
going to take it," the 36-year-old Malone said after Thursday night's loss to
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday that league officials threatened
Malone with a five-game suspension, which would cost him about $850,000 in
salary.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Manley denied that a fine or suspension was discussed. He said the
only concern about whether Malone would go to Oakland centered on the injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Manley said Malone had indicated he needed to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Malone reportedly has grumbled that the league makes a greater
effort to promote younger players such as Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and San
Antonio's Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett and Duncan were voted All-Star starters by fans while Malone was
named a reserve in voting by Western Conference coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past week, Malone has said little about the All-Star situation.
However, Jazz owner Larry Miller said last week Malone doesn't feel respected by
NBA administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   "Karl's a proud guy," Miller said. "I think he feels underappreciated by the
league."

<HEADLINE> Stars 5, Mighty Ducks 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jamie Langenbrunner scored twice in his return from
the injured list and Dave Manson had a goal in his Dallas debut as the Stars
beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 5-3 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenden Morrow and Sergei Zubov also scored for the Stars, who lost Brett
Hull less than 12 minutes into the game with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest in a rash of injuries for Dallas, which won its fourth
straight despite the absence of Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Derian Hatcher,
Brian Skrudland and Shawn Chambers. In addition, Aaron Gavey missed his second
straight game because of a hyperextended knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Kariya scored his 200th NHL goal and Fredrik Olausson and Matt Cullen
also scored for the Ducks, who lost to the Stars for the 22nd time in their last
30 meetings. Ed Belfour, whose next victory will be his 300th, made 23 saves to
improve his record against Anaheim to 17-6-1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars have 42 consecutive victories when they score at least three
goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim tied the score 1-1 at 11:55 of the first period during a hooking
penalty against Hull, accidentally cut on the bridge of the nose by the stick of
Jeff Nielsen as he hauled down the Ducks right wing.
</P>
<P>
	   Olausson capitalized on the man-advantage by one-timing Paul Kariya's feed
past Belfour's stick hand from 55 feet. It was Anaheim's 10th power-play goal in
six games and only the third surrendered by Dallas, the league's top
penalty-killing unit, in 58 short-handed situations.
</P>
<P>
	   Olausson's eighth goal extended his point-scoring streak to nine games, the
longest this season by any NHL defenseman, and broke the club record for
defenseman set by J.J. Daigneault.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars went ahead 2-1 about four minutes later on the power play. Guy
Hebert stopped Zubov's slap shot from the right point, but Mike Modano grabbed
the rebound at the right on the net and set up Morrow's short backhander from
the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Manson, dealt to the Stars on Thursday with Sylvain Cote, ended a 40-game
goal-scoring drought with his first since last April 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Cullen cut it to 3-2 with 38 seconds left in the second. But Zubov restored
Dallas' two-goal margin less than three minutes into the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya converted Teemu Selanne's pass from behind the net with 8:07
remaining for his 31st goal, but the rally fell short.
</P>
<P>
	   Langenbrunner, who missed 11 games because of bruised ribs and a pinched
nerve in his neck, opened the scoring on a power play at the 6:46 mark and added
his ninth goal with 4:21 to play.

Dozens Leave Hijacked Plane
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- About 85 men, women and children walked down the
staircase of a hijacked Afghan plane early Thursday, a dramatic release that
buoyed hopes for a peaceful end to a near four-day hostage drama. Police said
negotiations were continuing to win freedom for dozens of other captives still
aboard the Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport near London. The largest
release of hostages so far came about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 p.m. EST Wednesday) as
the heavily armed hijackers let women and children leave the aircraft then
followed by the men.

<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis scored 23 points as the Portland
Trail Blazers held onto the NBA's best record by beating the Los Angeles
Clippers 107-100 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith added 17 points for the Blazers, who won their 11th straight
home game and improved to 38-11 overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor led the Clippers with 23 points and Troy Hudson added 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson scored 16 on 4-of-5 3-point shooting in the first quarter as the
Clippers took a 38-20 lead. The Blazers trailed by as many as 18 in the second
quarter and 10 at halftime before starting the third quarter with a 16-2 run.
</P>
<P>
	   A reverse layup by Brian Skinner pulled the Clippers within 93-92 with 3:26
to go. A 22-foot jumper by Taylor pulled the Clippers within 99-96, and a dunk
by Taylor cut it to 101-98 with 44 seconds left, but they couldn't get any
closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace had 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, and Detlef
Schrempf added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers have lost four in a row and 15 of 16. They fell to 0-3 under
interim coach Jim Todd, who stepped in when Chris Ford was fired last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers turned it around in the third after trailing 55-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabonis had 15 points in the quarter, and his dunk tied it at 57. Wallace
gave the Blazers their first lead at 59-57 with a turnaround jumper with 7:03
left in the third. Los Angeles didn't quit, and a 3-pointer by Hudson at the
buzzer put the Clippers up 79-77.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers didn't have any turnovers in the third quarter after committing
nine in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers ran out to a quick lead, capitalizing on seven Blazers
turnovers in the first quarter. Hudson's third 3-pointer put Los Angeles up
29-16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers came back in the second quarter. Damon Stoudamire, who sat at
the end of the Blazers' bench sulking with his jersey off after coach Mike
Dunleavy put Greg Anthony in to guard Hudson, hit a deep jumper, and Schrempf
sank two free throws to cut it to a 10-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace hit a bank shot with just under a minute left to cut the lead to
50-45, but the Clippers pushed the lead back to 10 points as Lamar Odom hit a
wide-open 3-pointer and Eric Piatkowski hit a fast-break layup.

<P>
	   The first group of hostages -- women and children, followed by men -- were
allowed to leave the plane about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 EST).
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how many hostages were released in the second
batch, or if any of the hijackers also left the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Edwards, Essex County police assistant chief constable, had said earlier
that the released hostages would be taken to a safe location and would undergo
medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 hostages, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday on a domestic
flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey,
stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the first surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby
and bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people
leaving the jetliner, the men with their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers had left the aircraft for a
meeting with negotiators on the tarmac, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the negotiations continued in person or via other
channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also left a box of unspecified ``equipment'' near the steps where the
first group of passengers exited, to assist with negotiations, police
spokeswoman Kim White said. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Police expressed hope on Wednesday that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Wednesday, the hijackers had ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   His departure came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second
captain, first officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower
themselves from the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the negotiations, authorities insisted the armed men had made no
formal demands, political or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades, pistols and daggers,
had requested only that food, water and other comfort items be brought to the
plane, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted, however, that the plane was seized as part of an
elaborate bid for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   At the airliner's three stops before landing at Stansted, 25 miles north of
London, the hijackers released a total of 22 passengers. On Monday and Tuesday,
10 hostages were let go at Stansted.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Deacon Denies Assaulting Teen  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY REEVES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON, Ala. (AP) -- A man accused of assaulting a teen-ager at an
Alabama commune pleaded innocent as the victim's family raised new questions
about a 1998 fire that killed four children at the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Lee Roberts, in a written plea, denied a misdemeanor charge. A judge
set a March 13 trial date for Roberts, 48, described by authorities as a deacon
at the Pentecostal commune called Holyland, home to dozens of children and
adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Holyland resident Derrick Wilson, 13, said in an interview that
Roberts knocked him to the ground, choked him and struck him 20 times with a
paddle for pushing a boy who was picking on a female cousin.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts' attorney, Walter Griess, was not in court Wednesday and did not
return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics allege widespread abuse of children and the exploitation of poor
blacks at Holyland. Founder Luke Edwards, himself black, contends his foes are
jealous of his success.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court, Geraldine Wilson, Derrick's mother, and her 15-year-old son,
Jeffery, said Edwards predicted at least two blazes that occurred at the
compound. Four children died when flames swept through a wood-frame dormitory in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   State investigators ruled the deadly blaze an accident started by an
electric lamp placed too near a bed, which caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffery Wilson, who said he was living at the Holyland at the time of the
fatal blaze, said Edwards repeatedly predicted the girl's dorm would be
destroyed and that children would die.
</P>
<P>
	   After questioning the Wilsons about the fires Wednesday, the Sumter County
sheriff's office contacted the fire marshal's office, which sent an investigator
to talk with the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Brown, a Holyland spokesman, defended it in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time a person stumps his toe at the Holyland, it's automatically going
to be local, state, national and international news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Edwards predicting the fires, Brown said: ``I haven't heard him make
those predictions. I did hear him say one time that he had dreamed of a fire.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 114, Timberwolves 81  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN NADEL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 18 of his 37 points in the first
six minutes of the second quarter Wednesday night, leading the Los Angeles
Lakers to a 114-81 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal made seven of eight field goal attempts and four of five foul shots
as the Lakers outscored the Timberwolves 20-7 to begin the second period for a
44-25 lead. O'Neal scored the final 18 points of the spurt, giving him 25 at
that juncture.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal, who made 11 of 16 shots and a surprising 15 of 20 free throws, also
finished with 16 rebounds, three assists and four blocked shots before leaving
the game with 5:19 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers extended a 13-point halftime lead to 78-53 late in the third
quarter, and the Timberwolves wound up suffering their most one-sided loss of
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant, who sat out the fourth quarter, added 24 points for the Lakers,
who won their third straight but are just 6-6 since their 16-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 29 points and six rebounds and Tom Hammonds added a
season-high 12 points for the Timberwolves, who lost for just the third time in
12 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers went ahead for good by outscoring Minnesota 11-2 for a 19-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves made just 8 of 23 shots in the first period, which ended
with Los Angeles leading 24-18, and missed their first six of the second while
the Lakers went on a 13-1 run.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota scored the final five points of the first half to cut the Lakers'
lead to 54-41. O'Neal wound up with 20 points in the second period -- the most
by a Los Angeles player in a quarter this season.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Form New Privacy Groups  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, grappling with complex
privacy issues, are forming groups to discuss possible new legislation and
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., announced Wednesday the
formation of a Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, while Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., disclosed the creation of a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of
senators and House members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely
personal ways,'' Daschle said in a statement. ``Whether it is bank records or
medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to expect that
personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because laws have not kept pace with sweeping technological changes, Daschle
added, Americans' right to privacy is at risk. ``Some of our most sensitive,
private (data) end up on databases that are then sold to the highest bidder,''
he said. ``That is wrong, it's dangerous and it has to stop.''

<P>
	   Pollsters have found that privacy now is one of the highest priorities for
Americans, who have expressed concern about threats to their privacy involving
financial data, health records and employment records, Daschle noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted in November sweeping legislation removing Depression-era
barriers and allowing banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get
into each other's businesses. It included, for the first time, provisions giving
consumers the right to block financial companies from providing their personal
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers. However, the companies will be
able to share customers' data with affiliated financial companies under the same
corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, lawmakers may consider legislation regarding medical privacy and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Democratic task force will be headed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Democratic senators have expressed interest in joining the group, Leahy
spokesman David Carle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, a conservative, and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a liberal
Democrat, bitterly opposed the financial overhaul legislation last year on
grounds its privacy protections were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby and Markey will be co-chairmen of the new privacy caucus, along with
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remain convinced that the American people do not want financial
(companies) to collect, profile, buy and sell consumers' ... personal financial
information at will,'' Shelby said. ``Families ... do not want complete
strangers buying and selling their personal profile like currency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some two dozen single-issue caucuses now exist on Capitol Hill, including
the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and caucuses on women's
issues, human rights, Social Security, seniors, rural health, AIDS and the
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Twenty-one Sterling Foster brokers charged in small-stock scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The head of New York's FBI office warned that the
government is watching closely to make sure the high-flying stock market does
not become a tool for crime.
<P>
	   FBI Assistant Director Lewis D. Schiliro said Wednesday that charges brought
against 21 former managers and brokers at a defunct Long Island company should
send "a clear message to others who would prey on unsuspecting good-faith
investors."
</P>
<P>
	   "While the current period of unparalleled prosperity provides a window of
opportunity for investors big and small, it should not be looked at as a window
of opportunity for unscrupulous boiler-room operators using high-pressure sales
tactics to pump-and-dump worthless securities," he said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges against the employees of Melville-based Sterling Foster &AMP; Co.
alleged they tricked investors from 1994 to 1997 into buying certain stocks so
they could artificially inflate their prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said they used high pressure, false and misleading sales pitches
to convince customers that the stocks would rise rapidly in value, producing
more than $200 million in illegal profits for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the defendants were part of so-called
boiler rooms where "corrupt brokers prey on the unsuspecting public."
</P>
<P>
	   In a release, she said the boiler rooms where brokers try to heat up the
value of a stock through deceit "are particularly dangerous because they serve
as a boot camp to train the next generation of boiler-room operators."
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor noted that many of the 21 defendants held management or
supervisory positions at Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges stemmed from six public offerings, five of which were
underwritten by Sterling Foster. The defendants were each charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   An indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleged that the
stocks were promoted without disclosing to customers that the brokers were
receiving excessive undisclosed compensation as high as 15 percent of the price
of the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors earlier had brought charges against the company and several
others, including Randolph Pace, who allegedly secretly controlled the company,
and Alan Novich, an attorney and former dentist alleged to be an accomplice.
Both are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other defendants had pleaded guilty to charges arising out of 11
allegedly fraudulent public offerings involving Sterling Foster. Those
defendants have forfeited or agreed to give up about $32 million in illegal
gains, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the criminal charges Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission also brought civil securities fraud charges against 18 defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiliro said the indictment Wednesday resulted from a focus on managers and
supervisors at Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will set our sights on not just the headliners, but also the supporting
casts of these productions," Schiliro said.

<HEADLINE> First lady's donors include those criticized for helping president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Some players in President Clinton's 1996 fund raising
scandal have resurfaced, this time as donors to the first lady's U.S. Senate
bid.
<P>
	   Several of Hillary Rodham Clinton's donors were overnight guests in the
Lincoln Bedroom and others attended White House coffees. Both practices came
under criticism from Republicans, who accused the president of improperly
providing White House access to those who ponied up campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's camp stands by the contributors, saying they have done
nothing wrong. Her spokesman Howard Wolfson said it makes sense that people who
supported the president also support the first lady's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the camp of her likely opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, attacked the
donations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton is importing to New York the unethical and tainted
fund-raising practices that were the center of the fund-raising scandals that
rocked the White House after the 1996 election," Giuliani spokeswoman Kim
Serafin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the donors to the first lady who stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom was
Walter Kaye, an insurance executive who recommended Monica Lewinsky for her
internship. With his wife, Kaye gave $7,000 to Clinton and committees supporting
her.
</P>
<P>
	   William Brandt, a bankruptcy expert, hosted a fund-raiser for the first lady
in Florida. His name surfaced in the Clinton scandals when bankruptcy experts
complained that he had promoted a $10,000 fund-raiser for the president in 1996
as an opportunity to influence federal policy, The New York Times reported in
Wednesday's editions. Brandt denied the charges and the Justice Department
declined to investigate the case, The Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with his company, Development Specialists, Brandt donated $20,000 to
Clinton and committees set up on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandt told The Times that Republicans criticizing the first lady's fund
raising are trying to "drive people like me from the arena so that their
viewpoints can dominate."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other donors to the first lady with ties to the president's
fund-raising troubles were Farhad Azima. In 1997, the Democratic National
Committee returned more than $140,000 from Azima after his company, Aviation
Leasing Group, was linked to the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal. Investigators had
found that a jet used to deliver arms to Iran belonged to Azima.
</P>
<P>
	   The DNC later reversed itself and kept Azima's money.
</P>
<P>
	   Another major donor to the first lady is Bernard Schwartz, whose company
Loral Space Communications Corp. is being investigated by the Justice Department
over allegations it violated export laws in providing China with satellite
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwartz and his wife donated some $40,000 to Clinton and her committees.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has sought to portray the first lady's fund raising as
unethical, her camp has attacked Giuliani for raising a large amount of money
from conservatives around the nation.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 4, Flames 3, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mattias Ohlund scored 1:22 into overtime
Wednesday night, lifting the Vancouver Canucks to a 4-3 win over Calgary and
extending the Flames winless streak to seven.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Messier had two goals and also set up Ohlund's game-winner, which came
on the power play, 10 seconds after Calgary's Derek Morris was issued a penalty
for tripping Alexander Mogilny. Messier fed a no-look pass to Ohlund, who
one-timed a shot from the right circle that trickled through goalie Fred
Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   Mogilny also scored and Andrew Cassels had two assists for the Canucks, who
snapped a three-game losing streak. The Canucks also ended a 0-5-1 drought
against the Flames, going back to last April.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobby Dollas scored twice and Phil Housley had a goal as the Flames dropped
to 0-4-2 in their last six games. Despite the loss, the Flames earned one point
to move into a ninth-place tie in the Western Conference with the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   Dollas scored with 8:11 left in regulation to make it 3-3. The goal came
eight minutes after Mogilny regained the Canucks lead by snapping a 25-footer
over Brathwaite's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   After a scoreless first period, the teams each scored twice in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier had goals 65 seconds apart on consecutive Vancouver power-plays,
putting the Canucks ahead 2-0 at 11:02.
</P>
<P>
	   Housley made it 2-1 when he was set up by Jarome Iginla's centering pass at
12:03. Dollas tied it on a Flames' power-play, snapping a 35-footer from the
right circle that banked in off the far post.
</P>
<P>
	   For Messier, it was his second two-goal effort in five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Bure, the Flames leading scorer, had an assist to give him 53 points,
matching a career high.

<HEADLINE> Weeks of harassment preceded shooting-suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. (AP) - The man who shot his ex-girlfriend and killed
himself on a Westchester college campus had been harassing her for weeks, police
say.
<P>
	   One day last month, he took a baseball bat to the windows of a car as she
cowered inside. And last week he stood outside her home, shouting, "If you don't
come out of this house, I'm going to break your windows," Westchester County
Police Commissioner Louis D'Aliso said Wednesday. Several panes were smashed.
</P>
<P>
	   That incident finally prompted the woman, 18-year-old Joy Thomas of Mount
Vernon, to obtain an arrest warrant and a temporary order of protection against
19-year-old Olonzo Davis. It accused him of criminal mischief and harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mount Vernon police could not find Davis at his last known address and
did not distribute the warrant beyond the city, so the warrant and protection
order were never served on him. In addition, Thomas never told Westchester
Community College, where she was enrolled, about Davis and her protection order.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Davis, who was not a student, confronted Thomas in a hallway at
the school, shot her with a .38-caliber derringer as she tried to get away, then
shot himself through the head as he ran off across the campus.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack echoed an apparent murder-suicide at Columbia University on
Saturday. Police there say a former student slashed his girlfriend's throat,
then jumped in front of a subway train.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was in fair condition Wednesday at the Westchester Medical Center
with a graze wound on her left temple, a damaged ear and a hairline skull
fracture. "She'll be fine," D'Aliso said.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives were upset that despite the complaints, nothing was done to keep
Davis away from Thomas.
</P>
<P>
	   Her stepfather, Kingsley Gyebi, said relatives had told police, "This guy is
going to do something to hurt her." If police "had put in a little effort, this
guy would be alive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mount Vernon Police Commissioner Gertrude LaForgia said, "We did make some
efforts to locate him. Unfortunately, we were unable to before this tragedy
occurred."
</P>
<P>
	   D'Aliso said Davis had lived a somewhat nomadic existence. He came to
Westchester two years ago from Detroit, where his mother still lives and where
his body will be sent. Davis was no longer living at the house in Mount Vernon
he had shared with some friends; he may have spent some time with friends in the
Bronx; and he may have lived out of his car for a while, D'Aliso said.
</P>
<P>
	   He hadn't shown up for several days at his Manhattan courier job.
</P>
<P>
	   At Wednesday's news conference at county police headquarters, D'Aliso
displayed Davis' unlicensed gun, a 4 1/2-inch double-barrel derringer. The gun,
though not an antique, was old, and one of the firing pins was not working, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The derringer therefore could fire only one bullet at a time, which might
have saved Thomas' life. As Davis ran from the building where he shot her, he
had to reload to kill himself, D'Aliso said. Three more bullets were found in
his pockets after he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Though no suicide note or other proof has been found, D'Aliso said there's
"a good chance" that Davis' mission was to kill both Thomas and himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Luckily, she ducked at the time he was firing that shot," D'Aliso said.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Stricken Get Welcome News  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Canadian researchers say they have made a key step toward developing what
could be the first drug to save the lives of those struck by an especially
dangerous strain of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
	   Infections from a strain called O157:H7 kill 250 people in the United States
each year, many of them children 5 and under. The bacteria produce a poison that
works its way into the bloodstream and damages the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada have created a new
"inhibitor": a five-limbed molecule armed with 10 grippers that are designed to
grab the toxins and escort them out of the body. Its designers call it
"Starfish."
</P>
<P>
	   In test-tube experiments, Starfish appears to be far more effective than the
other inhibitors undergoing testing.
</P>
<P>
	   If it works in humans, it would be a big step.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no vaccines or inhibitors for E. coli infections on the market,
and doctors say there is not much they can do to treat the related kidney
disorder besides giving patients dialysis and blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers say Starfish shows promise, but they are still testing its
effectiveness in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'd have to make sure this molecule would end up in the right place in
the body, and also that it does not cause any toxicity problems itself. We don't
think it will," said David Bundle, a chemistry professor at Alberta.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in today's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Starfish works because of its design. Each inhibitor molecule can latch onto
two toxin molecules, preventing them from binding to the body's cells. With its
multiple arms, Starfish binds to the toxins 1 million to 10 million times more
tightly than other inhibitors being tested, Bundle said.
</P>
<P>
	   E. coli became a major health concern in the 1980s and '90s after deadly
outbreaks, many of them blamed on undercooked hamburgers. About 70,000 Americans
are infected annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Adults get diarrhea and intestinal trouble, symptoms Starfish could not
stop. But Bundle's team thinks Starfish could prevent the kidney disorder,
called hemolytic uremic syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   Each year, about 5,000 people infected with E. coli O157:H7 contract HUS,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. Five percent of HUS sufferers die.
</P>
<P>
	   An inhibitor called Synsorb, which is in testing, might be able to mop up
the poisons in the intestine but cannot fight toxins that end up in the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Lang, a researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, said Starfish's design appears to be a good advance, but
more testing is needed to determine whether it works.

<HEADLINE> Study: Ovarian Cancer Surgery OK  </HEADLINE>
    By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Women in the first stage of ovarian cancer do not increase
their risk of dying by undergoing a surgery that allows them to continue having
children, researchers suggest in a new study.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, conducted by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, examined 127 patients who had surgery after epithelial
ovarian cancer was detected at stage one. That means it was present in one ovary
but not in the second ovary or the uterus.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-two patients underwent a standard surgery to remove the uterus and
all functioning ovarian tissue, while 16 others had a more limited surgery that
preserved the uterus and at least one ovary.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who had the more limited surgery, 88 percent lived with no signs
of cancer for a median of seven years after being diagnosed, compared with 77
percent of patients who had the standard surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-three percent of those who had the limited surgery had a successful
pregnancy after treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "By using conservative surgery that preserves functioning ovarian tissue and
the uterus, we found survival rates comparable to the standard surgery," said
Carol Brown, lead author of the study. "That is very reassuring."
</P>
<P>
	   Only 25 percent of women with ovarian cancer have it diagnosed in the
earliest stage, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, which has not been published, was presented Wednesday at the
annual meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurie Markman, director of the Taussig Cancer Center at the Cleveland
Clinic, cautioned that the women studied had been were treated by specialists
while most women are treated by general surgeons or gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
	   "This in no way should be considered to be standard," he said. "You still
have to tell patients the standard treatment, based upon lots of experience over
several decades, is to remove all of the organs potentially at risk."

<TEXT>
<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis scored 23 points as the Portland
Trail Blazers held onto the NBA's best record by beating the Los Angeles
Clippers 107-100 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith added 17 points for the Blazers, who won their 11th straight
home game and improved to 38-11 overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Taylor led the Clippers with 23 points and Troy Hudson added 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson scored 16 on 4-of-5 3-point shooting in the first quarter as the
Clippers took a 38-20 lead. The Blazers trailed by as many as 18 in the second
quarter and 10 at halftime before starting the third quarter with a 16-2 run.
</P>
<P>
	   A reverse layup by Brian Skinner pulled the Clippers within 93-92 with 3:26
to go. A 22-foot jumper by Taylor pulled the Clippers within 99-96, and a dunk
by Taylor cut it to 101-98 with 44 seconds left, but they couldn't get any
closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace had 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers, and Detlef
Schrempf added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers have lost five in a row and 15 of 16. They fell to 0-3 under
interim coach Jim Todd, who stepped in when Chris Ford was fired last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers turned it around in the third after trailing 55-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabonis had 15 points in the quarter, and his dunk tied it at 57. Wallace
gave the Blazers their first lead at 59-57 with a turnaround jumper with 7:03
left in the third. Los Angeles didn't quit, and a 3-pointer by Hudson at the
buzzer put the Clippers up 79-77.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers didn't have any turnovers in the third quarter after committing
nine in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers ran out to a quick lead, capitalizing on seven Blazers
turnovers in the first quarter. Hudson's third 3-pointer put Los Angeles up
29-16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers came back in the second quarter. Damon Stoudamire, who sat at
the end of the Blazers' bench sulking with his jersey off after coach Mike
Dunleavy put Greg Anthony in to guard Hudson, hit a deep jumper, and Schrempf
sank two free throws to cut it to a 10-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace hit a bank shot with just under a minute left to cut the lead to
50-45, but the Clippers pushed the lead back to 10 points as Lamar Odom hit a
wide-open 3-pointer and Eric Piatkowski hit a fast-break layup.

<HEADLINE> Women Medical Faculty Face Barriers  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE WEBSTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Women doctors are more likely than their male peers to teach at medical
schools but are far less likely to get promoted to senior faculty positions,
according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who graduated from American medical schools from 1979 to 1993 were 10
percent more likely than male graduates to pursue a career in academic medicine,
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
	   But through 1997, the women were 26 percent less likely than men to be
promoted from junior faculty positions to associate professor, and still fewer
advanced from associate to full professor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Women are still confronting barriers to their success,'' said Dr. JoAnn
Manson, a professor of endocrinology at Harvard Medical School who was not
involved in the study. ``The glass ceiling may have some cracks in it, but it
hasn't yet come crashing down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Women accounted for less than one-quarter of all medical school graduates in
1979. Their numbers had climbed to 38 percent in 1993, and continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 percent of female medical graduates entered academia over the
course of the study. The big surge came in the 1980s; Dr. Catherine De Angelis,
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, speculated that women
entered the demanding field of academic medicine because they felt they had
something to prove.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Nonnemaker, a sociologist with the Association of American Medical
Colleges and the study's author, said there are encouraging signs that women who
graduated in the 1990s may be closer to achieving parity than those who
graduated in the '80s. But it could take a long time; women still represent only
about 10 percent of medical school faculty members.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most significant barriers to academic advancement is the conflict
between work and family demands, De Angelis said in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Equal opportunity is not possible for women in academia because only women
can bear children and because women have the primary (and often nearly total)
responsibility for the care of children,'' De Angelis wrote. ``I would settle
for equity -- that is, freedom from bias or favoritism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, the time when women doctors have children collides with the time
when they must chase grants aggressively and complete significant research if
they want to advance their academic careers, Manson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manson herself graduated from medical school 20 years ago and has two
children, ages 12 and 10. When she had her first child, she was still on the
junior faculty.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to Harvard programs that provided mentoring, help with child-care,
salary support and flexibility in promotion schedules, she advanced to associate
and then full professor and now serves as chief of preventive medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, she said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- All of the roughly 150 passengers held hostage on
a hijacked Afghan airliner exited the plane early Thursday, ending the crisis
after nearly four days, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 85 men, women and children walked down the staircase of the plane
about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 EST). Two hours later, about 65 more hostages were seen
exiting the Ariana airlines plane, their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   After the first group was released, police had said negotiations were
continuing to win freedom for the dozens of other captives still aboard the
Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport north of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities planned to carry out a sweep of the Ariana airlines Boeing 727
to ensure no passengers remained on board.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the hijackers were among those seen exiting
the plane shortly before authorities announced an end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to start the process of identifying hostages and hostage takers,''
said Joe Edwards, an Essex County assistant chief constable. ``We need to ensure
the airplane itself is safe to enter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Edwards, Essex County police assistant chief constable, had said earlier
that the released hostages would be taken to a safe location and would undergo
medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the release, officials said 151 hostages, including 21 children, were
believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early Sunday on a domestic
flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then began a meandering journey,
stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the first surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby
and bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people
leaving the jetliner, the men with their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers had left the aircraft for a
meeting with negotiators on the tarmac, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the negotiations continued in person or via other
channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also left a box of unspecified ``equipment'' near the steps where the
first group of passengers exited, to assist with negotiations, police
spokeswoman Kim White said. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Police expressed hope on Wednesday that a resolution was close.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Wednesday, the hijackers had ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   His departure came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second
captain, first officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower
themselves from the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the negotiations, authorities insisted the armed men had made no
formal demands, political or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades, pistols and daggers,
had requested only that food, water and other comfort items be brought to the
plane, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted, however, that the plane was seized as part of an
elaborate bid for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   At the airliner's three stops before landing at Stansted, 25 miles north of
London, the hijackers released a total of 22 passengers. On Monday and Tuesday,
10 hostages were let go at Stansted.

<HEADLINE> Tax cuts, spending increases in Rowland's revised budget proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Faced with the shortest legislative session in
state history, the General Assembly will spend the next 12 weeks picking,
choosing - and undoubtedly discarding - the proposals of Gov. John G. Rowland.
<P>
	   During his budget address to the Legislature on Wednesday, Rowland called
for $237 million in new tax cuts and credits during the next two years, and $522
million in new spending this year.
</P>
<P>
	   He added to the mix a smattering of reform ideas: Abolish the office of high
sheriff, restructure campaign financing and retool the office state treasurer's
office.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rhetoric was perhaps better than some of the details," House Majority
Leader David Pudlin said after Rowland's 36-minute address. "This is the
beginning of the process. While this is not the budget that will pass, there
will be elements of this by the last week of the session."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said he wants to cut 7 cents off the gasoline tax. He also proposed
giving a maximum $500 tax credit for middle- and low-income families who send
their children to private primary and secondary schools, and offered new tax
breaks for college students and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this booming economy, wages are higher and taxes are lower," Rowland
said during his 36-minute address. "Still, with all the great success we've had
over the last five years, there is always the challenge to improve."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Legislature passed a balanced $23.7 billion biennial budget in
June that included a $11.6 billion spending plan for the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
Rowland said he wants to increase spending to about $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   State budget director Marc Ryan said the adjustments must be made because of
$162 million in cost overruns in the Department of Correction, Medicaid and the
state's ConnPACE prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased spending plan would burst a constitutional spending cap. But
the governor proposes using money from an estimated $241 million surplus in tax
revenues. About $60 million needed would come from money already in the state's
special transportation fund.
</P>
<P>
	   While Rowland insisted during his budget address he is abiding by the
spending cap, he signed a declaration Wednesday asking the Legislature to
override it.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are large surpluses and they are going to be spent to avoid debt
or for one-time expenditures, those are wise investments," said House Minority
leader Robert Ward, R-North Branford.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also wants to cut $111 million from next year's budget in order
to keep the state about $84 million under the cap during the 2000-2001 fiscal
year, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those cuts include dropping adults from the state's HUSKY health care plan -
a program that Ryan said is too costly and could save the state about $32
million. The program was originally designed to provide health care for
uninsured children, but was expanded to include their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edith Prague called the HUSKY cut unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a commitment we made," said Prague, D-Columbia. "To take it out of
the budget is a disaster. We can't leave people out there without any health
coverage."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said the state could save another $27 million by changing the way it
administers its prescription drugs assistance program. The changes would include
mandating that recipients use generic drugs when they are available.
</P>
<P>
	   Key Democrats immediately pounced on Rowland's plan to break the spending
cap this year, and promised to stall his gas tax proposal. They also predicted
his private school tax break would fail.
</P>
<P>
	   "We already have a balanced budget," said Senate Majority Leader George
Jepsen, D-Stamford. "There's no need to do anything with the budget."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland's gas tax cut, which he wants on the books by April 1, would cost
the state an estimated $99 million in revenue. Ryan said that money could be
covered by with funds from the special transportation fund and the Department of
Motor Vehicles sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we are going to support that, it should be predicated on the fact that
the price of gas will come down if we pass the tax," said Sen. Martin Looney,
D-New Haven, co-chariman of the tax-writing Finance Committee. "There is no real
guarantee."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also revived the school choice debate. His plan for a private
education credit would be based on a sliding scale and limited to families that
meet certain income limits. He also wants to give college students state tax
cuts based on their eligibility for federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The college tax cut plan drew praise from many Democrats. But they
criticized the private education credit, arguing it would take money away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   While Jepsen and Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West
Hartford, said they do not want to reopen the budget, many key Democrats have
said they agree with Rowland's plan to spend the state's $241 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said he wants the surplus to pay for school construction, bail out
the financially struggling University of Connecticut Health Center and upgrade
the government's computer system.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland also said $33.4 million should be funneled into the state's
emergency Rainy Day Fund, and $17.5 million should be used for a hospital tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland proposed sinking $90 million into school construction, $30 million
into improved Internet access in schools, and $7.5 million into updating the
state's computer systems. He also wants to use $3.5 million to move the
Department of Information and Technology into new offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats support many of the ideas, but criticized the governor for not
including funding for open space purchases, housing programs and transportation
improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   His reform proposals received a mix reaction. Democrats have also called for
transferring the duties of the sheriffs system to state agencies, and that is
expected to pass. But reforming the treasurer's office is expected to be a
controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Since ex-Treasurer Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to racketeering and money
laundering charges in connection with his handling of state pension investments,
Rowland and leading Republicans have called for a Board of Trustees to oversee
state investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading Democrats have said they want that job to remain in the hands of the
treasurer.

<HEADLINE> NRC allows more discussion of spent-fuel pool expansion at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Another hearing will be held into Northeast
Utilities' plan to expand the capacity of its spent fuel storage pool at the
Millstone Three nuclear power plant.
<P>
	   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Wednesday ordered a full hearing to
examine criticism of the plan leveled by two anti-nuclear groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The board will explore whether the fuel storage plan poses an unnecessary
risk to workers and the public and if it increases the chance of a nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing will not be held until May at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's decision brings Millstone one stop closer to permanent closure,"
said Nancy Burton, the lawyer for the Connecticut and Long Island Coalition
Against Millstone groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast Utilities, the chief owner and operator of the Waterford plant,
said the fuel storage plan is safe and proven to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "The same system is already in use at many other utilities. It has a proven
track record. We've proven it's safe," said Millstone spokeswoman Sandra
Bazinet.
</P>
<P>
	   But Burton said the hearing will expose problems with the storage plan that
will end up shutting down the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant will have to shut down if it runs out of space to store its fuel,
and the storage problem will make the plant unattractive to potential buyers,
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bazinet denied the plan will impact the sale of the plant, and said it will
be able to run for years before a new fuel plan is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   NU needs to increase storage space because the federal government has not
yet approved a permanent site to store spent fuel from Millstone and other
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The company maintains the spent fuel pool is designed to hold much more fuel
than its license allows, so it is asking to increase the number of fuel rods
placed in the pool.
</P>
<P>
	   The system looks like a 40-foot-deep, L-shaped swimming pool. The fuel rods
are stored in bundles called assemblies, which are held on racks submerged at
the bottom of the pool.
</P>
<P>
	   Water laced with boron is circulated around the pool to keep the fuel cool
and prevent a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the Millstone 3 pool has about 450 assemblies. The plant is
licensed to store up to 756 assemblies, and NU wants to store up to 1,800.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-nuclear groups say it would be safer to store the fuel in secure
concrete vaults, since the water storage system could fail if pumps broke or
water leaks out.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fatal police shooting justified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - No charges will be filed against a North
Branford police officer who claims he shot and killed a motorist because he
thought she was going to run him over.
<P>
	   A report Wednesday that followed a seven-month investigation into the
shooting found that Officer Michael Breen was justified in using deadly force
against Victoria Cooper of West Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen, through no fault of his own, was confronted with a motor
vehicle weighing over 3,000 pounds bearing down on him, and the operator did not
heed his efforts to stop or slow down," said the report, signed by New Haven
State's Attorney Michael Dearington.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper's family maintains the July 13 shooting was not justified and that
Breen could have stepped aside to avoid the car. They have filed a civil rights
lawsuit against Breen in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no reason that this shooting by this police officer was justified
or necessary," said David Rosen, an attorney for the family. "There is no reason
for this young woman to be dead."
</P>
<P>
	   The report states Cooper's intent cannot be determined, but that cocaine in
her system may have affected her behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   North Branford Police Chief Matthew Canelli said he had expected the
investigation to find the shooting was justified. Breen was put been back on
regular patrol months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Officer Breen had no intentions when he went out that evening that he was
going to take a life, but what happened happened. Ms. Cooper had to be
responsible for her actions also that evening," Canelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation found that Cooper, 41, and her friend, Steven Guerette,
42, had smoked crack cocaine about an hour before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   They had driven in Guerette's brother's Camaro to a convenience store on
Route 80 at about 1 a.m. and Guerette was using the pay telephone when Breen
spotted them.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen stated he passed by the car three times and noticed its occupants were
watching him. He called in the license plate and found it was registered to
Guerette's brother, whose license had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The car then drove down Route 80 and Breen followed. The car crossed the
center line three times, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen pulled Guerette over and asked him to step out of the car. A search
found Guerette was carrying two bags containing a substance that resembled
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette then fled into the woods. Breen chased him, but lost him and
returned to his cruiser.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as he returned he saw the Camaro move toward him with its
headlights on. Breen said he yelled and waved his arms several times, but the
car did not stop, so he fired two shots.
</P>
<P>
	   A state police reconstruction of the shooting found Breen was in front of
and slightly to the right of the car, near the middle of the road, when he fired
the first shot. The bullet hit the car's hood and ricocheted.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen said he moved to avoid being hit as he fired a second shot. The bullet
went through the driver's side window at a 65-degree angle and hit Cooper in the
left side, exiting through her chest.
</P>
<P>
	   Residue from the cartridge was found on the driver's side door, indicating
the car was very close to Breen.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the car, police found more cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The report stated Guerette had a history of fleeing police to prevent the
seizure of narcotics - a history that may have influenced Cooper's decision to
drive the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette had fled from Madison police in 1986, injuring a police officer,
and in 1990 told a female driver to flee after police asked him to step out of
the car.
</P>
<P>
	   A week before the shooting, Guerette was involved in a police chase in which
Cooper was a passenger. He crashed the car and fled into the woods, where he was
captured.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerette is serving a one-year prison sentence for interfering with an
officer and drug possession.

<HEADLINE> Defibrillators Prevent Sudden Death  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Implanted defibrillators that jolt the heart back to normal rhythm can be
lifesavers for people with a certain inherited heart condition, according to a
study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, involves heart muscle
enlargement and an overly vigorous heartbeat. It affects an estimated 500,000
Americans, and about 10 percent of them are considered at high risk of sudden
death.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug amiodarone can reduce the number of potentially fatal episodes of
heart irregularities, but it is not recommended in younger patients because it
can have serious long-term side effects that include vision deterioration.
</P>
<P>
	   The study looked at 128 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and followed
them for an average of three years after they received defibrillators, small
devices that are typically implanted under the skin of the chest or the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
	   The study group included 43 patients who had suffered cardiac arrest or at
least one serious episode of a wildly speeded-up heartbeat before getting the
implants. The defibrillators corrected potentially deadly heart irregularities
in 11 percent of these patients per year.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also looked at 85 mostly younger patients who had never suffered
cardiac arrest or a serious heart irregularity, but who were considered at high
risk of sudden death because of their family histories or the results of heart
tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Five percent of these patients suffered potentially fatal heart episodes
each year, and they were corrected by the implants.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two patients in the study died. Both were at an advanced stage of
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was led by Dr. Barry Maron of the Minneapolis Heart Institute
Foundation and funded in part by a grant from Medtronic, which makes implantable
defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
	   More than one-third of the patients who had a serious heart episode during
the study were also taking amiodarone, suggesting the drug was not nearly as
effective at preventing sudden death as the implants, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Hugh Watkins of Oxford University said in an accompanying editorial that
the research appears to be "very good news."
</P>
<P>
	   "If longer-term studies bear this out, there is little doubt that the costs
and risks of defibrillators will be outweighed by the lives saved," Watkins
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Minority College Enrollment Is Up  </HEADLINE>
   By ARLENE LEVINSON AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   College enrollment for black and Hispanic high school graduates climbed
steadily during the 1990s, according to a new report that also includes
disquieting news about both groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate of blacks finishing high school fell in the late 1990s, and
Hispanics lagged far behind whites and blacks in getting their high school
diplomas, according to the report released today by the American Council on
Education in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The study analyzed Census and Education Department figures for 1996-97, the
latest available. The GE Fund, the charitable arm of General Electric Co., paid
for the research.
</P>
<P>
	   College attendance at any time among all high school graduates ages 18 to 24
reached a record high of 45 percent in 1997. Among whites, the figure was 45
percent, up from 41 percent in 1991; blacks, a record 40 percent, up from 32
percent in 1991; Hispanics, 36 percent, vs. 33 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrollment for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and American Indians rose
4 percent between 1996 and 1997, the study found. Between 1994 and 1995, their
numbers climbed by just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of minorities who went to college represents such a small part of
the total that it had negligible effect on the overall figure of 45 percent,
said Terry Hartle, the council's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was too soon to gauge the full effect of dropping affirmative
action in college admissions in the two most populous states, California and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The University of California system did away with affirmative action
beginning with the undergraduate class that entered in 1998. After a federal
court ruling, Texas ended racial preferences at state schools beginning with
students applying to enter in the fall of 1997. Washington state voters banned
race and gender criteria in admissions starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the high school graduation figures, the dropout rate represents ``a
very serious problem for African-Americans, for Latinos a catastrophe,'' said
Gary Orfield, professor of education and social policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 83 percent of whites ages 18 to 24 had high school diplomas in 1997,
compared with about 75 percent of blacks. In 1990, the rate among blacks was 77
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Whites holding high school diplomas were 8 percentage points ahead of blacks
in 1997, the widest gap since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The gulf between whites and Hispanics was far greater: Only 62 percent of
Hispanics ages 18 to 24 had completed high school in 1997. That was some
improvement, up from about 58 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Orfield blamed high-stakes testing -- ``They don't pass the test. They get
discouraged. They drop out.'' -- the push to end social promotion and poverty
afflicting both schools and students. Among Hispanics the problem is also a lack
of English among immigrants, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gwendolyn Cooke at the National Association of Secondary School Principals
blamed teachers with low expectations and inadequate training.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Teachers that lack the skills to be responsive, push kids away,'' Cooke
said. Zero-tolerance policies that eject misbehaving students also take a toll,
with blacks receiving the harshest punishment, she said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio weighing Conservative Party invitation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio said he is seriously considering the
New York Conservative Party's invitation to enter the U.S. Senate race, and drew
parallels between what would be his own underdog effort and come-from-behind GOP
presidential hopeful John McCain.
<P>
	   But Lazio said he would only get into the race if he ran on the Republican
line as well. The Long Island Republican added he has still not ruled out
challenging New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would only be a candidate for the Conservative nomination if I was also
the candidate for the Republican nomination at the same time," Lazio said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to decide whether I want to be Don Quixote or John McCain," he said,
referring to the knight errant made famous in Miguel de Cervantes' novel of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brooklyn GOP Chairman Arthur Bramwell said late Wednesday that Lazio had
told him about three weeks ago that he would endorse Giuliani at the group's
March 9 dinner. The Lazio camp responded that the congressman had not even
committed to attend the dinner, let alone endorse Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio had $3 million in the bank and was prepared to seek the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate late last year when Gov. George Pataki, who had
been advising him, urged him to step aside in favor of the better known
Giuliani. Pataki and Giuliani had frosty relations since Giuliani's 1994
endorsement of Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki yielded to calls from prominent Republicans, like Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, to unite behind Giuliani in order to beat the Democratic candidate for
Senate, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio said Wednesday he had spoken with Pataki that morning, but declined to
say what they had discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon would say only, "Rudy Giuliani is the
governor's candidate." One Pataki administration source said Lazio and Pataki
discussed Bush's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani irked Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long when in a series of
appearances on Sunday morning television talk shows he said he was prepared to
run without Conservative Party support. The mayor also reiterated his pro-choice
stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Long has said the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party backing
would be to come out in favor of a ban on what critics call partial-birth
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's endorsement. Pataki beat Cuomo on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio favors abortion rights but is opposed to certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio said he has been studying the election results in New Hampshire, where
McCain, the Republican underdog, defeated the better-financed Bush. And he said
he has also been looking at polls that show nearly 60 percent of New Yorkers
wish someone besides Giuliani were running in the New York race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he (Lazio) did run, I think he wins," Long said referring to Giuliani
and Clinton's high negative ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio also said he was not entirely convinced Giuliani was in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has hinted he will not formally announce he is entering the race,
but has strongly indicated that he is. The mayor has most of the state
Republican Party supporting him, including state GOP Party Chairman William
Powers, and has raised $11.5 million for the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like he's going to run but until he says 'I am a candidate for the
U.S. Senate' it's still a question," Lazio said. "He's a very mercurial man," he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp had no comment Wednesday on Lazio's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Griffey to Reds Trade Tentative  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. could be with the Cincinnati Reds by this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle and Cincinnati agreed Wednesday night to a tentative trade sending
the 10-time All-Star to the Reds, a top baseball official told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati has 72 hours to work out a contract extension with Griffey that
would make the trade final.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is there has been a window requested and it has been
granted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office. ``The 72-hour clock is running.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alderson would not say what players were involved in the proposed trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Under baseball's rules, teams must first agree on the players involved in a
trade, then ask the commissioner's office for the 72-hour window. During that
time, the acquiring team can attempt to work out a new contract or an extension
with the player.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, said earlier this week that his client
would take less-than-market value to play for Cincinnati, where he grew up.
Griffey, who is eligible for free agency after the season, rejected a $148
million, eight-year extension offered by the Mariners last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ESPN reported earlier Wednesday that the Mariners and Reds were working on a
three-way deal involving the Anaheim Angels and outfielder Jim Edmonds, but it
wasn't clear if the deal presented to baseball Wednesday night included two
teams or three.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey, 30, had 398 career home runs in 11 seasons, along with a .299
average and 1,152 RBIs. Hank Aaron, baseball's career home-run leader with 755,
thinks Griffey has the best chance to top his record.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey, who will earn $8.25 million this season, the final year of an $34
million, four-year contract, told the Mariners in November that he wanted to be
traded to a team closer to his home in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariners general manager Pat Gillick held talks with the New York Mets the
following month, but Griffey then said he would accept a trade only to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   Reds general manager Jim Bowden cut off negotiations at the winter meetings,
saying the Mariners' demands were too steep but talks resumed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg said Tuesday the Mariners had given him permission to talk directly
with the Reds in an effort to break the impasse. Since there was no deal in
place then and no 72-hour window, that appeared to violate baseball's rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enough occurred for us to look into it,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alderson said whether any penalties would be issued is something ``that
still has to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say this wouldn't take us very long,'' he added. ``Sometime next
week at the latest.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Struggles With Cocaine  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YALLAHS, Jamaica (AP) -- Gordon, a villager whose family has been fishing
the waters off Jamaica's southeastern coast for generations, needed a little
extra cash. So one day last year, another fisherman introduced him to a local
cocaine smuggler.
</P>
<P>
	   Gordon became a bit player in a growth industry. In his 18-foot-long boat,
he makes regular pickups at prearranged spots a few miles offshore. Occasionally
he's called at the last minute to pluck floating packets from the sea when they
are jettisoned by traffickers spotted by U.S. and Jamaican coast guard patrols.
</P>
<P>
	   It is dangerous work -- but very tempting in a land where times are hard and
hopes are scant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fishing can't send my kids to school. Fishing can't buy a new motor for my
boat,'' said Gordon, who only gave his first name.
</P>
<P>
	   Smuggling cocaine more than doubled his income, Gordon said, sipping rum at
a seaside bar and ruminating upon the $15,000, 45-horsepower Yamaha engine that
now graces his boat.
</P>
<P>
	   Gordon, 38, refused to give his last name for fear of the law, but he spoke
openly about his activities. While locals refused to discuss Gordon
specifically, they confirmed that cocaine smuggling by fishermen is widespread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hear it happens all up and down the coast,'' said Reddy Gilson, 32.
``This kind of thing is hard to keep secret. One man shows up with money, new
shoes, new clothes, more money than he had before, and everyone knows where he
got it from.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Tom, 24, who steams fish on the roadside, said: ``We all know what's
going on. You can't call the police and tell them what you know. If they see you
talking to a police officer they'll come and ... kill you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jean-Luc Lemahieu, manager of the Barbados-based U.N. program to fight drugs
in the Caribbean, said the phenomenon is rather new in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Up to two or three years ago, the impression was that Jamaica's major
problem was marijuana,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian traffickers began routing more shipments through Jamaica -- as
well as Haiti -- as U.S. authorities clamped down on smuggling through their
Caribbean territory of Puerto Rico and as enforcement improved in the Dominican
Republic, Lemahieu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Located about halfway between Colombia and Florida and offering a
well-established network of gangs as allies, Jamaica is an attractive alternate
transit point.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where we used to see maybe one boatload of cocaine a week, we're now
seeing three to four boatloads of cocaine, each weighing'' 800 to 1,800 pounds,
said Beres Spence, head of Jamaica's police narcotics division. ``Traffickers
can access every inch of our shoreline, but it would be impossible for us to
cover every inch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spence and foreign analysts estimate that, at most, a fifth of the cocaine
passing through Jamaica is intercepted. A record 5,500 pounds was seized last
year, more than double the amount of the year before. While the increase might
reflect better detection, it also suggests a rise in trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the cocaine is shipped on slim vessels outfitted with powerful
engines that can travel from the northern coast of Colombia to Jamaica in about
a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a small amount of the cocaine is consumed by the local market, where a
kilogram fetches $6,000. Most is smuggled to the United States, where the same
amount sells for $20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Most smugglers stockpile large shipments here with the help of people like
Gordon, then send smaller deliveries north on airline flights, cruise ships, or
smaller boats.
</P>
<P>
	   With unemployment running officially at 15 percent -- and in reality much
higher -- finding ``mules'' to carry the drugs is easy. Over a thousand
Jamaicans -- out of a population of 2.6 million -- were arrested for possession
of cocaine during the last two years, and most were also charged with attempting
to export the drug, police say.
</P>
<P>
	   The extent of Jamaica's role is summed up by one statistic: according to
U.S. Customs, 64 percent of those arrested for cocaine smuggling at U.S.
airports between October 1998 and September 1999 were coming from Jamaica,
though not all were Jamaican.
</P>
<P>
	   Spence said the Air Jamaica hub in Montego Bay, with flights going to major
cities in Europe and North American, was a ``hub for drug smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials cite the 1998 ``shiprider agreement'' allowing U.S. ships
and airplanes to chase smugglers into Jamaican waters and airspace as a sign
that officials here are serious. But corruption hampers the efforts, says the
U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Corruption, especially among members of the security and law enforcement
forces,'' remains a serious problem, said the department's most recent report on
Jamaica, published in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Kingston's gangs were created in the 1970s to fight turf wars on
behalf of political parties. The drug business has helped make them independent,
but they retain a loose affiliation with politicians that, Lemahieu suggested,
might hamper interdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Jamaican politicians created a Frankenstein and they have not
controlled it,'' Lemahieu said. ``They are trying to get rid of the ties. How
far they will succeed only the future will tell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet while smuggling activities are up, cocaine use has not flourished among
Jamaicans -- partly because the popular, marijuana-consuming Rastafarians
despise the drug. ``It's never been accepted the way marijuana has,'' said
Winston Mendes-Davidson, head of Jamaica's Medical Association.

<HEADLINE> All Hostages Leave Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- All of the roughly 150 passengers held hostage on
a hijacked Afghan airliner exited the plane early Thursday, ending the crisis
after nearly four days, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 85 men, women and children walked down the staircase of the plane
about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 EST). Two hours later, about 65 more hostages were seen
exiting the Ariana airlines plane, their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities planned to carry out a sweep of the Ariana airlines Boeing 727,
parked at Stansted airport north of London, to ensure no passengers remained on
board.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the hijackers were among those seen exiting
the plane shortly before authorities announced an end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to start the process of identifying hostages and hostage takers,''
said Joe Edwards, an Essex County assistant chief constable. ``We need to ensure
the airplane itself is safe to enter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said the released hostages would be taken to a safe location and
would undergo medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the releases early Thursday, officials said 151 hostages, including
21 children, were believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early
Sunday on a domestic flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then took a
meandering journey, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing
in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the first surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby
and bright lights shined up the staircase toward a steady stream of people
leaving the jetliner, the men with their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers had left the aircraft for a
meeting with negotiators on the tarmac, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the negotiations continued in person or via other
channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also left a box of unspecified ``equipment'' near the steps where the
first group of passengers exited, to assist with negotiations, police
spokeswoman Kim White said. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Wednesday, the hijackers had ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   His departure came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second
captain, first officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower
themselves from the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the negotiations, authorities insisted the armed men had made no
formal demands, political or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades, pistols and daggers,
had requested only that food, water and other comfort items be brought to the
plane, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted, however, that the plane was seized as part of an
elaborate bid for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   At the airliner's three stops before landing at Stansted, 25 miles north of
London, the hijackers released a total of 22 passengers. On Monday and Tuesday,
10 hostages were let go at Stansted.

<HEADLINE> Elian Said Surrounded by Drunks  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official said 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez is
surrounded by ``drunks'' after it was revealed that two of the boy's great
uncles have been convicted of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Fidel Castro's key man
for U.S.-Cuba relations, said Wednesday the convictions prove the uncles' Miami
home is no place for Elian -- the boy at the center of an international custody
battle pitting Castro's government against Cuban exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the
future, joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of
the child,'' Alarcon told reporters in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Elian was ``surrounded by two drunks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed the
criticism. ``Elian is surrounded by love. Alarcon does not know the word love,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was clinging to an inner tube when he was rescued off the coast of
Florida on Nov. 25 after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives and other Cuban exiles in Miami want to keep him in the
United States, saying his mother died to give him freedom. But Cuba's government
is staging a massive campaign to have the boy returned to his father in Cuba,
plastering the walls of major cities with ``Save Elian'' posters and holding
daily rallies with rousing speeches, choir performances and poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, with whom Elian has been
living in Miami, was found guilty of driving under the influence at least twice
from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Records show his 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, also has been found
guilty at least twice of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions may make it more difficult for Elian's relatives in Miami to
argue that they can offer Elian a better life than his father in Cuba, experts
on child custody law said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Gilbert Kliman, Medical Director of the Children's Psychological
Trauma Center in San Francisco, said the drunk driving cases will probably not
be the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The history of the attachments and the qualities of the attachments
between the child and the various parties may far outweigh the importance of the
DUIs,'' Kliman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Cuba's Roman Catholic leader said some Cubans are using
Elian's situation to attack the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinal Jaime Ortega, the archbishop of Havana and the only cardinal on the
communist island, said passions surrounding the case have spun out of control.
He said they may be unleashing ``prejudices and dark feelings'' against the
church.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Elian's Cuban grandmothers went to the United States in an
effort to bring Elian back. While they were there, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the
president of Barry University, hosted a meeting between Elian and his
grandmothers in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, O'Laughlin said she was giving up her previously
announced neutrality and felt the boy should remain in the United States. Since
then, she has been criticized by Cuba's media.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released Wednesday, Ortega expressed concern about the
derogatory references to O'Laughlin that appear daily in the local press, saying
she may be misguided but is not the ``devil'' portrayed in Cuban media.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin has been maligned, Ortega insisted, though he said she is wrong
to think Elian should stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the church and the Cuban state have warmed in recent
years. Castro's government abandoned officially mandated atheism in the early
1990s and received Pope John Paul II in a historic visit in 1998.

	   Meanwhile, Cuban rallies continued Wednesday. Castro and Elian's father and
grandparents joined hundreds of people -- most of them children -- at the
imposing Fortress of San Carlos de Cabana to demonstrate in favor of the boy's
repatriation. With the towering stone walls as a backdrop, costumed members of a
children's drama group sang songs, read poems and performed skits dedicated to
Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his
return to Cuba, but Elian's U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in a
Miami court.

<HEADLINE> Health Problems Found by Hog Farms  </HEADLINE>
    By SCOTT MOONEYHAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- People living near hog farms report more
headaches, diarrhea and minor respiratory problems, according to a study by
researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey also found that people who lived within two miles of an
industrial-style hog farm reported a reduced quality of life. Fewer residents
enjoyed outdoor activities when compared to those who did not live near hog
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that the survey provides enough evidence that we should consider
the problem serious," said Steven Wing, the UNC-Chapel Hill professor of
epidemiology who led the study released Wednesday. "This tells us we need to
look at this further."
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary results of the study, funded by the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences and the North Carolina Department of Health and
Human Services, were first reported last year. Final results will appear in
March in the scientific journal "Environmental Health Perspectives."
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers interviewed 155 people in three counties. One group lived
within two miles of a 6,000-head hog operation; another lived near two adjacent
cattle farms; and the third group, a control, lived in a farming area without
large livestock operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents were asked how many times they experienced a range of health
problems, and about quality of life issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers found the greatest differences in quality of life, but also
found a higher incidence of some health problems reported by those who lived
near the hog farm.
</P>
<P>
	   Hog industry officials said the study is pseudo-science.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just junk science. I do know that you can skew these so-called studies
to get the results you want," said Walter Cherry, director of the N.C. Pork
Council. "From a tax standpoint, that money was wasted if your trying to prove
something. Now if your trying to pursue an agenda, maybe it wasn't wasted."
</P>
<P>
	   Cherry said the survey questions, coupled with the fact that the hog farm in
the study had been the target of organized protests from residents, made it
clear the kind of responses that researchers wanted. A valid study would have
relied on medical examinations for hard evidence to back up the conclusions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wing said some of the respondents may have known the survey concerned the
effects of hog farms, but said no mention was made of hogs, livestock or odors.
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed that some people may have reported more symptoms because of their
negative feelings about hog farms.
</P>
<P>
	   But researchers found no difference between some types of health symptoms --
such as sore muscles and joints, blurred vision, or hearing problems -- among
those who lived near hog farms and among those who did not.
</P>
<P>
	   That finding, Wing said, suggests the greater incidence of health problems
reported by people who lived near hog farms -- sore throats, coughing, burning
eyes, headache and diarrhea -- were not imagined.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers did not have enough money to do physical exams and trace
long-term health effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study has a number of limitations which we discuss pretty openly,"
Wing said. "We need more research. But I am aware of people who live around
these operations who feel there is enough evidence here already."

<HEADLINE> Politics Around Marriage Penalty Tax  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Staking election-year strategy on a parade of tax cuts,
Republicans are using the first major House vote of the year to push a 10-year,
$182 billion income tax cut for millions of married couples.
</P>
<P>
	   Replaying last year's tax fight, President Clinton is threatening a veto but
some Democrats worry that the measure will have political appeal in competitive
districts as they attempt to retake control of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These Americans do not just reside in Republican districts,'' said Rep.
John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation today is among the more popular parts of the $792 billion
tax cut vetoed by Clinton last year. Republicans are carving up that bill into a
series of measures intended to force Democrats into a series of politically
difficult House votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ``really believe that they can con the American people to
believe that we are rejecting things, instead of being positive in working with
them, in getting something done,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill would cut taxes for all married couples who file joint income
tax returns, not just the estimated 25 million two-earner couples who pay a
``marriage penalty'' compared with what they would owe if single. Roughly half
the bill's total cost would go to increase the ``marriage bonus'' enjoyed by
millions of other couples, mainly those in which one spouse earns much more than
the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 50 million married couples filed joint tax returns in 1997, according
to the most recent complete Internal Revenue Service statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are going to provide tax relief for married couples, why pick and
choose which couples will benefit?'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. ``All
married couples should benefit, not just those with dual incomes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton argues that the GOP bill is too costly -- it is four times as
expensive as the president's version -- and is skewed toward people with higher
incomes. Clinton also says the bill would consume a chunk of the projected
budget surplus before plans are laid to ensure the future solvency of Social
Security and Medicare, payment of national debt and to pay for key spending
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to walk down the blind alley of individual tax cuts until
we know what the overall plan is,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Democrats, hoping to limit their House defections to two dozen or so,
will offer an alternative that would take about $89 billion of the projected
surplus over 10 years, or twice the size of Clinton's proposal. The Democratic
proposal, aimed more at lower- and middle-income people, would not help married
couples who itemize their deductions and contains a trigger requiring a
``framework'' to be in place for fixing Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everbody's for a tax cut,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo. ``It's a question of who gets them, how they're targeted and how much they
take of the total budget.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, however, labeled the Democratic alternative ``phantom tax
relief'' because it depends on enactment of future legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democrat plan is a sham, a fig leaf, and nothing more than an attempt
to confuse married couples and to try to pull the wool over the eyes of voters
who deserve tax relief,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   While House passage of the GOP bill seems assured, its future is less clear
in the Senate. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the House measure is
``a good bill'' but it may have to be combined with other tax legislation to
avoid Democratic delaying tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will certainly try to find a way to consider it,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democrats also support marriage penalty tax relief but not at such a
high cost, said Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. He said the House bill's
price tag would pay for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you spend that kind of money, we want to spend it on more than just
addressing the marriage penalty,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Neighbors at Odds in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- They're next-door neighbors, but the
British Protestants of bustling Lisburn and the Irish Catholics of grim
Poleglass remain worlds apart as their country's power-sharing government fades
to black.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's 2-month-old administration of Protestants and Catholics,
the intended centerpiece of the 1998 Good Friday accord, is likely to be
stripped of its powers Friday. Britain hopes this will forestall its total
collapse in the face of Protestant demands for a start to Irish Republican Army
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our leaders gave too much and got nothing back. Now we've got an IRA
terrorist in our government. Who'd be sad to see the back of that arrangement?''
said Johnston Kirkpatrick, a 40-year-old Protestant taxi driver from Lisburn.
</P>
<P>
	   In Poleglass, Eamonn Ward, a 34-year-old Catholic construction worker,
blamed the Protestant unionists. ``The British government's given in to threats
from the unionists. They say it's because the IRA won't disarm, but the
unionists just won't treat us as equals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether talking to key protagonists like David Trimble of the Ulster
Unionist Party and Gerry Adams of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein -- or to their
grassroots equivalents in Kirkpatrick and Ward -- it's clear now that the two
sides never agreed on the terms of their union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There wasn't any honeymoon like there needed to be. Trimble started
hen-pecking Adams at the altar,'' said Ward, who had hoped the four-party
coalition would work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole thing was a shotgun wedding. It only happened because Trimble
took some big risks. But they haven't paid off,'' said Kirkpatrick. ``Thank God
us Prods (Protestants) believe in divorce.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ward's dashed hopes and Kirkpatrick's palpable relief reflect the widely
different experiences of their communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirkpatrick's Lisburn is the well-scrubbed model of an Ulster ``garrison
town.'' The British army has its Northern Ireland headquarters here; many of its
Protestant families have members in the locally recruited regiment or the
province's well-paid police force.
</P>
<P>
	   But beneath a comfortably middle-class veneer lies paramilitary menace. An
outlawed paramilitary group called the Ulster Defense Association controls many
Lisburn businesses. The UDA's decision in 1994 to stop slaying Catholics at
random hasn't slowed its pursuit of criminal rackets.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighboring Poleglass is the last in a chain of Catholic districts that
stretch from inner west Belfast to Lisburn's outskirts. As such Poleglass forms
the vanguard, as many Protestants see it, of a growing and unwelcome community.
</P>
<P>
	   Within its warren of gray stucco welfare row houses reside some of Northern
Ireland's poorest residents. The only color comes from militant wall murals
honoring dead Irish Republican Army figures.
</P>
<P>
	   No policemen have lived in Poleglass for three lawless decades. The IRA, by
contrast, imposes nighttime order, confronting local hoodlums and glue-sniffers
with the threat of broken limbs or banishment, a form of violence not covered by
its 1997 cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you're reared in Poleglass, you survive by hoping for something
better and pushing hard to get it,'' said Ward, who voted ``yes'' in 1998 in the
referendum that ratified the Good Friday accord. Catholics almost universally
backed the pact.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward voted again that year to put his local Sinn Fein activist into the new
Northern Ireland legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirkpatrick, like many alienated Protestants, didn't bother to vote in
either election. Those Protestants who did were split almost 50-50 between
politicians for and against Trimble.
</P>
<P>
	   As the British government quickly paroled imprisoned IRA and UDA members in
support of the Good Friday deal, both groups balked on cooperating with a
disarmament commission. The Ulster Unionists in turn refused to form the Cabinet
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Under international pressure, Trimble last November finally agreed to accept
Sinn Fein as government colleagues on condition that IRA disarmament would soon
commence and conclude by the Good Friday accord's May deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   To a chorus of Protestant protests Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness -- the
IRA's one-time senior commander -- became minister of education. No disarmament
followed.
</P>
<P>
	   For Kirkpatrick, a former soldier who lost friends to IRA bombs, disarmament
isn't optional. It's the only way he'll ever trust his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's IRA men in Poleglass who were targeting me six, seven years ago
and they're still there. They should all be doing life along with the UDA.
Instead all the terrorists are out of prison. They're stronger than ever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward insists Protestants demand disarmament only as a device for keeping
Sinn Fein out of office. He agrees with Kirkpatrick that the IRA will never
disarm. He, too, cites a lack of trust.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only guns I ever see in Poleglass are carried by unionists in
uniform,'' he said. ``The IRA aren't using their guns. That ought to be good
enough for everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Drops Out, Millions Lighter  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the $66 million he spent pursuing the White House,
Steve Forbes could have bought 307 new Rolls Royce Silver Seraph sedans, fielded
a professional football team for a season or sent thousands to college for free.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the conservative publisher leaves the Republican presidential race
today in the company of a select few who squandered millions of their personal
fortunes on back-to-back political campaigns that ended in defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Reform Party founder Ross Perot and Californian Michael Huffington
before him, Forbes helped set the standard for sparing no expense on a political
dream.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent an average of $160 per vote to finish second in an Iowa straw poll
last August, although no delegates were at stake and anyone could vote for the
price of a ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent more than $3 million a month in the last three months of 1999 in
advance of the Iowa caucuses, where he finished a strong second, and the New
Hampshire primary, where he came in a poor third.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never has so much been spent with so little in return,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group that studies money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will go down in the annals of presidential politics as a spectacular
example of the dictum that just throwing money at an election doesn't win you an
office. It's a lesson that seems to be an expensive one for millionaires,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes decided to quit after finishing third Tuesday in Delaware's primary,
behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain. Forbes won the primary in
1996. He scrapped plans to campaign in Michigan and returned to his New Jersey
home to prepare for today's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no regrets except not winning,'' Forbes told NBC News in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He had spent $28.7 million of his own money on the 2000 campaign through
Dec. 31; January numbers are due later this month. He spent $37.4 million on the
1996 run.
</P>
<P>
	   The total, $66.1 million, was more than the salary cap for National Football
League teams, and twice as much as Michael Jordan was paid in his last year with
the Chicago Bulls basketball team. It is almost one-third of the gross national
product of Micronesia, which is $205 million; and would buy a Forbes magazine
subscription for each of 1.7 million voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' unceasing willingness to dip into his own pocket has influenced
campaign spending in the last two elections. In 1996, he forced the eventual
Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, up against federal spending limits
long before the GOP convention. As a result, Dole had to restrain his spending
for months while President Clinton and the Democrats spent millions of dollars
against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Vowing not to be caught in the same situation, Bush declined federal funds
for his campaign, thus freeing him from federal spending limits. He has
collected a record $70 million for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' departure triggered a scramble among the remaining contenders for
his anti-abortion, anti-tax supporters on the conservative right, and also set
the stage for a two-way race between Bush and McCain. Forbes had no immediate
plans to endorse either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he didn't come close to winning, Forbes helped shape the debate. His
plan for a flat income tax became a national issue in 1996, when he burst onto
the political scene. This year, he helped popularize GOP economic themes such as
health care savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes began mounting a 2000 bid almost as soon as the 1996 campaign ended,
shifting to the right on abortion and other social issues in an attempt to rally
social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   But the conservative base was split among a crowded field of like-minded
candidates such as Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch. Many
conservatives stuck with Bush, despite Forbes' attempts to dislodge them.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: I support Ten Commandments in schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says public schools should be
free to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms - even though it's illegal.
<P>
	   "If teachers want to put up the Ten Commandments, they should be allowed to
do that," Giuliani said during a City Hall press conference Wednesday. "They
shouldn't be harassed if they want to do that. The Ten Commandments is part of
our tradition. It's part of our history, it's part of Western civilization. If
teachers would like to emphasize what's in it and talk about it, there shouldn't
be some kind of inquisition that says that they can't do that."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor - who was educated in Catholic parochial schools and was once a
First Amendment lawyer - added however, that posting the commandments should not
be required.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, a moderate Republican who has recently been courting elements of
his party's conservative wing, is running for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who announced her candidacy last Sunday. In several
television talk show appearances that day, Giuliani also indicated he would run.
</P>
<P>
	   The commandment issue was raised after The Village Voice obtained an
eight-page Giuliani fund-raising letter mailed to out-of-state religious
conservatives. In the letter, Giuliani complains that, "liberal judges have
banned the posting of even the Ten Commandments in our public schools."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that placing the commandments in
schools violates First Amendment protections against the government's promotion
of religion.
</P>
<P>
	   But there has been a recent push in communities across the United States to
allow the display of the commandments in public spaces, including schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Indiana House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a bill that would allow the commandments to be posted in schools,
courthouses or other government property if displayed with other documents of
historical significance that have formed and influenced the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana's state senate has already approved a similar bill and Gov. Frank
O'Bannon has said he will sign the legislation if it is found to be
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of such legislation say the United States based its system of
laws on the 10 rules the biblical Book of Exodus says God gave to Moses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Randall Balmer, a Barnard College professor of religion, said that
publicly posting the commandments constitutes "an excessive attack on religion."
</P>
<P>
	   "Religion has thrived in this country precisely because it has been
uncoerced," said Balmer. "The minute you post the Ten Commandments, you
undermine the very basis of what America stands for and you threaten the
vitality of religion in America."
</P>
<P>
	   Balmer added that anyone who is neither Christian nor Jewish, "should be
offended. They should be up in arms about this."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to advocating the posting of the commandments, Giuliani said
Wednesday that sometimes, teachers who pray with students are fired faster than
teachers found to have serious criminal records, including for sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, Giuliani cited a New York City school teacher dismissed last
year for leading students in prayer after one of their classmates had died.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had a prayer and the teacher was fired in record time," said Giuliani.
"And I made the point then that it was odd to me that a teacher would be fired
for something like that in a few weeks when pedophiles, who are accused and
convicted of pedophilia, teachers who do that, remain there for three or four
years."

South Carolina, the event illustrates the tensions between his dual roles as a
straight-talking reform candidate and powerful Senate committee chairman in need
of cash for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   It also has given ammunition to his chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who now calls himself the
true reformer in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's another reason why being an advocate for reform takes political
courage,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, the advocacy group
that is allied with the Arizona senator in support of changing the way political
campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been criticized for enlisting corporate lobbyists to raise money
for him, and for holding closed-door events. He has said he wants his
fund-raisers open to scrutiny except when the hosts insist otherwise. He
scrapped plans for a private event tonight for $1,000 donors, and was combining
the event with a larger, $500-per-person gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the hosts for tonight's event, which is expected to raise $200,000,
are former Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a member of McCain's national steering
committee whose clients include AT&AMP;T and Microsoft; Ed Hamberger, head of the
Association of American Railroads; and former Federal Election Commission
chairman Trevor Potter, a McCain campaign attorney now with a law firm that
represents CBS Corp. and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Fellow campaign finance reformers note that McCain is abiding by the limits
outlined in the legislation he has co-sponsored with Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis. The bill would ban soft money -- the unregulated contributions from labor
unions, corporations and individuals that the political parties increasingly are
spending on ads in support of particular candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that impresses me about McCain's fund raising is he on his own
said he would not take soft money,'' Feingold said. ``He is giving up the
biggest pot of money, which is going to be a very big factor. ... The good news
is lobbyists can't give more than other people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who has criticized McCain for collecting money from lobbyists, was hit
on the same issue Wednesday by the watchdog group Texans for Public Justice. The
group said at least 23 lobbyists were members of Bush's ``Pioneers,'' the group
of fund-raisers who have brought in at least $100,000 for his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bush is the crown prince of special-interest fund raising,'' said Craig
McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice. ``To call George W. Bush a
reformer is like calling Al Capone a country gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
	   Observed McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky: ``It's tough to be the king of
reform when you're the king of special interest cash.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan responded by citing McCain's record,
including fund raising from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The report neglects to point out that Chairman McCain, who said he will
not take PAC contributions, actually takes a larger portion of his contributions
from Washington special interests than any candidate, while Governor Bush is the
one candidate who fully and rapidly discloses his campaign contributors, 173,000
from all 50 states,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has raised about five times more PAC money than McCain -- $1.5 million
to $318,000. Bush also has outraised McCain overall, $68.7 million to $13.7
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush has raised more money than any candidate in the history of
presidential politics,'' McCain said in his defense Wednesday night on CNN.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also criticized McCain for allegedly breaking federal limits on
spending for the upcoming South Carolina primary. McCain, who is accepting
federal help for his campaign, must adhere to state spending caps. Bush is not
accepting federal funding and can spend as much as he can raise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you accept public money, there is an obligation to adhere to spending
caps,'' Bush said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But loopholes in the federal law enable candidates to exceed the spending
caps -- $1.5 million for South Carolina -- and there is no evidence that McCain
has broken the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If George Bush really cared about the spending limits he'd be following
them himself,'' Opinsky said. ``Unfortunately, he's chosen to opt out of the
system.''

<HEADLINE> Artist of Symbols Gets Big Show  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a surrealist painting with a feminist touch: Three
men with curved, floor-length beards seem to be pedaling as if their beards were
bicycles. A woman in the background floats above the floor, tangled in a third
beard.
</P>
<P>
	   The men use their long thick mustaches as handlebars.
</P>
<P>
	   It's one of 77 paintings in this nation's first major show of work by
Remedios Varo which opens today at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pictures by Varo, who died in Mexico in 1963, bring hundreds of thousands of
dollars at New York auctions, according to curator Luis-Martin Lozano.
</P>
<P>
	   Lozano said the painting called ``Hairy Locomotion'' illustrates Varo's view
that the dynamism of civilization -- symbolized by the invisible bicycles --
depends on maleness -- the long beards and mustaches. Females -- symbolized by
the floating, beard-entangled woman -- compete at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Like fellow-surrealist Salvador Dali, Varo was born in Spain and got a
strict classical training at San Fernando, the national art school. Like his
work, her paintings combine precise drawing with fantastic figures and objects.
</P>
<P>
	   Andre Breton, the founder of surrealism, hung Varo's work in his Paris
apartment, though women had little place in his movement. ``They were
womanizers,'' Lozano said of the surrealists in an interview, ``a woman was an
inspiration -- a muse -- not an independent artist.''
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose of surrealism, influenced by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, was to
explore the hidden depths of the mind. In Dali's case, the result was grotesque
images like pliable watches hung over tree branches, or a huge severed head
propped up on a landscape.
</P>
<P>
	   In another picture, ``Woman Leaving the Psychoanalyst,'' Varo painted a
figure with a mask dropped from her face, holding a severed head by the beard.
</P>
<P>
	   A visitor asked if it was meant to be the psychoanalyst's head.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe her father's?'' suggested one of the museum staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Varo's father was an engineer who fostered his daughter's artistic career.
</P>
<P>
	   Lozano said Varo lived for a year with Max Ernst, a leading German exponent
of surrealism.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Varo felt much freer when she made her way to Mexico in 1941, after
a period in prison and concentration camp in German-occupied France. The reason
for her confinement is still obscure, and she was freed well before the war
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Varo did all but two of the 77 paintings in the show during her more than 20
years in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Magic of Remedios Varo'' will be at the National Museum of Women in
the Arts through May 29. Admission is free with a suggested contribution of $3
for adults, $2 for seniors and students. The exhibit will be at the Mexican Fine
Arts Center Museum in Chicago, June 16-Aug. 20.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Defend Military Retirees  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers say the nation must live
up to its promise to provide full health care access to military retirees, even
if it costs billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen
agreed that the government has an unfulfilled obligation to retired career
servicemen. ``This is perhaps the single most important issue we can address
this year and in the future,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers, speaking separately at a news conference before cheering
veterans, said they will make sure the issue comes up this year, and introduced
legislation that would bring sweeping changes to the retiree health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation ``would rectify a broken promise made to those servicemen
and women who were promised by recruiters that they would have fully paid health
care for life,'' said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., sponsor of the Senate bill with
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, 20-year retirees who entered military service before
June 7, 1956, could enroll in the health care program for federal civilian
retirees -- the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program -- with the government
paying 100 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those entering after 1956, when the military health care plan CHAMPUS was
enacted into law, could join FEHBP under the same conditions as civilian
retirees. At age 65, they could either stay in FEHBP or participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., House sponsor along with Rep. Ronnie Shows,
D-Miss., said cost estimates run in the $8 billion to $10 billion a year range.
``So what?'' he said. ``That absolutely means nothing to me. We gave our word.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the budget running big surpluses, he said, ``now is the time and maybe
the only time'' to do right by the nation's military retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1956, the military promised free health care for life to retirees.
After that all retirees were entitled either to free care at a military facility
on a space-available basis or could sign up with an insurance plan, for many the
HMO-like Tricare program. At age 65, all retirees are switched to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The closing of many military bases has made it tougher for many veterans to
use military hospitals, while Tricare, is ``one of the worst HMOs in America,''
Norwood said. Reimbursement rates are only about 75 percent of what Medicare
pays, he said, making it difficult to find providers and forcing many veterans
to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before applying to the program for
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the legislation said it would make it easier to recruit and
retain quality people in the military. ``If you want them to stay in the service
and you promise them something, please give it to them,'' said Fred Athans,
president of the Retired Enlisted Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, speaking to the House Armed Services Committee, said the
administration is working to expand health care access.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have made a pledge, whether it's legal or not, it's a moral obligation
that we will take care of all of those who served, retired veterans and their
families, and we have not done so,'' said Cohen.

<HEADLINE> CIA Agent Warns on Korean Missiles  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea is still developing its long-range ballistic
missile program despite a promise not to test the missiles while talks with the
United States are under way, a top U.S. intelligence official suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as the United States and North Korea prepare to resume talks next
month, ``our judgment is they are continuing the program,'' Robert Walpole, the
CIA official in charge of strategic and nuclear issues, told a Senate hearing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, North Korea's continued willingness to sell its missiles and
technology to other nations poses a major threat to U.S. troops and to allies,
both in the Middle East and Asia, Walpole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if North Korea is sticking by its promise not to test missiles in the
atmosphere, ground testing of various components is believed to still be taking
place, Walpole said. ``The program is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole gave an unclassified update on new intelligence estimates of the
ballistic-missile threat. That report, completed in September, found that over
the next 15 years, North Korea and Iran are likely to develop missiles
potentially capable of killing millions of Americans. The CIA also said Iraq
posed an additional -- though somewhat more distant -- threat.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballistic missile capability being developed North Korea and Iran is the
chief reason for a movement in Congress to build a limited U.S. missile defense
system. President Clinton is to make a decision on going forward with such a
project this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to shelve its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for energy supplies from the United States, Japan and South Korea. But
North Korea rattled nerves in Asia and Washington by testing a three-stage Taepo
Dong-1 rocket that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean in August
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, North Korea agreed to forgo a test of the newly developed
longer-range Taepo Dong-2 missile for the duration of talks with the United
States. In return, Washington lifted some of its half-century-old economic
sanctions on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Those talks are to resume next month when a senior North Korean official,
yet to be designated by Pyongyang, meets in Washington with Clinton
administration officials. U.S. concerns about North Korean missiles will be high
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole told the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on international
security that if North Korea ends the freeze, it could test its long-range Taepo
Dong-2 ballistic missile later this year. A three-stage Taepo Dong-2 would be
capable delivering a several-hundred-ton nuclear payload anywhere in the United
States, Walpole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Walpole said that the proliferation of shorter-range ballistic missiles,
``driven primarily by North Korean No Dong sales, has created an immediate,
serious and growing threat to U.S. forces, interests and allies in the Middle
East and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Missiles that Iran now possess -- with help from North Korea, the Russian
and China -- can reach deep into Turkey, for instance, he said. ``That's NATO.
We're trying to get this message out.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``North Korea continues to demonstrate a willingness to sell its missiles,''
Walpole said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that not all U.S. intelligence community analysts shared the view
that North Korea is continuing to develop its long-range ballistic missile
program, but that a majority did, including himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the subcommittee chairman, said he was troubled
that ``North Korea appears ready to test its more capable Taepo Dong-2 at any
time; Iran has already tested a medium-range ballistic missile and has begun
developing longer-range weapons.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These worrisome developments reflect not just a determination by rogue
states to acquire ballistic missiles, but the increasing availability of the
technology required to develop these weapons,'' Cochran said.

<HEADLINE> Disney Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While Internet operations remain a money loser for Walt
Disney, the company expects its growing Web presence to become a key part of its
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Disney reported higher profits Wednesday, its Internet losses
continued and are likely to drag down overall results for the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   As stated last month when the company announced a management reorganization,
Disney earned $515 million, or 25 cents a share, for the quarter that ended Dec.
31, up from $482 million, or 23 cents a share, for the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's Go.com Internet division, spun off with its own stock after
Disney completed its acquisition of the Infoseek Web portal last fall, lost
$265.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the quarter. Most of the loss resulted
from Infoseek acquisition costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney retained 72 percent of Go.com stock. Adding in Go.com's losses,
Disney's earnings were $324 million, or 16 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Go.com's operating losses are expected to continue while the company reforms
its operations from an Internet portal to a content-driven entertainment site,
Disney executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will push to reach profitability as quickly as is possible and prudent,"
said Thomas Staggs, chief financial officer, in a conference call with
investment analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   With Disney's assets, including its movie division, ABC-TV, ESPN and other
top cable channels, Go.com is positioned to become a leading entertainment site
for Internet users, said Michael Eisner, Disney chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   "No other company than Go.com has a comparable collection of assets to serve
them," Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also can become a leader in creating entertainment specifically for
broadcast over the World Wide Web as high-speed Internet access becomes more
available, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall Disney revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 5 percent from
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasting revenues were up 19 percent to $2.7 billion, driven by strong
ad sales for the smash game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." Advertising
revenues also rose at Disney's radio stations and ESPN and some of its other
cable channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success of "Toy Story 2," which has grossed $237 million,
Disney's studio revenues dropped 10 percent to $1.6 billion. Other films such as
"The Insider" and "Bicentennial Man" performed weakly, while home-video sales
also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's retail division, a sore spot as the company's stock and earnings
slumped the past year, continued to falter. Consumer-products revenues were $903
million, down 6 percent as merchandise licensing declined in the United States,
Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's tourism operations, which include theme parks, resorts and
cruise ships, maintained strong results, posting revenues of $1.58 billion, a 9
percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Documents Surface in Coke Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Few in number, black employees at Coca-Cola formed
networking groups to share prejudical experiences as a way to "retain their
psychological health," according to documents released as part of a racial
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke turned over about 300 pages of documents Wednesday to lawyers
representing eight current and former black employees who have sued the beverage
giant, claiming the company discriminated against blacks in pay, promotion and
performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really a window into how the top blacks of the company were dealing
with racism," said Cyrus Mehri, a Washington lawyer representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in the documents -- 40 pages of which Coke faxed to reporters -- is
a December 1995 report on diversity from Carl Ware, the former head of Coke's
Africa Group, to M. Douglas Ivester, who was then Coke president and will soon
retire as chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fall of 1995, Ware led a discussion group of five black senior Coke
officials who reviewed the company's efforts at diversifying its work force and
the environment in which black employees worked.
</P>
<P>
	   The group concluded that some black employees were seen as "lacking the
skills and intelligence to succeed in certain areas," and that group members
credited their advancement to mentors and their "ability to depersonalize
prejudicial behavior."
</P>
<P>
	   "Even when African-Americans were few in number in the organization, an
informal network of African-Americans was operating to provide sanity checks and
a comparison of related experiences with the social realities of the
organization," Ware wrote. "This allowed many of them to retain their
psychological health."
</P>
<P>
	   Mehri called the report "the litigation equivalent of the fall of the Berlin
Wall."
</P>
<P>
	   "They have no more moral standing left," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch said plaintiff attorneys were reading too much
into the documents, which U.S. District Judge Richard Story last month ordered
Coke to produce.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't say that the company was systematically engaging in practices
that discriminate against African-Amercian associates," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivester, who plans to retire after Coke shareholders meet in April, is being
replaced by Douglas Daft. Deutsch said that neither Ware nor Ivester was
available to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft, who was elected president in December, has made a series of swift
management decisions in recent weeks, including persuading Ware to change his
mind about leaving the company and announcing worldwide job cuts of 6,000
workers as the Atlanta-based company struggles to stem declining profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsch said the documents were made public because the company wanted "to
be sure the information is put in the proper context."
</P>
<P>
	   He said many of Ware's recommendations had been implemented, including a
formal minority recruitment and training program, a quarterly networking program
for black employees and diversity training for all managers starting this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Coke's incoming president Jack Stahl said the company is
committed to renewing its diversity efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the company has taken some actions since that report was written, we
are not where we want to be where diversity is concerned," Stahl said. "We must
and will make accelerated progress."
</P>
<P>
	   The discrimination lawsuit seeks class action status, which would expand it
to represent more than 2,000 black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola has denied the allegations of discrimination and is fighting the
efforts to certify the lawsuit as a class action.
</P>
<P>
	   In an order made public Tuesday, Story said the parties must "attempt in
good faith to settle this case by participating in non-binding, confidential
mediation," in which a neutral third party attempts to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   James Voyles, a Marietta attorney representing the plaintiffs, said
Wednesday that the mediation is expected to start in two to three weeks. He
declined to reveal who the mediator is.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, Toyota Show Off New Cars  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- With competition heating up in the market for small trucks,
two Asian automakers have introduced new versions aimed at keeping their sales
up -- and perhaps even stealing a few from the American leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan Motor Co. on Wednesday showed off a restyled version of its Frontier
pickup, and announced a new top-of-the-line engine for the model at the Chicago
Auto Show media previews. Toyota Motor Co. showed off a four-door version of its
Tacoma compact pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   While the market for such pickups has not grown in recent years, the
Japanese automakers see their offerings as a way to bring new buyers into their
fold -- and hopefully keep them as customers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel a lot of our growth potential is on the truck side," said Don
Esmond, general manager of Toyota's U.S. sales arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The new versions of the Frontier that will hit dealerships later this summer
will carry the same mechanical pieces under a tougher looking exterior, with
such touches as painted, exposed bolts over the wheel wells. The old model
"didn't have a lot of testosterone going for it, visually," said Jerry
Hirshberg, the chief of Nissan Design International.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this year, the Frontier will get some mechanical testosterone as an
option -- a supercharged V6 that puts out 210 horsepower. Nissan did not offer a
price for the new version; the old models sell from $11,500 to $21,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan expects the restyled Frontier -- sold in two-door, four-door,
extended cab and four-wheel-drive versions -- to add about 5,000 sales to last
year's total of about 105,000. It will still be built at Nissan's plant in
Smyrna, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see a lot of growth, which is why you've got to do something bold,"
said Jed Connelly, vice president and general manager of Nissan North America.
"You've got to get noticed."
</P>
<P>
	   Connelly also said Nissan was exploring building a full-size pickup and SUV
models for the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason for keeping small pickups up-to-date is that they have some
of the youngest buyers. Esmond noted that the average buyer age on some models
of the Tacoma is 36 years old -- a young group that Toyota can target for other
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tacoma Double Cab will go on sale in October, and Toyota expects to sell
from 30,000 to 45,000 vehicles. The company did not release pricing; a Tacoma
Xtracab can cost up to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are scheduled to show off new
versions of their own compact pickups Thursday. Ford's Ranger is the top-seller,
followed by the Chevrolet S-10.
</P>
<P>
	   GM also showed off two concept cars Wednesday. The Pontiac Piranha is a
swoopy hatchback with removable mesh seats and a carrying cart for large cargo.
The Chevrolet Traverse is a four-door sedan with a two-piece hatchback and a
microcomputer built into the dash.
</P>

All Hostages Leave Afghan Plane
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- All of the roughly 150 passengers held hostage on
a hijacked Afghan airliner exited the plane early Thursday, ending the crisis
after nearly four days, police said. About 85 men, women and children walked
down the staircase of the plane about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 EST). Two hours later,
about 65 more hostages were seen exiting the Ariana airlines plane, their hands
in the air. Authorities planned to carry out a sweep of the Ariana airlines
Boeing 727, parked at Stansted airport north of London, to ensure no passengers
remained on board.

<HEADLINE> Buick Unveils 1st Truck in 77 Years  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Think of a wingtip shoe with a thick cleated sole and you'll
get an idea at what Buick was aiming for with its first truck model in 77 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buick Rendezvous, to be unveiled Thursday at the Chicago Auto Show, is
General Motors Corp.'s next stab at the lucrative market for vehicles that offer
the cargo capacities of a truck and the smooth, easy ride of a sedan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous, a mechanical sibling of the Pontiac Aztek unveiled earlier
this year, is roughly the same size as the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes M-Class
SUVs, but will likely cost thousands less. Buick hopes the Rendezvous will bring
in a younger group of buyers than its current lineup of conservative sedans when
it goes on sale in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mission for Rendezvous is to go beyond what Buick has been ... to go
beyond where Buick is today in terms of our customer demographics," said
Rendezvous brand manager Jack Bowen.
</P>
<P>
	   GM and other automakers have been rushing to bring car-like SUVs to market.
In addition to the Aztek, Saturn is slated to introduce an SUV soon, and other
models may be in the works for Oldsmobile and Cadillac. Buick hasn't offered a
truck model since 1923.
</P>
<P>
	   While Buick has been one of the more successful GM divisions in the past few
years, the market for its slate of sedans is stagnant. By adding an SUV to its
lineup, Buick also hopes to change the way consumers think about the brand.
</P>
<P>
	   "The challenge that Buick faces is the image of the brand," said Chris
Cedergren, an analyst with Nextrend. "It's not bad, but among younger consumers,
even in their 40s, Buick is associated more with their parents' or grandparents'
generation."
</P>
<P>
	   Cedergren said Lincoln faced a similar problem before it introduced its
Navigator SUV. The Navigator was a hit, and its Lincoln badge did not appear to
hurt it among younger customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous has several Buick design touches, but makes a few alterations
for a beefier appearance. While the front end is distinctively Buick, the rear
pillars borrow the forward-angled look of the Lexus RX 300.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the Aztek, the Rendezvous comes with an 185-horsepower V6 that runs the
front wheels. Buick will offer an optional all-wheel-drive system that engages
automatically when sensors detect a loss of traction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rendezvous' most unique feature is a third row of seats that can fold
flat into the floor. With the seats up, the Rendezvous can hold seven people.
</P>
<P>
	   Buick officials would not give a price on the vehicle, but industry analysts
estimate it will cost between $25,000 and $29,000. Although expected production
of 50,000 Rendezvous a year would be a small part of Buick's overall sales --
the division sold 445,611 cars last year -- analysts said the effect on Buick
would be far greater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like the Aztek, it's a niche product, but in neither case are we looking
for huge volume," said Alan Baum, an analyst with IRN Inc. "GM needs products
that appeal, that are distinct. Then consumers will care about them and GM can
sell them at a profitable price."

<HEADLINE> Sens.: Aid Can't Keep Up With Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The more money made available through federal student
loans and aid, the more it entices colleges to raise tuitions, complained
senators who contend students and government cannot keep up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is incumbent on us to take a serious look at the effect of this
government spending on tuition rates,'' Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of
the Senate Government Affairs Committee, told university officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 20 years, tuitions at public and private schools overall have doubled in
the past, after inflation. The increases have made college unaffordable for many
families, despite the annual $41 billion in federal grants and guaranteed loans,
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators who fear more federal aid could further drive up college costs
speculated that states could raise public tuition caps -- figuring more students
could afford it because of a larger loan, a higher grant or a potential tax
break on their bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators also said private schools might reduce their campus-based programs
in favor of students who can afford to pay their own way with the help of
federal loans and tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   But college officials denied Wednesday that they were driving up tuition to
take advantage of increases in federal aid, and said there's little government
can do to control costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tuition price controls will not work and will be destructive of academic
quality in higher education,'' said William Troutt, president of Rhodes College
in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to believe that parents would welcome a decision by the federal
government to curtail severely their access to loan capital,'' said David
Breneman, a University of Virgnia education school dean.
</P>
<P>
	   Blame the soaring price tags on a handful of the most-expensive private
schools catering to students who don't need aid, said Harvard economist Caroline
Hoxby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence that students are being forced to enroll in
inexpensive colleges that are inappropriate for their level of preparedness,''
said Hoxby. She highlighted Education Department data which shows that since
1970, tuition at the least-expensive schools has actually dropped 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Private schools cost an average $15,000 per year; public colleges charge
about $3,300 annually. About 7 million U.S. college students receive some sort
of aid. About 60 percent of the help a student gets to pay these bills comes
from loans that average $3,000 a year, while grants make up less than 40 percent
of available aid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If college becomes a luxury that an increasing percentage of our
population cannot afford, it will expand the economic divide between the higher
education haves and have-nots and stunt our economic growth,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., the committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising student loan debt is another concern, said Jamie Pueschel, a lobbyist
with the United States Student Association who told lawmakers that government
budget surpluses should be used to boost grant programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have little ability to save money and have no idea when I will be able
to afford a car let alone buy a house,'' said Pueschel, who has a $19,000 debt
and $25,000 annual income.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Czar: Drug War is No Real War  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK STEVENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican and U.S. drug traffickers are facing increasing
competition from their counterparts in Caribbean and Central American nations,
the U.S. drug czar said today in a review of trends in the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico remains the leading route for cocaine shipments into the United
States, but traffickers in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Panama are
rapidly gaining ground, Barry McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, American drug gangs have been pushed out of the wholesale
domestic trade by Dominicans, Colombians and Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gringos just can't compete,'' McCaffrey said, noting that American
traffickers are more easily detected and are less likely to pile up the proceeds
in accounts hidden abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem with the foreigners is that some kid from Colombia gets a
15-year sentence, that has less significance because he's got $200 million
somewhere else,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the top U.S. drug policy officer praised Mexico's efforts to stop
maritime cocaine shipments in the Pacific -- the main route for the drug -- he
told reporters during a three-day visit here that there are warning signs
elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot more (cocaine) showing up in Haiti, the Dominican Republic,
the Jamaica axis,'' he said. ''(Drug) overflights in Cuba dropped dramatically
over the last six months.''
</P>
<P>
	   With U.S. troops out of Panama for the first time in nearly a century, drug
trafficking is increasing in that country, which shares a border with Colombia,
the region's leading drug producer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey cited the latest intelligence reports to show that drug
trafficking is more complex than commonly thought: Leftist rebels in Colombia
protect cocaine shipments -- and even coordinate planting the crop and move
shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   But right-wing paramilitary groups who are fighting the rebels also operate
cocaine processing labs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colombian government has tried to negotiate peace accords with the
rebels by ceding a Switzerland-size chunk of the country to their control; but
the rebels have responded by planting about 35,000 acres of cocaine in that
enclave.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey is here for talks with Mexican leaders that focused on the June 1
implementation of the U.S. ``drug kingpin'' law, which will allow for the
freezing of U.S. assets of foreigners linked to drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Americans Going Hungry  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Churches and volunteer groups are launching a campaign to
combat the problem of hunger that recent reports say persists in America despite
growing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study by Bread for the World today scores the world's wealthiest
nation for ``doing less than any other developed nation to combat pervasive
hunger.''
</P>
<P>
	   One in 10 American households is unable to afford the food it needs, the
report said. Citing Agriculture Department data, the report pushes a plan for
increased wages and nutrition programs it says could end hunger in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Globally, non-government organizations have adopted a goal of cutting hunger
in half by 2015 by pushing governments to add about $4 billion for a variety of
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is buoyed by progress in recent years. The proportion of world
hungry has dropped by 50 percent and the actual number by 17 percent in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But 31 million Americans and 791 million people in poorer countries ``still
face hunger as a regular fact of life,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The level of effort required to end widespread hunger is relatively
small,'' Bread for the World said, noting that U.S. aid to other countries
continues to decline while other nations' contributions rise.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationwide campaign, Hunger 2000, seeks improvements in the federal Food
Stamp program, an increase in the minimum wage by $1 an hour, and more
government spending to combat hunger.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,000 churches across the country are asking devotees to give
``offerings of letters'' to be sent to Congress pushing hunger issues. The goal
is 100,000 letters.
</P>
<P>
	   As further evidence of persistent hunger in America, the U.S. Conference of
Mayors reported in December a survey of 26 cities that demand for emergency food
rose 18 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bread for the World report also parallels the conclusions of a Tufts
University study released last month showing that 30 million Americans worry
about where they will get their next meal. That study said the numbers have not
decreased over the past four years despite unprecedented economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   An Agriculture Department report released in November, lists 18 states and
the District of Columbia where at least 10 percent of households are going
hungry or don't have consistent access to adequate food.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico had the largest percentage -- 15.1. Texas, Mississippi, Arizona,
Louisiana, Arkansas and Oregon had rates of 12.6 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunger also has become a minor issue in the presidential campaign, with
Texas Gov. George Bush saying he doesn't believe the federal ranking of Texas as
second-hungriest state in the nation, with 5 percent of Texas families sometimes
going hungry.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic candidate Al Gore visited a soup kitchen shortly after the
federal report was issued, promising a healthy school breakfast for every child
and food stamps for legal immigrants if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic rival Bill Bradley promises a plan to eradicate child poverty,
frequently telling the story of a little girl who didn't eat breakfast on the
day it was her sibling's turn to eat.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Bread for the World report says increased spending of just $18 per
person per year would end hunger in America, while an extra $1 billion a year
would pay America's share of fighting world hunger.
</P>
<P>
	   The report notes that while hunger has decreased worldwide in the last 25
years, terrible conditions continue to exist in sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia, and two-thirds of the world's hungry still live in poorer Asian and
Pacific countries. Under-nutrition also is rising in former Soviet states, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Cities, States Mull Car Phone Bans  </HEADLINE>
   By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patricia Pena gave little thought to using a cellular
telephone on the road before a distracted driver hit her car broadside, fatally
injuring her 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Now she has devoted herself to pushing for a nationwide ban on cell phone
use in cars, except in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too late for my daughter, but I feel compelled to lobby for my baby
and for other people's babies,'' said Pena, 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers in states and cities across the nation are considering legislation
to ban drivers from talking on cell phones. Without statistics that track
fatalities related to cell phone use, critics point to a 1997 study that
suggests talking on a cell phone while driving is about as dangerous as being
close to legally drunk behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
	   No state bans the use of wireless phones in automobiles, and only
California, Florida and Massachusetts have laws limiting cell phone use in
moving vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Only Oklahoma and Minnesota require police to include information about cell
phones in accident reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Pena died a day after the Nov. 2 accident in Hilltown when a driver
ran a stop sign and slammed into her mother's car. The driver admitted he was
distracted while talking on his cell phone. He was cited for reckless driving
and fined $50.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilltown now bans certain cell phone uses for drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're hoping is by us and other municipalities taking action, the
state Legislature will understand how supportive the residents of Pennsylvania
are of this and look at passing a state law,'' said Ken Bennington, chairman of
the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the ordinance, which took effect last month, a driver cannot be
stopped for using a mobile phone but can be fined $75 if pulled over for another
violation. Emergency services workers and motorists calling 911 are exempt.
</P>
<P>
	   The ordinance, and another passed last month in the Philadelphia suburb of
Conshohocken, is based on one passed last March in Brooklyn, Ohio, where police
have issued more than 80 citations with $2 fines.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposals to ban car phone use have been introduced in Massachusetts and in
Nebraska, where talking on a cell phone would be considered contributory
negligence in auto accidents. At least 300 towns and cities, including Chicago,
are considering local ordinances.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded
that talking on a cell phone while driving quadruples the risk of an accident.
Researchers said losing concentration, not fiddling with the phone itself,
creates the hazard, so talking on a hands-free model is just as risky.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report, a
proliferation of more high-tech auto gadgetry -- on-board navigation systems,
fax machines -- could heighten driver distractions and lead to more crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 85 percent of the nation's approximately 80 million cell phone
subscribers use the devices while driving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know I probably shouldn't be using one when I'm driving. You do get
distracted on the road, but you can get a lot of work done,'' said Jerry
Siedlecki, a claims representative for a Philadelphia insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   Educating drivers about how to use their cell phones responsibly will do
more good that an outright ban, said Lisa Ihde, spokeswoman for the Cellular
Communications Industry Association, a Washington-based industry group
representing wireless carriers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to see any legislation that would deter drivers from taking
their phone with them in their cars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 15 states attempted to address the issue with legislation. In
Pennsylvania, the bill calls for the state to track accidents related to cell
phones, require drivers to pull over when using phones and fine violators. A
hearing is tentatively scheduled for March.
</P>
<P>
	   Such measures have failed to get out of committee in many states, including
New York, where bills prohibiting use of hand-held phones while driving have
languished in committee since 1996. Gov. George Pataki has called such a law
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's kind of a copout,'' said Brendan McGrath, spokesman for
Westchester County Assemblyman Ronald Tocci, whose district recorded several
auto fatalities blamed on cell phone use. ``Obviously if a cop sees you're not
wearing a seat belt, he can see if you're operating a phone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of outright bans believe the benefits of car phones -- the ability
to quickly report drunken drivers, accidents and breakdowns -- far outweigh any
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are 100,000 calls a day placed to 911 through wireless phones,''
Ihde said. ``Those people are saving lives and stopping crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits do nothing to deter Pena from her crusade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You never think something like this can happen to you, until it does,''
she said. ``I'm not going to give up until something is done.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Form New Privacy Groups  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, grappling with complex
privacy issues, are forming groups to discuss possible new legislation and
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle, announced Wednesday the formation of
a Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, while Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
disclosed the creation of a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of senators
and House members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely
personal ways,'' Daschle, D-S.D., said in a statement. ``Whether it is bank
records or medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to
expect that personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
	   Americans' right to privacy is at risk because laws have not kept pace with
sweeping technological changes, Daschle added. ``Some of our most sensitive,
private (data) end up on databases that are then sold to the highest bidder,''
he said. ``That is wrong, it's dangerous and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters have found that privacy now is one of the highest priorities for
Americans, who have expressed concern about threats to their privacy involving
financial data, health records and employment records, Daschle noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More police testimony in Louima case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The cop who broke the "blue wall of silence" in the
Abner Louima torture case says he did not see Officer Charles Schwarz take the
Haitian immigrant into a station house bathroom where he was sodomized by
another officer with a broom handle.
<P>
	   Eric Turetzky, a patrolman at the time and now a detective in the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, testified on Wednesday it was a "poor
choice of words on my part" that caused him to tell IAB investigators in 1997
that he had seen Schwarz enter the bathroom with the prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial in Brooklyn federal court is the second stemming from the attack
on Louima after his arrest during a 1997 melee outside a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky told the jury on Wednesday that Schwarz led the handcuffed prisoner
toward the bathroom where he was subsequently attacked by Justin Volpe, an
officer who mistakenly thought Louima had hit him.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he didn't see Schwarz enter the bathroom, but did see Volpe a short
time later, prodding Louima, pants down and still handcuffed, into a holding
cell.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Volpe had a broken wooden stick in his other hand, "holding it like
you'd hold a sword."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe is serving 30 years for violating Louima's civil rights. Schwarz, 34,
who is appealing his conviction in that case; Officer Thomas Wiese, 37, his
former partner; and Volpe's ex-partner, Officer Thomas Bruder, 37, are now on
trial for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's role in the
Aug. 9, 1997, assault.
</P>
<P>
	   Louima testified earlier that the driver of the patrol car who took him to
the station - Schwarz - held him down in the bathroom while Volpe rammed the
broomstick into his rectum and then his mouth. Schwarz denies ever being in the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's defense lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, played a tape of Turetzky's
interview with IAB investigators six days after the incident, in which he said
he was "positive" that he saw Schwarz take the prisoner into the bathroom, but
didn't see which officer brought him out.
</P>
<P>
	   That previously undisclosed interview differed sharply from his verbal
account on Wednesday, when he said he did not see Schwarz actually approach the
bathroom with the prisoner. In reply to a question by Bruder attorney Stuart
London, he called the IAB interview reference to Schwarz "a poor choice of words
on my part."
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky, whose decision to go to the authorities provided a key break in
the case, said he acted despite pressure from fellow officers and delegates of
the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, he told the IAB probers he had trouble sleeping and
"butterflies in my stomach" over what to do with the information.
</P>
<P>
	   As rumors of a "sexual assault" at the station house spread, Turetzky
testified, he visited the office of the precinct's new commander, and was later
confronted by Officer Timothy Lee, a PBA delegate.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said to me, 'What are you doing in there?' I said, 'you know what I'm
doing.' He said, 'why?"'
</P>
<P>
	   In the IAB interview, he said Volpe's police officer-brother Damian, also a
PBA delegate, urged him to "stick together" with other cops over the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Turetzky said on Wednesday he saw no improper behavior by Schwarz and Wiese
at the riot scene or at the station house, where the two officers searched and
booked Louima and another Haitian man arrested at the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   After moving Louima from the bathroom to a cell, he said, Volpe whacked the
stick against walls and garbage cans in the station house. "He looked pissed
off, angry," Turetzky said. "Officer Volpe was usually the center of attention,
usually joining in. Not that night."

<HEADLINE> Memorial Services Set for Thomas  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK LONG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Derrick Thomas' No. 58 jersey almost certainly will be retired
by the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   It might happen as soon as Tuesday, the day when Thomas' life will be
celebrated at services in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our owner is giving it great thought right now," Chiefs president Carl
Peterson said Wednesday. "And the one thing about Lamar Hunt and his family is
that they always find a way to do the right thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, 33, died Tuesday from a massive blood clot in his pulmonary artery,
which carries blood and oxygen from the heart to the lungs. Memorial services
are set to begin in Kansas City and then move to Miami, Thomas' hometown and the
place where he will be buried.
</P>
<P>
	   There will be a viewing Monday at Thomas' church in Kansas City, then a
memorial service at Kemper Arena the following day, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure it can hold all the people who want to attend," he said. "It
will be a public opportunity for Derrick's fans and friends to honor him."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas's body then will be transferred back to Miami, where there will be a
public viewing Feb. 18. He will be buried Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason for the delay is because Thomas' aunt, Edith Morgan's sister,
died last weekend, Peterson said. Thomas' family will be at her funeral Saturday
in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas' death added to the family's grief. But former Chiefs coach Marty
Schottenheimer said friends and relatives have rallied around Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's been a rock for all of us," Schottenheimer said. "She's been a pillar
of strength."
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan was at her son's side Tuesday when he said he wasn't feeling well
just seconds before his eyes rolled back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chiefs star, who held the NFL record of seven sacks in a game, went into
cardio-respiratory arrest. Thomas, paralyzed from the chest down following a car
crash, died minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of death, confirmed Wednesday by an autopsy, is common for
paralysis victims.
</P>
<P>
	   "A certain percentage of people with paralysis suffer from blood clots,"
said Dr. Barth Green, a neurosurgeon at Jackson Memorial Hospital. "Sometimes
you can see them and sometimes they're hidden in the deeper veins of the body,
and that's what happened with Derrick."
</P>
<P>
	   Between 3 and 15 percent of spinal cord injury patients suffer from blood
clots, Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was driving his Sport Utility Vehicle during a snowstorm on Jan. 23
as he and two friends headed to the Kansas City airport to fly to St. Louis for
the NFC championship game. He lost control of the car, and it flipped several
times.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was brought to the hospital in Miami, his hometown, where he had
surgery to repair his spinal column.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker had been on blood thinners since the
accident, doctors said. Therapists also used mechanical devices on Thomas daily
that intermittently contracted his legs to help circulate blood.
</P>
<P>
	   "We took all the aggressive precautions that are available to people today,"
Green said. "It just wasn't enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Dr. Frank Eismont, an orthopedic surgeon: "If I were to have it all to
do over again, I wouldn't do anything different."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas had been progressing quickly in rehabilitation. He was allowed out of
the hospital last weekend -- although a nurse and a physician accompanied him --
and he had been talking about returning to Kansas City within the next few
months, said Dr. Jon Browne, Chiefs team physician.
</P>
<P>
	   An All-American at Alabama, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Thomas became an
immediate star as a pass-rushing specialist after being taken in the first round
of the 1989 draft. He was an All-Pro in his first nine seasons and ranked ninth
on the career list with 126.5 sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas is survived by his mother; his son, Derrick Thomas Jr., 8; and a
half-brother, Gregory Morgan, 19.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's really one of everyone's own," Peterson said. "He's a special, special
guy that came our way. And we were very, very fortunate to have him 11 of his 33
years. You don't replace someone like this. We won't forget him."

<HEADLINE> Review Into Clinton-Judge Complaints  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel that oversees judicial conduct is reviving a
complaint into why the chief federal district judge in Washington directed
criminal cases of presidential friends to appointees of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judicial Council on Monday ordered appeals court judge Stephen Williams
to look into the circumstances surrounding the special assignment by Chief Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson of five campaign fund-raising prosecutions and a tax
evasion case against longtime Clinton confidant Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
	   In each of the six cases, Johnson sent the prosecutions to Clinton
appointees, bypassing the computer system that randomly assigns almost all
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press first brought the special assignments to light in a
story last summer regarding the Hubbell case and the fund-raising prosecution of
presidential friend Charlie Trie.
</P>
<P>
	   The now-revived complaint, brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative group,
was dismissed by Williams, who labeled it ``frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a two-paragraph order, the Judicial Council noted that a Jan. 10 letter
by a House judiciary subcommittee chairman, Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., brings to
light information about additional fund-raising cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the cases cited by Coble, Johnson assigned to a Clinton-appointed
judge the guilty plea of prominent Miami businessman Howard Glicken, a former
fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore. The chief judge has never said why she
bypassed the random assignment system in Glicken's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The action by four appeals judges and three district judges on the Judicial
Council follows a decision last week by Johnson's colleagues to kill a rule that
enabled the chief judge to make the special assignments. The rule says the chief
judge can bypass the random assignment system for ``protracted'' cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to a newspaper last summer, Johnson said she made the special
assignments to ``move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that
politics was ``never a factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Williams, an appointee of former President Reagan, had said the court rule
that enabled Johnson to bypass the random assignment system ``makes possible
both actual and perceived abuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who received some of the campaign
fund-raising cases from Johnson, spearheaded an internal courthouse review of
the long-standing rule -- a review that began in April, before the issue became
public. He recommended the rule be abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   The national policy-making body of the federal judiciary also has rescinded
its long-standing position supporting special assignments.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit claims Nassau's property tax system harms minorities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - Nassau County's antiquated system of property
assessments forces homeowners in minority communities to pay more than their
fair share in taxes, plaintiffs claim in a class action lawsuit.
<P>
	   Frederick K. Brewington, a lawyer representing the homeowners, said
Wednesday that the county has continued a system that it knew was wrong. "It is
that uncaring attitude that has caused these citizens to step forward and
challenge their government," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While he acknowledged that others fighting the tax assessment system are
already headed to court, Brewington noted that the lawsuit filed Wednesday in
state Supreme Court was the first class action.
</P>
<P>
	   "The time of abuse of taxpayers must end," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta said the county
rejects the notion that assessments are based on race. "We intend to defend the
lawsuit," said Caroline Smith. She said the assessment system affects residents
equally in all the communities. "It exists in Levittown, it exists everywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   The county assessor's office has created a commission to study the issue and
is expected to complete its findings in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Nassau's current system of assessments is based on a formula that uses 1938
building costs and 1964 land values.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is that property values in wealthier, mostly white,
neighborhoods have appreciated much faster than homes in poorer areas with large
minority populations. The homes may have cost about the same when they were
built; they now vary widely in price, but are assessed at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just want equal taxation in the community," said class action plaintiff
Cynthia Cooper of Lakeview.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said his office plans to
file papers today joining six homeowners in a separate assessment case expected
to be heard in state Supreme Court next month. That case is being handled by the
Nassau chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are looking for a system that is fair to all homeowners," Spitzer said
in a statement. "Someone's assessment should be based on what their home is
worth today, not what it may have cost to build 60 years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   Brewington said the county's liability for damages could run into "the
millions upon millions," depending on the final number of homeowners who join
the class action.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers of the class action set up a hotline, 516-694-9598, and said
civic associations would be distributing petitions.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Trying To Run Streak to Seven  </HEADLINE>
    By BERNIE WILSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The PGA Tour just happens to be stopping at one of Tiger
Woods' favorite courses.
</P>
<P>
	   And Woods, of course, just happens to need a win in the Buick Invitational,
which starts today at Torrey Pines, to run his winning streak to seven and break
a tie with Ben Hogan for the second-longest run in golf history.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe that's why Woods couldn't wait to get to Torrey Pines, the municipal
course with a million-dollar setting on bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite all the emotion and hoopla of his incredible win at Pebble Beach on
Monday, Woods was on the Torrey Pines North Course at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday, getting
out while the greens were fresh.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great environment to play in," Woods said Wednesday. "I have some
good memories from this golf course, not only from last year, but from junior
golf. Even the times I played as a professional, I guess overall I felt really
well."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods tamed Torrey as a 15-year-old junior, and he did it last year with a
spectacular weekend of golf to win the Buick Invitational.
</P>
<P>
	   A seventh straight victory would put him closer to Byron Nelson's seemingly
untouchable record of 11 straight victories in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   With a gallery of some 2,000 watching Wednesday's pro-am, Woods sank a
15-foot eagle putt on the 18th at Torrey Pines South to end his round.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Woods sank a similar eagle putt on the same hole to end a
nine-month victory drought. After making the cut by just two strokes, he came
back and played 17-under during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   His Saturday round of 62 broke the South Course record and was his best
round as a pro, which he later lowered to 61 in the Byron Nelson Classic in May.
His 65 on Sunday allowed him to tie George Burns' 1987 tournament record of
22-under 266.
</P>
<P>
	   His Buick victory came after months of trying to get comfortable with a new
swing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was nice to know that I could do it with the new changes implemented,"
Woods said. "I barely made the cut, and came out on the weekend and played
great.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's when I knew the swing changes we were working on were coming
together. I was able to swing naturally, instead of having to worry about each
position on my backswing and on my downswing, and trying to feel it. I could
just get up there, see the shot, hit it, and there it was.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything about it was indicating that it was just a matter of time before
it came together, and it stayed together for a while."
</P>
<P>
	   It's still together, but Woods said it certainly won't be easy to break
Nelson's record.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a tremendous task that I have ahead of me, if I'm going to be the one,
or somebody else is going to be the one. You know, whoever it is, you are going
to have to play good for not only a long period of time, but you have to get
lucky. You have to get some good breaks right away."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods said he has a chance to catch Nelson. "But the chances are very small.
Very small," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods claims the only time he thinks about his streak is when asked by
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But Woods already knows what the huge gallery expected this weekend will be
cheering for.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just interesting that here people talk about the streak, rather than
the shots I'm hitting or the putts I made here and there. And I think that's
more important than the streak because that's what keeps it alive."
</P>
<P>
	   There's a reason people are excited about the streak, Arnold Palmer said
during an interview on The Golf Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing if you think about it. He's 24 years old and he already has a
path in back of him," Palmer said. "He is drawing a line, and it's going to be
tough for anyone that I see right now to touch him, if he keeps his mind about
his business and enjoys the game."

<HEADLINE> International Custody Fights on Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``To look into their eyes and see the hurt is painful,''
says Rep. Nicholas Lampson, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson is hoping the publicity over the Elian Gonzalez case will call
attention to the thousands of American parents whose spouses have fled with
their offspring to distant lands. In many cases, the parents have found it
impossible to retrieve their children even though they have international law on
their side.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, age 6, is the target of a custody fight between his father in Cuba
and the relatives with whom he has been staying in South Florida since late
November. He arrived there unaccompanied after his mother drowned in a
shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson, chairman of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's
Caucus, was joined at a news conference Wednesday by six such parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Rinaman said his life is ``not livable'' since his wife abducted their
child, Julia, and fled to her native Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   A note sent by fax informed him of Julia's fate. Almost four years have
passed since her abduction, and he has had no contact with Julia since then.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I need help,'' Rinaman said. ``I am American. I served my country and I
expect my country will be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Hague Convention calls for abducted children to be returned to their
place of habitual residence. It is generally agreed that the United States tries
hard to repatriate abducted children who end up on American soil but numerous
foreign countries don't reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The norm is no return of the (American) child,'' said Tom Johnson, a State
Department employee who believes his agency could do much more than it has to
help him retrieve Amanda, 12, from Sweden, where she was taken by her
Swedish-born mother in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Rejecting Johnson's criticism, State Department officials say their efforts
have helped repatriate numerous American children.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Koons, whose son was abducted to Italy by the boy's Italian mother,
said, ``I can stand being a victim of this but my son can't.'' He said young
Ludwig goes through periods of ``great hair loss.'' Alleging that his ex-wife is
unfit, he said an Italian newspaper carried a nude photograph of his son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's being exploited,'' Koons said.
</P>
<P>
	   Melanie al-Mufti, an Islamic woman from Texas, said her son was spirited off
to Egypt by his father two years ago and has had no contact with him despite a
court order awarding her sole custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The wife of Joseph Cooke fled to Germany with their two children in 1992.
She informed her husband after her arrival in Germany that he would never see
his children again. His Christmas gifts to them have been sent and returned. A
U.S. court order granting him full custody has been ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Sylvester, of Cincinnati, has worked ``unceasingly'' for the return of
his daughter Carina from Austria but to no avail. She was taken there at age 13
months by her Austrian mother in October 1995. Court rulings, he said, have
granted custody to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why he doesn't go to Austria and snatch Carina away from her mother,
Sylvester said U.S. authorities informed him he would risk extradition back to
Austria if he tried.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampson said legislation is needed to assist American parents who are
victims in international abduction cases. He also favors steps to ``embarrass
countries into abiding by the Hague Convention.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Boxing Road Longer, Harder  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The road to the Olympics is longer and harder for American
boxers this year -- and it is possible the United States won't be represented by
a full 12-member team at Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
	One who thinks that 12 U.S. boxers will go for Olympic gold is Gary Toney,
president of U.S. Boxing.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 100 percent confident we'll qualify in all 12 weights,'' Toney said
Wednesday, the opening day of the U.S. Olympic trials in the Tampa Port
Authority Cruise Terminal No. 6.
</P>
<P>
	The site, and opening-session attendance -- mostly boxers and their coaches,
friends and family members -- tells you something about the attraction of
amateur boxing in this country.
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very disappointed if we do not qualify 12 boxers,'' Toney added.
``That would be a personal defeat with me.''
</P>
<P>
	It shouldn't disappoint NBC (No Boxing Coverage), which virtually ignored
boxing in its televised coverage of the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	In past Olympic years, trials winners and selected opponents would compete in
box-offs, with the winners going to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	Boxing, however, is one of the sports ordered by the International Olympic
Committee to reduce the number of competitors for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	So the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA), presided over by Prof.
Anwar Chowdhry from that boxing hotbed of Pakistan, ruled that only 54 boxers
from the Americas (North, South, Central and the Caribbean) could compete in
this year's games.
</P>
<P>
	Cuba does not have to qualify any boxers. As the world's best team, it is
guaranteed a boxer at each of the 12 weight classes.
</P>
<P>
	So the 12 winners of the box-offs at the Foxwoods Casino at Mashantucket,
Conn., Feb. 24-26, will have to qualify. Ten of the 12 will get three chances.
The heavyweight and super heavyweight will get two.
</P>
<P>
	The winners and runnersup of 10 weight classes from 106 through 178 pounds and
the winners at 201 and super heavyweight in an Americas qualifier March 27-April
1 will make the Olympics. Those who do not qualify can do so April 27-22 at
Mexico City, where 22 more boxers will make the Olympics. The 10 remaining
Americas spots will go to the winners at 106 through 178 pounds May 23-28 at
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	The United States won one gold and a total of eight medals at the Atlanta
Olympics, but the U.S. team at the 1997 world championships in Budapest won only
one bout.
</P>
<P>
	``We could see we were not developing depth,'' said Toney, whose second
two-year term as president ends in October. So instead of concentrating on
international dual meets, USA Boxing began concentration on international
tournament competition.
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 Pan American Games, U.S. boxers won eight medals, including one
gold, and in the world championships last summer at Houston, they won four gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
	Just as importantly, changes have been made at the administrative level.
</P>
<P>
	``We got comfortable, but things weren't working,'' Toney said. ``I had to
change a lot of committee chairs.''
</P>
<P>
	USA Boxing also starting playing international politics, an important part of
any Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be involved politically with AIBA,'' Toney said,. ``Now we have
eight people on AIBA commissions.''
</P>
<P>
	An American, Loring Baker of Atlanta, currently is the AIBA general secretary,
replacing Karl-Heinz Wehr of Germany, who long held the important post.

<HEADLINE> Youth Is Served at Boxing Trails  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Boxing Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- For Roberto Guerrero, the Olympics are a bright and shining
dream. For Darnell Wilson, they're a fading hope.
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Guerrero, the youngest boxer in the tournament, took a first
step on the long, tough road to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics by winning his
opening bouts Wednesday at the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Wilson, however, was dropped into the challenger's (losers)
bracket.
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had butterflies, but I wasn't scared of boxing,'' Guerrero said
after advancing to the 119-pound semifinals with a 10-7 win over 21-year-old
Jason Franco of the Army at Ft. Collins, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	``They said I wasn't old enough to go to the Olympics,'' said Guerrero, a high
school sophomore from Gilroy, Calif. The minimum age limit for the Olympic is
17.
</P>
<P>
	``But then my father (Ruben, also his trainer) checked and found out the
Olympic deadline for turning 17 is March 27. Guerrero will turn 17 on March 27.
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, of Lafayette, Ind., was outpointed 14-3 by 21-year-old Anthony Hanshaw
of Mansfield, Ohio, at 156 pounds. If Wilson wins the losers bracket in his
class, he would go to the box-offs against the trials champion and would need to
win twice to keep alive his Olympic hopes.
</P>
<P>
	The box-offs will be held Feb. 24-26 at Foxwoods Casino at Mashantucket, Conn.
Previously the box-off winners automatically went to the Olympics. Not this
year.
</P>
<P>
	The box-off winners will have to qualify at one of three Americas qualifying
tournaments -- at Tampa, Mexico City and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	The opening day turned into a nightmare of their own making for Tiger and Rock
Allen, identical 18-year-old twins from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	Tiger was unable to compete at 125 pounds when he weighed in 4 1/2 pounds over
the class limit. Rock outpointed Mahlon Kerwick of Spokane, Wash., 16-9 at 132
pounds, but he later was disqualified when it was disclosed that Tiger had
weighed in for him and signed paperwork on his behalf. Kerwick was declared the
winner.
</P>
<P>
	The twins' father-coach, Naazim Richardson. refused to let his sons appear
before the USA Boxing's grievance committee to answer questions. They did not
talk to the media.
</P>
<P>
	Brotherly love could be tested -- at least in the ring -- in the 106-pound
class, where Nonito and Glenn Donaire of San Leandro, Calif. both advanced
during the day session at the Tampa Port Authority Cruise Terminal No. 6. If
both win tonight, they will box in the final Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter who wins as long as one of us goes to the
Olympics,'' said 20-year-old Glenn Donaire, who often spars with 17-year-old
Nonito, but has never opposed him in an official bout.
</P>
<P>
	Nonito Donaire opened the tournament by counter-punching his way to a 19-7 win
over Ronald Siler of Cincinnati. He then watched and rooted as Glenn overwhelmed
Karoz Norman of St. Louis 26-9 after four 2-minute rounds, the Olympic format.
</P>
<P>
	The Donaire brothers, who came to the United States from the Philippines in
1993, are trained by their father, Nonito Sr., and Robert Salinas. If they meet
in this tournament, the father will work in Nonito's corner.
</P>
<P>
	The day started poorly for the brothers LeChaunce and Teaunce Shepherd,
students at Northern Michigan University, but it ended on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
	Dante Craig of Cincinnati, the 1999 Golden Gloves champion, scored a 14-12
decision over 25-year-old LeChaunce Shepherd, the 1997 and 2000 U.S. champion
and a 1999 Pan American Games bronze medalist. Shepherd also lost his opening
bout in the 1996 Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd landed the harder punches, especially left hooks, but the 21-year-old
Craig was busier.
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Teaunce Shepherd, a silver medalist at the U.S. championships,
was too experienced for Verquan Kimbrough of Aliquippa, Pa., and won their
125-pound bout 18-4 on the night program.
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four boxers from the Americas will qualify for the Sydney Olympics. Cuba
does not need to qualify and will automatically field a full squad as the
world's top-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying for the Olympics will be the winners and runners-up in 10 weight
classes from 106 through 178 pounds, and the winners at 201 pounds and super
heavyweight at Tampa on March 27-April 1 and at Mexico City on April 17-22.
</P>
<P>
	The winners in the lower 10 weight classes at Buenos Aires on May 23-28 also
will qualify for Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Binnebose Hopes To Return to Ice  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Paul Binnebose's physical scars are already fading.
</P>
<P>
	Hair covers the part of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his swollen
brain. The stark black eye patch is gone, though his double vision remains.
Slight facial paralysis is his most noticeable disfigurement.
</P>
<P>
	But while Binnebose will soon be whole, his loved ones' memories will be
scarred forever.
</P>
<P>
	``My family had the worst part. They have memories they're going to carry
around,'' said Binnebose, who has no recollection of the accident that nearly
killed him. ``I wouldn't want anyone to have that.''
</P>
<P>
	Binnebose and partner Laura Handy were silver medalists at both the 1999 World
Junior Championships and the Junior Grand Prix final, and finished third as
seniors at last year's U.S. Championships. They were eager for the new season,
training for Skate America on Sept. 29 in Newark, Del. As they practiced a star
lift, where Binnebose lifts Handy above his head with one hand, his back began
spasming from a previous injury.
</P>
<P>
	His feet tangled beneath him and he tumbled to the ice, Handy crashing down
upon him. His head slammed onto the ice so hard spectators in the stands heard
the sickening thud. His skull split.
</P>
<P>
	``I can just visualize how horrible it was in my head,'' said Binnebose's
mother, Judy, who was videotaping practice that morning. ``When I went down to
the ice, he was having convulsions. People were holding his head so he didn't
constantly hit it against the ice.''
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, at the Christiana Medical Center, Binnebose stopped
breathing.
</P>
<P>
	``I heard them say his pupils were fixed and dilated,'' Judy Binnebose said.
``Of course, at that point, I felt he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't, but it was close. With his brain swelling, doctors tried one last
measure to save his life. They cut his skull from ear to ear across the top of
his head and removed a large piece of skull.
</P>
<P>
	He was then put in a barbiturate-induced coma to allow his brain to heal.
</P>
<P>
	``Eww!'' Binnebose said with a laugh as he listened to the gory details. ``I
have a dent in my head, but that's really the only thing. Brain surgery, all
that stuff ... I've been told I went through a lot, but it really ain't nothing
to me.''
</P>
<P>
	``It was to us,'' his mother retorted.
</P>
<P>
	The trauma didn't end with surgery. He stopped breathing again and had to be
revived. He spent almost five weeks in either a coma or sedated state. He
developed pneumonia, a blood infection and a heart infection. He had so much
fluid in his chest cavity it shrunk his lungs. One of his lungs collapsed.
</P>
<P>
	``We were hanging on by a thread,'' Judy Binnebose said. ``The doctors will
look at us and say, `There were four days we didn't expect him to live.'''
</P>
<P>
	Even if he lived, would Binnebose be left with any life? Or would the strong,
vibrant young man who once lifted Handy so high be reduced to a shell?
</P>
<P>
	Almost a month after his accident, Binnebose began mouthing words and
responding to commands with blinks of his eyes. It was another week before he
regained total consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	``When I realized how much time was missing, that's when it first hit me how
long I was taking a timeout for,'' he said. ``I guess even now, I can't really
comprehend all it involved. To think about this and that and pneumonia ... I
should have been gone. I should have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
	Binnebose was released from the hospital Nov. 30. He'd lost 50 pounds. It took
all his strength just to lift his thumb. The right half of his face was
paralyzed, causing double vision in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
	But he still wanted to skate.
</P>
<P>
	``He was told by one doctor, `You really shouldn't skate. If you hit your head
again really bad, you're going to die. You just don't have the reserves,'''
sister Rhonda said. ``That really shook his world.''
</P>
<P>
	Not enough to keep him off the ice, though. After dozens of physical therapy
sessions, Binnebose returned to the ice last month. He wore a helmet, which
longtime coach Ron Ludington would like to see required for pairs skaters.
</P>
<P>
	Binnebose isn't the first pairs skater to suffer a serious head injury. Russian
Yelena Berezhnaya, who has won the last two world titles, was hospitalized for a
month after a former partner's blade sliced her skull while they practiced
side-by-side spins.
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, I wasn't a big advocate of helmets,'' Binnebose said. ``They're
big and bulky and feel weird on your heard. But I sure could have used one on
Sept. 29.''
</P>
<P>
	Binnebose has no doubt he and Handy will skate competitively again. Only if
doctors say his back is too unstable to support Handy on lifts would he quit.
</P>
<P>
	``People on the outside looking in can say, `What are you doing? This is
ridiculous, you're going to kill yourself,''' he said. ``To quit now would be
giving up when I'm on the upside of my career. I just don't think I'm really
ready to not hear, `Representing the United States of America, Laura Handy and
J. Paul Binnebose.'''

<HEADLINE> All Hostages Leave Afghan Plane  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLINE BYRNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Hijackers holding roughly 150 passengers hostage
for four days allowed all their captives to leave the plane safely Thursday,
ending the tense standoff outside London, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities would not disclose exactly how the unknown number of hijackers
had surrendered, but indicated they had not been granted immunity from
prosecution in exchange for freeing the hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are now into a very complex and involved criminal investigation, and we
have to be very careful what we say,'' said John Broughton, an Essex County
assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
	   A sweep of the Ariana airlines jet confirmed no one remained on board, and
the Boeing 727 was being swept to make sure it was safe for investigators,
Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained unclear why the hijackers seized the plane early Sunday, 20
minutes into a domestic flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in the process now of building a detailed picture of what is
required and what people want,'' Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He deflected speculation the plane was diverted to Britain in an elaborate
bid for political asylum, saying that would be a matter for the Home Office,
which oversees such requests.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers left the aircraft with little warning, filing off in groups
of about 85 and 65 approximately two hours apart, illuminated by bright lights.
The women and children were allowed to leave first. The males exiting the plane
held their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The first group released was allowed to leave about 3:50 a.m. (10:50 EST).
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said the released hostages would be taken to a safe location and
would undergo medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the releases early Thursday, officials said 151 hostages, including
21 children, were believed on board the aircraft, which was hijacked early
Sunday on a domestic flight leaving Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. It then took a
meandering journey, stopping in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia before landing
in London.
</P>
<P>
	   As the first surprise release got under way, police vehicles parked nearby
and bright lights lit the staircase as a steady stream of people left the
jetliner, the men with their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before that, two of the hijackers had left the aircraft for a
meeting with negotiators on the tarmac, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust,'' he said
later. ``We have negotiated a face-to-face encounter between us and two hostage
takers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the negotiations had continued in person or via other
channels.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also left a box of unspecified ``equipment'' near the steps where the
first group of passengers exited, to assist with negotiations, police
spokeswoman Kim White said. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Wednesday, the hijackers had ejected a flight attendant, who was seen
being sent forcibly down a set of stairs at the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   His departure came four hours after four crew members -- the captain, second
captain, first officer and flight engineer -- escaped by using a rope to lower
themselves from the cockpit and jumping onto the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the negotiations, authorities insisted the armed men had made no
formal demands, political or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, believed to be Afghans armed with grenades, pistols and daggers,
had requested only that food, water and other comfort items be brought to the
plane, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation mounted, however, that the plane was seized as part of an
elaborate bid for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   At the airliner's three stops before landing at Stansted, 25 miles north of
London, the hijackers released a total of 22 passengers. On Monday and Tuesday,
10 hostages were let go at Stansted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Looks To Fill FEC Vacancy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After taking more than a year to think about it,
President Clinton selected law professor Bradley A. Smith to fill a vacancy on
the Federal Election Commission, setting up a new election-year clash between
Senate Republicans and reform groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has been a harsh critic of campaign funding laws, saying they have
failed to rid the system of corrupting influences while infringing on
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. He favors no limits on how
much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, was
recruited for the FEC post by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a vigorous foe of the
campaign finance bills under consideration in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   McConnell said Smith's legal background and credentials may make him ``the
most qualified person we've ever put on the FEC.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Scott Harshbarger, president of the government watchdog organization
Common Cause, promised to fight against Smith's confirmation. He complained that
``President Clinton has caved in to an increasingly extreme faction in this
country ... who actually believe that big money in politics should be increased,
rather than reduced.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FEC enforces federal campaign finance law, making sure candidates comply
with disclosure requirements and contribution limits. The six-member commission
is evenly split among Republicans and Democrats, all of whom serve six-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
	   By tradition, the Senate's Democratic leadership recommends the three
Democrats and the GOP leadership recommends the three Republicans. In almost
every instance, whoever has occupied the White House has deferred to those
wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith's writings on election law gave his critics considerable fodder
with which to oppose him. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, he
wrote that when ``a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of
ever-changing 'loopholes,' it is probably the law, and not the people, that is
in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal
Election Campaign Act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Common Cause and other groups organized a campaign against Smith last
summer, and Clinton held off on the nomination. Frustrated by the failure to get
quick action on what normally is a routine nomination, McConnell and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., delayed confirmation of Richard Holbrooke
as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House made no mention of that background in its announcement.
Clinton also will renominate Commissioner Danny Lee McDonald, who has served on
the FEC since 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the White House offered him no explanation for the long gestation
period between the time his name was suggested and Wednesday, when Clinton
announced his intention to send the nomination to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was looking forward to explaining his views to senators during
confirmation hearings. In the meantime, ``I expect I'll take a few more whacks
on the editorial pages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith would succeed retiring Commissioner Lee Ann Elliot.

<HEADLINE> State tries to get rid of Canada Geese  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWINGTON, Conn. (AP) - The town of Newington is spending $300 a month
trying to keep Canada Geese out of Mill Pond Park.
<P>
	   An animal control company has used noise, trained border collies and decoys
that simulate dead geese. But the geese keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar wars are being waged across the state, where the population of the
non-migratory birds has exploded.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, 389,985 resident Canada geese were counted from Maryland to Maine.
By 1999 that figure had grown to 999,469. In Connecticut, there were an
estimated 10,514 resident geese in 1989 and 18,524 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "People like to see wildlife, but we have a population that is becoming a
serious nuisance," said Edward C. Parker, chief of the state Department of
Environmental Protection's Bureau Of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker has asked for help from the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service, which has
regulatory authority over the species and issues permits for control measures.
</P>
<P>
	   The service has announced a series of meetings in the East over the next few
weeks in which it hopes to find out which measures work and which have broad
community support, a fundamental step in streamlining government procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   The only meeting scheduled for Connecticut will be today at 7 p.m. at the
Holiday Inn in Danbury.
</P>
<P>
	   Ideal habitat for Canada geese is open water adjacent to a grassy area.
Increasing development throughout the East - including golf courses, athletic
fields near low-lying waterways and the creation of small ponds, often in
affluent suburbs with large-lot zoning - has increased Canada goose habitat.
</P>
<P>
	   One method that has increasingly been used over the past decade is an
expansion of the hunting season for Canada geese. Connecticut last expanded its
season in 1996. But many wildlife managers have concluded there is little more
that can be done with hunting seasons, especially since so many of the birds
have congregated in areas where hunting isn't allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Another method that has been used in some other states is a roundup, in
which the geese are captured and killed, the meat given to homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals in Darien, a national
animal-rights organization, is adamantly opposed to killing the geese. Feral
suggests that as long as people are creating the habitat that welcomes the
geese, people ought to get used to them. If their droppings are bothersome,
"clean up after them," she said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis on Lebanon Border Come Out  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Residents of towns and villages along
Israel's border with Lebanon came out of bomb shelters this morning after the
latest flare-up of fighting in south Lebanon eased.
</P>
<P>
	   Shops and factories reopened and people went back to work. After the army
called the all-clear, children in pyjamas jumped around in the sun outside the
shelters, where they had been cooped up for the past three days for fear that
Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon would retaliate for Israeli air strikes against
Lebanese power stations by firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The rockets did not come, and Israeli cabinet ministers indicated Wednesday
that the operation is over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope everything will be OK,'' said Daniel Dadon, 51, as he walked with
his 8-year-old daughter in the town of Kiryat Shemona. ``We just want quiet
here, but I don't think that this will be our last time in the shelters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Israeli jets and artillery struck targets in Jabal al-Daher and the
Zillaya valley, 12 miles north of the border, wounding one Hezbollah guerrilla,
Lebanese security officials said. The area contains reinforced mountain caves
used to hide Hezbollah weapons and supplies. There were no attacks by the
guerrillas, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Israel launched a stepped-up operation by striking the
power stations after Hezbollah attacks killed five Israeli soldiers over the
past few weeks. A sixth was killed in this week's exchanges. The Israeli army
occupies a strip of land in south Lebanon to protect Israel's northern border
against guerrilla attacks, and Hezbollah is fighting to oust the Israeli troops
from the south.
</P>
<P>
	   The casualties caused intense anger and frustration in Israel, coming on the
heels of the suspension of peace talks with Syria. Israel also said that in the
attacks Hezbollah fired rockets from inside Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli ministers said this was a violation of understandings reached by
Israel, Syria and Lebanon to avoid putting civilians on either side of the
border in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel holds Syria responsible for Hezbollah operations, because the flow of
arms from Iran to the guerillas comes across its territory and because Damascus
is the main power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides claimed victory in the exchanges of the past few days. Israeli
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Israel had changed the understandings
in order to protect its soldiers in Lebanon, not only civilians in northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The important change of principle that happened this week is that the IDF
carried out a large-scale operation in Lebanon, including damage to
infrastructure, not in response to firing of Katyushas at civilians but in
response to casualties inflicted on our soldiers in Lebanon,'' Sneh told Israel
radio.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the assistant secretary general of Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem,
said Israel failed to achieve its aim of changing the rules of the game and
driving a wedge between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government and people.
</P>
<P>
	   In a radio interview he pointed out that Hezbollah attacks had killed the
sixth Israeli soldier after the bombing of the power stations. Hezbollah had not
found it necessary to fire Katyushas into Israel but reserved the right to do so
in the future, Qassem said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to pull the army out of Lebanon by
July, responding to growing public weariness with casualties among Israeli
soldiers.

Hostages Released From Hijacked Plane
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- Hijackers holding roughly 150 passengers hostage
for four days allowed all their captives to leave the plane safely Thursday,
ending the tense standoff outside London, police said. Authorities would not
disclose exactly how the unknown number of hijackers had surrendered, but
indicated they had not been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
freeing the hostages. A sweep of the Ariana airlines jet confirmed no one
remained on board, and the Boeing 727 was being swept to make sure it was safe
for investigators, Broughton said.

combat pervasive hunger." One in 10 American households is unable to afford the
food it needs, the report said. Citing Agriculture Department data, the report

<HEADLINE> Skating: Ina-Zimmerman Lead Pairs  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman are expecting to get a phone
message from Europe any minute. And it won't be congratulatory.
</P>
<P>
	With their renowned coach, Tamara Moskvina, overseas at the European
Championships, the pair skated a strong but flawed short program Wednesday night
to take the lead at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman weren't pleased with the uneven performance, and they're
certain Moskvina wouldn't be either.
</P>
<P>
	``We were comfortable when we came off the ice,'' Ina said. ``But when we saw a
replay, we had words.''
</P>
<P>
	They know Moskvina will be checking in to see how they did.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure she won't hear, `great program,''' Zimmerman said. ``Maybe we better
call her.''
</P>
<P>
	Even if it wasn't the couple's best effort, it was by far the most polished
performance on a night when the current weak state of U.S. pairs skating became
apparent to a crowd of more than 10,000 at Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
	Other than Ina and Zimmerman, only Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, currently
second, skated decently, and she fell on their side-by-side jump. And siblings
Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler somehow managed to place third despite two falls
and some sloppy spinning.
</P>
<P>
	``We just had a little bit of an off night,'' said Johnnie, who could have been
speaking for the entire field of 12 pairs. ``It's good we're in third place for
the long.''
</P>
<P>
	The free skate is Friday night. The top two teams qualify for the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman, who have only been skating together for two seasons,
attributed part of their subpar night to rustiness. This was their first
competition since Trophee Lalique in November, and they had spent the last two
months fine-tuning their routines.
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't performed in two months and to get it out of the way felt really
good,'' Ina said. ``You just get on a roll when you're performing all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
	They've been working with Moskvina, who has coached dozens of world medalists,
and her husband, Igor, since they first became a skating pair in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	Using some of the techniques that made Moskvina and her husband famous in
coaching circles, the Russians are hoping to make Ina and Zimmerman medal
contenders on an international level.
</P>
<P>
	During their time training in Hackensack, N.J., they've become more familiar
with the difference in their two coaches.
</P>
<P>
	``Igor doesn't talk as much,'' Ina said. ``Tamara just likes to talk --
sometimes about nothing. He gets serious, so Tamara says, `Make sure Igor is
OK'. When something goes wrong on the ice, he takes it hard. He thinks he's done
something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman's biggest problem in their program came when she stepped out
of a throw triple salchow. They nailed their triple-toe loop jumps and followed
that with an excellent split double twist and death spiral.
</P>
<P>
	``I think we took a little for granted after the first triple-toe jump,'' Ina
said.
</P>
<P>
	In original dance, defending champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won to
increase their overall lead in ice dancing. The couple is expected to take the
free dance (worth 50 percent of the total score) tonight.
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek are second. The top two couples will go to
worlds.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar retreated against the yen Thursday following the
release of unexpectedly strong Japanese economic data. Tokyo stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 108.66 at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), down 0.12 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 109.11 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 297.75 points, or 1.49
percent, to finish the day at 19,710.02. On Wednesday, the average closed up
138.89 points, or 0.70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei's close Wednesday at 20,007.77 was its first above the 20,000
mark since July 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, investors bought yen after the government reported
that December core machinery orders jumped 16.1 percent from the previous month,
beating forecasts of a 0.2 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
	   An overnight fall in New York stocks also prompted traders to dump dollars
ahead of a three-day weekend in Japan. Tokyo financial market were to close
Friday for a national holiday.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Ends a Few Duke Streaks  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Maryland's recent history against Duke is dismal, to say the least. The
Terrapins made the latest game in the series one for the books.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Dixon matched his career high with 31 points and No. 23 Maryland beat
No. 3 Duke 98-87 Wednesday night, ending three impressive winning streaks by the
Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins (17-6, 6-4), who had lost 28 of their previous 33 games
against Duke, snapped:
</P>
<P>
	   --an Atlantic Coast Conference-record 31-game winning streak in the regular
season;
</P>
<P>
	   --an 18-game overall winning streak, the longest in the nation;
</P>
<P>
	   --a 46-game winning streak in Cameron Indoor Stadium, one that dated to Jan.
11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "Streaks come to an end, now we've got to start another one," Duke senior
Chris Carrawell said. "It was a great run and it's sad it ended on our home
court, but that's how God had it in the plans."
</P>
<P>
	   Terence Morris, who struggled through a 7-for-22 shooting night, gave
Maryland the lead for good at 86-83 with a 3-pointer with 3:27 left. He added
another 3 a minute later, and Dixon wrapped it up with three free throws in the
final 31 seconds as the Terrapins closed the game with a 15-4 run.
</P>
<P>
	   "The coaches still told me to shoot," said Morris, who finished with 20
points, two less than teammate Lonny Baxter. "I knew my shot was kind of off in
the first half, but they kept calling plays for me. Those last two 3-pointers
were open, so I had to take them."
</P>
<P>
	   Shane Battier had 28 points for the Blue Devils (18-3, 9-1).
</P>
<P>
	   In other games involving ranked teams Wednesday, it was Iowa 67, No. 5 Ohio
State 64; No. 8 Tennessee 110, Georgia 83; No. 25 LSU 83, No. 9 Auburn 68;
Minnesota 77, No. 10 Indiana 75; No. 13 Connecticut 87, Boston College 58; No.
17 Iowa State 72, Missouri 62; No. 18 Texas 76, Texas Tech 60; and No. 22
Vanderbilt 65, Mississippi State 64.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing to play that well and it still go down to the wire," Maryland
coach Gary Williams said. "They deserve to be No. 3. I think we caught them at
the right time. I seems like there was more and more talk about the streak and
this was our time to get a chance.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really believed we could win the game walking on the court. That was the
key."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than seven points until the final two minutes as
both teams shot 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just stayed with them, exchanged punch-for-punch," said Baxter, who
added 10 rebounds and a career-high six assists in 29 minutes. "Most teams come
in here and are satisfied at the half, saying, 'We played good and expect to
come out and win the game.' It doesn't happen like that here. You've got to stay
focused."
</P>
<P>
	   Carrawell gave all the credit to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   "We definitely were silenced," he said. "They outplayed us and they took the
crowd out of it. They deserved to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Kyle Galloway hit a 3-pointer with 4 seconds left to give the Hawkeyes
(11-11, 4-6) their third win over a ranked team. Dean Oliver had 21 points and
Galloway added 12 for the visitors. Scoonie Penn had 22 points for the Buckeyes
(16-4, 7-2), who had won eight straight and 12 of 13, and Ken Johnson matched
his school record with 11 blocked shots. George Reese of Ohio State tied the
game 64-64 on an offensive rebound with 11 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Harris scored 21 points for the Volunteers (20-3, 8-2 Southeastern
Conference), who had their highest point total of the season and got to 20 wins
faster than any team in school history. D.A. Layne had a career-high 30 points
for the visiting Bulldogs (9-14, 2-8).
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Beshara scored 24 points and Jabari Smith added 20 as LSU (18-4, 5-4
Southeastern Conference) beat its second Top Ten team this season. Mack McGadney
had 19 points for the visiting Tigers (19-4, 7-3), who shot 25 percent from the
field, including 1-for-11 from 3-point range, in falling behind 34-22 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel Przybilla scored a career-high 33 points, including the game-winning
basket with 3.9 seconds left for the Golden Gophers (12-9, 4-7 Big Ten). A.J.
Guyton, who scored 27 points despite a 17 1/2-minute drought, was several feet
short on a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer for the Hoosiers (17-4, 7-3), who
haven't won in Williams Arena in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Mouring was 5-for-5 from 3-point range and scored a career-high 23
points as the Huskies (17-5, 6-3 Big East) beat the Eagles for the 22nd
consecutive time. Freshman Troy Bell had 13 points for visiting Boston College
(9-14, 1-9), which has lost 10 straight games. The Huskies were without starting
center Jake Voskuhl, who sprained his right ankle in the loss to Michigan State
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Fizer had 28 points and 12 rebounds for the Cyclones (20-3, 8-1), who
improved to 3-1 on the road in the Big 12 after going 1-15 the last two seasons.
Keyon Dooling had 18 points for the Tigers (14-7, 7-2), who had a seven-game
conference winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mihm had 23 points and 15 rebounds for his 14th double-double of the
season as the Longhorns (16-6, 7-2 Big 12) rolled at home. Mario Layne had 20
points for the Red Raiders (9-11, 0-9), who have lost eight straight, their
longest losing streak since dropping 18 in a row in 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Langhi scored 21 points to lead the Commodores (16-4, 6-3 Southeastern
Conference). Marckell Patterson had 13 points for the Bulldogs (12-10, 3-6), who
had a chance at the road win, but Robert Jackson's jumper at the buzzer bounced
off the back of the rim.

<HEADLINE> German Films Showcased At Festival  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Showcasing German films in its 50th year, the Berlin
International Film Festival opened Wednesday with a premiere of German director
Wim Wenders' latest work, "The Million Dollar Hotel."
</P>
<P>
	   The romantic thriller showed just how cross-cultural filmmaking has become
since the festival's early days, when directors like Ingmar Bergman and Francois
Truffaut made their highly stylized marks in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Million Dollar Hotel" was financed in Germany, but Wenders shot it in
English in Los Angeles. It is based on a story co-written by Irish rock star
Bono, and stars the Hollywood powerhouse Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference after the film's first screening, Wenders expressed his
delight at returning to Berlin and the newly rebuilt Potsdamer Platz, where he
shot one of his first successful films, "Wings of Desire," 15 years ago when the
square was still a no man's land in the shadow of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   "It'd be an honor for any director on the planet to be here, but for me it's
highly emotional," he said. "I never would have dreamed it."
</P>
<P>
	   His is one of three German movies among 21 in competition at the festival.
But it's the six Hollywood juggernauts, including "The Beach" and "The Talented
Mr. Ripley," that attract the most attention, with their posters plastered all
around the theaters where the festival is being held.
</P>
<P>
	   German President Johannes Rau spoke out for "cultural variety" and warned
that allowing big studios with deep pockets -- namely Hollywood -- to gain too
much market power could lead to a "leveling of cultural traditions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish that German films in the coming year contribute strongly to this
variety -- perhaps a little more strongly," Rau said in remarks prepared for his
opening night address.
</P>
<P>
	   Culture Minister Michael Naumann told German radio earlier that the problem
with German and European films lies not with quality, but with marketing and
distribution. If European distributors spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
advertising their films, he said, those films also would be big hits.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted the recent listing in Frankfurt of German production companies, and
said film distributors should make more money available to German filmmakers "to
be able to compete with their high-financed American competitors."
</P>
<P>
	   By Hollywood standards, Wenders' film was made for next-to-nothing: less
than $20 million. To save money, it was done entirely on digital video, which
Wenders noted also made it easier and cheaper to add special effects, such as
lighting up the neon sign on the roof of the decrepit hotel. The finished
product was then transferred to film.
</P>
<P>
	   Having the lead singer of a popular band like U2 as co-author also goes a
long way toward generating free publicity. Wenders may have been sitting center
stage at his post-screening news conference, but most of the questions from the
world media were directed at Bono, who also provided the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   Wenders also talked Bono into doing a brief cameo in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still flinch when I see it," Bono said, squinting from behind his
trademark bug-eye sunglasses. "It's one of those awful 'There's the rock star in
his movie' moments for me."

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Drug for Painful Bowels  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of women who suffer irritable bowel syndrome won
a new treatment Wednesday that promises some relief for their diarrhea and pain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved Lotronex, the first new therapy in
years for the mysterious intestinal disorder. The FDA cautions that the drug
offers modest help and is not a cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, involves chronic or recurrent abdominal
pain, the sudden and urgent need to go to the bathroom, and frequent diarrhea or
constipation. It affects up to 15 percent of the U.S. population, and is three
times more common in women than men.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex, known chemically as alosetron, is only for women who have
diarrhea-prone IBS. Studies so far show no effect in men, or in women whose IBS
is more prone to constipation than diarrhea, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex seems to work by blocking certain neurologic receptors that line
the intestine, explained Dr. Victor Raczowski, FDA's deputy chief of
gastrointestinal drugs. Those receptors affect pain sensations, fluid secretions
and how rapidly waste moves through the intestines. By blocking those receptors,
Lotronex theoretically offers a three-pronged attack against the pain and
diarrhea of IBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In clinical trials involving 1,200 women, Lotronex had "a modest but real
effect," Raczowski said. Of every 100 patients using it, about 10 to 15 got
relief from abdominal pain and diarrhea, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But even that modest effect is important because there are few other drugs
that treat IBS and the illness can severely disrupt people's lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The main side effect was constipation, affecting about 28 percent of
Lotronex users. Some had constipation so severe they had to quit taking
Lotronex, while others took fiber or laxatives, or temporarily stopped the drug
until their constipation was relieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lotronex does pose one serious concern, Raczowski said: Four patients have
developed ischemic colitis, a potentially lifethreatening inflammation of the
large intestine. All four recovered when they quit taking the drug, and the FDA
cannot prove Lotronex caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FDA is warning patients that if they suffer sudden worsening of
abdominal pain or see any blood in their bowel movements, they immediately
should stop taking Lotronex and call a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors must be alert to possible colitis cases and report any to the
government at 1-888-INFO-FDA, Raczowski said. Manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome Inc.
has promised to clear up just how big this risk by studying several thousand
more patients once Lotronex hits the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients take one tablet twice a day. The prescription-only drug will be on
pharmacy shelves by mid-March and will cost $1.98 a tablet, Glaxo said.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Slightly Lower Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower at the start of trading today as
interest rate worries once again weighed on blue-chip stocks, preventing
investors from doing much bargain-hunting in the wake of Wednesday's sharp
selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 13.34 at 10,685.82.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were marginally lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 1.23 at 1,410.48, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 0.82 at
4,362.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks were held lower by persistent worries that the Federal Reserve will
continue raising interest rates later this year in its effort to cool the
economy enough to ward off inflation. Four modest increases since last June have
done little to slow the pace of U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that technology companies are growing quickly enough to
continue expanding their profits even if rates are sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Johnson &AMP; Johnson fell 1 to 79 and Merck fell 1 13/16 to 69 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, MCI WorldCom rose 1 1/8 to 49 1/4. The company reported today
that fourth-quarter profits nearly tripled from the final quarter of 1998. MCI
WorldCom cited strong growth in its Internet and data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.94 million shares, behind Wednesday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 0.15 at 536.15.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.6 percent.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as interest rate worries once again
weighed on blue-chip stocks, preventing investors from doing much
bargain-hunting following Wednesday's sharp selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 31.95 at 10,667.21.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was

</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Dow fell 258.44 in broad-based selling, closing below
10,700 for the first time since mid-November. Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., said that drop could have prompted some
selling that will make it difficult for the Dow to recover ground.
</P>
<P>
	   As it has done for several months, the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow today.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as interest rate worries once again
weighed on blue-chip stocks, preventing investors from doing much
bargain-hunting following Wednesday's sharp selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
7.75 at 10,691.41.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
2.55 at 1,414.26 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 52.34 at 4,415.58.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks were held lower by persistent worries that the Federal
Reserve will continue raising interest rates later this year in its effort to
cool the economy enough to ward off inflation. Four modest increases since last
June have done little to slow the pace of U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that technology companies are growing quickly enough to
continue expanding their profits even if rates are sharply higher. Today,
Caterpillar fell 15/16 to 38 3/16, and Merck fell 1 15/16 to 69 7/16, leading
the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Dow fell 258.44 in broad-based selling, closing below
10,700 for the first time since mid-November. Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., said that drop could have prompted some
selling that will make it difficult for the Dow to recover ground.
</P>
<P>
	   As it has done for several months, the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow today.
</P>
<P>
	   "The (Dow's) recent weakness has gone nearly unnoticed thanks to the run in
technology and growth stocks over the past two to three weeks," Belski said.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom rose 2 13/16 to 50 15/16. The company reported today that
fourth-quarter profits nearly tripled from the final quarter of 1998 due to
strong growth in its Internet and data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Dell Computer rose 1 13/16 to 37 3/8. The company, considered a
bellwether for the technology industry, was scheduled to release its latest
earnings report after the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 466.80 million shares, compared with 497.83
million at the same time Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Jaclyn Smith Ditches Victim Role  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Jaclyn Smith isn't the beautiful damsel in
distress in her newest television movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Well, she's still gorgeous more than 20 years after chasing the bad guys in
a bikini on "Charlie's Angels," but Smith departs from her usual role as victim
in "Navigating the Heart," premiering Monday at 9 p.m. EST on Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm usually murdering somebody or being raped or having a disease of the
week, so to go to work and laugh and fall in love and get angry for funny
reasons at this person was really fun," Smith said in a soft Texas twang that
belies her decades in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   The romantic comedy pairs her with Tim Matheson in the story of a
hard-charging Manhattan magazine writer who spars with a local fisherman when
she visits British Columbia for a story on salmon fishing.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith gulped pills for seasickness during the hours spent filming in boats
during the Vancouver shoot.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I'd come in at night, I was still rocking, and when that stopped I
missed it," she said. "Sometime I'd be on one boat and the camera would be on
the other boat and I really felt I was in my own world."
</P>
<P>
	   Less comforting were the scenes of Matheson gutting salmon, a slippery skill
Smith also had to master.
</P>
<P>
	   And at one point, her character leans overboard to vomit, a performance
perhaps not so hard for her to master.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were real fish, real smells, real sounds," she said, smiling. "Those
fish are heavy, they're big. It was hard."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith plays Edith Iglauer, whose autobiography "Fishing With John" is the
movie's basis. Sent to Canada to write a fluff piece on the high price of fish,
Edith discovers that the fishermen's threatened way of life is the real story.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their combativeness, Edith and John (Matheson) fall in love, forcing
Edith to choose between her high-profile career or sharing a quiet life in the
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Life is all the sweeter to share it with someone, and that's what this is,"
she said, relaxing in a bamboo chair in the Zen garden of an exotic tea emporium
in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, an admitted sucker for love stories, faces a similar dilemma in her
own life.
</P>
<P>
	   She's been married for two years to Bradley Allen, a heart surgeon in
Chicago. The couple spends weekends together, taking turns flying to see each
other. Smith remains in Los Angeles during the week with her 17-year-old son and
14-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes I just want to pack us all up and move to Chicago, but I'm
thinking about two other people and their dad is here, so it gets very complex,"
she said. "There's this constant pull about different things."
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith isn't ready to retire at 54.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a better person and more interesting by having my career," she said. "I
sometimes say when I go do a movie it's a vacation in a sense. Running a house
and a family, you're superwoman. My career sort of refuels me and stimulates
me."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith looks back fondly on her "Charlie's Angels" days a quarter-century
ago, despite the show being lambasted by critics as "jiggle" television.
</P>
<P>
	   "They just couldn't take it for what it was. We didn't pretend to be doing
Shakespeare," she said. "From the public, we were very loved."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said scheduling conflicts will keep the original cast from appearing
in this summer's "Charlie's Angels" movie with Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and
Lucy Liu.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of think it's best we leave it alone and let them have their hand,"
she said. "We always got the bad guy, but it was amazing how we did. Maybe
they'll base theirs more on reality."
</P>

	   'FRASIER': It's back-to-back sessions with Dr. Crane tonight on NBC. At 9
p.m. EST, Frasier drags his dad to the opera for a Valentine's outing -- where
some new acquaintances mistakenly think Martin is gay. Then, at 9:30 p.m.,
Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) blithely thinks he's found the perfect love match in
Mia (guest star Rita Wilson of "Runaway Bride") -- who stuns Niles (David Hyde
Pierce) and Martin (John Mahoney) when they recognize her as a virtual clone of
Frasier's late mother.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Business Week's online edition reported that Seagram may be put up for sale.
Also, the company reported earnings of $1.27 per share in its fiscal second
quarter, reversing a loss of 63 cents per share in the second quarter of 1998,
when Seagram was working to integrate the Polygram music company into its
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The frozen yogurt company will be purchased by Capricorn Investors in a
stock deal worth about $140 million. An affiliate of Capricorn is the principal
shareholder of Mrs. Fields' Holdings, the cookie company.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurance company missed analysts' fourth-quarter earnings expectations,
citing higher levels of terminated business in the group disability line, slower
new sales and higher claim costs. Several Wall Street brokerages cut their
ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's stock market officials confirmed that the company will replace
Mannesmann AG on the Xetra DAX 30 blue-chip index as of Monday. Mannesmann is
being acquired by Vodafone Airtouch PLC. Epcos supplies electronic components.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter earnings nearly tripled to 42 cents a share, from 15 cents
per share in the fourth quarter of 1998. Analysts had expected earnings of 41
cents per share. The company said its Internet and international businesses
helped boost profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The company signed an agreement with Sichuan Province Broadcasting and
Television Bureau to develop a broadband Internet network. Chinese technology
companies have thrived in the months since the Chinese government said it would
allow foreign investment in Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   A hepatitis C drug that Enzon has developed with Schering-Plough Corp. will
receive a standard review from the U.S. Food &AMP; Drug Administration instead of
the expedited review the companies had requested. Standard review takes about a
year, whereas expedited review generally takes six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug discovery company completed a protein interaction map for an entire
genome. CuraGen said the map will help scientists map the way proteins interact,
first in testing of fruit flies and ultimately in humans.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Test Blood Clot Zapper  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Doctors trying to stop a stroke in its tracks are
developing some entirely new approaches that use lasers and other gadgets to
blast, smash or grab blood clots lodged deep inside the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology is still in its infancy, and the first report on one of these
devices -- a laser beam on the tip of skinny, flexible tube -- was made Thursday
at a conference in New Orleans of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Strokes are the nation's No. 3 killer, after heart attacks and cancer. They
are also among the most frustrating of diseases because there is so little
doctors can do for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Most strokes occur when a blood clot gets stuck in one of the brain's
arteries, choking off the blood supply. Unless it can be dislodged within six
hours or so, a section of brain dies, causing paralysis and other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clot-dissolving drugs can stop strokes if given quickly enough, but the
therapy can also trigger bleeding in the brain, so doctors are often reluctant
to offer it. Other recent attempts at developing stroke medicines have been
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
	   Now experts say at least a dozen companies are developing devices intended
to physically remove or destroy these clots. The first results were reported by
Dr. Wayne M. Clark of the Oregon Stroke Center in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark tested a laser developed by TaLIS Inc. of Coon Rapids, Minn. The
results demonstrate both the difficulties and the promise of this approach.
</P>
<P>
	   The arteries inside the head are very narrow and kinked with hairpin turns.
Just reaching them without causing damage is a technological feat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark's team so far has used the laser on five patients with strokes in the
middle cerebral arteries or their branches. In two cases, the laser never
reached the clot. In one case, it partially obliterated the clot, while in
another it destroyed the clot.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in the most recent case, one of the steps in the treatment poked a
hole in the clogged artery, triggering bleeding in the 79-year-old woman's
brain. The patient died, although it is unclear whether the laser or the stroke
itself was to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   In the one success, Clark said, a 78-year-old woman came to the hospital
unable to talk and paralyzed on her left side. She "went from a huge stroke to,
three months later, living alone and taking care of herself. But it's just one
case, and maybe the clot would have dissolved by itself."
</P>
<P>
	   The program has been suspended temporarily while doctors investigate the
death. Eventually, they hope to do 12 procedures, then assess whether the
technology is worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
	   "An adverse event would not necessarily mean they should abandon the effort.
But it means they have to figure out what went wrong," said Dr. Lynn A. Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   TaLSIS's president, Charles Hadley, said the laser was developed more than a
decade ago at Massachusetts General Hospital to remove red birthmarks. Because
the laser is absorbed only by red material, doctors looked into the possibility
of using it to blast the blood clots that trigger heart attacks, but that work
was eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   The laser is threaded into the brain through a liquid-filled catheter that
is one millimeter thick. Doctors use X-rays to follow its progress.
</P>
<P>
	   To work, the laser must get within a centimeter of the clot. It takes a
minute or two of laser blasting to destroy it. In theory, the artery walls
should not be harmed because they are white, not red, and so will not absorb the
laser energy.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one other company, EndoVasix of Belmont, Calif., is also testing a
laser on stroke patients. Stephen Johnson, the chief financial officer, said the
company hopes to have results by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Employing an altogether different approach, Possis Medical Inc. of
Minneapolis has developed a catheter designed to suck blood clots out of the
brain. The device fires a high-speed water jet away from the clot. This create a
vacuum that draws the clot into the catheter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can get into the upper reaches of the middle cerebral artery," said
Eapen Chacko, a Possis spokesman. "We think we can do that and evacuate the
clot."
</P>
<P>
	   Testing of the approach is set to begin in March at six medical centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other devices in the works could obliterate clots with sound waves or grab
them with a variety of mechanical claws and haul them out. Still another
approach is to try to put oxygen into the brain to compensate for the blocked
blood flow.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides potentially being less likely to trigger bleeding, these mechanical
devices may also work faster than clot-dissolving drugs, which take an hour or
two to break up a clot.
</P>
<P>
	   "The idea is, the quicker you get it removed, the better," Clark said. Using
a laser, "it takes seconds vs. hours."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as interest rate worries once again
weighed on blue-chip stocks, preventing investors from doing much
bargain-hunting following Wednesday's sharp selloff. Technology stocks were
mostly higher.

164 7/16. No new attacks were reported, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
was continuing its probe of the Internet vandalism.

<HEADLINE> Court bars Listerine competitor from using BreathAsure name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The first ruling in a dispute between the makers of
products aimed at bad breath left a sour taste in the mouths of both sides.
<P>
	   Breath Asure Inc., a small California company that markets what it called an
"internal breath freshener" capsule, was barred from making that claim or even
saying that the product works.
</P>
<P>
	   That failed to completely satisfy Warner-Lambert Co., the
multibillion-dollar Morris Plains company whose breath products include
Listerine mouthwash, Certs mints and Clorets and Dentyne gums.
</P>
<P>
	   So Warner-Lambert appealed, and won an order barring its competitor from
calling its product BreathAsure.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Warner-Lambert was likely to be
harmed by the continued use of that product name.
</P>
<P>
	   "The name falsely tells the consumer that he or she has assurance of fresher
breath when ingesting one of the defendant's capsules. That is not true," a
three-judge circuit panel ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages seeking comment from Breath Asure, of Calabasas, Calif., and its
lawyer were not immediately returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D became widely known in the mid-1990s through
an "aggressive" national advertising campaign that featured radio personality
Howard Stern and actor George Kennedy, said Warner-Lambert lawyer Thomas C.
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "Negligible" sales in 1992 and 1993 grew to $29 million by 1996 on the
strength of that campaign, Morrison said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That figure is dwarfed by the Warner-Lambert products, among the top sellers
in their categories. In 1999, Listerine had worldwide sales of $487 million;
Certs $127 million; Clorets $193 million, and Dentyne $158 million, company
spokesman Jason Ford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert produced evidence during a trial here in 1998 that forced
Breath Asure to accept limits on what claims its advertising could make.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau investigated
the advertising and found claims that BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D were
effective breath fresheners were not supported by any reliable scientific
evidence, the appellate court noted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Accordingly, it recommended that defendant discontinue or substantially
modify its ads for its breath fresheners," the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   At trial, Breath Asure agreed not to say its product provides users with
clean breath, cleans bad breath for hours, works with the digestive system, is
"America's number one selling breath freshener," and over a dozen other
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence established that bad breath originates in the mouth, not in the
stomach, the court said, upholding Warner-Lambert's assertion that "effective
breath freshening products must either mask offensive oral odors, or attack
bacteria in the mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell, who heard the weeklong non-jury trial,
declined to bar the product name, however, finding that Breath Asure's products
appear to be bought as a complement to Warner-Lambert products, not a
substitute, "thereby lessening any injury to (Warner-Lambert)."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, which was not seeking monetary damages, appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought once the advertising was enjoined, the name should be enjoined,
because the very name of the product conveys the same message as the
advertising," Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3rd Circuit agreed: "Although BreathAsure's ads never mentioned
Warner-Lambert's products by name, they implicitly told consumers to stop
"masking" bad breath with plaintiff's products and start "attacking it at its
source."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert this week agreed to be bought by Pfizer Inc. $90 billion in a
deal that creates the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure's Effects Last  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- High blood pressure in middle age sharply raises the
risk of strokes later in life, even in people who have brought their pressure
under control, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have long known that high blood pressure is the single most mportant
cause of strokes, which hit more than 600,000 Americans annually. However,
doctors traditionally consider only a person's current blood pressure -- not
past readings -- when judging whether their risk is higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   A new study found that a history of high blood pressure is a powerful
predictor of stroke risk, no matter where a person's blood pressure now stands.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings are from the 50-year-long Framingham Heart Study in the Boston
suburbs. They were presented Thursday by Dr. Sudha Seshadri of Boston University
Medical School at a meeting in New Orleans of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just the blood pressure you have now," she said. "It's the blood
pressure you had in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Her study was based on a review of 5,197 study participants, including 367
who had suffered strokes. The researchers looked at current blood pressure, as
well as blood pressure decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   A standard blood pressure reading is given as systolic pressure over
diastolic pressure. Systolic, the larger of the two numbers, should ideally be
below 120, while the diastolic number should be under 80.
</P>
<P>
	   The Framingham researchers found that a 20-point elevation in systolic
pressure when people are in their 60s raises their stroke risk by 50 percent
after they reach age 70. A 20-point elevation during the 50s raises the risk 40
percent later on.
</P>
<P>
	   An increased risk persists even if people bring down their blood pressure in
old age, though the risk is lower than if hypertension is left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study is important, because it shows that a risk factor is in effect
over a lifetime. The longer you have it, the greater its effect," said Dr. Ralph
Sacco of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Another study by Dr. George W. Petty of the Mayo Clinic shows the importance
of leaky and deformed heart valves in triggering strokes. The researchers
followed more than 700 people who had problems with their aortic or mitral
valves, the two main valves that control blood flow on the left side of the
heart.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that severe mitral valve narrowing was an especially important
risk. People with this condition were nearly four times more likely than usual
to suffer full-blown strokes or ominous mini-strokes.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol-Brain Cell Lind Found  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A single drinking binge by a pregnant woman can be enough
to permanently damage the brain of her unborn child, according to a new study of
the effects of alcohol on babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although experiments in the study were conducted on laboratory rats, experts
said the findings offer an explanation of why children born to drinking mothers
can suffer learning disabilities and other brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   The study indicates that rats, and presumably humans, are most susceptible
to alcohol-related neurological damage during a period when developing brain
cells are furiously building the connections needed for memory, learning and
thought. In humans, this brain growth spurt starts in the sixth month of
gestation and continues for two years after birth. In rats, it comes in the two
weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   "We call this a brain growth spurt period," said Dr. John W. Olney, a
Washington University School of Medicine researcher and senior author of the
study appearing Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
	   During this brain growth spurt, said Olney, a single prolonged contact with
alcohol -- lasting for four hours or more -- is enough to kill vast numbers of
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a massive wave of cell suicide after the brain is exposed to
ethanol (alcohol)," said Olney. "The cells die by the millions and millions."
</P>
<P>
	   During the brain growth spurt, called synaptogenesis, brain cells must
receive a balanced signal from two types of neurotransmitter chemicals,
glutamate and GABA, he said. If this signal is disrupted, the developing brain
cells are programmed to commit suicide. This is the body's way of eliminating
surplus cells.
</P>
<P>
	   But, based on the rat studies, alcohol severely disrupts the glutamate-GABA
signals and this, in turn, causes nerve cell suicide at about 15 times the
normal rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neurons cells that normally die during brain development are about 1.5
percent of the total, but in rat pups exposed to alcohol just days after birth,
said Olney, the dead neurons ranged from 5 to 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our study showed that it only requires one round of intoxication of about
four hours for this to occur," said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   The "binge" to which the rats gave the rodents a blood alcohol level of .20,
or 200 milligrams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. Such a level in people is
twice the legal standard of drunkenness in many states.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David Lovinger of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine said in
Science that the study carries a powerful message: Drinking in late pregnancy
"is really unsafe for the brain."
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 study by the Institute of Medicine showed that about 20 percent of
women who drink do not stop during pregnancy. About one in every 1,000 babies
born in the United States suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, a disorder caused
by exposure to alcohol in the womb. The disorder can cause stunted growth, along
with memory and learning problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Olney said pregnant women need not be anxious about past, moderate alcohol
drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "One glass of wine at dinner is unlikely to cause the damage, but we cannot
say that any added intake would be safe," he said. "The most prudent policy
would be to have no alcohol during pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
	   The connection between brain cell death and disruption of the glutamate-GABA
signals also prompts concern about common drugs used on children, said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   Most anesthesia drugs in pediatric surgery, he said, disrupt either
glutamate or GABA in the brain. This means that surgery using these drugs might
increase the risk of brain damage for children under the age of two.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be important to carefully reevaluate how these drugs are used in
pediatric medicine," said Olney. He suggested the need for studies to establish
safety guidelines for use of these drugs on young children.
</P>
<P>
	   University of Colorado Health Sciences researcher Boris Tabakoff agreed on
the need to evaluate the anesthesia drugs used in young children.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this study is correct," Tabakoff said in Science, "one might need to
reassess their safety in (infants) while the brain is still developing."

	   Greenspan Eyes Derivative Exemption
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
urged Congress to act quickly to exempt from regulation the $80
trillion market in so-called over-the-counter derivatives. Legal
uncertainty, he said, is posing ``unacceptable risks to the
country's financial system.'' Derivatives are financial instruments
whose value depends on the value or change in value of an
underlying security, commodity or asset. They are used by
businesses to guard against losses from unexpected market movements
but also by high-risk investment funds to speculate, and played a
key role in the near-collapse in September 1998 of hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management, which sent shock waves through world
financial markets.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson is taking its adhesive bandage
high-tech, using material normally found in hospitals or doctors'
offices. The Band-Aid Brand Advanced Healing Strip promises to heal
wounds fast and eliminates the formation of scabs, which can cause
scaring. But the new product is likely to give consumers sticker
shock. At $3.79 for a box of 10, it will be at least eight times
more expensive than normal adhesive bandages. J&AMP;J officials
unveiled the new strip today in New York. They said the new brand,

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines introduced a new class of
business fares on today that are 40 percent cheaper than
unrestricted full coach walk-up fares, hoping to attract travelers
who don't want to build a Saturday night stay into the trip to save
money. BizFlex fares require a roundtrip purchase at least 10 days
in advance and a one night minimum stay. They are nonrefundable and
subject to a $75 change fee and can be purchased through travel
agents, at Northwest ticket offices or on the company's Web site.
Under the BizFlex fare schedule, a roundtrip flight between
Minneapolis and Omaha is $392, compared with the full coach fare of
$654; the fare between Detroit and Boston is $628, compared with
full coach fare of $1,046, and the Memphis-Portland, Ore. BizFlex
fare is $1,050, compared with $1,750 for full coach.

by 27,000 to 301,000 last week. That's the highest level since Jan.

officials blamed a portion of the rise on recent snows that buried
the East and parts of the South, resulting in the loss of some
jobs, but they had no specific information. However, some
economists had been predicting claims would rise as people dug out
from the snow and made it into unemployment offices to file claims.
The four-week moving average fell 2,500 to 276,250, the lowest
level since Dec. 15, 1973, when claims were at 256,750.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Earns $69M in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co. on Thursday reported higher earnings in the
fourth quarter and credited strong performances in its agricultural and
pharmaceutical businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto, which is preparing to merge with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said net
income totaled $69 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of $603
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. The 1998 loss reflected restructuring
charges and research project costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding restructuring costs and other special items, earnings for the
October-December period totaled $115 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
$27 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The results matched the 18 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $2.34 billion, up 35 percent from $1.73 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   In early afternoon, Monsanto's shares were trading at $41.81 1/4, down 43
3/4 cents or about 1 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, based in St. Louis, said the higher earnings were the result of
continued strength of its arthritis drug Celebrex, growth in Roundup herbicide
sales and a 48 percent increase in acreage using Monsanto's bioengineered crops.
The company also was able to reduce its debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto's merger with Pharmacia is expected to close during the first half
of the year. The merged company will be known as Pharmacia Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Monsanto earned $575 million, or 88 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $250 million, or 41 cents per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, income was $650 million, or $1 a share, in 1999,
compared with $580 million, or 93 cents a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $9.15 billion, up 26 percent from $7.24 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Annan Meets With Thailand Premier  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID THURBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met today with
Thailand's prime minister ahead of a major U.N. conference that he said should
launch a new debate on how world trade can be made both free and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from 180 nations and international organizations will begin a week
of meetings of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first major trade forum since World Trade Organization talks
collapsed in Seattle two months ago because of deep divisions over trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the WTO, which sets world trade rules, say rich countries have
benefited far more than poor countries from current free trade agreements and
that workers have often lost job security.
</P>
<P>
	   Poorer countries hope their voices can be heard "clearly and fairly" at the
conference meetings, Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said after the talks
between Annan and Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai at Bangkok's Government House.
</P>
<P>
	   "The enthusiasm and expectations for this forum are unprecedentedly high,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan said it would be an "all-important" conference in setting the
direction of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The WTO conference in Seattle failed to reach agreement on a new trade round
and ended in acrimony, with activists fighting police in the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference, which meets every four years and focuses on promoting trade
as a tool of development, is not designed to come up with any binding
agreements, but offers a chance for developing countries to press for a greater
say in global trade arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, the 135-nation WTO is widely perceived to be controlled by rich
countries. Some African countries were so upset in December by being excluded
from key negotiating sessions in Seattle that they threatened to walk out.
</P>
<P>
	   Surin said the chance to build a consensus on the need for "fairness and
equal treatment" for poor countries in itself represented a "powerful moral
force" in setting trade policy.
</P>
<P>
	   In an address to parliamentarians from 50 countries gathered in the Thai
capital, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will serve as the
WTO's director general in 2002, said the international community must act
quickly to ensure that poor countries benefit from globalization rather than
being marginalized.
</P>
<P>
	   "A backlash against the process of globalization has been gaining momentum,"
he said, citing the Seattle riots and unrest during a recent World Economic
Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the legislators said world trade rules must be changed to take into
account the situation and opinions of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Globalization will force us to do something to open our country, but we
can't open up without knowing why, what are the conditions," said Ba Mamadou, an
opposition lawmaker from Guinea. "We want to make sure we are involved in
planning."
</P>
<P>
	   As Annan met with Chuan, hundreds of Thai villagers rallied outside
Government House to demand compensation for land lost to a dam project in
northeastern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   They are part of Thailand's Forum of the Poor, which campaigns for the
rights of rural Thais who say their lives have been ruined by major
infrastructure projects in the country's headlong rush into development.

<HEADLINE> Pulitzer Prize winner just a stinker to FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - His colleagues honored Murray Kempton with a Pulitzer
Prize for his "witty and insightful" newspaper columns. To J. Edgar Hoover and
the FBI, though, Kempton was merely "a real stinker" - with the "real"
underlined for emphasis.
<P>
	   Kempton, the acclaimed New York writer, was also maligned as a "rat" and a
"snake" in his 194-page confidential FBI file. The file was obtained by the Web
site APBNews.com, which monitors law enforcement news, through a Freedom of
Information request.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, a one-time member of the Young Communist League, was monitored by
the FBI from the early 1950s through 1969 - the year he help raise funds for the
Black Panther Party. Kempton later wrote a book, "The Briar Patch," about the
trial of several Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who died in 1997, had requested his file and reviewed it in 1989.
In a column that year, Kempton said the FBI's surveillance had zero impact on
his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "My malice toward Hoover, which was always small, and his malice toward me,
which seems to have been outsized, were alike inconsequential for help or harm,"
Kempton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   So why the extensive Kempton file?
</P>
<P>
	   Well, according to one FBI memo, Kempton "has belittled Bureau and Director
(Hoover) in columns." Another memo complained that Kempton "has taken a
forthright stand for the right of dissent in general and for the rights of
communists in particular."
</P>
<P>
	   At the bottom of a third memo, there was a hand-written notation: "He is a
real stinker."
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who rode a bicycle to his assignments, smoked a ubiquitous pipe and
loved jazz, aggravated Hoover and many others in a 55-year career that included
stints at the New York Post and Newsday. It was at the latter that he won his
Pulitzer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau didn't share that appreciation of Kempton's work.
</P>
<P>
	   "When a newspaper hires a snake like Kempton they can expect the worst,"
said one memo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am surprised that Scripps-Howard are taking on this rat," the same memo
said later, referring to Kempton's hiring by the New York World Telegram and
Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton was also placed on the FBI's "Do Not Contact" list, which provided
the names of people who would not help the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   In the file's twisted highlight, the FBI recorded a 1962 speech by Kempton
to a group called the Citizens for Constitutional Liberties. According to the
file, Kempton said "he regretted to say that he lives in a country where his
speech ... was being transcribed."
</P>
<P>
	   Word for word, as it turns out.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as interest rate worries once again
weighed on blue-chip stocks, preventing investors from doing much
bargain-hunting following Wednesday's sharp selloff. Technology stocks were
mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 57.08 at 10,642.08.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.46 at 1,408.25 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 60.33 at 4,423.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks were held lower by persistent worries that the Federal
Reserve will continue raising interest rates later this year in its effort to
cool the economy enough to ward off inflation. Four modest increases since last
June have done little to slow U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that technology companies are growing quickly enough to
continue expanding their profits even if rates are sharply higher. Today, Merck
fell 2 7/8 to 68 1/2, and 3M fell 1 11/16 to 85 15/16, leading the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Dow fell 258.44 in broad-based selling, closing below
10,700 for the first time since mid-November. Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., said that drop could have prompted some
selling that will make it difficult for the Dow to recover ground.
</P>
<P>
	   As it has done for several months, the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow today.
</P>
<P>
	   "The (Dow's) recent weakness has gone nearly unnoticed thanks to the run in
technology and growth stocks over the past two to three weeks," Belski said.
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom rose 1 1/2 to 49 5/8. The company reported today fourth-quarter
profits nearly tripled from the final quarter of 1998 due to strong growth in
its Internet and data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Dell Computer rose 2 1/2 to 38 1/16. The company, considered a
bellwether for the technology industry, was scheduled to release its latest
earnings report after the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet stocks were mostly lower a day after hackers disrupted several
popular Web sites. Amazon.com fell 4 3/8 to 75 7/8, and online auctioneer eBay
fell 1 7/8 to 162 1/8. No new attacks were reported, and the FBI was continuing
its probe of the Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   The market was little affected by the Labor Department's latest weekly
report on jobless claims, which showed the number of Americans filing new claims
for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in a month.
Analysts said the four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out
week-to-week volatility, fell sharply to the lowest level since Dec. 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. Breadth was better on the Nasdaq, where 10 stocks rose for every
nine that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 833.78 million shares, compared with 837.68 million at
the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.15 at 538.15.

<HEADLINE> Back Pain Hits Opera Singer Terfel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Severe back pain has forced Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel
to withdraw from his final four performances as the Four Villains in Offenbach's
"The Tales of Hoffmann" at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
	   Terfel, whose huge voice and riveting stage presence have made him one of
the most popular opera stars, has flown to London for treatment, Met General
Manager Joseph Volpe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian baritone John Fanning sang the Four Villains -- in the opera's
prologue and each of the three tales -- on Feb. 8 and will sing them in the Feb.
12 matinee, which will be broadcast live on the radio, and on Feb. 15 and 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Terfel has been hampered by back problems before. In 1994, he had to cancel
some Met performances as Leporello in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and later
underwent back surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Last season Terfel sang the title role in Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro"
in a new Met production by Jonathan Miller. He was part of a cast The Associated
Press review called "as close to perfection as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Fanning made his Met debut last season as Monterone, who pronounces the Act
1 curse in Verdi's "Rigoletto."

<HEADLINE> Alcohol-Brain Cell Link Found  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A single drinking binge by a pregnant woman can be enough
to permanently damage the brain of her unborn child, according to a new study of
the effects of alcohol on babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although experiments in the study were conducted on laboratory rats, experts
said the findings offer an explanation of why children born to drinking mothers
can suffer learning disabilities and other brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   The study indicates that rats, and presumably humans, are most susceptible
to alcohol-related neurological damage during a period when developing brain
cells are furiously building the connections needed for memory, learning and
thought. In humans, this brain growth spurt starts in the sixth month of
gestation and continues for two years after birth. In rats, it comes in the two
weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   "We call this a brain growth spurt period," said Dr. John W. Olney, a
Washington University School of Medicine researcher and senior author of the
study appearing Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
	   During this brain growth spurt, said Olney, a single prolonged contact with
alcohol -- lasting for four hours or more -- is enough to kill vast numbers of
brain cells.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a massive wave of cell suicide after the brain is exposed to
ethanol (alcohol)," said Olney. "The cells die by the millions and millions."
</P>
<P>
	   During the brain growth spurt, called synaptogenesis, brain cells must
receive a balanced signal from two types of neurotransmitter chemicals,
glutamate and GABA, he said. If this signal is disrupted, the developing brain
cells are programmed to commit suicide. This is the body's way of eliminating
surplus cells.
</P>
<P>
	   But, based on the rat studies, alcohol severely disrupts the glutamate-GABA
signals and this, in turn, causes nerve cell suicide at about 15 times the
normal rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neuron cells that normally die during brain development are about 1.5
percent of the total, but in rat pups exposed to alcohol just days after birth,
said Olney, the dead neurons ranged from 5 to 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our study showed that it only requires one round of intoxication of about
four hours for this to occur," said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   The "binge" used in the study gave the rats a blood alcohol level of .20, or
200 milligrams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. Such a level in people is
twice the legal standard of drunkenness in many states.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David Lovinger of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine said in
Science that the study carries a powerful message: Drinking in late pregnancy
"is really unsafe for the brain."
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 study by the Institute of Medicine showed that about 20 percent of
women who drink do not stop during pregnancy. About one in every 1,000 babies
born in the United States suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, a disorder caused
by exposure to alcohol in the womb. The disorder can cause stunted growth, along
with memory and learning problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Olney said pregnant women need not be anxious about past, moderate alcohol
drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "One glass of wine at dinner is unlikely to cause the damage, but we cannot
say that any added intake would be safe," he said. "The most prudent policy
would be to have no alcohol during pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
	   The connection between brain cell death and disruption of the glutamate-GABA
signals also prompts concern about common drugs used on children, said Olney.
</P>
<P>
	   Most anesthesia drugs in pediatric surgery, he said, disrupt either
glutamate or GABA in the brain. This means that surgery using these drugs might
increase the risk of brain damage for children under the age of two.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be important to carefully reevaluate how these drugs are used in
pediatric medicine," said Olney. He suggested the need for studies to establish
safety guidelines for use of these drugs on young children.
</P>
<P>
	   University of Colorado Health Sciences researcher Boris Tabakoff agreed on
the need to evaluate the anesthesia drugs used in young children.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this study is correct," Tabakoff said in Science, "one might need to
reassess their safety in (infants) while the brain is still developing."

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department said Thursday that all of its
computers with Internet access will be checked to verify that they were not used
as unwitting agents in the massive attacks this week on Internet electronic
commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said there is no evidence to
suggest that Pentagon computers were involved in the attacks, but the hard
drives of the more than 1 million computers with Internet access will be checked
anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just think it's a prudent thing to check,'' said Quigley, noting that
the Defense Department is the largest computer user in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The computers will be checked for the presence of ``distributed denial of
service'' tools like those used in this week's attacks. Hackers can hide these
tools, known as daemons, on hundreds or even thousands of third-party computers
and then trigger them from a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a
single target.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals For Woman's Release  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department pressed China on Thursday for the
immediate release of a prominent Muslim businesswoman from China's Far West who
was arrested shortly before she was to meet with U.S. congressional staff in
August.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are deeply disturbed by her arrest and her long detention without
formal charges, as well as the fact that she was arrested on her way to a
meeting with congressional staff,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the long detention of Rebiya Kadeer, 53, without formal charges is
in violation of China's own criminal procedures law, as well as international
human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin added that U.S. officials see no basis to Chinese allegations that she
has provided state secrets and intelligence to foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   After her arrest Aug. 11 in Xinjiang province, two of her sons and her
secretary were detained as well. One son was released shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed meeting with the congressional staff members was organized
under the auspices of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Program of
the U.S. Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., is seeking support for a resolution demanding the
release of all three detainees. He also is asking that the three be allowed to
settle in the United States if they choose. In the House, Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., also plans a resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadeer's husband lives in the United States and works for the U.S.-sponosred
Radio Free Asia, which has been critical of China's policies toward Uighurs in
Xinjiang, according to a draft of Roth's resolution. It also said her husband is
a former political prisoner in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
	   China has been sharply critical Radio Free Asia, contending its broadcasts
are tendentious and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional aides said Roth is moving ahead quickly because of information
that Kadeer's trial may be imminent. They said Chinese officials have not been
responsive to his requests for information about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese Embassy had no immediate comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that Kadeer's arrest highlights China's
troubled relations with the Uighur ethnic group, of which Kadeer is a member.
The newspaper said she had been officially touted as a rags-to-riches
inspiration for fellow members of her group.
</P>
<P>
	   The son who was detained and released told the Times that his mother was
arrested because she was one of the most patriotic members of the Uighur
community and because his father ``was engaged in counter-revolutionary
activities in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo murder witness has criminal record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Bronx woman who emerged as a key eyewitness in the
trial of four police officers accused of murdering Amadou Diallo has a criminal
record.
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi ordered prosecutors Thursday to
turn over the rap sheet of the witness, Schrrie Elliott, to the defense during a
break in testimony. Defense attorneys could use the information to attack
Elliott's credibility when she returns to the stand Monday in the excessive
force case.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But city records show
that a 32-year-old woman using the names Schrrie Elliott, Scherie Elliot and
Denise Williams has been arrested and convicted for possession and sale of drugs
at least twice between 1990 and 1994, and has served time on Rikers Island and
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled the defense could show the jury portions of two
television news interviews in which Elliott appears to support some details of
the officers' account of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interviews, the witness said that one officer yelled "Gun!" She also
indicates Diallo appeared to be on his feet for most of the shooting - all
proof, the defense says, that the officers fired because they believed Diallo
was an armed threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and
Richard Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered the West
African immigrant by shooting him on his Bronx doorstep at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4,
1999 without cause or warning; 19 bullets hit Diallo. If convicted, they face a
maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott - who had refused
to meet with them - to testify about what she heard while walking home along
Diallo's block that morning. She told jurors someone yelled "Gun!" before
gunfire erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   But the move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed the
officers cornered Diallo in the vestibule of his apartment building and opened
fire without warning. Prodded by prosecutor Donald Levin, she also said the
officers kept shooting the unarmed victim after he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott admitted on the stand Wednesday that she had "had past dealings with
the law." But she did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   After Elliott's damaging testimony, Teresi declared her an adverse witness
and ordered prosecutors to turn over transcripts of her grand jury testimony and
her interview with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, prosecutor Eric Warner argued against providing Elliott's rap
sheet as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "This witness was not called by us," Warner told Teresi. "They may not
impeach this witness as to character."
</P>
<P>
	   Responded Teresi: "This was a defense witness. Her posture has changed.
Credibility is an issue."
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of minorities that an appeals
court moved it to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers - in a search for dangerous criminals - saw
Diallo as a threat because he refused orders to stop, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers' high-powered
pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly up against a
wall, throughout the shooting.

	   Kempton, a one-time member of the Young Communist League, was monitored by
the FBI from the early 1950s through 1969 - the year he help raise funds for the
Black Panther Party. Kempton later wrote a book, "The Briar Patch," about the
trial of several Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who died in 1997, had requested his file and reviewed it in 1989.
In a column that year, Kempton said the FBI's surveillance had zero impact on
his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "My malice toward Hoover, which was always small, and his malice toward me,
which seems to have been outsized, were alike inconsequential for help or harm,"
Kempton wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   So why the extensive Kempton file?
</P>
<P>
	   Well, according to one FBI memo, Kempton "has belittled Bureau and Director
(Hoover) in columns." Another memo complained that Kempton "has taken a
forthright stand for the right of dissent in general and for the rights of
communists in particular."
</P>
<P>
	   At the bottom of a third memo, there was a hand-written notation: "He is a
real stinker."
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton, who rode a bicycle to his assignments, smoked a ubiquitous pipe and
loved jazz, aggravated Hoover and many others in a 55-year career that included
stints at the New York Post and Newsday. It was at the latter that he won his
Pulitzer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau didn't share that appreciation of Kempton's work.
</P>
<P>
	   "When a newspaper hires a snake like Kempton they can expect the worst,"
said one memo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am surprised that Scripps-Howard are taking on this rat," the same memo
said later, referring to Kempton's hiring by the New York World Telegram and
Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   Kempton was also placed on the FBI's "Do Not Contact" list, which provided
the names of people who would not help the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   In the file's twisted highlight, the FBI recorded a 1962 speech by Kempton
to a group called the Citizens for Constitutional Liberties. According to the
file, Kempton said "he regretted to say that he lives in a country where his
speech ... was being transcribed."
</P>
<P>
	   Word for word, as it turns out.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Nevada As Waste Site  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Nevada's heated objections, the Senate directed
Thursday that thousands of tons of nuclear waste be shipped from power plants
nationwide to that state. But the legislation faces a certain presidential veto
that is not expected to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the nuclear waste legislation cleared the Senate by a 64-34 vote,
Nevada's two senators declared victory because they had gotten enough support
against the bill to assure a veto will be sustained if necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This victory puts the brakes on the latest attempts by Republicans to bury
Nevada in nuclear waste,'' declared Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation calls for more than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive used
reactor fuel -- now kept at commercial power plants in 31 states -- to begin to
be shipped to Nevada as early as 2007 if a permanent waste burial site there
receives a federal license. The site is a few miles from where hundreds of
nuclear bomb tests were conducted during the Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, the bill's chief sponsor, had sought
numerous compromises to gain administration support, but failed to budge the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is hard-core politics ... to accommodate my colleagues from Nevada,''
complained Murkowski. He said the administration had promised to take the waste
from the utilities ``and solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a threatened
veto, Murkowski told reporters, ``This bill is dead until we get a new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House has not acted on the matter and may not because a veto is assured.
</P>
<P>
	   While 12 Democrats joined 42 Republicans in support of the legislation, two
defections from the GOP ranks -- Sens. Ben ``Nighthorse'' Campbell of Colorado
and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- were viewed as critical by the Nevada
senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has struggled for six years over what to do with the more than
40,000 tons of highly radioactive used reactor fuel sitting at commercial power
plants. By law, the waste, which will remain radioactive for 10,000 years,
should have been taken by the Energy Department two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the bill said some utilities are running out of storage space
in waste pools and in some cases dry cask containers. And they argue that the
spent fuel rods would be safer kept at a central location instead of at 71
reactor sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House has opposed a requirement to ship waste to Nevada until
after a permanent underground facility is built at Yucca Mountain. To do so
might undermine the development of the permanent site, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The permanent Yucca Mountain facility being proposed 90 miles northwest of
Las Vegas is still under scientific review, but it is scheduled to be opened in
2010 if found to be technically suitable. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
expected to decide whether to give it a license in 2006. The Senate-passed bill
would require shipments to begin a year later, before the permanent facility is
built.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson -- and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota -- also objected to a provision in the bill that they said would
weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to set radiation standards
for the future permanent waste repository.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, the EPA would have to consult with the NRC and the
National Academy of Sciences if it wanted to issue the standards before June 1,
2001. The NRC has suggested less-stringent standards than the EPA is considering
for the Yucca Mountain site.
</P>
<P>
	   Murkowski rejected criticism that the EPA's role was being reduced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The EPA has the final authority on determining radiation standards. Make
no mistake on that,'' he declared. ``The effort is to get the best science.''
</P>
<P>
	   He abandoned a provision that would have required the Energy Department to
assume title of the waste at the power plants. He did so after seven governors
raised concern about the title transfer, fearing it could lead to the waste
staying at the power plants for decades, perhaps permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem, said Murkowski, is ``nobody wants the waste'' but ``if you
throw it up into the air, it's got to come down somewhere.'' He argued that the
Nevada site is a logical place to bury it.

<HEADLINE> Lott PAC Corrects Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fund-raising committee led by Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott has corrected reports to the Federal Election Commission,
acknowledging that erroneous figures were submitted earlier because a bookkeeper
embezzled about $85,000.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dowd, the attorney for Lott's New Republican Majority Fund, said
Thursday that the money was stolen by the bookkeeper last year to support a drug
habit.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the political action committee was not seeking prosecution because
the former employee ``told us the truth, restitution was made and he went into
rehabilitation.'' The individual has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 31, 1999, letter to the FEC, Dowd wrote that committee officers
discovered irregularities in December.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The employee admitted that, since March 1999, he had been misappropriating
committee funds to support a drug addiction and falsifying information to
conceal his activities,'' the letter said. ``The employee was fired. The
employee's family has fully reimbursed the committee for the misappropriated
funds and the employee has entered a drug rehabilitation program.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd wrote that ``the committee has adopted a number of policies and
procedures to strengthen its internal controls to avoid future financial
irregularities of this kind from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fund is a ``leadership PAC,'' which gives money to other candidates and
also has paid for Lott's own travel. It was started in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd said 10 months of corrected reports had to be filed, and he offered to
provide the FEC any additional information.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC officials said they were unaware of past penalties in such cases and
noted that the voluntary notification would be in the PAC's favor. The
commission's major concern is to correct false information in campaign finance
reports.

<HEADLINE> Diallo murder witness has criminal record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Bronx woman who emerged as a key eyewitness in the
trial of four police officers accused of murdering Amadou Diallo has a criminal
record.
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi ordered prosecutors Thursday to
turn over the rap sheet of the witness, Schrrie Elliott, to the defense during a
break in testimony. Defense attorneys could use the information to attack
Elliott's credibility when she returns to the stand Monday in the excessive
force case.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But city records show
that a 32-year-old woman using the names Schrrie Elliott, Scherie Elliot and
Denise Williams has been arrested and convicted for possession and sale of drugs
at least twice between 1990 and 1994, and has served time on Rikers Island and
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled the defense could show the jury portions of two
television news interviews in which Elliott appears to support some details of
the officers' account of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interviews, the witness said that one officer yelled "Gun!" She also
indicates Diallo appeared to be on his feet for most of the shooting - all
proof, the defense says, that the officers fired because they believed Diallo
was an armed threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and
Richard Murphy, 27, have pleaded innocent to charges they murdered the West
African immigrant by shooting him on his Bronx doorstep at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4,
1999 without cause or warning; 19 bullets hit Diallo. If convicted, they face a
maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott - who had refused
to meet with them - to testify about what she heard while walking home along
Diallo's block that morning. She told jurors someone yelled "Gun!" before
gunfire erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   But the move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed the
officers cornered Diallo in the vestibule of his apartment building and opened
fire without warning. Prodded by prosecutor Donald Levin, she also said the
officers kept shooting the unarmed victim after he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott admitted on the stand Wednesday that she had "had past dealings with
the law." But she did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   After Elliott's damaging testimony, Teresi declared her an adverse witness
and ordered prosecutors to turn over transcripts of her grand jury testimony and
her interview with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, prosecutor Eric Warner argued against providing Elliott's rap
sheet as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "This witness was not called by us," Warner told Teresi. "They may not
impeach this witness as to character."
</P>
<P>
	   Responded Teresi: "This was a defense witness. Her posture has changed.
Credibility is an issue."
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of minorities that an appeals
court moved it to Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the officers - in a search for dangerous criminals - saw
Diallo as a threat because he refused orders to stop, then pulled out a black
wallet that appeared to be a gun. It also argues the officers' high-powered
pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet, possibly up against a
wall, throughout the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Elections Held in Gibraltar  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL WOOLLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GIBRALTAR (AP) -- A young lawyer who has overseen Gibraltar's robust
economic growth while cracking down on drug smugglers and fending off Spanish
claims of sovereignty sought re-election Thursday as the British colony's head
of government.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Caruana, a 43-year-old conservative, was ahead of his main rival,
leftist Joe Bossano, in opinion polls in this quaint patch of Britain located at
Spain's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was estimated at about 44 percent, compared to 49 percent in the
last election, held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Caruana, whose title is chief minister, and Bossano, a 61-year-old
former union boss, rule out giving in to Spain's claims to the 2 1/2-square-mile
chunk of limestone that looms over the isthmus that connect the Mediterranean to
the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht, but
now wants it back. Britain says it cannot give up the territory because the
majority of residents oppose joining Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory largely controls its own internal affairs. Britain appoints a
governor and is responsible for defense and foreign affairs. Gibraltar is not
represented in the British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of the four candidates, Peter Cumming, favors any kind of
accommodation with Spain and he was running last in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruana has run for re-election on the island's vibrant economy, which has
virtually no unemployment, thanks in large part to Gibraltar's emergence as a
duty-free tourist mecca and offshore financial center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gibraltar is experiencing a breath of fresh air,'' Caruana said as he cast
his ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bossano, who served two terms as chief minister until he was unseated by
Caruna four years ago, has accused the government of failing to share the wealth
with middle and lower-class residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Gibraltar Senior Citizens Center on Thursday several voters
accused Caruana point-blank of catering to business interests and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he is a bit of an actor,'' said Lisanne Davis, a 25-year-old
housewife. ``He promises many things but does not deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. workers support government funding for computer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - American workers want the federal government to
support computer literacy programs in high school to minimize the so-called
"digital divide" between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who don't, according to a poll released Thursday.
<P>
	   The poll found that a majority of workers use a computer every day and have
access to one at home. About 80 percent of those polled said they support
computer literacy programs in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   "Americans seem to be interested in a pro-active government, especially with
respect to education," said Carl E. Van Horn, a Rutgers University professor and
co-director of the study. "They say the federal government should require people
to have computer literacy upon graduation from high school, and very strongly
support the government assisting in education and the extension of computer
access and training to lower-income areas."
</P>
<P>
	   Entitled "Nothing But Net: American Workers and the Information Economy,"
the poll was conducted by Rutgers' John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce
Development and the University of Connecticut's Center for Survey Research and
Analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers interviewed 1,005 working adults by telephone from Jan. 5 to
Jan. 19. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
	   The study divided computer users into several groups depending on how often
they used a computer, terming those who use computers daily for many purposes
"technophiles" and people with no access to computers "exiles."
</P>
<P>
	   Most "technophiles" were in their 20s and 30s, white, college-educated,
earning more than $40,000 and working for a large company, the study found.
"Exiles" tended to be over 50, black, earning less than $40,000 and working for
a small company, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a big socioeconomic difference here," Van Horn said. "The exiles
want to be part of the (digital) economy, but they're not. They don't have the
skills needed, therefore they're being left out. That means if you don't have
those skills, you're relegated to low-paying jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly eight in 10 respondents said they believed information technology was
good for the economy, a departure from the 1950s and 1960s when workers feared
technological advances would replace them on the job, Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The use of computers at work has become commonplace, the study found.
Sixty-eight percent of workers use a computer every day.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll found that 23 percent of workers said they learned to use a
computer at work; 26 percent said they learned at school. But the majority of
American workers said they taught themselves or learned from a friend, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, there are more employees who would like to telecommute from
home than there are employers who allow it, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   About four in 10 workers said they could perform their jobs from home as a
telecommuter, yet only 16 percent of employers offer this option, the study
said. Sixty-one percent of workers said they would like to participate in online
education, but only 26 percent had participated in such programs, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
	   "People would like to be more involved in digital education and
telecommuting. And the digital exiles are feeling left behind and left out
because they know this is an information age and economy," Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is a downside to technology that enables more people to work from
home, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you have information on a 24-by-7 basis, it does create the potential
for people never being away from work," Van Horn said. "Those are important
public and private issues that we're going to have to grapple with."

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department disclosed Thursday it is reviewing
whether racial minorities have been given more federal death sentences than
white defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The review, initiated two months ago at Attorney General Janet Reno's
request, is not a moratorium on executions like that announced recently by
Illinois Gov. George Ryan in his state, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House said last Friday that President Clinton is considering a
Democratic senator's request for a suspension of federal death penalties pending
the outcome of a study like the one Reno ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the system is as fair as it can be,'' Holder
told a news conference. ``It's a historical study of the federal system with an
emphasis on finding out whether or not there are inappropriate racial
disparities'' in the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The study was ordered by the attorney general, I'd say almost out of an
abundance of caution,'' said Holder, who is leading the review. ``We don't have
anything to our knowledge that gives us reason to believe that there is a
disparity within the system. But we want to make sure that is so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said the study would not prevent the Bureau of Prisons from setting
an execution date for any of the 21 people on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. Two-thirds of those prisoners are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   With appeals under way, no dates have been set for their executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno established an elaborate Justice Department review system for deciding
whether to seek death penalties, including private hearings for defendants'
lawyers. But the final decision belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she personally opposes the death penalty, Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek death penalties in 149 cases, out of 517 reviewed under her
procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   The last federal execution was in 1963. In 1972, The Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty had been unfairly applied. State and federal procedures were
revised, so the high court restored the death penalty on the federal level in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is concerned
about the issues raised by Illinois' decision and will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being reviewed by White House counsel, Lockhart said. He added there's no
guarantee President Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Gov. Ryan's halt of executions in Illinois
until authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered fairly.
Since 1976, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 Illinois death row
inmates have been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a
few cases, persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal executions and have Reno
thoroughly review how the federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Rises on Dryness, Export Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat led grain and soybean prices sharply higher Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by more dry-weather forecasts for the
winter wheat belt that heightened concern about drought impact.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong weekly export sales figures released by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture underpinned the rally in wheat, which reached its highest level this
year. Rumors of China seeking more U.S. wheat also were a factor in the price
runup.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat helped boost corn higher, with the March contract hitting its highest
level in two weeks. Corn exports also were higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans also benefited from wheat's rise, along with bullish export sales
numbers from the USDA.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.71 3/4 a bushel; March corn
rose 3 cents to $2.25 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 1 3/4 cent to $1.10 1/4 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 9 1/4 cents to $5.13 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and pork futures
advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle fell .37 cent to 71.30 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
fell .18 cent to 83.27 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .15 cent to 59.10
cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .97 cent to 89.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bruno plan aims to aid businesses through airport upgrades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Saying a flight from Ithaca to Paris is $820 cheaper
than one between Ithaca and Buffalo, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
Thursday proposed a $650 million plan to subsidize instate flights and for
airport improvements.
<P>
	   The program is intended to boost business in New York, which has been
plagued with air fares that rank among the highest in the nation. Critics say
the rates have crippled the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know that by improving airport facilities we can increase traffic and
stimulate competition among air carriers, ultimately lowering costs to business
and leisure travelers," Bruno, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's office released a list of round-trip airfares advertised Tuesday to
prove his point. A flight from Ithaca to Buffalo - a distance of only 124 miles
- was listed as $1,168, while a flight from Ithaca to Paris was $348. A flight
from Islip on Long Island to Binghamton was listed at $650 while one from Islip
to Los Angeles was $283.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's definitely burdensome," David Waldek, chief financial officer of
Albany Molecular Research, said of air fares. His chemistry research company
spends about $500,000 a year on travel for its 200 employees. That's more than 5
percent of its operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldek and others in the business and airport communities praised Bruno's
proposal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been waiting a long time for something like this," said commissioner
of aviation Charles Everett, Syracuse Hancock International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno dubbed his initiative the Statewide Opportunities for Airport
Revitalization program - dubbed "NY SOARS." He said the state would provide $200
million over five years for terminals, runways and airport access highways. The
amount includes the $73 million Gov. George Pataki has already proposed spending
in a five-year plan for airport improvements. Airports would have to apply for
the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed spending another $20 million in state funds on a three-year
pilot program to subsidize air fares between upstate airports.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's plan also banks on bringing in an additional $430 million in
spending by the federal government and municipalities around the airports.
Taxes, energy costs and airfare are the three biggest complaints about doing
business in New York, said Kevin O'Connor, of the Center for Economic Growth in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ability of our employees to move around the Northeast in particular is
a problem for us," said Ken Pulver, spokesman for Albany International, a
manufacturer for the paper industry. He said that just getting from Albany to a
large hub like Boston or New York City tremendously increases costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany recently expanded its airport and in the spring, Southwest airlines
is expected to bring lower-cost flights - and a 20 percent increase in
customers. That means the airport will need help paying for improved roadways
and additional parking, said spokesman Doug Myers.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Pataki's office nor the Assembly's Democratic leadership had an
immediate response to Bruno's proposal.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Arms Monitors Won't Return  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Thursday that it will not allow U.N. arms
inspectors back into the country to reinstate a disarmament program halted on
the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan branded U.N. arms inspectors as ``spies''
in the clearest rebuff to date of renewed inspection attempts stipulated in a
Dec. 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Iraqi leaders have decried the resolution, but left open the question
of Baghdad's cooperation. Ramadan was blunt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There shall be no return of the so-called inspection teams. We reject the
infiltration by spies using such cover,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
Ramadan as telling a visiting Russian envoy, Nikolai Kartuzov.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks come as the newly appointed chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix
of Sweden, tries to set up a new disarmament commission. Ramadan did not mention
Blix by name, but he was appointed under the December resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Iraq's leaders have
to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know what they need to do, and standing in the way and trying to
dictate the terms of engagement of any force, or who will lead such a force, is
only going to perpetuate a situation that they publicly claim that they want to
get out of, which is the U.N. sanctions,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
can be lifted only after Iraq proves to the Security Council it has destroyed
its long range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq maintains it no longer has banned weapons and is demanding the
abolition of U.N. sanctions as a condition for the return of arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman John Mills said the world body would not respond
directly to Ramadan's remarks. But he noted that Blix will not take up the post
until at least the end of the month, so ``there isn't an inspection mechanism up
and functioning at the moment knocking on the door, asking to go into Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mills also said Blix must first spell out the remaining arms questions for
Iraq to answer.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, seen as Iraq's closest ally on the Security Council, sent Kartuzov
to Baghdad in a bid to persuade the government to cooperate, Baghdad-based
diplomats said. Kartuzov, a former Russian ambassador to Baghdad, also met
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run newspapers on Thursday quoted Aziz as saying Iraq will not
cooperate. Last week, Aziz said his government might cooperate if the United
Nations made the resolution palatable to Iraq. He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar Inspects Mexican Project  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey toured a checkpoint on
Mexico's border with Guatemala on Thursday and listened as Mexican officials
described their plan to ``seal'' the country's borders and coasts against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Spurred by U.S. criticism of its anti-drug efforts, Mexico is spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to install giant X-ray units at border posts
with Guatemala to detect drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico also has mounted a land, sea and air campaign involving about 20,000
military personnel to patrol the country's Caribbean coast. The goal is to
intercept drug shipments that are dropped from planes and picked up by waiting
boats there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an important day for me to be a student of (Mexican) Attorney General
Jorge Madrazo, and to see what his leadership is accomplishing,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, McCaffrey said about 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United
States is shipped through Mexico. Mexican officials have said they want to cut
off that flow, not only by catching shipments here, but by preventing
Colombian-grown drugs from ever entering Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican prosecutors announced Thursday that federal police had seized 5.7
tons of marijuana from trucks stopped in the last few days at checkpoints near
the U.S. border. Two truck drivers were arrested.

<HEADLINE> And now, live on the Internet: Funerals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - And now, live on the Internet: Funerals.
<P>
	   In what seems certain to be a sign of future times, funeral director Fred
Fergerson said Thursday that his parlor is now offering to broadcast funerals
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
	   If that sounds like something out of the Twilight Zone, it's really not.
Fergerson said he decided to do it out of compassion - for loved ones who cannot
attend services in person. That way they won't feel left out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's going to be a big demand for it," said Fergerson, who
is providing the service for free. "But we've got it if anybody wants it."
</P>
<P>
	   And he thinks he may be the only one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went all over the Internet on search engines," said the 52-year-old
Fergerson, whose father started the business here in 1948. "Nobody's doing it.
To my knowledge, we're the only ones."
</P>
<P>
	   Probably not for long. Fergerson said a New York City parlor is set to go on
line, and industry experts feel that others will follow.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you are dealing with here is the front end of a trend. Death is
different now than it was 50 years ago because family, friends and relatives are
more scattered," said Kelly Smith of the Wisconsin-based National Funeral
Directors Association. "The need for this kind of service is greater. If we
reach the point where the computer is the tie that binds the family, more
directors will use the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Just how quickly the trend will develop is difficult to predict. It all
depends on mortality.
</P>
<P>
	   "The funeral service profession is somewhat behind the curve when compared
with other businesses in providing consumers with e-commerce services," Smith
said. "A large majority of funeral service consumers are not yet asking for it
because most of them are of a generation different from the computer generation,
mostly the World War II generation and mid- to late baby boomers."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Fergerson hasn't had any takers. Visitors to the new streaming video
page on his website (www.FergersonFuneralHome.com) can click on Gallery and see
the front entrance to the funeral home and traffic passing by in the distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Fergerson said he tested the system last week, broadcasting a hearse
procession as it left the funeral home. He uses a fixed camera installed at the
entrance to the funeral home and says he also can broadcast from inside or take
the camera to a cemetery for a graveside service if a grieving family so wishes.
He's also working on adding audio.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea came out of the blue - after the death of an old high school
friend's father about two weeks ago. His friend, who lives on the West Coast,
returned to Syracuse to make funeral arrangements but couldn't come back when
his dad died.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started thinking about it," said Fergerson, a computer whiz in college.
"If we could get this camera working, we could do it worldwide. I didn't have it
working at that point. It took three days of configuring to get it the way I
wanted it."
</P>
<P>
	   During the testing and setup period, Fergerson said he inadvertently left
the camera on during a funeral. That's when he knew the system was ready.
</P>
<P>
	   "My brother in Maine saw it," Fergerson said. "I gave him the link for it."
</P>
<P>
	   Fergerson said he has three laptops he can give to those who are unable to
attend a funeral for whatever reason. He said he has good control over the setup
and can limit who sees it.
</P>
<P>
	   But just the thought of it all had Nicholas P. Bush scratching his head.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gets very impersonal at some point, and I still think tradition holds
the best process of grieving," said Bush, a second-generation funeral director
in nearby Rome, N.Y. "And that means being present for viewing and ceremony. I
don't see it at this point, but if it was something where the public was
interested on a regular basis, then I guess I would."

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Ambush Russian Train  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Rebels attacked two military trains and pulled the
Russians into one of the fiercest battles since abandoning the Chechen capital,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambush, and increasingly frequent guerrilla attacks on Russian units
elsewhere, demonstrated that bands of well-armed rebels are still able to move
around Chechnya in spite of the military's claims to control most of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The train had been sent to repair railroad tracks north of the capital
Grozny, but was crippled Tuesday near the town of Argun when rebels detonated
three remote-controlled mines under its locomotive and opened fire. The attack
was not reported until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A second train sent as backup was also badly damaged in fighting, but the
rebels eventually retreated, said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a presidential spokesman
on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there must have been casualties, because the battle was long and
fierce,'' Yastrzhembsky told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The train ambush signaled that the rebels would make good on their threats
to wage a wide-ranging guerrilla war on Russian forces after an estimated 3,000
rebels abandoned Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Overnight, the militants twice raided a Russian unit in the town of
Duba-Yurt, near Chechnya's southern mountains, killing at least three soldiers,
unit commander Capt. Andrei Chashchevoi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Major rebel forces -- some 7,000 fighters, according to Russian military
estimates -- are now concentrated in the south, where the mountainous terrain
will pose a major obstacle to any Russian advance. Russian forces have been
trying to prevent rebels who fled Grozny from reaching safety in the south.
</P>
<P>
	   A Russian paratroop unit on Thursday seized Itum-Kale, a town high in
Chechnya's southern mountains, which serves as a gateway to the strategic Argun
Gorge, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels have used the Argun and Vedeno gorges as supply routes, and have
bases hidden along the snowy slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the effort to block rebel reinforcements from reaching the
mountains, Russian forces forbade travel between settlements across western
Chechnya on Thursday, even for people with passes from military authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal troops on Thursday were also combing for remaining rebels in the
wreckage of Grozny, where about 80 percent of the buildings are destroyed or
damaged after months of bombing, shelling and house-to-house fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Interior Minister Col. Gen. Ivan Golubev said Thursday that 150-200
rebels are estimated to remain in Grozny. About 10,000 ``peaceful residents,''
are in the city, which once had a population of about 400,000, Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The residents who remain complained Thursday that Russian troops were
looting their homes under the pretext of searching for militants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They call it mopping up,'' said a 72-year-old Grozny man, Hamid Gukayev.
``They have cleaned out everything in my house: the carpets, kitchenware, warm
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I try not to leave my house these days,'' he added. ``The moment I go out,
the soldiers seize me on the pretext I'm a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the city's ethnic Russians also complained about the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The soldiers took my hens and my home-canned vegetables,'' said Taisiya
Dmitriyeva, 68. ``The Chechens called me a Russian wretch, but they never
confiscated food.''
</P>
<P>
	   The international watchdog group Human Rights Watch said it has confirmed
that at least 38 civilians have been executed by Russian soldiers in Grozny --
including nine people in a single family -- and called on acting President
Vladimir Putin to investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September after Chechen-based Islamic
militants twice invaded neighboring Dagestan. Authorities also claim Chechen
rebels are tied to apartment bombings that killed about 300 people in Russia in
September.

<HEADLINE> Russian Newsman Missing in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH INGRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Criticism of Russia's handling of a missing Russian reporter
mounted Thursday as the man's fate remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for U.S.-financed Radio Liberty, was detained in
January in Chechnya. Russian officials had vigorously objected to his critical
coverage of the offensive in the rebel republic, and some called him an
apologist for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said Babitsky was turned over to Chechen rebels last week in
exchange for three Russian prisoners of war. But Babitsky's family and
colleagues cast doubt on the reported deal, alleging that he was being held by
Russian security services and that his life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Thursday that Babitsky was in
southern Chechnya, ``alive and well and where he wanted to be.'' Ministry
spokesman Oleg Aksyonov said on the RTR television channel that Babitsky was in
Alkhazurovo, a village on the edge of the southern mountains where thousands of
rebels are believed to be based.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a presidential spokesman for Chechnya matters, told
reporters that ``circumstances'' prevented officials from discussing the case
publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe at a later stage, some of these circumstances will be made known,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some rebel representatives have denied they are holding Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's NTV television showed footage of a purported rebel commander
identified as Akhmed Basnukayev who predicted that Babitsky would be liberated
soon. In the footage, the commander appeared to indicate he believed the
Russians were holding the reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In any case, they'll let him go, because he's not so simple a figure that
they'd try to knock him off, like any Chechen,'' Basnukayev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, criticism of Russia's treatment of Babitsky grew.
</P>
<P>
	   Anatoly Chubais, a leader of the liberal Union of Democratic Forces party,
told reporters that Babitsky's purported exchange was ``an indisputable and
definite mistake by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot say at what level the decision was made, but there is no doubt
that in its essence and political consequences, it was bad for (acting President
Vladimir) Putin, among others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oleg Mironov, Russia's human rights commissioner, called the reported trade
``a crude violation of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is abnormal that a Russian citizen should be exchanged for Russian
citizens and sent to rebels and criminals,'' Mironov said in an interview with
NTV.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, a dozen members of the French media watchdog group Reporters
Without Borders gathered outside the Russian embassy in Paris to demand more
information about Babitsky's whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Earnings Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn posts 11 percent profit increase in fourth quarter
</P>
<P>
	   PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn on Thursday reported
fourth-quarter profits rose 11 percent due to surging sales for its glaucoma and
overactive bladder drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company reported some disappointing news on its experimental
anti-depression drug that is awaiting U.S. approval. Pharmacia said Vestra
failed to perform better than a placebo in one of two U.S. clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how that disclosure will impact obtaining Food and Drug
Administration approval, though it could hurt sales if Vestra is cleared for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacia, the maker of Nicorette smoking cessation products and Rogaine for
baldness, said its net earnings, adjusted for legal costs and the sales and
acquisitions of some businesses, rose to $261 million, or 50 cents per share, up
from $235 million, or 45 cents per share a year ago. Results matched
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the impact of its recent acquisition of South San Francisco
biotech company Sugen Inc. and the sale of most of its nutrition business,
profits for the October-December quarter jumped 75 percent, to $214 million, or
40 cents per share, from $122 million, or 22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 5 percent, to $1.94 billion from $1.85 billion. Adjusting for
1998 and 1999 divestments of parts of the nutrition business, sales were up to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, profits adjusted for the divestments and
</P>
<P>
	   other factors hit $944 million, for $1.80 per share. That was up 13.6
percent from net earnings of $631 million, or $1.58 per share, in 1998. Sales
for 1999 rose 12 percent, to $7.2 billion from $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Xalatan, the company's biggest seller and the world's No. 1
glaucoma medication, were up 53 percent for the year to $507 million. Sales rose
53 percent in the fourth quarter to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overactive bladder drugs Detrol and Detrusitol saw sales jump 162 percent to
$329 million for the year, with a 33 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> May Earnings Rise 7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- May Department Stores Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose
more than 7 percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales at many of its
retail chains.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis-based company said Thursday that it earned $513 million, or
$1.45 a share, for the quarter ending Jan. 29, compared with earnings of $478
million, or $1.31 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $4.70 billion, up from $4.52 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. May's stock was up 25
cents to $27.62 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   May also announced on Thursday that it planned to buy back an additional
$650 million of its stock. The buyback, which will take place over an
unspecified time, represents about 7.2 percent of the company's stock
outstanding. Companies use buybacks to increase earnings per share by reducing
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, May earned $927 million, or $2.60 per share, compared with
$849 million, or $2.30 per share the year before. Sales for the year increased
to $13.87 billion from $13.05 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   May now operates 421 stores in 36 states and the District of Columbia. Its
stores include Lord &AMP; Taylor, Hecht's, Strawbridge's, Foley's, Robinson-May,
Filene's, Kaufmann's, Famous-Barr, L.S. Ayres, The Jones Store, Meier &AMP; Frank
and ZCMI.
</P>
<P>
	   The company opened 18 new department stores in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   For 2000, the Meier &AMP; Frank division already opened 13 ZCMI stores at the
end of January and May plans to open 10 additional stores this year.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Released for Heating Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced Thursday that it was
releasing an additional $130 million in emergency funds to help low-income
people deal with soaring heating oil costs.
</P>
<P>
	   About one-third of the money will go to the Northeast, where heating oil
prices have been a particular problem because so many homes rely on oil for
heating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, President Clinton released $45 million to help low-income people
in the Northeast pay for their heating bills.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been growing pressure on the administration to intervene,
especially from members of Congress from Northeastern states. Many of them have
called on the president to release oil from the emergency government stockpile
to try to dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said the administration remains opposed to using the
strategic reserve to affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices and
that the markets should flow on their own,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the new funds for low-income assistance, Richardson said a
variety of measures would be taken to try to boost heating oil production at
Northeast refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   These include issuing temporary waivers at some refineries for compliance
with clean air laws, urging refiners to defer routine maintenance and lifting
waivers on the hours that truckers carrying heating oil may work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jay Hakes, head of the Energy Department's Energy Information
Administration, said refineries have been working at about 90 percent capacity,
which is normal during this time of year, but also lower than what is necessary
to deal with the current situation, especially in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Refineries have increased production of heating oil somewhat over the past
two weeks, Hakes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson also said the U.S. Coast Guard was creating a task force to give
priority to heating oil shipments at terminals and the government was urging
utilities to switch from heating oil to natural gas in an effort to ease the
price crunch.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: E. Timor Better, Problems Loom  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peacekeeping operations in East Timor largely have been
successful and hunger no longer is a daily danger for most, the State Department
said Thursday, but residents seeking to build an independent state are starting
with virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The economy is at a near standstill; unemployment is perilously close to
universal. Regrettably, but not surprisingly, crime and lawlessness are
increasingly serious problems,'' Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for
Far East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a joint House-Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said that since Australian-led U.N. troops entered the former
Indonesian province last fall, militia violence effectively has ended and an
estimated 135,000, roughly half of those who fled to Indonesian West Timor
during the violence, have returned. He said some do not intend to return.
</P>
<P>
	   The militia rampage after the East Timorese voted to break away from
Indonesia damaged up to 80 percent of public and private property, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth praised the Indonesian government for a recent report on atrocities in
East Timor that identified 33 individuals for further investigation, but said
the United States will continue to watch closely to see if Jakarta follows
through on the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the Australians should be
commended for helping restore peace. But, he said, the real issue as East Timor
tries to build a nation is ``what do we do now to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that only half the members of the 1,600 international police force
were on the ground, and little of the $520 million in aid pledged at a
conference in Tokyo in December has reached the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said Congress provided $25 million in aid in last year's budget and was
increasing from 30 to 45 the number of Americans on an international police
force. He said this might be further increased and the State Department had
allocated $8.5 million in peacekeeping operations funds for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to think of them, in a benevolent sense, as an international
welfare case for a while,'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., chairman of the
House International Relations subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Police Interrogate Israeli President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police questioned President Ezer Weizman, his wife and his
top aide Thursday over a scandal involving money Weizman received from a French
millionaire, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Switzerland, police interrogated the millionaire, Edouard Sarousi, at
Israel's request. Israeli officers were present, according to the Zurich
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Police went to the official president's residence in Jerusalem to question
Weizman, his wife, Reuma, and his aide Arieh Shumer, a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talking to reporters later, Weizman said the questioning would probably
continue Sunday. ``We're only halfway through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has admitted receiving money from Sarousi between 1988 and 1993 --
while he was a member of parliament and the Cabinet -- but less than the
$453,000 amount reported by an investigative journalist.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman insists the money was a personal gift, and he was following his
lawyer's advice when he failed to report it to tax authorities. The attorney
general ordered the police investigation when he discovered what he called a
business relationship between Weizman and Sarousi.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, 75, resisted pressure to resign his post or suspend himself while
the investigation is in progress. His term runs until 2003, but even before the
scandal, there were rumors he would step down before that date.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's president fulfills a mostly ceremonial role, but is considered a
source of moral authority. Critics say Weizman has damaged the image of the
presidency by refusing to step aside.

<HEADLINE> UPI Is in Talks on a Possible Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- United Press International is in talks that could lead to
the sale of the company, and an announcement is expected within the next few
weeks, the president of the news service said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arnaud de Borchgrave, a Newsweek veteran who took over the struggling news
provider just over a year ago, said the negotiations were part of an effort to
focus UPI on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borchgrave said the talks were being held with one potential partner, and
that a deal could be announced as early as the end of February. He declined to
be more specific, but did acknowledge that a sale to an Internet company was a
possibility. "We're all thinking of clicks rather than bricks," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   De Borchgrave would not comment on the potential value of the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   If the talks did result in a sale, it would be the latest shakeup for UPI.
The company has gone through two bankruptcy reorganizations and four owners
since being sold by the Scripps family in 1982. It was bought in 1992 by Middle
East Broadcasting Centre, a Saudi corporation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The present owners have authorized me to negotiate a different future for
UPI in which they would no longer be directly involved," de Borchgrave said. "My
job is to save UPI, and I'm doing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after taking over as head of UPI in late 1998, de Borchgrave said he
would lead an effort to bring more of the nearly 100-year-old company's business
onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   UPI got out of the broadcast news business last August, selling contracts to
provide news to more than 400 radio and television stations to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, de Borchgrave said UPI would shed 47 radio news jobs but add
26 positions for coverage of specialized fields such as Internet newsletters and
more in-depth stories.
</P>
<P>
	   UPI, which declined to disclose its revenue, said it has 110 full-time
employees and 725 stringers around the world. Its reports are disseminated
through contracts with about 150 "redistributors" throughout the world, such as
the Kyodo News agency of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Slain Yugoslav Official Mourned  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia buried its defense minister on a
wind-swept mountain in his native Montenegro on Thursday, three days after his
assassination.
</P>
<P>
	   An army commander speaking at Pavle Bulatovic's funeral warned against
testing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The blood of a first-rank soldier has been spilled, it must not be
forgotten, it is a warning,'' Gen. Milorad Obradovic said in a eulogy to
Bulatovic, who was gunned down in a Belgrade restaurant on Monday. ``The
Yugoslav army today is angry and no one should mess with it or test it on the
battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
	   Obradovic is in charge of the military in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller
partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
	   An army convoy escorted a hearse bearing Bulatovic's coffin to his home
village of Gornji Rovci, high atop a snowcapped mountain in northern Montenegro.
There, a platoon lined up at the cemetery to fire farewell salvoes during the
traditional Christian Orthodox funeral.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was no shot at a single man but a shot at the unity of Serbia and
Montenegro,'' Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said at the ceremony,
attended by several hundred people on the windy mountain. He is not related to
the late defense minister.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, a Milosevic ally claimed the assassination was an ``act of
state terrorism by the United States and the West, aimed against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a warning to the entire country and we shall react adequately,
with all means available under the constitution,'' said ultranationalist leader
Vojislav Seselj. He accused the country's independent media of being the West's
accomplices in the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   No new details of the unsolved shooting emerged Thursday. Serbian opposition
parties have demanded the resignation of top officials over Bulatovic's killing
and other unresolved high-profile slayings in the past decade of Milosevic's
rule.

<HEADLINE> Bruno plan aims to aid businesses through airport upgrades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Saying a flight from Ithaca to Paris is $820 cheaper
than one between Ithaca and Buffalo, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno
Thursday proposed a $650 million plan to subsidize instate flights and for
airport improvements.
<P>
	   The program is intended to boost business in New York, which has been
plagued with air fares that rank among the highest in the nation. Critics say
the rates have crippled the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know that by improving airport facilities we can increase traffic and
stimulate competition among air carriers, ultimately lowering costs to business
and leisure travelers," Bruno, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's office released a list of round-trip airfares advertised Tuesday to
prove his point. A flight from Ithaca to Buffalo - a distance of only 124 miles
- was listed as $1,168, while a flight from Ithaca to Paris was $348. A flight
from Islip on Long Island to Binghamton was listed at $650 while one from Islip
to Los Angeles was $283.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's definitely burdensome," David Waldek, chief financial officer of
Albany Molecular Research, said of air fares. His chemistry research company
spends about $500,000 a year on travel for its 200 employees. That's more than 5
percent of its operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldek and others in the business and airport communities praised Bruno's
proposal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been waiting a long time for something like this," said commissioner
of aviation Charles Everett, Syracuse Hancock International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno dubbed his initiative the Statewide Opportunities for Airport
Revitalization program - dubbed "NY SOARS." He said the state would provide $200
million over five years for terminals, runways and airport access highways. The
amount includes the $73 million Gov. George Pataki has already proposed spending
in a five-year plan for airport improvements. Airports would have to apply for
the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed spending another $20 million in state funds on a three-year
pilot program to subsidize air fares between upstate airports.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's plan also banks on bringing in an additional $430 million in
spending by the federal government and municipalities around the airports.
Taxes, energy costs and airfare are the three biggest complaints about doing
business in New York, said Kevin O'Connor, of the Center for Economic Growth in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ability of our employees to move around the Northeast in particular is
a problem for us," said Ken Pulver, spokesman for Albany International, a
manufacturer for the paper industry. He said that just getting from Albany to a
large hub like Boston or New York City tremendously increases costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany recently expanded its airport and in the spring, Southwest airlines
is expected to bring lower-cost flights - and a 20 percent increase in
customers. That means the airport will need help paying for improved roadways
and additional parking, said spokesman Doug Myers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's proposal is the result of a task force on upstate airports Bruno
appointed in 1997. The Assembly's Democratic leadership had no immediate
response to the plan. The governor's budget office said it will take a look at
it.

<HEADLINE> New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Off 55.53  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new high today while
blue-chip stocks once again lagged behind, pulled down by persistent worries
that their earnings aren't growing fast enough to offset rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 122.37 to close at 4,485.61. It was the fourth new closing
high in five sessions for the index, topping Tuesday's record of 4,427.50.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 to 10,643.63. Broader stock
indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,788 down, 1,252 up and 481 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.05 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.04 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.20 to 542.20.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology shares that dominate the Nasdaq rose as investors determined
that their powerful earnings growth puts them in the best position to thrive
even if interest rates move sharply higher later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are seeking out the biggest earnings gains," said Joseph V.
Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. "The
companies in the Nasdaq are probably going to grow their earnings 30 percent
this year, while the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will probably see 13.5 percent
growth."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are scrambling toward the fastest-growing companies amid concerns
that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates in its effort to
cool the economy enough to ward off inflation. Four modest increases since last
June have done little to slow U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that their slower growth rates will be especially endangered by
rising rates. Today, Merck and 3M led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, earnings were indeed the catalyst for buying. MCI WorldCom
rose. The company reported today fourth-quarter profits nearly tripled from the
final quarter of 1998 due to strong growth in its Internet and data services
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Dell Computer rose. The company, considered a bellwether for the
technology industry, was scheduled to release its latest earnings report after
the close of trading today.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet stocks were mostly lower a day after hackers disrupted several
popular Web sites. Amazon.com and online auctioneer eBay fell. No new attacks
were reported, and the FBI was continuing its probe of the Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts noted that in their frenzy for technology stocks, investors brushed
off some major bargain-hunting opportunities following the Dow's 258.44-point
plunge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The (Dow's) recent weakness has gone nearly unnoticed thanks to the run in
technology and growth stocks over the past two to three weeks," Belski said,
noting that Wednesday's decline knocked the Dow below 10,700 for the first time
since mid-November and may have prompted some computer-driven selling.
</P>
<P>
	   The market was little affected by the Labor Department's latest weekly
report on jobless claims, which showed the number of Americans filing new claims
for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in a month.
Analysts said the four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out
week-to-week volatility, fell sharply to the lowest level since Dec. 1973.

<HEADLINE> Justice Reviews Elian Guardians  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing whether
alcohol-related driving violations or other actions by Elian Gonzalez' relatives
in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That matter is under review,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said
when asked Thursday about the violations. ``We will look at that, try to make
some kind of factual determination and then decide what steps, if any, need to
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the department is still considering a request last week from
Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody
shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo
Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro
Gonzalez's family has permitted and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists
selected by Lazaro Gonzalez's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, the possibility of a meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno
and Lazaro Gonzalez's family reemerged Thursday. Reno agreed to a meeting
earlier this week, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw the request.
But discussions have been renewed, a Justice official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, two of Elian's Miami cousins sought support on Capitol hill
for legislation that would help keep the boy in America. One of them,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, told a news conference that reports of alcohol-related
violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said Elian's father had intended to flee Cuba
himself, but was being coerced by the Castro government to stay and make certain
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba,'' Cid said. She said
she and other family members had spoken to Elian's father by phone both before
and after the mother perished.
</P>
<P>
	   The father's response when learning that his boy was safe in Miami was
``take care of him until I can go, meaning go to the United States,'' Cid said.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Florida lawmakers introduced legislation earlier this month to
grant Elian American citizenship, blocking the Justice Department's ruling to
return him to Cuba, but support for it has been waning.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has already met with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and a Catholic nun from
Miami who oppose his return to Cuba, as well as with Elian's two grandmothers
from Cuba, who want him returned.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice official, who requested anonymity, said the department has
authority, if necessary, to shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro
Gonzalez. The boy was placed in his care after being found clinging to an inner
tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following a boat wreck that killed his
mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of the
father's request that the boy be returned to him in Cuba, but that decision was
put on hold while the Miami relatives battle in federal court to keep him in
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said that INS acted appropriately but ``now that we have this new
information, we'll have to look at it, and see, like I said, what steps if any
are appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found guilty of driving
under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997. Records also
show Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found
guilty at least twice of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Fidel
Castro's key man for U.S.-Cuba relations, said the convictions prove the homes
of those uncles are no place for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the
future, joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of
the child,'' Alarcon told reporters in Havana. He said Elian was ``surrounded by
two drunks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed the
criticism: ``Elian is surrounded by love.'' Elian's relatives and other Miami
supporters say his mother died to give him freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily Gramma, published a letter
Thursday from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No material good exists that can compete with the value of the family, and
it is humiliating for us that people are still questioning our love and the
future that awaits Elian at his home,'' said a Spanish version of the letter,
dated Feb. 4.

<HEADLINE> Court: Al Fayed Fabricated Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Mohamed Al Fayed fabricated a story that he paid for an
engagement ring for Princess Diana and his son, an appeals court said Thursday,
but ruled that a tabloid should not have used copyright photos to cast doubt on
his account.
</P>
<P>
	   The pictures, purchased by The Sun newspaper, were taken by a security
camera hours before Diana and Dodi Fayed died in a 1997 Paris car crash. Timed
and dated, the photos showed they spent much less time at Al Fayed's Villa
Windsor than he claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge Court of Appeal panel overturned a High Court ruling holding
that the pictures were published in the public interest as part of ``fair
dealing'' by the news media. The judges ruled The Sun should not have used
``misappropriated material.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Fayed's spokesman gave the media an accurate account of the half-hour
visit to the villa, but ``Mr. Al Fayed fabricated and gave wide publicity to a
different version in a book entitled `Death of a Princess,''' Lord Justice
William Aldous said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the book, Aldous said, Al Fayed claimed it was the couple's second visit
to the villa, that they stayed for two hours, that they were preparing for a new
life together and that a conspiracy existed to kill them in order to prevent
their marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To those falsehoods must be added the fabricated story that Mr. Al Fayed
had paid for a ring to mark the engagement of the princess and Mr. Dodi Fayed,
that he saw the bodies and that he was informed of the princess' last words,''
Aldous wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper contended it had printed the stills -- part of a story
headlined ``Video That Shames Fayed'' -- to help disprove Al Fayed's claim that
his son and the princess planned to marry and set up house there.
</P>
<P>
	   Lord Justice Jonathan Mance wrote that the ``transparent absurdity'' of Al
Fayed's allegations was a factor in reaching the conclusion that The Sun had no
basis for disregarding the Harrods owner's copyright.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges ordered Reuben Murrell, the security man who sold the stills to
The Sun for $64,000, to give the court $32,000 in case Al Fayed seeks damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun was ordered to pay $72,000 in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have attempted to fight the good fight to bring to the notice of the
public the lies being peddled by Al Fayed,'' said Tom Crone, The Sun's legal
manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Fayed professed himself delighted with the judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Sun was vicious and utterly disreputable in trying to capitalize on my
grief and profit from the criminal activities of my dishonest former
bodyguard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Al Fayed's spokesman, Laurie Meyer, said the Egyptian-born
billionaire had won the right to challenge a decision by Home Secretary Jack
Straw denying him a British passport because of questions about his honesty and
his admission that he put legislators on his payroll.

<HEADLINE> FDA Targets Recycled Medical Devices  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a growing practice but one few patients realize:
Medical devices like cardiac catheters and angioplasty balloons that were
intended to be used once and thrown in the trash instead are resterilized and
used again in other patients.
</P>
<P>
	   This controversial recycling largely has gone unregulated, but hospitals and
resterilizing companies soon will have to meet strict new standards to prove
that it is safe for patients, the Food and Drug Administration told Congress on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers responded that the FDA's move was long overdue, citing reports of
reused equipment that broke or caused infections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't put patients at risk in order to save a few dollars'' by reusing
equipment, said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a significant and perhaps even dangerous gap in FDA's
procedures,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who called FDA to a meeting of the
House Commerce oversight subcommittee to explain. ``I am alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's own research has uncovered problems with some reused disposable
devices, such as angioplasty balloons that get stretched out of shape by the
cleaning. A Kansas woman is living with a piece of metal lodged inside her heart
after a reused catheter broke during surgery last year. Some studies have
concluded that a few patients caught tuberculosis, hepatitis or pneumonia from
improperly resterilized devices.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FDA insists it has no evidence that reusing disposable devices is
much riskier than using other medical equipment. Brand new heart catheters can
break the first time they are used, says FDA medical device chief Dr. David
Feigal. Also, lots of medical devices are made to be used over and over -- yet
they, too, commonly cause infections whenever hospitals do not properly
resterilize them.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the FDA has decided ``this growing practice needs increased
scrutiny,'' Feigal told Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   So the agency proposed forcing hospitals and resterilizing companies to
prove they can safely reclean and reuse disposable medical devices -- and
whether it's safe to reuse such devices only two or three times, or if 10 times
is OK.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal would make hospitals and resterilizing companies, called
``reprocessors,'' meet the same FDA safety standards as medical device
manufacturers must meet before they can sell equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   It is all based on risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Devices the FDA classifies as high-risk, or Class 3 devices, typically are
hard to clean or contain delicate materials that sterilizing could damage, such
as angioplasty balloons. Under the proposed rule, hospitals that want to
resterilize them, or reprocessors that offer that service, would have to quickly
get FDA approval that their methods are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, very low-risk devices, like tough and easy-to-clean surgical
saw blades, could be reprocessed without prior FDA approval as long as standard
quality measures are followed.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal is open for public comment through early April, before FDA
finalizes the rule.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Earnings Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn on Thursday reported
fourth-quarter profits rose 11 percent due to surging sales for its glaucoma and
overactive bladder drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company reported some disappointing news on its experimental
anti-depression drug that is awaiting U.S. approval. Pharmacia said Vestra
failed to perform better than a placebo in one of two U.S. clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how that disclosure will impact obtaining Food and Drug
Administration approval, though it could hurt sales if Vestra is cleared for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacia, the maker of Nicorette smoking cessation products and Rogaine for
baldness, said its net earnings, adjusted for legal costs and the sales and
acquisitions of some businesses, rose to $261 million, or 50 cents per share, up
from $235 million, or 45 cents per share a year ago. Results matched
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the impact of its recent acquisition of South San Francisco
biotech company Sugen Inc. and the sale of most of its nutrition business,
profits for the October-December quarter jumped 75 percent, to $214 million, or
40 cents per share, from $122 million, or 22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 5 percent, to $1.94 billion from $1.85 billion. Adjusting for
1998 and 1999 divestments of parts of the nutrition business, sales were up to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, profits adjusted for the divestments and
</P>
<P>
	   other factors hit $944 million, for $1.80 per share. That was up 13.6
percent from net earnings of $631 million, or $1.58 per share, in 1998. Sales
for 1999 rose 12 percent, to $7.2 billion from $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Xalatan, the company's biggest seller and the world's No. 1
glaucoma medication, were up 53 percent for the year to $507 million. Sales rose
53 percent in the fourth quarter to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overactive bladder drugs Detrol and Detrusitol saw sales jump 162 percent to
$329 million for the year, with a 33 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for growth hormone Genotropin, contraceptive injection Depo-Provera
and colorectal cancer drug Camptosar all increased significantly, while sales of
anti-anxiety pill Xanax dropped 15 percent to $72.5 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Last December, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced plans to buy St. Louis-based
Monsanto Co. for about $27 billion. The deal is expected to close by summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Pharmacia fell $1.50 to $50 in midafternoon New York Stock
Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Strokes More Deadly for Blacks  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Blacks ages 35 to 54 are four times more likely to die of a
stroke than their white counterparts, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Middle-aged Hispanics, Asians, American Indians and Alaska natives also are
at greater risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
American Indians and Alaska natives in that age group are nearly twice as likely
as whites to die of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The racial gap narrowed sharply at older ages, suggesting that younger
minorities are not getting the message about the risk factors, said Carma Ayala,
a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people believe stroke is an older person's disease," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC also cited lack of access to health care and mistrust of the medical
system as reasons for the racial gap.
</P>
<P>
	   Obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, diabetes, poor nutrition and high blood
pressure are the major risk factors for stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only do minorities have a higher rate of stroke deaths, but they run a
higher risk of having a stroke than whites, with blacks four times more likely,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said stroke was the third leading cause of death in 1997, killing
157,791 Americans. Overall, U.S. stroke deaths in the declined 70 percent from
1950 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Attacks Concerning Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet next week with the nation's
top computer security experts and technology executives in light of the attacks
against some of the most prominent companies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly what happened this week will be at the top of the agenda,''
David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the meeting was not called directly in response to this
week's attacks but was organized on the heels of the president's budget proposal
for $2.03 billion to protect the country's most important computer systems from
cyber attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting at the White House also will include Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, and the president's chief of staff, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said others invited include executives from companies involved in
e-commerce and computer networks, leaders from industry associations and
academic experts who study online security.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, the Defense Department said all its computers with
Internet access will be checked to verify that they were not used as unwitting
agents in the massive attacks this week on Internet electronic commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Services Administration also alerted all federal agencies to
ways they can prevent hackers from using electronic tools on their computers
that might have been surreptitiously installed.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said there is no evidence to
suggest that Pentagon computers were involved in the attacks, but the hard
drives of the more than 1 million computers with Internet access will be checked
anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just think it's a prudent thing to check,'' said Quigley, noting that
the Defense Department is the largest computer user in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The computers will be checked for the presence of ``distributed denial of
service'' tools like those used in this week's attacks. Hackers can hide these
tools, known as daemons, on hundreds or even thousands of third-party computers
and then trigger them from a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a
single target.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure's Effects Last  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- High blood pressure in middle age sharply raises the
risk of strokes later in life, even in people who have brought their pressure
under control, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have long known that high blood pressure is the single most
important cause of strokes, which hit more than 600,000 Americans annually.
However, doctors traditionally consider only a person's current blood pressure
-- not past readings -- when judging whether their risk is higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   A new study found that a history of high blood pressure is a powerful
predictor of stroke risk, no matter where a person's blood pressure now stands.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings are from the 50-year-long Framingham Heart Study in the Boston
suburbs. They were presented Thursday by Dr. Sudha Seshadri of Boston University
Medical School at a meeting in New Orleans of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just the blood pressure you have now," she said. "It's the blood
pressure you had in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Her study was based on a review of 5,197 study participants, including 367
who had suffered strokes. The researchers looked at current blood pressure, as
well as blood pressure decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   A standard blood pressure reading is given as systolic pressure over
diastolic pressure. Systolic, the larger of the two numbers, should ideally be
below 120, while the diastolic number should be under 80.
</P>
<P>
	   The Framingham researchers found that a 20-point elevation in systolic
pressure when people are in their 60s raises their stroke risk by 50 percent
after they reach age 70. A 20-point elevation during the 50s raises the risk 40
percent later on.
</P>
<P>
	   An increased risk persists even if people bring down their blood pressure in
old age, though the risk is lower than if hypertension is left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study is important, because it shows that a risk factor is in effect
over a lifetime. The longer you have it, the greater its effect," said Dr. Ralph
Sacco of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Another study by Dr. George W. Petty of the Mayo Clinic shows the importance
of leaky and deformed heart valves in triggering strokes. The researchers
followed more than 700 people who had problems with their aortic or mitral
valves, the two main valves that control blood flow on the left side of the
heart.
</P>
<P>
	   They found that severe mitral valve narrowing was an especially important
risk. People with this condition were nearly four times more likely than usual
to suffer full-blown strokes or ominous mini-strokes.

<HEADLINE> CBS To Air Some Nickelodeon Shows  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of Nickelodeon's most popular shows for pre-schoolers,
including "Blue's Clues" and "Little Bill," will soon air on Saturday mornings
on CBS under a deal being negotiated by the soon-to-be corporate cousins.
</P>
<P>
	   It could be one of the first changes TV viewers will see as a result of the
pending merger of CBS and Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's low-rated block of Saturday morning children's programming would be
replaced by shows from the Nick Jr. lineup, which runs on weekday mornings on
Nickelodeon, according to executives from both companies who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't been determined exactly which shows will air on CBS, though the
popular "Blue's Clues" mystery-solving show and "Little Bill" are almost
certain. Other Nickelodeon pre-school shows include "Franklin," "Maurice
Sendak's Little Bear" and "Gulla Gulla Island."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS could use a lift in children's programming, where Nickelodeon, the WB
and Fox are generally considered the market leaders. ABC revived its own
Saturday morning fortunes in recent years by letting its parent, Walt Disney
Co., program its kids' schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Many young viewers barely know that CBS exists. The arrangement will help
the network because Nickelodeon will promote CBS's schedule within its schedule,
and CBS will do the same for Nick.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon's own popular Saturday morning lineup will not be affected,
since it is geared toward a slightly older audience.
</P>
<P>
	   The change would begin this fall, executives said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS has also been working with two other Viacom networks, the music channels
MTV and VH1. One of MTV's leading personalities, Carson Daly, was host last week
of the "Miss USA Pageant," which aired last Friday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   The show recorded its lowest ratings since it began airing in 1974, however,
drawing 1 million fewer viewers than the previous low last year. It may be an
indication that CBS's audience, which averages over age 50, and MTV's audience
doesn't easily mix.
</P>
<P>
	   VH1 is producing a pre-telecast program to air before the Grammy Awards,
which are being aired Feb. 23 on CBS. The show will be aired on several
CBS-owned television stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the merger took place, VH1 had set up agreements with CBS to air
reruns of concert specials first shown on the network, involving Shania Twain,
Celine Dion and Ricky Martin, said VH1 chief programmer Jeff Gaspin.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Apologizes for Plundering  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Amsterdam stock exchange apologized
Thursday for allowing Jewish-owned equity to be plundered during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the Amsterdam Exchanges and the firm that ran the bourse
during World War II expressed regret during a meeting with organizations of
Dutch Jews in Israel and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting was the first since a government-appointed commission in
December urged the exchange to enter into negotiations with the Jewish community
over restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides agreed to meet again in March to begin discussing the precise
wording of a public apology and financial compensation, said exchange spokesman
Raymond Salet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Jewish Council, an umbrella group, welcomed the apology but said
the exchange must still prove its sincerity in the follow-through stages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They offered words and we were very pleased to hear those words,'' said
spokesman Ronni Naftaniel. ``But it is a limited apology, an in-house apology.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the commission, compensation for unreturned assets and Jewish
suffering which resulted from the theft should run into the millions of dollars.
It did not specify an exact amount.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is one of several addressing the issue of Dutch mistreatment
of Jews during and after the war at a time when other European countries are
re-examining their roles in abetting the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of a prewar population of around 140,000 Jews in the Netherlands, more
than 100,000 perished in Nazi death camps, one of the highest rates death rates
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   During the war, the bourse allowed the German occupation authorities to
establish the Lippman-Rosenthal Bank, which expropriated Jewish stocks and sold
them to non-Jewish traders.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasers included the forerunners of ING Groep and ABN Amro, the
country's leading banks which have offered Jews $1.8 million to compensate for
profit made on stock trades.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the bourse's spokesman, 90 percent of the value of the assets
was returned after the war, but the exchange never apologized for turning a
blind eye to the theft.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a black page in our history,'' Salet said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Talks on Bankrupt Cos.  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers stand to lose billions of dollars -- and the
promise of new communications services -- if valuable government licenses become
tied up in bankruptcy court, a regulator told senators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told the
Senate Budget Committee that the agency successfully has conducted auctions
since 1993 to get new slices of the airwaves into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   But problems have arisen from companies that declare bankruptcy before
paying in full for their licenses. The commission argues that these licenses
should be returned to the government so they can be reauctioned and put to use.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing bankrupt companies to hold on to the licenses -- and eventually pay
only a portion of what they bid -- undermines the entire process, Kennard told
the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spectrum belongs to the American public. It's a national resource,''
Kennard said. He again advocated for legislation that would ensure the
government gets back licenses from companies that file for bankruptcy. Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H., and others have pushed for such measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC was in a long battle with NextWave Telecom, which bid more than $4
billion for wireless licenses in a federal auction several years ago and later
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company recently agreed to pay its debt in
full.
</P>
<P>
	   But the commission wants that portion of the airwaves back, saying that
under agency rules, NextWave's licenses were canceled automatically when it
failed to meet its payment deadlines. A New York bankruptcy court earlier this
month rejected the commission's bid to take back NextWave's licenses for
reauctioning.
</P>
<P>
	   That decision was appealed by the FCC to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, which previously had reaffirmed the commission's jurisdiction
over the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the appeals court said the commission can begin preparing for a
July reauction of the licenses, while the court makes its decision. The FCC
still needs a favorable ruling from the court for the auction to go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the increasing demand for wireless voice and data services, the
licenses may be worth much more now. Mobile phone company Nextel Communications
has indicated that it would bid as much as $8 billion if the licenses were put
back on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregg said Americans are taking a hit when NextWave and others bring
licenses into bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The company ``is trying to beat down the taxpayers by going into bankruptcy
court,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave officials rebuffed any suggestion that they filed for bankruptcy in
order to reduce what they owed the government. They instead blamed FCC license
policy for their financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Dolan, chief operating officer for NextWave, also chastised the
commission for not accepting the company's offer to pay for the licenses, so
they could be put to use to deliver wireless services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our offer is sincere,'' Dolan said. ``It is the right and fair result.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Reviews Elian Guardians  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing whether
alcohol-related driving violations or other actions by Elian Gonzalez' relatives
in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That matter is under review,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said
when asked Thursday about the violations. ``We will look at that, try to make
some kind of factual determination and then decide what steps, if any, need to
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the department is still considering a request last week from
Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody
shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo
Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro
Gonzalez's family has permitted and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists
selected by Lazaro Gonzalez's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, the possibility of a meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno
and Lazaro Gonzalez's family reemerged Thursday. Reno agreed to a meeting
earlier this week, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw the request.
But discussions have been renewed, a Justice official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, two of Elian's Miami cousins sought support on Capitol Hill
for legislation that would help keep the boy in America. One of them,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, told a news conference that reports of alcohol-related
violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said Elian's father had intended to flee Cuba
himself, but was being coerced by the Castro government to stay and make certain
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba,'' Cid said. She said
she and other family members had spoken to Elian's father by phone both before
and after the mother perished.
</P>
<P>
	   The father's response when learning that his boy was safe in Miami was
``take care of him until I can go, meaning go to the United States,'' Cid said.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Florida lawmakers introduced legislation earlier this month to
grant Elian American citizenship, which would take the decision about Elian's
future away from INS and give it to a Florida family court. Support for the bill
has been waning.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has already met with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and a Catholic nun from
Miami who oppose his return to Cuba, as well as with Elian's two grandmothers
from Cuba, who want him returned.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice official, who requested anonymity, said the department has
authority, if necessary, to shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro
Gonzalez. The boy was placed in his care after being found clinging to an inner
tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following a boat wreck that killed his
mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of the
father's request that the boy be returned to him in Cuba, but that decision was
put on hold while the Miami relatives battle in federal court to keep him in
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said that INS acted appropriately but ``now that we have this new
information, we'll have to look at it, and see, like I said, what steps if any
are appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found guilty of driving
under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997. Records also
show Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found
guilty at least twice of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Fidel
Castro's key man for U.S.-Cuba relations, said the convictions prove the homes
of those uncles are no place for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the
future, joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of
the child,'' Alarcon told reporters in Havana. He said Elian was ``surrounded by
two drunks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed the
criticism: ``Elian is surrounded by love.'' Elian's relatives and other Miami
supporters say his mother died to give him freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily Gramma, published a letter
Thursday from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No material good exists that can compete with the value of the family, and
it is humiliating for us that people are still questioning our love and the
future that awaits Elian at his home,'' said a Spanish version of the letter,
dated Feb. 4.

<HEADLINE> Senate Breaks Nominations Impasse  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pushed through the
confirmation of two federal judges Thursday, defying an effort by his fellow
Republicans to block all nominations put forward by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we should, or would, be able to go all year without
confirming any nominations,'' Lott, R-Miss., said in explaining his decision to
press ahead with the votes. ``Some of these are good men and women ... and in
some of these states, there truly is a need for more judges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 96-2 to confirm Thomas Ambro as U.S. Circuit Judge for the
Third Circuit and 95-2 to approve Joel Pisano to be U.S. District Judge for the
District of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-simmering standoff between the administration and Senate
Republicans over federal judges boiled over at yearend. That's when Sen. James
Inhofe, R-Okla., accused President Clinton of violating an agreement on making
temporary recess appointments, a method of bypassing the Senate confirmation
process.
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe said 19 Republican senators had joined in deciding to put ``holds''
on all judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Senate tradition, a single senator can block further floor action on a
nominee by putting a ``hold'' on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   But in this case, with Democrats accusing Republicans of playing politics in
blocking worthy judicial nominations, Lott decided to move ahead with votes on
the two non-controversial judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said he believed the White House did try to work with his office on the
recess appointment issue and ``my feeling is that we should not start
filibustering these nominations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe continued to assert that Clinton broke his word last December by
reappointing Sara M. Fox to the National Labor Relations Board. The Constitution
gives the president the right to make appointments during a congressional
recess, with the nominee allowed to serve until the end of the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator said his effort to block future judicial nominees was ``the only
chance in eight years to hold the president up to his word.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe was joined by 18 other Republicans who voted no in a 79-19 vote on
whether to move to final consideration on the two judges. He and Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H., voted against confirmation of the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
thanked Lott and committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for working with
him on the nomination issue, but said there were still 77 vacancies, nearly 10
percent of all federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged action on two nominations to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
U.S. District Judge Richard Paez and attorney Marsha Berzon, both blocked by
Republicans who say they are too liberal. Paez has been waiting more than three
years for a vote on his nomination.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Opposition Request Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Some of Cuba's best-known opposition leaders are asking the
communist government to free jailed dissident Marta Beatriz Roque for
humanitarian reasons, saying they are worried about her health.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights activist Elizardo Sanchez, religious leader Oswaldo Paya and
independent journalist Raul Rivero were among those who signed the letter
delivered Feb. 2 to Cuba's Council of State, the government body of which Fidel
Castro is president. A copy was delivered to The Associated Press this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Roque, 53, suffers from a growth in her breasts which has since spread into
her armpits and arms. She reportedly has been hospitalized numerous times since
her imprisonment for that and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Roque was jailed in July 1997. She was among four dissidents sentenced after
a closed trial last spring to prison terms ranging from 4 1/2 to six years. The
Vatican, the European Community, Canada, the United States and others have
called for the dissidents' release.
</P>
<P>
	   The four were convicted of incitement to sedition for encouraging
businessmen not to invest in Cuba and calling on exiles in the United States to
ask their relatives on the island to undertake acts of civil disobedience. The
dissidents also criticized a major draft document of Cuba's Communist Party,
saying it concentrated only on the glories of Cuba's revolution and did not
offer any pragmatic solutions to the country's severe economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Putin Eyes Caucasus Rebuilding  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KRASNODAR, Russia (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin told governors of
Russia's Caucasus republics Thursday that his government will work for a
renaissance in Chechnya once the war with rebels is over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After we finish them up -- and I hope it will happen in the near future --
we must think about the economic, social and cultural revival of that
territory,'' he said. ``Our duty is to help the Chechen people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before traveling to Krasnodar, a large city near the Caucasus region about
720 miles south of Moscow, Putin said the government would devote up to $70
million to rebuilding Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting with the governors, he was briefed by Gen. Viktor Kazantsev,
a top commander in the Chechen offensive, on the progress of the operation and
what steps should be taken following rebels' abandonment last week of the
Chechen capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's tough handling of the Chechen war is seen as one of the cornerstones
of his popularity ahead of the March 26 presidential elections. Opinion polls
have showed him getting the approval of more than 50 percent of the electorate,
with his nearest challenger, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, registering
around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov recently has criticized Putin for allegedly having no election
program. Putin said that a ``center for strategic research'' has been
established to help draft his economic program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the public will see the document in the nearest future -- I think,
I am sure, before the election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's stance on economic matters and other reform issues is largely
unclear. He has spoken about the need to revise Russia's labyrinthine tax code
and recently expressed interest in a proposal to hold a referendum on land
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the uncertainty about his platform, he has resisted efforts to
make him be specific.

<HEADLINE> Slowdown of Productivity Forecasted  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion, already the longest in
the nation's history, should keep going this year and beyond even though a
recent surge in productivity may not last, the Clinton administration said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration used this year's 432-page "Economic Report of the
President" to take part of the credit for the good times, with unemployment and
inflation both at 30-year lows and consumer confidence at record highs.
</P>
<P>
	   While praising the Federal Reserve for pursuing an astute monetary policy,
the economic report said the administration deserved credit for making the tough
choices to eliminate the soaring government deficits it had inherited.
</P>
<P>
	   By turning huge deficits into record surpluses, the administration has
helped to keep interest rates 30 percent to 50 percent lower than they had been
during the 1980s and the low borrowing costs have fueled an investment boom by
businesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, the American economy is stronger than ever," President Clinton said
in the report, which like the $1.84 trillion budget he released on Monday was
heavy on themes the Democrats hope to use in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
	   "More than 20 million new jobs have been created since Vice President Gore
and I took office in January 1993," Clinton said in one of the report's numerous
references to Gore, who is running to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans argue that the administration only reluctantly agreed to balance
the budget under pressure from the GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans also
give credit for the economy's good times to Ronald Reagan, who first appointed
Alan Greenspan to the Federal Reserve in 1987, and for Reagan's championing of
large tax cuts in the 1980s which they claim laid the groundwork for the current
boom.
</P>
<P>
	   The economic report, prepared by the president's three-member Council of
Economic Advisers, contained details of the administration's updated economic
forecast, which formed the basis for budget projections forecasting $746 billion
in non-Social Security surpluses over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual report forecast that after three straight years with economic
growth averaging over 4 percent, the economy will slow in 2000 to 2.9 percent,
when measured from the fourth quarter of each year, and slow to around 2.5
percent in the following three years. Such a slowdown would see the unemployment
rate rise slightly to 5.2 percent from the current 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of recent economic strength has come from a remarkable jump in
productivity growth, the amount of output per hour of work. The government
reported Tuesday that productivity in 1999 increased by 2.9 percent, the
strongest increase in seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past four years, productivity has risen at an annual average of 2.6
percent, far higher than the 1.4 percent annual average increase from 1973 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
	   After booming gains in the 1950s and 1960s, productivity went into a
two-decade slump following the first Arab oil embargo in 1973. The recent upturn
has left some analysts believing that huge business investments in computers are
finally beginning to pay off and the country is in a new economic era that will
be marked by stronger productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Productivity is the key factor determining whether Americans' standards of
living can increase. Higher productivity allows employers to pay higher wages
that are not inflationary because they are financed by increased output rather
than increased charges for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's economic report, however, sounded a note of caution about
how long this near doubling in the rate of productivity growth will last.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than predicting gains of 2.6 percent, the average from 1996 through
last year, the administration's economic forecast projects more modest annual
increases of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But Martin Baily, chairman of the president's economic council, said the
administration was erring on the side of caution on productivity as well as on
overall economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Leader Pushing for Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana wants U.S. taxpayers to
spend tens of millions of dollars to wean Colombian farmers away from growing
illicit drug crops by promoting the raising of cattle, coffee and cotton
instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the bulk of the proposed $1.6 billion U.S. aid plan to fight drugs in
Colombia will be used for destroying coca crops and battling the leftist rebels
who protect them, Colombia will spend a fifth of it on alternative development
and other social programs, Pastrana told The Associated Press in an interview on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his embrace of the U.S. aid package, currently awaiting U.S.
congressional approval, Pastrana insisted he would not allow American troops to
become directly involved in Colmbia's nearly four-decade-old civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 U.S. military personnel are in Colombia at any one time, and
five were killed in the July crash of an Army RC-7 spy plane in Putumayo,
apparently due to pilot error. Green Berets and Navy Seals periodically train
troops and the Pentagon has helped Colombia's military improve its
intelligence-gathering and combat ability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will never accept the presence of foreign troops in combat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. money will underwrite a push by a U.S.-trained counternarcotics
battalion into the guerrilla-dominated southern state of Putumayo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said last week that he expects
violent protests by coca growers in Putumayo, where coca cultivation has
exploded by some 300 percent in the past two years and now makes up one-third of
the country's crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana wants U.S. taxpayers to help fund alternative development there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a very grave social problem and for that reason we've said we
can't look at the problem only as one of fumigation and eradication,'' Pastrana
said. ``We've got to give these people a hand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aggravating a civil conflict that claims 3,000 lives a year and the
pervasively corrupting influence of drug trafficking, Colombia is in the throes
of its worst recession since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerrilla attacks occur almost daily. This week, a rebel blockade kept the
highway that links Bogota with the country's second-largest city, Medellin,
closed for four days.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana nevertheless held out an olive branch to the country's largest
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, with which he
is engaged in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would not extradite to the United States a regional commander
accused of murdering three U.S. activists last March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a crime that will be tried in Colombia,'' Pastrana stressed during
the 45-minute interview in his office in the presidential palace before heading
off for provincial cities where he has proposed tax-free enterprise zones.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of the activists, kidnapped while visiting an indigenous group,
prompted U.S. diplomats to break off exploratory contacts with the FARC to
discuss possible guerrilla cooperation in weaning farmers off drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian prosecutors have filed murder charges against the guerrilla
commander, German Briceno, who remains at large. Prosecutors say Briceno is
among FARC leaders most deeply involved in the drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking office in August 1998, Pastrana bet his presidency on making
peace with the FARC. He demilitarized a huge swath of southern Colombia 15
months ago -- virtually ceding it to the rebels -- as a condition for talks that
have so far proceeded at a glacial pace.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged Thursday the rebels' deep involvement in the drug business
but added ``we have no clear evidence that the FARC is a cartel ... We know it
lives off drugs. But we also know that behind it is a political life of 40 years
of insurgency that can't simply be cast aside.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, 45, said he was optimistic about FARC negotiators' trip to Europe
this month. So far, they've met with Swedish and Norwegian business and union
leaders and say they're hoping for an audience with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is the first big step in this entire process of
negotiation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, told reporters in Mexico Wednesday that
about two-thirds of FARC units ``are engaged in some way in drug-related
criminal activity'' and that the FARC's primary task in Putumayo ``is to protect
coca-growing fields, lab's production and the movement of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana said 79 percent of the U.S. aid would help Colombia's military and
police battle drugs in the world's No. 1 cocaine-producing nation. That money
would go to buying 63 helicopters, training and equipping two additional 950-man
counternarcotics battalions and upgrading radar that detects drug flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the aid plan, which the U.S. Congress is to begin debating next
week, say Pastrana's alternative development plans are ill-conceived and still
in the draft stage. They predict a bloody backlash against the push into
Putumayo that will only increase FARC support.

<HEADLINE> Quaker, Novartis in Joint Venture  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. is entering a joint venture with Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG in an attempt to woo consumers who want food
that's both nutritional and has proven health benefits
</P>
<P>
	   The new firm, Altus Food Co., will develop and market "functional foods" --
food containing ingredients said to contribute to better health -- in the United
States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said Thursday they intend to get a sizable chunk of a U.S.
market, which they estimate at between $10 billion and $20 billion and is
experiencing double-digit percentage growth annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Valentino, president and chairman of Novartis Consumer Health Inc.,
the Summit, N.J.-based arm of the Swiss conglomerate, estimated Altus could reap
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big opportunity to take advantage of an emerging food category,"
said Greg Shearson, president and general manager of Altus and former vice
president of Quaker New Ventures. He cited the aging of the population and
growing concerns about children's nutrition as prime reasons behind the rise of
functional foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Now consisting of just 20 to 30 executives from the two firms, Altus is
based in Chicago, like Quaker, and aims to have new products on the market by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Shearson wouldn't divulge financial details of the companies' 50-50
partnership or say what products are envisioned, other than that they could
include beverages, healthy snacks, cereals and side dishes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel like we're onto some early examples" of products that will "deliver
significant health benefits over and above nutrition," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Examples of such products include cholesterol-reducing cereals or healthful
energy bars.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said they will focus particularly on the health-care concerns
of women, children, athletes and older adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Novartis is one of the world's biggest health care and pharmaceutical
companies whose products also include nonprescription brands like Ex-Lax,
Maalox, Ovaltine and Gerber Foods. It recently launched the Aviva line of
functional foods in Europe, touting bone health, cardiovascular health and
digestive health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker Oats makes cereals like Cap'n Crunch and Life in addition to its
namesake oatmeal, although the sports drink Gatorade accounted for nearly 40
percent of the company's $4.73 billion in worldwide sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The joint venture follows several acquisitions by food giants of health-food
brands, including Kraft Foods Inc.'s purchase of nutrition bar maker Balance Bar
Co. and soy foods maker Boca Burker, as well as Kellogg Co.'s deal for
Worthington Foods Inc., a maker of vegetarian products.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution says witnesses heard Volpe promise to "say nothin"'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors said Thursday they had witnesses
ready to testify that on the day he agreed to plead guilty to a sodomy attack on
Abner Louima, officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer for fellow officer Charles
Schwarz that he would "say nothin"' to implicate Schwarz in the crime.
<P>
	   The surprise move, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson,
injected a new element into the trial of Schwarz and two other officers for
conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Louima's civil rights
when Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty. Schwarz was convicted and faces a
possible life sentence. His appeal for a new trial was rejected by Nickerson
last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, face up
to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20, when, during a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, "confronted Volpe in the lobby" and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, currently defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial
in Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
"They know where to find me," he said. "I'd be happy to respond to a subpoena."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers in the Brooklyn trial declined comment but Bruder attorney Stuart
London said they would confer on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors' letter, dated Feb. 9, said the government hoped to call
"one or more witnesses who overheard the conversation between Volpe and Worth,"
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe pleaded guilty on May 25 to sodomizing Louima with a broken broomstick
in August, 1997. He said a second, unnamed officer took part.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing in December 1998, where he drew a 30-year term, Volpe said
for the first time that the "second officer" in the bathroom during the attack
on Louima was not Schwarz, but Wiese, who did not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial, Worth - then Schwarz's lawyer - claimed the
government withheld from him its knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's
presence in the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of
Volpe's intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent
to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr.
Louima," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony, James Burns, a former senior official of the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, described an interview with Wiese days
after the incident in which that officer identified himself as the second cop in
the bathroom and said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's
front desk.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Burns, Wiese said he helped Volpe escort Louima toward the
arrest processing room and was surprised when Volpe took a sharp right to the
bathroom, saying he wanted to "clean up the prisoner."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and found Volpe,
broomstick in hand, with his foot on the prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he
dragged Louima away from the toilet by his legs as Volpe explained that the man
had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police officer admitted he told police and state investigators he
didn't know who escorted Louima to the station house bathroom, but named Schwarz
when questioned months later by the FBI and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake... it was a mistake not to do so," Officer Mark Schofield
said when defense lawyers pressed him to explain his failure to tell what he
knew to police Internal Affairs Bureau detectives and the Brooklyn district
attorney when questioned days after the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that anyone told him to lie.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dispatching an election-year valentine, Republicans won
House passage Thursday of legislation that would cut income taxes $182 billion
over 10 years for all married taxpayers, including the 25 million couples who
pay a ``marriage penalty'' compared with single people.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote, timed to coincide with Valentine's Day next week, was 268-158 to
send the bill to the Senate. Although 48 Democrats joined all Republicans in
favor, it was short of a veto-proof edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate passage is far from certain and President Clinton is threatening a
veto over the bill's cost and timing, yet House GOP leaders trumpeted the
measure as the first in a series of tax cuts that would return a portion of
projected budget surpluses to taxpayers and limit the growth of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need a tax code that doesn't punish married couples,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``They need to buy braces for the kids. They need
to buy insurance for the car and the home. They don't need the federal
government picking their pocket.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day for politicians of every stripe to ally themselves with the
popular issue, even if they opposed this particular bill. Despite his veto
warning, Clinton said at a Capitol Hill appearance, ``We know we should do
this.'' However, he wants marriage penalty tax relief targeted more toward
lower- and middle-class taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are united in saying, `Let's do it now,''' Clinton told a Democratic
rally.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``marriage penalty'' occurs because millions of couples who file joint
tax returns are forced to pay taxes at higher rates than they would if they were
single and filing separately, especially if each spouse earns roughly the same
income. The penalty strikes most frequently at income levels between $20,000 and
$75,000 and costs couples an average of $1,400 a year, according to
congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill would cut taxes for those couples as well as millions of others
who already get a marriage ``bonus,'' mainly those in which one spouse earns the
lion's share of family income. It would gradually expand the bottom 15 percent
tax bracket to apply to more of a married couple's income, boost the standard
deduction in 2001 for married filers to twice that of singles and raise the
income cap to allow more lower-income couples to claim the earned income tax
credit.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 million married couples filed joint income tax returns in 1997, the
most recent year complete statistics are available from the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats complained that half of the bill's total tax cut would go to
couples who already receive a bonus and would consume a large chunk of the
projected budget surplus before plans are laid to ensure the future solvency of
Social Security and Mecidare, to pay down the national debt and to guarantee
adequate government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans want to have a political gimmick for Valentine's Day,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``If they just want a political issue, they've
got it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats also said two-thirds of the tax cuts would go to couples earning
more than $75,000 a year once it is fully phased in by 2008, and would entangle
some of them in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republicans, who are pushing a series of tax cuts that were part of last
year's vetoed $792 billion, 10-year tax cut, said their marriage bill would help
stay-at-home mothers and couples who itemize their tax deductions such as
homeowners, unlike narrower ``marriage penalty'' bills proposed by Clinton and
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want bigger government and they want the American people to pay for
it,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip. ``Marriage is
sacred, not taxable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political undercurrents of Thursday's vote were apparent on an issue
Republicans believe they can use against Democrats in the fall election in
competitive House districts. Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., recited how many married
taxpayers lived in many individual Democratic opponent's districts during floor
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You may be able to explain your opposition to them, but I sure can't,''
Weller said each time.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage of the Republican bill came after the House defeated by 233-192 a
Democratic alternative costing $95 billion over 10 years that was geared more
toward middle- and lower-income married couples.
</P>
<P>
	   That bill also would not have taken effect until Congress adopted a
``framework'' to guarantee Social Security and Medicare and to pay down the
national debt. Clinton, meanwhile, has proposed $45 billion in ``marriage
penalty'' relief, although his plan would not help couples who itemize and is
focused on those with dual incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their opposition to the GOP plan, Democrats were clearly wary of the
issue's political potency. At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
GOP bill was based on ``fantasy budget numbers'' but said Clinton was willing to
work out a compromise
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told
reporters, ``There is a real good possibility we'll pass some form of marriage
penalty tax relief this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said the issue was
``a top priority'' for his panel. ``We look forward to righting this wrong.''
--------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is H.R. 6.

<HEADLINE> Details of Marriage Penalty Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Details of the House Republican bill to cut income taxes for many married
couples, including those who have a ``marriage penalty,'' paying more income
taxes than they would if they were single, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
Total cost: $182.3 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --Adjusts upward for married couples the bottom 15 percent income tax
bracket to make it double that of single filers by 2008. If it had been in place
this year, couples would have paid a 15 percent rate on their first $52,500 of
taxable income, compared with $43,850 in current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to twice that of single filers beginning in 2001. Using this year's
numbers, the deduction would rise from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 beginning in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Official Doubts Spy Device's Effect  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's doubtful the Russians gleaned any vital American
national security secrets from a bug planted at the State Department, even
though some sensitive subjects were discussed in the seventh-floor room where it
was located, the department's top security official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Carpenter, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security,
blamed a post-Cold War relaxation in security programs and budget cuts for the
department's vulnerability. ``It takes very little imagination for one to
surmise that the Russian intelligence service took advantage of our posture,''
he told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said security was being improved even before the bug was found, with
escorts now required of nearly all visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter said it still isn't clear how the listening device was implanted
in a strip of wall molding, or by whom. The FBI is continuing to investigate but
faces a lack of detailed records on who had access to the room, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that clearly the device was installed ``in multiple visits to the
conference room.''
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, the investigation confirmed ``this was indeed a Russian
intelligence operation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the United States ordered the expulsion of Russian diplomat
Stanislav Gusev after the listening device was found. Gusev was arrested by FBI
agents outside the State Department, where he was allegedly listening in his car
to transmissions from the device.
</P>
<P>
	   As Gusev was being investigated, American agents even helped arrange for him
to find parking spaces nearer to the State Department so he could be more
closely observed, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the conference room where the bug was planted was on the same floor
as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's office, it is on the other side of
the sprawling building.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, the room was used for a variety of meetings, including some during
which classified material was discussed, Carpenter said. One such meeting was
held by a department group that deals with intelligence matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Carpenter said only material with moderate classification levels
had been discussed, not the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on
international operations, called the department's security system ``porous.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am concerned the State Department has become a soft target for foreign
intelligence services because of a lack of security consciousness in the State
Department culture,'' Grams said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was held amid rising congressional concern about security
breaches, after the recent disclosure that former CIA Director John Deutch
violated security rules in 1996 by using an unsecured home computer attached to
the Internet to work on highly classified intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, who has been stripped of his security clearances, so far has
declined to appear before congressional oversight panels. But Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday he
thought a deal was close under which Deutch would appear before his panel soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Carpenter said Gusev, whom he identified as a Russian intelligence officer,
had been seen visiting the State Department twice or more each week, where he
``walked the streets and fussed about in his car.''
</P>
<P>
	   He often parked right alongside the State Department when he could find
space, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once we realized what he was doing, space was always available,''
Carpenter said.

<HEADLINE> Va.'s Newseum Has Campaign Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Political junkies who don't get enough in the current
presidential campaign can relive 26 more of them starting Friday at a new museum
exhibit that covers a century of politics from William McKinley to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The special exhibit at the Newseum in Arlington, Va. dates back to the 1896
re-election of McKinley and includes a huge photo of his Ohio home, where he
personally received 750,000 potential voters in his original "front-porch"
campaign, said Joe Urschel, Newseum executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The advent of "whistle stop" campaign tours, which emphasized efforts to
reach even communities so small the trains only stopped when the station
signaled, is represented by William Jennings Bryan, McKinley's unsuccessful
Democratic opponent who set out on the rails for a long series of appearances
around the country. Recordings of both candidates can be heard, including
Bryan's famous "Cross of Gold" speech about the use of silver in U.S. coins.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the exhibit, called "Every Four Years," is a state-of-the-art
computer where visitors can call up the multitude of Internet sites spawned by
campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   An illuminated logo of an elephant-and-donkey, representing the two major
parties, moves along the floor to entice visitors into the show from one of the
main exhibits at the museum of news and the media.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1896 segment, visitors can follow presidential races in big panels
with memorable photos like the one of President Harry Truman after his 1948
victory, gleefully showing off the erroneous banner newspaper headline "Dewey
Defeats Truman."
</P>
<P>
	   A caption near that photo carries a quotation from James Reston of the New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before we in the newspaper business spend all our time and energy analyzing
Governor Dewey's failure in the election," Reston wrote, "maybe we ought to try
and analyze our own failure. For that failure is almost as spectacular as the
President's victory, and the quicker we admit it the better off we'll be."
</P>
<P>
	   A less familiar photo shows the 350-pound President William H. Taft on a
horse.
</P>
<P>
	   President Theodore Roosevelt, a famous outdoorsman, advised Taft that it
wasn't a good campaign image.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard on the horse," Roosevelt explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half the races covered in the exhibit were heavily influenced by
candidates' TV ads, and a 126-foot screen stretching along the gallery exhibits
a series of them. Old newsreels and more recent TV coverage also appear.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the whole length of the screen, just underneath, runs a line of lights
with up-to-the-minute headlines of Associated Press stories that continue even
when the Newseum is closed, recalling how much else goes on in the world besides
politics.

<HEADLINE> Halston Unveils Fall Fashions  </HEADLINE>
    By Francine Parnes
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new head designer at Halston likes to keep things
short, be it his "don't-bend-over" hemlines, or his Fashion Week show, which he
promised would last no longer than 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will take longer to say 'Hi' to everyone and kiss them hello," predicted
Craig Natiello before his fall preview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Natiello did take enough time to revive many Halston signature touches:
sporty evening wear such as casual mohair sweaters with sequined miniskirts,
long, lean and slinky gowns, and Ultrasuede, which he fashioned into the
shortest of skirts.
</P>
<P>
	   He trotted out at least 10 of those "snotty little black dresses that you
wear to a party," some with fox cuffs or with his typically high-slit sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Plenty of Oscar-night dresses were also shown, to please the battalion of
Hollywood stylists in the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Natiello, who worked 10 years at Bill Blass, most recently as senior
designer, landed at the helm of Halston last December.
</P>
<P>
	   Randolph Duke also previewed his line Thursday, showing award-night sexy
looks that just might entice such customers as Minnie Driver, Jennifer Aniston,
Lisa Kudrow and Kim Basinger.
</P>
<P>
	   Out came slit skirts that can zip high on the thigh, evening gowns in tweed,
fringe and beading, showy optical prints and ostrich feathers for flash and
dazzle. Inspired by menswear, Duke stitched up houndstooth, which he beaded onto
chiffon strapless dresses and evening pants.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love the contrast of a woman in a menswear check or herringbone," said
Duke.
</P>
<P>
	   For the third time this week, anti-fur protesters disrupted the show.
</P>
<P>
	   When one Duke model walked the runway in a sable hooded cape, an anti-fur
protester pulled red paint out from underneath his coat and tossed it at the
model, according to Stan Herman, president of 7th on Sixth, the organization
that runs Fashion Week. The protester was quickly arrested, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "(He) got the paint on us, not the model, that's the ridiculous part," said
Phillip Bloch, a noted Hollywood celebrity stylist. "Besides, I'm wearing a
vintage bear coat that's like 80 years old. The bear would've been dead by now
anyway."
</P>
<P>
	   The paint splattered approximately five front row members, including CNN
style reporter Elsa Klensch. Elycia Rubin, a fashion director for Style and E!
Entertainment TV, was knocked from her chair but remained unfazed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't get upset over paint on my shoes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, anti-fur protesters interrupted shows at Oscar de la
Renta and Michael Kors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Michael Kors served up a tribute to cosmopolitan America.
Well, a tiny slice of it, anyway. "It's for a woman who's busy, active and
travels, but always considers Park Avenue home," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rich-girl looks were deluxe and took their cue from the glamour of the
Art Deco 1930s. Kors envisioned his customer in ostrich boas, fedoras, diamonds,
and tailored suits with strong shoulders. Intricate geometric beading and silk
gowns in shades of platinum and steel reflected the architecture of the era.
</P>
<P>
	   At Anna Sui, a studied mismatch was the message. The funky downtown designer
opted for chaos, with crazy, mixed-up color combos like purple leather jackets
with lime silk shirts, loopy patchwork crochet on boots, and outrageous
textures, including long shimmy fringe cascading from skirts.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's new in fashion are all those broken rules," said Sui. "You're not
bound by this-goes-with-this. It's a little disturbing, because it's not the way
you would normally picture it, but that's what makes it modern."

<HEADLINE> NC Textile Workers Exult in Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- Workers at six North Carolina mills exulted
Thursday in their ratification of a three-year contract that sealed the biggest
union victory in the history of the Southern textile industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never felt so proud working on my machine as I do now after winning
this contract," said Kemberly Taylor, a 17-year hem-stitcher for Fieldcrest
Cannon. "We've done what a lot of people said we could never do."
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't just for us. It's for our mothers and fathers who have worked in
these mills and have struggled for so many years," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, ratified by 90 percent of the union members who voted,
concluded a quarter-century struggle to organize 5,000 workers at six Fieldcrest
plants in two North Carolina counties. The contract also covers 3,500 workers at
other plants in North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama where Fieldcrest
makes its towels, sheets and comforters.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, after four failed tries dating to 1974, textile workers at the
six North Carolina plants voted 2,270-2,102 to be represented by the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney called it the greatest union victory at a
Southern textile mill -- bigger than the 1973 J.P. Stevens plant election in
Roanoke Rapids on which the movie "Norma Rae" was based.
</P>
<P>
	   It came in a state with the lowest percentage of unionized workers, at 4.2
percent, and an industry that has long been hostile to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract reached last weekend gives the Fieldcrest workers higher wages
and better pensions and other benefits.

<HEADLINE> Community Centers Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The administration has turned after-school learning
centers meant to bolster the technology, literacy and other skills of
communities into little more than ``glorified baby-sitting'' for children,
critics contended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Education Department undermines the broader-based goals of the program
by directing grant money to elementary and middle schools rather than high
schools and community organizations that could serve older children and adults
with better resources and equipment, lawmakers were told.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Community organizations bring fresh ideas and new ways of thinking to the
table,'' Lynne Vaughan, a YMCA executive, told the House Education and Workforce
subcommittee on early childhood, youth, and families. ``There are organizations
in these communities that have the capacity to operate a quality after-school
program.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Michael Cohen, an aide to Education Secretary Richard Riley, said the
2,100 school-based 21st Century Community Learning Centers are ``sound, strong
and moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his fiscal 2001 budget, President Clinton is seeking to double program
funds to $1 billion, increasing the number of centers to 4,000 by the next
academic year. About 500,000 children use the centers, more than 80 percent of
which also serve adults, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we have strayed as far as you think we have,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who five years ago helped create the
federally funded centers, said concentrating most of the centers in elementary
and middle schools defeats the intended purpose of offering a variety of
community-based training programs. Such schools, Gunderson said, are
ill-equipped to handle much beyond child care.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1994 law, centers must offer at least four programs from a list
that includes activities geared toward senior citizens, nutrition and health
education, parenting, employment counseling, technology training and child care
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, while the department's focus on keeping younger children off
the streets in safer environments is laudable, it may be duplicating other
federally funded efforts, said Gunderson, now a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Otherwise this is nothing more than glorified baby-sitting and I don't
think there's anybody in this room who wants that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The full committee chairman, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., asked the Education
Department to study the centers' effectiveness before asking for more money.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said the centers were meeting educational needs and social services
for everyone. He said that a Tucson, Ariz., center tutors 1,000 students in math
and computer skills, while a Detroit charter school's center trains parents on
computers and offers everyone drug-abuse awareness and conflict resolution
counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   Chantal Cotton, a 13-year-old eighth grader from Flint, Mich., told
lawmakers that youngsters have to learn at her after-school center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tutoring is from 2:30 to 4,'' she explained. ``Then we have recreation. If
the kids want to do recreation, they have to do something educational first.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Department to help implement "reentry courts" for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Calling the difficulties ex-prisoners face when they try
to re-enter society "one of the most pressing problems we face as a nation,"
Attorney General Janet Reno announced Thursday that the Justice Department will
help implement new "re-entry courts" so that fewer people end up back in prison.
<P>
	   "This problem has received too little attention for too long," Reno told
about 600 people at Manhattan's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, of the
City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative uses the power of judicial authority to more closely monitor
released offenders and provide support for the offenders' reintegration into the
community. The Justice Department will help re-entry court programs in
California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, New York, Ohio and West
Virginia, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Too often, offenders leave prison and return to the community without
necessary supervision, jobs and housing," she said. "The re-entry court would
promote positive behavior by linking released offenders to agencies and
community organizations that provide these services, while also using its powers
of punishment to be sure the individual stays on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   Support for the initiatives comes as the nation's prisons grapple with a
record number of prisoners - and a record number of offenders up for release.
There are now 1.2 million people in federal and state prisons, compared to
320,000 in 1989. This year, 585,000 prisoners are expected to return to society,
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of the nation's released offenders are rearrested within three
years of their release, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have so little chance of getting off on the right foot unless we do
things the right way," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said the nine states participating in the program will tailor their
re-entry courts to state laws and local needs, but all programs will include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Offender assessment and planning, which will bring together re-entry court
personnel such as a judge, parole or probation officer, to explain the re-entry
process to the prisoner and identify his or her needs upon release.
</P>
<P>
	   - Active offender oversight, which would include routine judicial visits
with all offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   - Accountability to the community, to include the development of initiatives
to ensure that offenders are held accountable both to victims and the community.
</P>
<P>
	   - A predetermined range of sanctions for violations of the conditions of
release that can be swiftly, predictably and universally applied.
</P>
<P>
	   - Access to an array of support services including substance abuse
treatment, job training programs, private employers, faith-based institutions,
housing services and community service providers.
</P>
<P>
	   - Rewards for successful offender behavior and compliance with the
conditions of release.
</P>
<P>
	   There are currently no funds for the re-entry court program, but Reno said
the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs will work closely with each
area to see how existing federal, state or local resources can be used to
support the programs. She said that President Clinton has requested $60 million
in the 2001 budget to expand offender re-entry initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Computer Expert To Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet next week with the nation's
top computer security experts and technology executives in light of the attacks
against some of the most prominent companies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly what happened this week will be at the top of the agenda,''
David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said the meeting was not called directly in response to this
week's attacks but was organized on the heels of the president's budget proposal
for $2.03 billion to protect the country's most important computer systems from
cyber attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House meeting also will include Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, and the president's chief of staff, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said others invited include executives from companies involved in
e-commerce and computer networks, leaders from industry associations and
academic experts who study online security.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, the Defense Department said all its computers with
Internet access will be checked to verify that they were not used as unwitting
agents in the massive attacks this week on Internet electronic commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Services Administration also alerted all federal agencies to
ways they can prevent hackers from using electronic tools on their computers
that might have been surreptitiously installed.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the Treasury Department said it is being especially watchful. ``As a
result of increased hacking activity, we are more vigilant in monitoring our
security firewalls that protects our system,'' a Treasury spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said there is no evidence to
suggest that Pentagon computers were involved in the attacks, but the hard
drives of the more than 1 million computers with Internet access will be checked
anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just think it's a prudent thing to check,'' said Quigley, noting that
the Defense Department is the largest computer user in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The computers will be checked for the presence of ``distributed denial of
service'' tools like those used in this week's attacks. Hackers can hide these
tools, known as daemons, on hundreds or even thousands of third-party computers
and then trigger them from a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a
single target.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Earnings Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn on Thursday reported
fourth-quarter profits rose 11 percent due to surging sales for its glaucoma and
overactive bladder drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company reported some disappointing news on its experimental
anti-depression drug that is awaiting U.S. approval. Pharmacia said Vestra
failed to perform better than a placebo in one of two U.S. clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how that disclosure will impact obtaining Food and Drug
Administration approval, though it could hurt sales if Vestra is cleared for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacia, the maker of Nicorette smoking cessation products and Rogaine for
baldness, said its net earnings, adjusted for legal costs and the sales and
acquisitions of some businesses, rose to $261 million, or 50 cents per share, up
from $235 million, or 45 cents per share a year ago. Results matched
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the impact of its recent acquisition of South San Francisco
biotech company Sugen Inc. and the sale of most of its nutrition business,
profits for the October-December quarter jumped 75 percent, to $214 million, or
40 cents per share, from $122 million, or 22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 5 percent, to $1.94 billion from $1.85 billion. Adjusting for
1998 and 1999 divestments of parts of the nutrition business, sales were up to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, profits adjusted for the divestments and
</P>
<P>
	   other factors hit $944 million, for $1.80 per share. That was up 13.6
percent from net earnings of $631 million, or $1.58 per share, in 1998. Sales
for 1999 rose 12 percent, to $7.2 billion from $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Xalatan, the company's biggest seller and the world's No. 1
glaucoma medication, were up 53 percent for the year to $507 million. Sales rose
53 percent in the fourth quarter to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overactive bladder drugs Detrol and Detrusitol saw sales jump 162 percent to
$329 million for the year, with a 33 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for growth hormone Genotropin, contraceptive injection Depo-Provera
and colorectal cancer drug Camptosar all increased significantly, while sales of
anti-anxiety pill Xanax dropped 15 percent to $72.5 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Last December, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced plans to buy St. Louis-based
Monsanto Co. for about $27 billion. The deal is expected to close by summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Pharmacia fell $1.50 to $50 in midafternoon New York Stock
Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> Greece Cited for Laxity on Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
   By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should continue excluding Greece from a
visa waiver program until it arrests members of a terrorist group that has
killed four Americans since 1975, lawmakers were told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Greece has one of the world's worst records in combatting terrorism, Wayne
Merry, a former diplomat who served at the U.S. Embassy in Athens, told a House
Judiciary immigration subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until the Greek government takes the minimal step of apprehending the
murderers of our diplomatic and military representatives, I believe the United
States should deny approbation to Greek law enforcement through waiving the visa
requirement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Merry, a director of the Atlantic Council of the United States, a private
foundation, was referring to the Greek domestic terrorist organization called
November 17 whose 21 victims since 1975 include four Americans, among them the
CIA station chief in Athens, and one U.S. Embassy employee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not a single member of this group has even been identified, apprehended or
punished in any way,'' Merry said. ``Last year it carried out five attacks,
nearly killing the German and Dutch ambassadors.''
</P>
<P>
	   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, is considering
whether to extend a program that was begun in 1988 and now covers 29 countries,
including most of Europe, Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the program, tourists and business people with return tickets can stay
up to 90 days in the United States without a visa. Americans get the same
privileges in trips to those countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying for the administration, Mary A. Ryan, assistant secretary of
state for consular affairs, said Greece has been told it will qualify for the
visa waiver when it tightens its passport procedures against fraud, strengthens
its work in the European Union's crime-fighting accord and takes certain other
steps.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the committee's ranking minority member,
said nations in the Caribbean and Africa should be considered for the visa
waivers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- A car that exploded Thursday in a West Bank
village, killing one Palestinian and injuring another, was carrying explosives
meant for an attack on an Israeli army base, Israel army radio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Military sources quoted by the radio said the victims were members of Hamas
-- the militant Islamic movement opposed to peace between Israel and the
Palestinians -- and they planned to plant the bomb on a road leading to a nearby
Israeli military outpost.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabil Ali, 21, died of his injuries several hours after the blast, officials
at Rafidia hospital in Nablus said. The other Palestinian, Osaid Salah Sarhan,
22, was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian security officials would not say what caused the blast. The car
exploded early Thursday in the village of Burkin, south of the West Bank town of
Nablus.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army imposed a curfew on Burkin, which is under joint
Israeli-Palestinian control. Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian Cabinet minister, said
Israeli and Palestinian security forces are cooperating in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaath would not say whether the explosion was an aborted terror attack, but
added: ``Our standing position is to condemn terror and violence, whoever is the
perpetrator and whoever is the victim.''

<HEADLINE> Belgium Wants Cresson Immunity Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Belgium judicial authorities have asked the
European Commission to lift the immunity of a former French prime minister in
connection with a scandal among the previous EU executive team, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Edith Cresson, France's first female premier, is wanted for questioning for
hiring a dentist friend to work at EU headquarters when she was the EU's
research commissioner, Belgian Justice Ministry spokeswoman Rosanne Germonprez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull said legal experts were studying the
request and would soon reply.
</P>
<P>
	   Revelations that dentist Rene Berthelot received an EU contract for
scientific consultancy work that he was later deemed unqualified to perform was
a major factor in forcing the resignation of Cresson and the whole EU Commission
last March.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigation by an independent panel of experts found Berthelot was paid
$135,000 but failed to produce ``even a minimum quantity of work of interest to
the Commission.''
</P>
<P>
	   Berthelot was an old friend of Cresson's from Chatellerault, a town in
central France where she was mayor from 1983 until 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresson also was accused of mismanaging programs she was responsible for
overseeing and of failing to respond to ``known serious and continuing
irregularities over several years.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report, however, found no evidence Cresson enriched herself personally
at public expense.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresson was an EU commissioner from 1995 to 1999 and French prime minister
for 10 months ending in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brussels public prosecutor's office, under magistrate Jean-Claude Van
Espen, launched an initial investigation after complaints were filed from the
European Parliament a year ago, said public prosecutor, Benois De Gryse.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was too early to say if Cresson would be charged with any
offense.
</P>
<P>
	   De Gryse said eight people including Cresson and Berthelot were included in
the investigation, with others likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresson has denied allegations Berthelot was given a fictitious job and said
that, although not a scientific expert, he had sound managerial experience,
notably in running a French hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The new EU Commission has pledged to root out corruption and nepotism in the
EU civil service.
</P>
<P>
	   EU commissioners enjoy diplomatic immunity from prosecution and questioning
by magistrates. Faull said the immunity covers former commissioners for
allegations relating to their time working for the Union, but could be lifted by
a decision by the 20-member EU executive body.

<HEADLINE> Dell Earnings Rise Slightly  </HEADLINE>
    By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose slightly
from the year-ago period, finishing ahead of analysts' reduced expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the three months ended Jan. 28 was $436 million, or 16 cents
a share, compared to $425 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago, it said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell announced two weeks ago that earnings would be below expectations,
because of problems getting computer chips and slower-than-expected post Y2K
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, who had projected
earnings for the quarter would be 21 cents per share, reduced their expectations
to 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, said
Thursday he expects revenue growth at Dell will slow from its previous torrid
pace, but that doesn't mean stockholders should go rushing to unload their
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody goes through some level of maturation," Jaruzelski said. "It was
not possible to keep up with that level of staggering growth, but it's still
staggering."
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported revenue of about $6.8 billion for the fourth quarter,
up 31 percent from the prior-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of revenue and averaged $40
million per day, up from $14 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Dell's revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of 38
percent over the prior year. Earnings were $2.5 billion, or 68 cents per share,
up 28 percent over prior-year earnings of 53 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Dell rose $2.67 to $38.23 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market
before the news was announced Thursday. In after-hours trading, shares were
drifting slightly lower.

<HEADLINE> Seagram Bounces Back From Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of The Seagram Co. rose nearly 9 percent Thursday
after it reported a big jump in net profits, bouncing back from a loss a year
ago, on gains in its music and liquor businesses. Losses in its troubled
Universal movie studio narrowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Montreal-based beverage and media company earned $557 million in the
three months ended in December, compared to a net loss of $226 million in the
same period a year ago, when the company took a $405 million charge to integrate
the Polygram music company into its operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the restructuring charge, a tax benefit and assuming the
integration of Polygram, Seagram earned $522 million, or $1.19 per share,
compared to $48 million, or 12 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The results for the company's fiscal second quarter exceeded the $1.04 per
share expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial,
and the company's shares rose sharply, gaining $4.87 1/2 to $60.68 3/4 on the
New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues slipped 1 percent to $4.97 billion from $5.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Music and spirits continued to be strong suits for Seagram, while movies
remained weak. Seagram's stock has been rising since the beginning of the year
on rumors that it might enter a deal to sell off the struggling Universal film
studio, but the company has not commented on the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   Universal Music Group, whose roster includes Shania Twain, Andrea Bocelli
and Limp Bizkit, reported a 3 percent rise in cash flow and would have had an 8
percent gain if not for foreign exchange factors.

	   New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Off 55.53
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new high
today while blue-chip stocks once again lagged, pulled down by
persistent worries that their earnings aren't growing fast enough
to offset rising interest rates. The Nasdaq rose 122.37 to close at
4,485.61. It was the fourth new closing high in five sessions for
the index, topping Tuesday's record of 4,427.50. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 55.53 to 10,643.63. Broader stock
indicators were mixed. ``Investors are seeking out the biggest
earnings gains,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. ``The companies in the
Nasdaq are probably going to grow their earnings 30 percent this
year, while the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will probably see 13.5
percent growth.''

	   Greenspan Eyes Derivative Exemption
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
urged Congress to act quickly to exempt from regulation the $80
trillion market in so-called over-the-counter derivatives. Legal
uncertainty, he said, is posing ``unacceptable risks to the
country's financial system.'' Derivatives are financial instruments
whose value depends on the value or change in value of an
underlying security, commodity or asset. They are used by
businesses to guard against losses from unexpected market movements
but also by high-risk investment funds to speculate, and played a
key role in the near-collapse in September 1998 of hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management, which sent shock waves through world
financial markets.

the negotiations were part of an effort to focus UPI on the

the end of February. He declined to be more specific, but did
acknowledge that a sale to an Internet company was a possibility.

	   PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn today reported
fourth-quarter profits rose 11 percent due to surging sales for its
glaucoma and overactive bladder drugs. But the company reported
some disappointing news on its experimental anti-depression drug
that is awaiting U.S. approval. Pharmacia said Vestra failed to
perform better than a placebo in one of two U.S. clinical trials.
It is unclear how that disclosure will affect obtaining Food and
Drug Administration approval, though it could hurt sales if Vestra
is cleared for marketing.

said today that it earned $513 million, or $1.45 a share, for the
quarter ending Jan. 29, compared with earnings of $478 million, or
$1.31 per share. Sales were $4.70 billion, up from $4.52 billion a

the fourth quarter and credited strong performances in its
agricultural and pharmaceutical businesses. Monsanto, which is
preparing to merge with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said net income totaled
$69 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of $603
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. The 1998 loss reflected
restructuring charges and research project costs. Excluding
restructuring costs and other special items, earnings for the
October-December period totaled $115 million, or 18 cents a share,
compared with $27 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. The
results matched the 18 cents expected by analysts.

debate on how world trade can be made free and fair. The weeklong
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development opens Saturday, bringing
together thousands of officials from 180 countries and
organizations. It is the first major trade forum since World Trade
Organization talks collapsed in Seattle two months ago because of
deep divisions over trade liberalization. Critics of the WTO, which
sets world trade rules, say rich countries have profited far more
than poor ones from current free trade agreements and that workers
have often lost their job security.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution says witnesses heard Volpe promise to "say nothin"'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors said Thursday they had witnesses
ready to testify that on the day he agreed to plead guilty to a sodomy attack on
Abner Louima, officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer for fellow officer Charles
Schwarz that he would "say nothin"' to implicate Schwarz in the crime.
<P>
	   The surprise move, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson,
injected a new element into the trial of Schwarz and two other officers for
conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Louima's civil rights
when Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty. Schwarz was convicted and faces a
possible life sentence. His appeal for a new trial was rejected by Nickerson
last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, face up
to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20, when, during a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, "confronted Volpe in the lobby" and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, currently defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial
in Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
"They know where to find me," he said. "I'd be happy to respond to a subpoena."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers in the Brooklyn trial declined comment but Bruder attorney Stuart
London said they would confer on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors' letter, dated Feb. 9, said the government hoped to call
"one or more witnesses who overheard the conversation between Volpe and Worth,"
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe pleaded guilty on May 25 to sodomizing Louima with a broken broomstick
in August, 1997. He said a second, unnamed officer took part.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing in December 1998, where he drew a 30-year term, Volpe said
for the first time that the "second officer" in the bathroom during the attack
on Louima was not Schwarz, but Wiese, who did not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial, Worth - then Schwarz's lawyer - claimed the
government withheld from him its knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's
presence in the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of
Volpe's intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent
to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr.
Louima," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvyn Kornberg, who was Volpe's attorney, described the letter as "grasping
at straws" by the state. "It shows the prosecutors are mortally afraid of Mr.
Volpe's testimony," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony, James Burns, a former senior official of the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, described an interview with Wiese days
after the incident in which that officer identified himself as the second cop in
the bathroom and said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's
front desk.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Burns, Wiese said he helped Volpe escort Louima toward the
arrest processing room and was surprised when Volpe took a sharp right to the
bathroom, saying he wanted to "clean up the prisoner."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and found Volpe,
broomstick in hand, with his foot on the prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he
dragged Louima away from the toilet by his legs as Volpe explained that the man
had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police officer admitted he told police and state investigators he
didn't know who escorted Louima to the station house bathroom, but named Schwarz
when questioned months later by the FBI and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake... it was a mistake not to do so," Officer Mark Schofield
said when defense lawyers pressed him to explain his failure to tell what he
knew to police Internal Affairs Bureau detectives and the Brooklyn district
attorney when questioned days after the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that anyone told him to lie.

<HEADLINE> Truckers cruise statehouse to demand relief from high fuel prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Horns blaring, engines roaring and transmissions
stuck in first gear, about 100 trucks slowly circled the streets around the
Statehouse on Thursday morning to protest steep increases in diesel fuel and to
ask Gov. Christie Whitman for help.
<P>
	   The protest, organized by independent truckers from southern New Jersey,
tied up traffic in the capitol area for several hours. But most of the
slow-moving rigs crept along just enough to avoid running afoul of police who
kept a close eye on the procession.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're here today to send a message to the governor about the impact these
fuel prices are having on our industry," said Thomas Pokrywka, president of the
Owner Operator Trucking Association of South Jersey. "We're asking the governor
if we can temporarily repeal the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need the governor to know this isn't a situation that can go on for the
next few months until prices go down in the spring," he said. "A lot of guys
won't make it 'till spring. You have truckers who now have to choose whether to
put fuel in the tank or food on the table. It's that bad."
</P>
<P>
	   One trucker who's having trouble making ends meet is Ed, an independent
driver from Vineland who allowed a reporter to ride with him during the protest
on the condition his last name not be published. He contracts with companies to
haul loads of gravel, sand or other materials to and from construction sites six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Normally I spend $75 a day on fuel," he said, while inching his shiny black
dump truck and its 100-gallon tank along West State Street and waving to fellow
truckers. "Now I'm paying $160. The other day I paid $172.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, it's costing all of us 15 to 30 percent more to operate," said
Ed, who's been driving a truck for three years. "I have a wife, two kids, a
mortgage and a dozen credit cards."
</P>
<P>
	   He said others will soon feel the same pinch truckers are feeling.
</P>
<P>
	   "What people don't realize is it's going to hit them soon, too," he said.
"Everything you buy comes off a truck somewhere down the line. You'll pay more
for food at the grocery store. Then you'll go to Wal-Mart and pay more there,
too."
</P>
<P>
	   Ed said truckers don't understand the rapid run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody is telling us why this is happening," he said. "Nobody understands
why."
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Dressler, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers
Association, said the price increases were caused by Middle East oil-producing
nations agreeing to cut back production, driving up the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
	   He and other truckers said they hoped Whitman would use her influence with
federal authorities to start a government investigation into possible price
gouging by refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks ago, the governor wrote to President Clinton asking him to help
bring down the cost of home heating oil and diesel fuel by releasing some oil
from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. She also asked to have the
appropriate federal agencies investigate possible price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said Thursday she will ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
as a last resort to allow New Jersey to burn oil with a higher sulfur content so
that more fuel would be available until prices come down.
</P>
<P>
	   And U.S. Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly, asked U.S. Secretary of Energy
Bill Richardson on Thursday to release petroleum reserves, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman did not address the truckers' request for a temporary fuel tax
repeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "To do something like that would require legislation, and the governor feels
this is something that needs to be addressed immediately, which is why she's
focused on things like getting fuel released from the strategic reserve," said
spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers said the rapid increase in diesel fuel prices is forcing many
truckers to park their rigs.
</P>
<P>
	   "How does fuel go from 87 cents a gallon in September to $1.97 now?" asked
Rollo LaSasso of Hammonton, a driver for Habina Trucking in Blackwood. "Our
company has 12 to 14 trucks, and they've all been parked for a week. It's just
not feasible to run the equipment."
</P>
<P>
	   Pokrywka said most independent truckers have contracts with their customers
to haul goods or materials at a set price.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't go back to them and ask them to pay 20 to 30 percent more because
fuel costs went up," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vehicles, mostly dump trucks, met up in Hammonton and formed a convoy
along Route 206 into Trenton, where they began slowly circling the blocks in
front of the Statehouse before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Trenton police issued two summonses to truckers involved in the
demonstration, said Sgt. Don Berry. One was for running a red light; he did not
know what the other was for. He also said two television cameramen covering the
protest were issued summonses for interfering with traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar protest occurred Wednesday in Rhode Island, where about 60 trucks
circled the capitol building.

<HEADLINE> Agency OKs Nazi Insurance Claims  </HEADLINE>
    By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international commission next week will start its
long-awaited program to pay Jewish families still owed money from Nazi-era
insurance policies, the head of the commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   And the U.S. government's top researcher on art plundered by the Nazis also
estimated Thursday that in the 12 years of Adolf Hitler's rule, Germans stole
600,000 works of art from Jews in Germany and from countries they occupied in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony came as the House Banking Committee ended two days of hearings
into the progress of a number of compensation programs for Holocaust-era
victims, including those to pay former slave and forced laborers, and to
compensate for money deposited in Swiss banks and never returned to heirs.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence S. Eagleburger, chairman of the insurance commission, told the
committee that his panel will announce Tuesday a toll-free phone number and
other details for families who want to file claims for payments never made after
the policyholders were killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the claims programs, which took nearly a year to set up, a step
towards "doing justice to ... a substantial number of people who have not had
justice done to them for some six decades."
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger negotiated the program with Jewish representatives and five
European insurance companies that now have subsidiaries in the United States.
They are Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, Allianz of Germany, AXA of France, and
two companies from Switzerland: Winterthur, and Zurich.
</P>
<P>
	   Still to be worked out is exactly how much money there will be, Eagleburger
said. The insurance compensation program is part of the so-called German
foundation initiative, a fund not yet established by German government and
industry, mainly to pay people forced into labor by Germany's wartime regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The government and businesses have pledged to contribute $5.2 billion in
exchange for a promise the U.S. government will oppose the filing of further
American lawsuits against German companies for Holocaust-related wrongs.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger also said there are more insurance companies that operated
during the era that should participate: Aegon, CGU, Gerling, Munich Re, Sorema,
Royal &AMP; Sun Alliance, Swiss Life and Prudential.
</P>
<P>
	   Eagleburger did not release the number of claims he thought there would be,
nor the total number of companies that have failed to pay Holocaust-era
policies. But others have previously put the number of claimants in the hundreds
thousands and the number of companies that may have not paid on policies at
around 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Petropoulos, research director for art on the Presidential Advisory
Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, testified that the new
600,000 figure on looted art includes paintings, sculpture, objets d'art,
tapestries, but excludes furniture, books stamps or coins.
</P>
<P>
	   Petropolous said 44 countries are taking part in the search for
still-missing items.

<HEADLINE> Costly High-Tech Band Aid Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson unveiled its newest and highest priced
Band-Aid on Thursday, a bandage you can wear for several days and which is
designed to eliminate the formation of scabs that can cause scars.
</P>
<P>
	   The company claims its Band-Aid Brand Advanced Healing Strips is a
breakthrough in healing wounds more efficiently, and is more comfortable than
existing products. There's no proof, though, that it heals wounds any quicker
than traditional adhesive bandages, J&AMP;J said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new bandage, expected to be on store shelves by April, will be sure to
give consumers sticker shock. At $3.79 for a box of 10, it will be at least
eight times more expensive than typical bandages.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J said it hopes consumers will be willing to pay more for the product
because the same bandage can be worn for several days, including in showers and
baths. Most bandages need to be changed daily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Advanced Healing Strip does not have the little white absorbent pad in
the middle. Instead, the entire bandage is an absorbent layer made from a
material that absorbs moisture.
</P>
<P>
	   Particles in the bandage absorb fluid that oozes out of the wound and form a
white gel that provides extra cushioning from bumping and reinjury.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining just the right amount of moisture around the wound is key to
giving skin cells the optimal environment to grow new tissue, said Dr. David
Margolis, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania
Health System.
</P>
<P>
	   Margolis said the technology J&AMP;J is using is similar to bandages used by
hospitals and doctors treating patients with chronic wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   J&AMP;J is not the first company to employ this special material called
hydrocolloid technology in a retail product. Spenco Medical Corp., a privately
held and much smaller business based in Waco, Texas, introduced a hydrocolloid
bandage in 1998. Its products are not as widely distributed as J&AMP;J's.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers beginning looking at cable TV rates again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State lawmakers are showing renewed interest in
rising cable TV rates.
<P>
	   The Assembly telecommunications committee held a brief hearing Thursday to
air the issue, listening to state regulators before adjourning without action or
discussion on any bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the mere mention of the subject was enough to draw an array of cable TV
executives and lobbyists to listen in. None spoke.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Senate's Democratic minority leader, Sen. Richard Codey,
D-Essex, said he intends to make an issue of cable prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly committee chairwoman, Assemblywoman Carol Murphy, R-Morris,
said Thursday's hearing was called because of constituent concerns.
</P>

	   "We get a lot of calls," Murphy said. "There are a lot of complaints. ... We
don't always have the answers, and clearly we need to get them from the people
who have the answers."
</P>
<P>
	   But when pressed on possible legislative action to control rates, Murphy
balked. She said she was most interested in examining how competition would
affect rates.
</P>
<P>
	   More hearings are planned.
</P>
<P>
	   These developments threaten to rouse the sleeping giant of consumer issues:
pay television, a multibillion-dollar industry operating with exclusive
franchise rights town by town.
</P>
<P>
	   Once under strict price control, the cable TV industry is enjoying relative
freedom under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a federal law that deregulated
most aspects of cable while opening the market to new competitors such as
satellite dish networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, price deregulation took effect. It requires cable operators to
offer bare-bones cable packages at low rates that the state is permitted to
regulate.
</P>
<P>
	   No hikes are allowed without negotiations with the Office of Cable
Television, located within the agency that regulates utilities. And none have
occurred, according to director Celeste Fasone, who claims statewide rates have
actually dropped in the past six years and today average $12.77 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic cable package provides clear reception of all local broadcast
stations plus public television, C-SPAN and networks using UHF channels like Fox
and Warner Brothers. A few operators toss in TBS, ESPN or CNN, but it is not
required.
</P>
<P>
	   But few pay attention to these basic-cable packages and rates because the
vast majority of customers opt for enhanced packages. For these they pay higher
prices not regulated by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Permitting the enhanced package rates to be unregulated was a mistake and
must end, Codey said, noting that few consumers in New Jersey have realistic
choices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cable companies have hammered captive subscribers across New Jersey with
rate increases that are nearly five times the rate of inflation, and
deregulation has been their enabler," Codey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Codey said his analysis of rate reports shows 25 of the state's 92 cable
systems raised rates 11 percent or more in the past year. These systems cover 40
percent of the state's 2.4 million cable TV households.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Alexander, president of the Cable Telecommunications Association,
issued a statement Thursday saying high programming costs are the "single
largest driver" behind the increases. And those are caused by things such as
deals with professional sports leagues.
</P>
<P>
	   The association statement also said it was unfair to examine prices in a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
	   "Too often, people evaluate cable prices without recognizing the fact that,
by and large, they are receiving more and better services for the money paid,"
it said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijacking Crisis Over  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANSTED, England (AP) -- About half the hostages freed from a hijacked
Afghan airliner requested asylum in Britain, but their 74 applications ran into
immediate skepticism Thursday from officials who feared the four-day drama was
all an elaborate bid to escape Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested 21 people as the standoff ended peacefully before sunrise
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At 3:50 a.m., about 85 captives -- mostly women and 21 children -- suddenly
streamed down the aircraft's rear stairs, illuminated by bright lights, their
flowing garments fluttering in the wind. The rest, including the hijackers,
filed down the stairs two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the hijackers never asked for asylum, but many others on the
flight did. Home Secretary Jack Straw told the House of Commons that Britain
would try to deport them, subject to legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, you cannot have a situation where a signal can be sent to anybody
that the way to get asylum is through hijacking a plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers took over the Ariana airline flight early Sunday on what
should have been less than an hour's flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to
the northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane made stops in Uzbekistan, Kazakstan and Russia, releasing 22
passengers. Ten more people were let go and four crew members escaped after the
plane landed early Monday at Stansted airport, 25 miles northeast of London.
That left 151 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Police gave no guarantees during the mostly calm and businesslike
negotiations, said David Stevens, chief constable of Essex County police. The
hijackers never gave a clear explanation of their aims, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It became clear in the last hour of the negotiations that they were
expressing concern about the political situation in Afghanistan,'' he said.
``For the first 75 hours, they didn't talk about the political situation at
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police recovered four handguns, five knives, one set of brass knuckles, two
detonators and two grenades, though they did not appear to have fuses, Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He anticipated a long process of interviewing all the people aboard the
aircraft, mainly through translators, to build a case.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-line Taliban government in Afghanistan sent a fax to British
authorities thanking them for ending the hijacking safely. The Taliban's civil
aviation minister, Akhtar Mohammed Manzoor, asked that the plane -- one of only
nine in the aging fleet -- and its passengers be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers ``must be punished, otherwise it will be an example for others
that they can hijack a plane and get asylum if that is what they want,'' Manzoor
said. ``It's not right that they should endanger all the passengers to get
asylum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain does not have diplomatic relations with Taliban authorities, who
practice a strict brand of Islam and control 90 percent of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council, urged the government
to be cautious about sending everyone back Afghanistan, wracked by 20 years of
war and home to one of the world's largest refugee populations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth is this is a desperate act by desperate men, desperate to get
their families to safety. It doesn't excuse it at all, but it doesn't mean we
can return people to a very dangerous situation without very careful thought,''
Hardwick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition politicians in Britain suggested the hijackers had been attracted
to the United Kingdom by a reputation for lenience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why the United Kingdom? How many European Convention on Human Rights
signatories did that plane fly over on its journey from Moscow to the U.K.?''
Conservative Party lawmaker Anne Widdecombe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain received 3,975 applications for asylum from Afghan citizens last
year, out of a total of 71,160 from all countries, the Home Office said. In
1998, there were 2,395 applications from Afghanistan, with 35 granted refugee
status and 1,500 given permission to remain.

<HEADLINE> Government releases more money to New York to help poor pay heating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration announced Thursday that it
is providing New York with an additional $34 million in emergency funds to help
low-income people deal with soaring heating oil costs.
<P>
	   The government is releasing $130 million nationally, one-third of it going
to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting," Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   New York received only $2.6 million in the Clinton administration's last
round of emergency fuel help last month. That was well below what state
officials had sought for the 1.4 million poor residents eligible for federal
assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   The spike in heating oil costs has struck particularly hard in New York,
which relies on heating oil more than any other state. Forty-three percent of
New York households use oil for heat. Of those 2.9 million households, nearly 80
percent are concentrated in New York City metropolitan area, according to F.
William Valentino, president of the New York State Energy and Research and
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   He said over the past three weeks retail heating oil prices have increased
by more than 75 cents per gallon to $2.02 per gallon on average statewide. In
the New York City area, prices are running $2.25 per gallon. Last year, the
price was 91 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Valentino testified Thursday before the House International Relations
Committee hearing on the oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   At that hearing, Democratic and Republican lawmakers blasted the Clinton
administration for not taking the problem seriously enough. They also attacked
the administration for not putting enough pressure on oil-producing nations to
loosen their stranglehold on the supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices soared after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
cut the supply by 4.3 million barrels a day last year after oil prices dipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's matter of trying to get the OPEC nations to turn on the spigot and let
the market determine what the prices should be," said the committee's chairman
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-Middletown.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices have also been pushed skyward by severe weather in the Northeast.
Frigid temperatures have forced consumers to use more oil and have clogged
waterways with ice making it more difficult for barges to deliver oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers on Thursday also questioned why the government had not released
oil from the emergency government stockpile to try to dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said unless something was done to break OPEC's
stranglehold, gas prices would also soar this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said the administration remains opposed to using the
strategic reserve to affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices,"
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said a variety of measures would be taken to try to boost
heating oil production at Northeast refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   These include issuing temporary waivers at some refineries for compliance
with clean air laws, urging refiners to defer routine maintenance and lifting
waivers on the hours that truckers carrying heating oil may work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson also said the U.S. Coast Guard was creating a task force to give
priority to heating oil shipments at terminals and the government was urging
utilities to switch from heating oil to natural gas in an effort to ease the
price crunch.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Earns $69M in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co. on Thursday reported higher earnings in the
fourth quarter and credited strong performances in its agricultural and
pharmaceutical businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto, which is preparing to merge with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said net
income totaled $69 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a loss of $603
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. The 1998 loss reflected restructuring
charges and research project costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding restructuring costs and other special items, earnings for the
October-December period totaled $115 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
$27 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The results matched the 18 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $2.34 billion, up 35 percent from $1.73 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto's shares were at $41.31 1/4 at 4:30 p.m. EST on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 93 3/4 cents or about 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, based in St. Louis, said the higher earnings were the result of
continued strength of its arthritis drug Celebrex, growth in Roundup herbicide
sales and a 48 percent increase in acreage using Monsanto's bioengineered crops.
The company also was able to reduce its debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto's merger with Pharmacia is expected to close during the first half
of the year. The merged company will be known as Pharmacia Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Monsanto earned $575 million, or 88 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $250 million, or 41 cents per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, income was $650 million, or $1 a share, in 1999,
compared with $580 million, or 93 cents a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $9.15 billion, up 26 percent from $7.24 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Quaker, Novartis in Joint Venture  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. is entering a joint venture with Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG in an attempt to woo consumers who want food
that's both nutritional and has proven health benefits
</P>
<P>
	   The new firm, Altus Food Co., will develop and market "functional foods" --
food containing ingredients said to contribute to better health -- in the United
States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said Thursday they intend to get a sizable chunk of a U.S.
market, which they estimate at between $10 billion and $20 billion and is
experiencing double-digit percentage growth annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Valentino, president and chairman of Novartis Consumer Health Inc.,
the Summit, N.J.-based arm of the Swiss conglomerate, estimated Altus could reap
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big opportunity to take advantage of an emerging food category,"
said Greg Shearson, president and general manager of Altus and former vice
president of Quaker New Ventures. He cited the aging of the population and
growing concerns about children's nutrition as prime reasons behind the rise of
functional foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Now consisting of just 20 to 30 executives from the two firms, Altus is
based in Chicago, like Quaker, and aims to have new products on the market by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Shearson wouldn't divulge financial details of the companies' 50-50
partnership or say what products are envisioned, other than that they could
include beverages, healthy snacks, cereals and side dishes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel like we're onto some early examples" of products that will "deliver
significant health benefits over and above nutrition," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Examples of such products include cholesterol-reducing cereals or healthful
energy bars.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said they will focus particularly on the health-care concerns
of women, children, athletes and older adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Novartis is one of the world's biggest health care and pharmaceutical
companies whose products also include nonprescription brands like Ex-Lax,
Maalox, Ovaltine and Gerber Foods. It recently launched the Aviva line of
functional foods in Europe, touting bone health, cardiovascular health and
digestive health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker Oats makes cereals like Cap'n Crunch and Life in addition to its
namesake oatmeal, although the sports drink Gatorade accounted for nearly 40
percent of the company's $4.73 billion in worldwide sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The joint venture follows several acquisitions by food giants of health-food
brands, including Kraft Foods Inc.'s purchase of nutrition bar maker Balance Bar
Co. and soy foods maker Boca Burger, as well as Kellogg Co.'s deal for
Worthington Foods Inc., a maker of vegetarian products.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very interesting partnership," said Nomi Ghez of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., noting that the pairing of a drug giant with a food and beverage company
with strengths in marketing and selling "makes sense." "Of course, in this
industry everything depends on the execution."
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker's stock was down $1.12 1/2 at $55.56 1/4 a share at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Crude Prices approach $30 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices moved within striking distance Thursday of $30 a barrel --
a price not seen since 1991 -- on heightened concern that fast-shrinking
inventories could soon result in shortages of refined products.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil couldn't keep up the same torrid pace, sagging on signs of
increased imports and milder weather in the Northeast that may end weeks of
price runups.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, both wheat and gold rallied strongly.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil climbed more than 2 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with
the March contract rising 66 cents to $29.43 a barrel. With a repeat
performance, the price would surpass the nine-year high of $29.95 reached in
intraday trading Jan. 20 and top $30 for the first time since the eve of the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   With inventories extraordinarily tight and refineries running at only 85
percent of capacity, the lowest rate since 1993, analysts say there's little
resistance to keep prices from surging further.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to go through $30 like a hot knife in butter," said Bill
O'Grady, energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil's rise may be slowed if OPEC nations increase production when a nearly
year-old agreement limiting output runs out next month. But the market is
increasingly concerned that the extra production still won't erase the supply
crunch for oil and gasoline as the summer driving season gets closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Underpinning the rally Thursday was Iraq's statement that it won't allow a
United Weapons inspection team into the country to restart disarmament
activities. An impasse with the West could result in Iraq halting its daily
supply of 1.5 million to 2 million barrels to the world market.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can cause a lot of havoc right now if they decide to pull the oil card
again with supplies as tight as they are," said Phil Flynn, senior markets
analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time Iraq stopped pumping oil, in November, it prompted a rally in
crude oil futures.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other energy commodities, March heating oil fell .14 cent to 74.46
cents a gallon, March unleaded gasoline rose 2.09 cents to 81.75 cents a gallon
and March natural gas rose 5.2 cents to $2.592 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude from the North Sea rose 56 cents to $27.48 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat surged to its highest level this year on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid more dry-weather forecasts for the southwestern U.S. Plains, heightening
concern about drought impact on the winter wheat crop. Strong weekly export
sales figures released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture underpinned the
rally, which helped pull other grains and soybeans higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.71 3/4 a bushel; March corn
rose 3 cents to $2.25 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 1 3/4 cent to $1.10 1/4 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 9 1/4 cents to $5.13 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold surged 3 percent higher on the Comex division of the New York Merc
after the world's No. 1 producer, AngloGold Ltd. of South Africa, announced it
had cut back on hedging, or betting on lower prices. Traders said rumors
abounded that more gold mining companies will suspend their hedging programs.
</P>
<P>
	   April gold settled up $10.10 at $318.70 per troy ounce.

<HEADLINE> Israeli: Haider Estate Deal Tainted  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Noemi Merhav remembers playing as a child in the thick
pine trees of her father's 3,700-acre estate in southern Austria. She wants her
adult son to someday visit the place her family called ``The Forest.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the expanse of timberland now belongs to Austria's far-right leader,
Joerg Haider -- acquired, according to relatives of the original Jewish owners,
in a tainted deal forced by Nazi property laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has lauded the Nazis' ``orderly employment policy'' and praised
former members of Hitler's Waffen SS, though he later apologized for the
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Merhav's brother, Alex Rofe, holds a copy of a power-of-attorney document
that could help them prove the family was pressured into selling the property to
Haider's great-uncle in 1941. The politician later inherited the land.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans by Merhav, 71, and her son to try to get back the estate they say is
worth $15 million mark the latest twist in Israel's outcry over the inclusion of
Haider's Freedom Party in the new Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel recalled its ambassador from Austria last week in protest. The United
States and Europe also have threatened diplomatic reprisals.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-time owner of the land, timber merchant Giorgio Roifer, bought the
Baerental (Bear Valley) estate for its vast expanse of pine forests.
</P>
<P>
	   A year after he died in Italy in 1938, his widow, Matilde, moved the family
to Palestine and left the property in the care of her brother-in-law, Naftoli
Emdine.
</P>
<P>
	   Emdine decided in 1941 to sell the land located in the south Austrian
province of Carinthia, Rofe said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were already pressures on Jews to sell land, and the deal was done
only months before a clause in a law was passed requiring the sale of Jewish
property to non-Jews in all Nazi-occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My uncle had been deprived of Italian citizenship, he didn't have a
passport even,'' Rofe, 67, told The Associated Press from his Jerusalem office
at Hebrew University on Thursday. ``He was really scared. ... It was sold under
duress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Emdine sold the land to Josef Webhofer, Haider's great-uncle, for what
Merhav said was 1 percent of its worth at the time. She does not know the
precise amount.
</P>
<P>
	   It ``wasn't moral'' that Webhofer agreed to take the land when her family
could not have kept it, Merhav said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Emdine might not even have had the authority to release the
land. Matilde Roifer signed over power of attorney to Emdine for only six
months, but he sold the property two years later, Merhav said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the power-of-attorney papers that Merhav and her son, Zvi, hope will
help prove their case, that the property known for its timber, sawmill and
hunting was effectively stolen from them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the other side of the power of attorney papers, the authorities wrote
that it had no value but they accept it because it was used in a sale to an
Aryan,'' Merhav said by phone from her home in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
	   Rofe has a copy of the document he obtained through Austrian journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Merhavs have yet to take any legal action, but Rofe thinks a suit is
futile. In a legal battle in 1952 to win back the estate, Matilde Roifer
accepted $120,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I doubt if there is any legal ground for action,'' Rofe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rofe, a Hebrew Bible professor, doesn't remember the land that he may have
visited only once at the age of three. But he remembers growing up thinking that
his family had the land until, when he was 13 in 1945, they learned the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I imagined that I would go there someday,'' Rofe said. ``I have never
visited.''
</P>
<P>
	   Merhav remembers a visit to the property when she was 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember thick forests and small houses near a river,'' Merhav said.
``It was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
	   The unease over Haider is shared by Israeli athletes who are in Vienna this
week to compete in the European Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were a bit afraid to come,'' said Line Haddad, an Israeli pairs skater.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were worried it could become dangerous like at the Olympics, when the
Israeli team was killed there,'' said Haddad, referring to the slayings of 11
Israeli athletes and coaches at Munich in 1972.

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Clinton Farm Aid Inadequate  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans opened an election-year battle over aid to
farmers Thursday by saying the administration's $5.8 billion package of farm
assistance is "woefully inadequate."
</P>
<P>
	   "The initial reaction to it is, is that all there is? Where is the rest of
it?" the House Agriculture Committee chairman, GOP Rep. Larry Combest of Texas,
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's plan, which would be the third
multibillion dollar farm bailout in as many years, is a new "supplemental
income" program that would cost $3.1 billion and be targeted toward small and
moderate-size farmers. An additional $1.3 billion is earmarked for farmers who
participate in conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest said he did not think the administration's package is "going
anywhere" and called it "something that is woefully short."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the chairman of the Senate's agricultural
appropriations committee, told Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman at a hearing
Thursday that many Southern producers would not qualify for the supplemental
income program because of a proposed $30,000 cap on payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said his proposals should serve as an "intellectual framework for
what the emergency package should look like."
</P>
<P>
	   The supplemental income payments would be pegged to the average gross income
nationally over the past five years for eight major crops -- corn, wheat,
cotton, rice, soybeans, sorghum, oats and barley.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has provided $15 billion in special assistance to farmers over the
past two years to compensate for low commodity prices and crop failures.
Glickman had criticized the way Congress distributed the money in 1998 and 1999
but did not propose an alternative plan for making the payments until this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department expects net farm income this year to drop $7.6
billion, or 16 percent, barring another aid package from Congress. Existing
government programs are expected to provide farmers with $17 billion in direct
payments this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said it was important to direct some of the extra aid that Congress
approves this year toward conservation programs, another idea to which
Republicans have reacted coolly.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest announced plans for a series of hearings on farm policy that will
start March 6 in Lubbock, Texas, and continue March 17-18 in Memphis, Tenn., and
Auburn, Ala. Additional hearings, which have not been scheduled, will be held in
Washington and in Boise, Idaho; Kutztown, Pa.; Peoria, Ill.; Raleigh, N.C.;
Sacramento, Calif.; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and West Chester, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Tribesmen Free U.S. Captive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- An American oil executive was released unharmed Thursday
by the Yemeni tribesmen who kidnapped him last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth White, 54, said he had been treated well by his abductors. He said
he plans to leave Yemen on Saturday for the United States and declined to give
his hometown because he hoped to return quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel great,'' White told The Associated Press in a call from Cairo to
his hotel in the Yemeni capital, San'a. ``I'm in surprisingly good health.''
</P>
<P>
	   White, who is from Arizona, was seized in the eastern Marib province on Jan.
26. He was handed over Thursday to officials of his company, Dallas-based
Halliburton, legislator Sultan al-Arada said.
</P>
<P>
	   White was released through mediation and the kidnappers' demands were not
met, al-Arada said. The demands had included releasing tribe members from jail.
</P>
<P>
	   White said he did not know why he was released or the identity of the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a good rapport with (the kidnappers). Maybe they thought it was time
to let me go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial reports said the kidnappers belonged to the al-Faheed tribe. But the
government later said the abductors worked for an investment company with close
links to Yemen's Islamic Islah Party, which calls for establishing a democratic
system based on Islamic sharia laws. The party denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the kidnappers were arrested, tribal sources said on condition of
anonymity. Their whereabouts were not immediately clear. Halliburton officials
would not comment and calls to the American Embassy in San`a went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   Yemeni tribesmen often kidnap foreigners to pressure the government into
providing money or better services, such as new roads, for their impoverished
areas. The kidnappers usually treat the hostages as guests and release them
unharmed. However, in 1998, four kidnapped tourists were killed in a botched
rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
	   In July, Yemen passed a law that allows judges to condemn kidnappers to
death. Since then, at least three people convicted of kidnapping have been
executed.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Pushing for Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana wants U.S. taxpayers to
spend tens of millions of dollars to wean Colombian farmers away from growing
illicit drug crops by promoting the raising of cattle, coffee and cotton
instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the bulk of the proposed $1.6 billion U.S. aid plan to fight drugs in
Colombia will be used for destroying coca crops and battling the leftist rebels
who protect them, Colombia will spend a fifth of it on alternative development
and other social programs, Pastrana told The Associated Press in an interview on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his embrace of the U.S. aid package, currently awaiting U.S.
congressional approval, Pastrana insisted he would not allow American troops to
become directly involved in Colmbia's nearly four-decade-old civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 U.S. military personnel are in Colombia at any one time, and
five were killed in the July crash of an Army RC-7 spy plane in Putumayo,
apparently due to pilot error. Green Berets and Navy Seals periodically train
troops and the Pentagon has helped Colombia's military improve its
intelligence-gathering and combat ability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will never accept the presence of foreign troops in combat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. money will underwrite a push by a U.S.-trained counternarcotics
battalion into the guerrilla-dominated southern state of Putumayo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said last week that he expects
violent protests by coca growers in Putumayo, where coca cultivation has
exploded by some 300 percent in the past two years and now makes up one-third of
the country's crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana wants U.S. taxpayers to help fund alternative development for
peasant farmers displaced by the eradication campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a very grave social problem and for that reason we've said we
can't look at the problem only as one of fumigation and eradication,'' Pastrana
said. ``We've got to give these people a hand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aggravating a civil conflict that claims 3,000 lives a year and the
pervasively corrupting influence of drug trafficking, Colombia is in the throes
of its worst recession since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerrilla attacks occur almost daily. This week, a rebel blockade kept the
highway that links Bogota with the country's second-largest city, Medellin,
closed for four days.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana nevertheless held out an olive branch to the country's largest
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, with which he
is engaged in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would not extradite to the United States a regional commander
accused of murdering three U.S. activists last March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a crime that will be tried in Colombia,'' Pastrana stressed during
the 45-minute interview in his office in the presidential palace before heading
off for provincial cities where he has proposed tax-free enterprise zones.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of the activists, kidnapped while visiting an indigenous group,
prompted U.S. diplomats to break off exploratory contacts with the FARC to
discuss possible guerrilla cooperation in weaning farmers off drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian prosecutors have filed murder charges against the guerrilla
commander, German Briceno, who remains at large. On Thursday, prosecutors
subpoened Briceno's brother, Jorge, the FARC's No. 2 leader and also a fugitive,
to testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking office in August 1998, Pastrana bet his presidency on making
peace with the FARC. He demilitarized a huge swath of southern Colombia 15
months ago -- virtually ceding it to the rebels -- as a condition for talks that
have so far proceeded at a glacial pace.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged Thursday the rebels' deep involvement in the drug business
but added ``we have no clear evidence that the FARC is a cartel ... We know it
lives off drugs. But we also know that behind it is a political life of 40 years
of insurgency that can't simply be cast aside.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, 45, said he was optimistic about FARC negotiators' trip to Europe
this month. So far, they've met with Swedish and Norwegian business and union
leaders and say they're hoping for an audience with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is the first big step in this entire process of
negotiation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, told reporters in Mexico Wednesday that
about two-thirds of FARC units ``are engaged in some way in drug-related
criminal activity'' and that the FARC's primary task in Putumayo ``is to protect
coca-growing fields, lab's production and the movement of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana said 79 percent of the U.S. aid would help Colombia's military and
police battle drugs in the world's No. 1 cocaine-producing nation. That money
would go to buying 63 helicopters, training and equipping two additional 950-man
counternarcotics battalions and upgrading radar that detects drug flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the aid plan, which the U.S. Congress is to begin debating next
week, say Pastrana's alternative development plans are ill-conceived and still
in the draft stage. They predict a bloody backlash against the push into
Putumayo that will only increase FARC support.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Add $2.05B in Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds rose this
past week, with retail funds adding $2.05 billion to $966.07 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose by $2.05
billion to $801.87 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund assets nudged up by about $600,000
to $164.20 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $3.43 billion to $699.91
billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, taxable money market
fund assets rose by $3.92 billion to $648.70 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds
fell by $493.0 million to $51.21 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Total money market assets stood at $1.666 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.661 trillion to reflect
reporting errors and a change in the number of funds reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week
ended Tuesday to 5.17 percent from 5.14 percent the previous week, said IBC's
Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial
Data Inc. The 30-day average yield rose to 5.14 percent from 5.13 percent, IBC
Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.31 percent from 5.28 percent the
previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 5.27 percent from 5.26
percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 47 days, up
from 45 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10
largest markets showed the annual percentage yield available on money market
accounts rose to 2.10 percent as of Wednesday from 2.07 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp. said the
annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts held
steady at 0.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.74 percent on six-month
certificates of deposit, up from 4.72 percent the previous week. Yields were
5.13 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.08 percent; 5.36 percent on 2 1/2-year
CDs, up from 5.30 percent; and 5.67 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.63 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Released for Heating Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Thursday released an
additional $130 million in assistance to help poor people deal with soaring
heating oil costs, and also took steps to try to increase refinery production
and oil deliveries.
</P>
<P>
	   About one-third of the money will go to the Northeast, where heating oil
prices have been a particular problem because so many homes rely on oil for
heating. That's on top of $45 million in low-income assistance made available a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10 million to 14 million homes nationwide rely on oil for
heating, with the highest concentration in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The average retail price for heating oil nearly doubled over the last year
to $1.66 per gallon, up from 86 cents in January 1999, lawmakers were told at a
congressional hearing Thursday. In the Northeast, prices have been even higher,
soaring to an average of $1.74 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the soaring cost of heating oil, diesel and other fuels stem
from ``a volatile mix of conditions'' ranging from high oil prices to low stocks
and dealers having problems getting supplies because of ice-clogged terminals
and other transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials also said they're concerned about refinery output, which was at
about 90 percent of capacity. Although refinery runs have increased over the
last two weeks, some facilities have normal maintenance scheduled this time of
year, which could result in new supply problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the new funds for low-income assistance, Richardson said a
variety of measures were being taken to try to boost heating oil production at
Northeast refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   These include issuing temporary waivers at some refineries for compliance
with clean air laws, urging refiners to defer routine maintenance and lifting
waivers on the hours that truckers carrying heating oil may work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Coast Guard was told to give heating oil shipments priority and
take other measures to prevent shipping delays. Also, loans were being offered
to heating oil dealers who face cash flow problems because sudden price spikes
prevent them from honoring existing contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson urged the industry to defer routine maintenance so heating oil
production is ``at full throttle until ... the crisis has passed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary said he had received ``an earful'' from a group of lawmakers
who met with him Wednesday to discuss the heating oil problem. ``We're dealing
with a short term crisis. We've gotten the message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been growing pressure on the administration to intervene. Many
members of Congress from the Northeast want the president to release oil from
the emergency government stockpile to try to dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said the administration remains opposed to using the
strategic reserve to affect prices, maintaining that the nearly 600 million
barrels in the reserve should be used only to deal with acute supply shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices and
that the markets should flow on their own,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   That view got an icy reception at a hearing of the House International
Relations Committee earlier Thursday, where Energy and State department
officials were called to discuss world oil prices and their effect on heating
oil and diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sitting on the strategic oil reserves like it's some kind of ancient
artifact is irrational,'' complained Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn. ``If we're not
going to ever dip into it, maybe we ought to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said the Clinton administration ought to do
more ``to get the OPEC nations to turn on the spigot and let the market
determine what the prices should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stunned a year ago by oil prices that had dipped below $12 a barrel, members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rolled back production by
4.3 million barrels a day. Prices soared and edged close to $30 a barrel in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The price on the spot market Thursday was $29.14 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he was ``ramping up'' his contacts with key oil producing
nations and spoke with oil ministers from Mexico and Venezuela about U.S.
concerns over the oil prices and production levels. He planned meetings with oil
ministers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Norville To Be an Anchor, Jailbird  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's inside jail for "Inside Edition" anchor Deborah
Norville.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday morning, Norville is to enter a North Carolina penal facility to
spend five days as a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   She will provide reports from Davidson County Jail in Lexington for her
weekday syndicated newsmagazine next Monday through Wednesday. "Inside Edition"
promises "a rare and unflinching look at day-to-day life behind bars."
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way to portray what life behind bars is really like is to spend a
considerable amount of time behind bars," Norville said Thursday. "One day
wouldn't do it."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll be checking in -- I'm sure there's a prison term for it -- Saturday at
8 a.m.," said Norville, who listed some of the regulations of this famously
tough prison: 24-hour lockdown; twice-a-week showers in a communal facility; no
TVs or newspapers; no makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   She, along with the rest of the prison population, will be forced to rise at
4:30 a.m. -- about the same time she used to get up to appear on NBC's "Today"
show. But it will be much harder thanks to yet another deprivation: no coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   The prison is under the authority of Sheriff Gerald Hege, who, since taking
office in 1994, has attracted wide attention for referring to criminals as
"scumbags," dressing inmates in striped uniforms, and selling merchandise
bearing his name and image.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last summer, Hege has played television talk-show host on Court TV's
weekly "Inside Cell Block F," conducting one-on-one interviews with selected
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Norville, who presumably will not appear on that show, is scheduled to get
sprung Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   To capture her jail experience, a video crew will be on hand selectively. At
other times, a producer will wield a lightweight "Hi-8" video camera. A camera
will be lodged in the ceiling of Norville's cell, and a point-of-view camera
will be sewn into her prison uniform, she said, stressing that "all the inmates
understand we'll be taping them."
</P>
<P>
	   Norville admits this story wasn't her idea, but instead an assignment she is
duty-bound to carry out.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if she's nervous, she replied, "Who wouldn't be? I'm probably going in
with the same trepidation that any lady in there probably feels. Sure I'm
scared!"

<HEADLINE> Euro Loses Gain Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro initially gained back some ground against the
dollar Thursday but ultimately ended the day lower, slipping futher away from
the psychological level of one-to-one with the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro got some early support from a report by the European Central Bank
in which the bank said it remained cautious about the inflationary effects of a
low euro.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank had cited concerns about inflation when it raised interest rates
last week, and some traders took the tone of the report to mean that other rate
hikes could be on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   But the euro fell back at the end of the day, trading at 98.62 cents in late
New York dealings, down from 99.27 cents late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 108.95 yen, down from 109.11 yen, giving up
some of its gains over the past few days. The recent reversal of a strong upward
trend in the yen has taken pressure off Japanese financial authorities, who had
worried that the high yen could strangle the profit flow at exporting companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6292 Swiss francs, up from
1.6211, and 1.4490 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4440. The British pound fell to
$1.6090 from $1.6142.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Thursday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9832 German marks, up from 1.9702; 6.6514
French francs, up from 6.6078; and 1,963.36 Italian lire, up from 1,950.51.

<HEADLINE> Debate Escalates Over Zimbabwe Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Debate escalated Thursday over an upcoming vote on
revising Zimbabwe's constitution, with a state commission calling those who
opposed the changes ``sellouts'' paid by whites and their ``international
friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vote 'yes' and make a historic change by sending a clear message to the
sellouts and their masters,'' the state-appointed Constitutional Commission said
in campaign notices published Thursday. The ``sellouts'' were paid by whites and
former colonial power Britain, the notices said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposing the commission's draft constitution are the Movement for Democratic
Change -- the main opposition party -- and human rights, church, civic and
lawyers' groups. They argue the proposed revision, in which President Robert
Mugabe retains most of his powers, does not reflect the wishes of ordinary
Zimbabweans canvassed last year for their opinions on reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the commission concede that most people at their meetings
overwhelmingly demanded an end to Mugabe's two decades of rule and the
dismantling of his sweeping presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the nation's police chief said most of those arrested in a week of
sporadic clashes were opposition party supporters. Police Commissioner Augustine
Chihuri, a Mugabe appointee, said government opponents devised a ``master plan
of violence'' to disrupt the referendum and dozens were arrested for violent
offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Welshman Ncube, the opposition group's secretary general, said followers
of the ruling party incited violence on Thursday and that police had refused to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They say they need arrests to be authorized by higher officers. This is
very serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leader Morgan Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe, 75, for fanning violence when
he told ruling party supporters on Saturday he himself was not too old to use
his fists against opponents. Mugabe raised a fist and, speaking the language of
his majority Shona tribe, said: ``You see this fist. It can smash your head.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Breaks Nominations Impasse  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pushed through the
confirmation of two federal judges Thursday, defying an effort by his fellow
Republicans to block all nominations put forward by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we should, or would, be able to go all year without
confirming any nominations,'' Lott, R-Miss., said in explaining his decision to
press ahead with the votes. ``Some of these are good men and women ... and in
some of these states, there truly is a need for more judges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 96-2 to confirm Thomas Ambro as U.S. Circuit Judge for the
Third Circuit and 95-2 to approve Joel Pisano to be U.S. District Judge for the
District of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Hispanic-American lawmakers and activists said President
Clinton promised them he would apply pressure on Congress to act on three
Hispanic judicial candidates who have been waiting up to four years for
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hispanic-Americans take longer to get through the judicial nominating
process than any other group,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., after the
meeting with Clinton. ``They are often not even given their day for a vote in
the Senate. That speaks volumes for itself.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three are Enrique Moreno, nominated in September for the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals; Julio Fuentes, nominated in March to fill a vacancy in the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals; and Richard Paez, the first Mexican-American to
serve as a federal judge in Los Angeles, who was nominated in January 1996 to a
higher judgeship on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is 100 percent behind our effort to push these nominations
forward,'' said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who leads the
congressional Hispanic Caucus. Clinton pledged to do whatever is necessary to
make the point that all three men are qualified for the bench, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-simmering standoff between the administration and Senate
Republicans over federal judges boiled over at yearend. That's when Sen. James
Inhofe, R-Okla., accused President Clinton of violating an agreement on making
temporary recess appointments, a method of bypassing the Senate confirmation
process.
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe said 19 Republican senators had joined in deciding to put holds on
all judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Senate tradition, a single senator can block further floor action on a
nominee by putting a hold on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   But in this case, with Democrats accusing Republicans of playing politics in
blocking worthy judicial nominations, Lott decided to move ahead with votes on
the two non-controversial judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said he believed the White House did try to work with his office on the
recess appointment issue and ``my feeling is that we should not start
filibustering these nominations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe continued to assert that Clinton broke his word in December by
reappointing Sara M. Fox to the National Labor Relations Board. The Constitution
gives the president the right to make appointments during a congressional
recess, with the nominee allowed to serve until the end of the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator said his effort to block future judicial nominees was ``the only
chance in eight years to hold the president up to his word.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe was joined by 18 other Republicans who voted no in a 79-19 vote on
whether to move to final consideration on the two judges. He and Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H., voted against confirmation of the two.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
thanked Lott and committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for working with
him on the issue, but said there were still 77 vacancies, nearly 10 percent of
all federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged action on two nominations to the Ninth Circuit, those of Paez and
attorney Marsha Berzon, both blocked by Republicans who say they are too
liberal.

<HEADLINE> Details of Marriage Penalty Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Details of the House Republican bill to cut income taxes for many married
couples, including those who have a ``marriage penalty,'' paying more income
taxes than they would if they were single, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
Total cost: $182.3 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --Adjusts upward for married couples the bottom 15 percent income tax
bracket to make it double that of single filers by 2008. If it had been in place
this year, couples would have paid a 15 percent rate on their first $52,500 of
taxable income, compared with $43,850 in current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to twice that of single filers beginning in 2001. Using this year's
numbers, the deduction would rise from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	    Impact on married couples who take standard tax deduction with two children
in 2005
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Arms and the Man' a Cartoonish Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Critic
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chocolate cream soldier has curdled in a high-strung
revival of "Arms and the Man," the George Bernard Shaw comedy that the
Roundabout Theater Company opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Gramercy Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw's antiwar play usually is delicious stuff, the tale of a Swiss
mercenary named Bluntschli who carries chocolates instead of bullets for his gun
and manages to be quite the most sensible person on stage when it comes to
debunking the honor of dying for one's country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Roundabout production feels slapdash and more than a little cartoonish.
It seems as if director Roger Rees, best known as Broadway's "Nicholas Nickleby"
and from television's "Cheers," has given his performers an extra jolt of
caffeine. They appear wired, overacting and shouting as they race through a
production that misses most of the play's laughs and exhausts the audience at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw called "Arms and the Man" one of his "pleasant" plays and that it is --
a likable diversion in which Bluntschli not only bests the dimwitted heroes of
the Bulgarian army but wins the heart of Raina, daughter of the town's most
upwardly mobile citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, set in the 1880s, served as the basis for the operetta, "The
Chocolate Soldier." This production could use a little music -- and not just
during scene changes as Rees has done.
</P>
<P>
	   As the commonsensical Bluntschli, Henry Czerny gives the revival's most
restrained performance, which is not saying much. Brilliant as the tortured
priest in the Canadian film "The Boys of St. Vincent," the actor is less than
mesmerizing here, swallowed up by the broad emoting of the other cast members.
</P>
<P>
	   Katie Finneran pouts prettily as the young woman dazzled by Bluntschli's
directness. Finneran, too, has done fine work in the past, but here, she is
saddled with the silliest vocal mannerisms this side of Betty Boop.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Michael Valley at least has a reason to puff and preen on stage. He
plays the vainglorious Sergius, a dashing dunderhead who blunders his way into
military legend. His Sergius displays such an overwhelming confidence in his
ability to charm that you eventually believe him.
</P>
<P>
	   The supporting cast suffers even more from bad cases of hyperactivity,
bellowing Shaw's witty observations that should be delivered with style rather
than exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Kaye Voyce's costumes, ranging from military uniforms to lamely exotic
dresses for the becoming Finneran, appear overcome by excess. Yet the sets by
Neil Patel, framed by a map of Bulgaria, manage to look skimpy and unattractive
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   This "Arms and the Man" then could not be more wrongheaded, a misstep for a
company that has done memorable Shaw revivals in the past. Maybe it could redeem
itself with a first-rate production of "The Chocolate Soldier."

<HEADLINE> CDC: Strokes More Deadly for Blacks  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Blacks ages 35 to 54 are four times more likely to die of a
stroke than their white counterparts, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Middle-aged Hispanics, Asians, American Indians and Alaska natives also are
at greater risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
American Indians and Alaska natives in that age group are nearly twice as likely
as whites to die of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The racial gap narrowed sharply at older ages, suggesting that younger
minorities are not getting the message about the risk factors, said Carma Ayala,
a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   "Many people believe stroke is an older person's disease," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC also cited lack of access to health care and mistrust of the medical
system as reasons for the racial gap.
</P>
<P>
	   Obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, diabetes, poor nutrition and high blood
pressure are the major risk factors for stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said stroke was the third leading cause of death in 1997, killing
157,791 Americans. Overall, U.S. stroke deaths in the declined 70 percent from
1950 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Off 55.53  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to another closing high
Thursday while blue-chip stocks once again lagged behind, pulled down by
persistent worries that their earnings aren't growing fast enough to offset
rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 122.39 to close at 4,485.63, the fourth record close in five
sessions for the index. Thursday's finish topped the record of 4,427.50 set on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 to 10,643.63, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 5.13 to 1,416.83.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology shares that dominate the Nasdaq rose as investors determined
that high-tech firms, with their powerful earnings growth, are in the best
position to thrive even if interest rates move sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are seeking out the biggest earnings gains," said Joseph V.
Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. "The
companies in the Nasdaq are probably going to grow their earnings 30 percent
this year, while the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will probably see 13.5 percent
growth."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are scrambling toward the fastest-growing companies amid concerns
that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to cool the
economy and ward off inflation. Four modest rate increases since last June have
done little to slow U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that their slower growth rates will be especially endangered by
rising rates. On Thursday, Merck, down 2 3/8 to 69, and 3M, down 1 5/8 to 86,
led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, DuPont fell 2 5/8 to 54 1/16 and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 2 9/16 to 91
7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, earnings were a catalyst for buying. MCI WorldCom rose 1
11/16 to 49 13/16 after the company reported fourth-quarter profits nearly
tripled from the final quarter of 1998 due to strong growth in its Internet and
data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Dell Computer rose 3 15/64 to 38 51/64. The company, considered a
bellwether for the technology industry, released its latest earnings report
after the 4 p.m. close of trading, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials, a leading maker of equipment used to manufacture computer
chips, rose 11 1/64 to 174 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet stocks were mostly lower a day after hackers disrupted several
popular Web sites. Amazon.com fell 4 1/16 to 76 3/16 and online auctioneer eBay
fell 1 5/8 to 162 3/8. No new attacks were reported, and the FBI was continuing
its probe of the Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts noted that in their frenzy for technology stocks, investors brushed
off some major bargain-hunting opportunities following the Dow's 258.44-point
plunge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The (Dow's) recent weakness has gone nearly unnoticed thanks to the run in
technology and growth stocks over the past two to three weeks," said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. Belski noted that
Wednesday's decline knocked the Dow below 10,700 for the first time since
mid-November and may have prompted some computer-driven selling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The market was little affected by the Labor Department's latest weekly
report on jobless claims, which showed the number of Americans filing new claims
for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in a month.
Analysts said the four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out
week-to-week volatility, fell sharply to the lowest level since Dec. 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.26 billion shares, compared with
1.28 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.20 to 542.21.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.6 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court bars Listerine competitor from using BreathAsure name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The first ruling in a dispute between the makers of
products aimed at bad breath left a sour taste in the mouths of both sides.
<P>
	   Breath Asure Inc., a small California company that markets what it called an
"internal breath freshener" capsule, was barred from making that claim or even
saying that the product works.
</P>
<P>
	   That failed to completely satisfy Warner-Lambert Co., the
multibillion-dollar Morris Plains company whose breath products include
Listerine mouthwash, Certs mints and Clorets and Dentyne gums.
</P>
<P>
	   So Warner-Lambert appealed, and won an order barring its competitor from
calling its product BreathAsure.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Warner-Lambert was likely to be
harmed by the continued use of that product name.
</P>
<P>
	   "The name falsely tells the consumer that he or she has assurance of fresher
breath when ingesting one of the defendant's capsules. That is not true," a
three-judge circuit panel ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Breath Asure, of Westlake Village, Calif., is considering whether to appeal
the decision, said its executive vice president, Anthony Raissen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We strongly disagree with the determination of the court," Raissen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company changed its advertising campaign after the first ruling, Raissen
said: "When you're David, and they're Goliath, you have to take a back seat
sometimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is privately held and would not disclose sales figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D became widely known in the mid-1990s through
an "aggressive" national advertising campaign that featured radio personality
Howard Stern and actor George Kennedy, said Warner-Lambert lawyer Thomas C.
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
	   "Negligible" sales in 1992 and 1993 grew to $29 million by 1996 on the
strength of that campaign, Morrison said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That figure is dwarfed by the Warner-Lambert products, among the top sellers
in their categories. In 1999, Listerine had worldwide sales of $487 million;
Certs $127 million; Clorets $193 million, and Dentyne $158 million, company
spokesman Jason Ford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert produced evidence during a trial here in 1998 that forced
Breath Asure to accept limits on what claims its advertising could make.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau investigated
the advertising and found claims that BreathAsure and BreathAsure-D were
effective breath fresheners were not supported by any reliable scientific
evidence, the appellate court noted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Accordingly, it recommended that defendant discontinue or substantially
modify its ads for its breath fresheners," the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   At trial, Breath Asure agreed not to say its product provides users with
clean breath, cleans bad breath for hours, works with the digestive system, is
"America's number one selling breath freshener," and over a dozen other
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence established that bad breath originates in the mouth, not in the
stomach, the court said, upholding Warner-Lambert's assertion that "effective
breath freshening products must either mask offensive oral odors, or attack
bacteria in the mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell, who heard the weeklong non-jury trial,
declined to bar the product name, however, finding that Breath Asure's products
appear to be bought as a complement to Warner-Lambert products, not a
substitute, "thereby lessening any injury to (Warner-Lambert)."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, which was not seeking monetary damages, appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought once the advertising was enjoined, the name should be enjoined,
because the very name of the product conveys the same message as the
advertising," Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3rd Circuit agreed: "Although BreathAsure's ads never mentioned
Warner-Lambert's products by name, they implicitly told consumers to stop
'masking' bad breath with plaintiff's products and start 'attacking it at its
source."'
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert this week agreed to be bought by Pfizer Inc. in a deal that
creates the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company.

<HEADLINE> JetBlue boasts low fares and deep pockets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Low fares, deep pockets and even something to keep the
kids from driving everyone nuts - live cable TV.
<P>
	   That's what's being offered by JetBlue Airways, a new discount carrier whose
first $79 flight from New York to Fort Lauderdale takes off Friday, with $49
flights to Buffalo a week later. Prices are 30 to 65 percent below typical
fares, which can cost $200 or more one-way between New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   But can JetBlue survive in an extremely tough industry? Of the 39 jet
carriers that began operation between 1989 and 1999, only 17 remain in business,
according to figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's a matter of survival," JetBlue's founder David Neeleman
insisted at a news conference at Kennedy Airport Thursday. "We have the capital
to survive. We're going to be profitable within a year. Our costs are
significantly lower than the majors. ... When you use technology the way we do,
you can be efficient."
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue claims to be the best-financed start-up in aviation history, with
$130 million in backing from billionaire George Soros and Chase Capital
Partners. The money has enabled Neeleman to buy all new Airbus jets, which cost
less to operate than older models. His 300 employees include stay-at-home moms
in his native state of Utah, who take reservations from home on their laptops,
and airport staff wearing preppy blue polo shirts. Passengers can also arrange
their own ticketless travel through a Web site, www.jetblue.com.
</P>
<P>
	   In a few weeks it will also become the first airline to offer live
transmission of 24 cable channels, at your seat, from takeoff to landing. The TV
service includes several stations for children, comes with earphones and costs
$5 per flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he's a college drop-out, Neeleman has a heap of experience in his
industry. He helped found Morris Air, a Utah-based carrier that Southwest
Airlines bought for $129 million in 1993. He's also worked for WestJet, a
profitable Canadian discount carrier, and was CEO of Open Skies, a reservations
company now owned by Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Decota, aviation director for the Port Authority, which manages JFK,
said he has high hopes for JetBlue. "A lot of new airlines have tried to spring
up but a lot of them haven't been this well capitalized, haven't had the
management, haven't had the resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue has even created a charming play area in the terminal with a little
house and a mini-basketball hoop. Perhaps Neeleman's own family life has
sensitized him to the needs of parents: He and his wife have eight kids.
</P>
<P>
	   This summer JetBlue will also become the first airline at JFK to offer a
shuttle bus directly from its terminal to a nearby Long Island Rail Road station
in Jamaica, Queens. From there it's a short train ride to Manhattan. This will
increase options for travelers whose alternatives now include $30 cab rides and
90-minute bus-and-subway rides.
</P>
<P>
	   New York State has some of the highest in-state fares in the country, a
factor that hurts in attracting new business upstate. Elected officials like
U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who made bringing low-cost airlines to the
state one of his campaign pledges, helped push for federal approval for JetBlue.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest - a discount airline based in Texas - has also recently begun
service from New York, flying out of a small airport in Islip, Long Island. The
carrier plans to fly planes out of Albany beginning in May to four unannounced
destinations.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of the year, Neeleman plans to add eight planes to JetBlue's
current two, and fly to Tampa, Rochester, Syracuse and Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue hopes to fly to another 38 cities over the next three years,
including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Indianapolis, Nashville, New
Orleans, Salt Lake City and Washington.

    	   LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday accused
Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani of running a campaign based on insults and
demanded he make public the fund-raising letters he has sent out for the past
two years.
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of New York's Conservative Party called on Richard
Viguerie, the guru of conservative direct-mail fund raising, to drop Giuliani as
a client.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not a conservative," Michael Long wrote Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Long was the latest sign that the small, but politically
important party would shun Giuliani. Since 1974, no New York Republican has won
a statewide race without also having Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second straight day, the first lady criticized the New York City mayor
for sending out a fund-raising letter to conservatives that accused her of
harboring "hostility toward America's religious traditions."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it is wrong to use religion as a political weapon and he should
know that," Clinton said outside the Ann Street Restaurant &AMP; Deli in Little
Falls about 60 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she wanted the mayor to release all his fund-raising letters
because, "I would like the people of New York to know there's a big difference
between the kind of campaigns we're running. I intend to run a campaign based on
issues and ideas, not on insults."
</P>
<P>
	   As he had on Wednesday, Giuliani continued to laugh off the Clinton attack.
The mayor said Thursday he would make public his fund-raising letters only if
Clinton reimbursed the federal government for the full cost of her travel on
government airplanes during her campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
	   "When they make out the check, we'll make the letters available," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has said it has reimbursed the government what it is
required to.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor also poked fun at criticism of him for saying teachers should be
allowed to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   During his annual management report at City Hall the mayor was showing
slides when up popped one displaying an illustration of two stone tablets.
</P>
<P>
	   After feigning surprise, the mayor joked that "maybe this is part of the
vast, right-wing conspiracy." After a pause, he added, "Or maybe part of the
vast left-wing conspiracy who put it here to get me in trouble."
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani was joking, the head of the Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith
Alliance took him to task for sending out his fund-raising letter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am frightened by the specter of a New York senatorial campaign that turns
religion into a political football," the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the 100,000-member, clergy-led organization, wrote in a letter to
both candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton obviously intended to stay on the attack, she did end up
giving the mayor faint praise when a reporter asked whether he might be taking
too much credit for the crime rate reduction in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's been a good partnership and a good team and I give full credit
to the mayors of all the cities, including New York, who have used the tools at
our disposal, who have worked with the federal government and particularly with
the president," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the improving economy, her husband the president and the
Congress - and Giuliani's first police commissioner, William Bratton, whom the
mayor fired - should also share in the credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said she was "very grateful" that Giuliani helped lobby
for President Clinton's Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994 aimed at putting an extra
100,000 police officers on the streets. The mayor's support for the president
had been criticized at the time by some Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to give credit where credit is due," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping later in Albany, Clinton visited the Jewish Community Center to
talk about families and children. She called for expanded tax credits and
incentives to promote child care, stronger efforts to collect child-support
payments and help for non-custodial parents who need to find jobs that will
allow them to meet their child-support responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Ford and Dodge Show Off New Cars  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- While most automakers focused on trucks and sport utility
vehicles during previews for the Chicago Auto Show, DaimlerChrysler's Dodge
division showed off an all-new midsize Stratus sedan and coupe.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's not buying SUVs," said Chrysler president Jim Holden. "The
truth is the U.S. market is still 50 percent cars. This is our commitment to
cars -- they can be fun too."
</P>
<P>
	   When they hit showrooms later this year, the Stratus models will enter a
crowded market of about 3.5 million vehicles that includes four different models
from GM and several models from foreign automakers. Ford had competed with its
Contour and Mercury Mystique, but plans to stop building those cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Improvements for the Stratus include all-new sheetmetal and interiors, and
an optional 200-horsepower V6. Holden also said engineers worked hard to quiet
the noise level inside the car and improve its fit and finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Cedergren, an analyst with Nextrend, said the challenge for Chrysler
would be to offer vehicles that have the quality feel of the Japanese imports
that dominate the segment.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a much more sophisticated buyer base on the market," he said.
"They're much more discriminating and they really understand the concept of
refinement. That's what the new consumer wants."
</P>
<P>
	   Both models will be powered by Mitsubishi engines. The coupe model, which
will replace the Dodge Avenger, will be built at the Mitsubishi plant in Normal,
Ill.; the sedan will be built in Sterling Heights, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   Holden said the company would build about 300,000 of the Dodge vehicles and
new versions of its Chrysler counterparts, which will be unveiled in April.
Prices will be similar to the current version, which sells for between $16,000
and $19,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Other automakers kept up the parade of trucks. Ford showed off a freshened
version of its best-selling Ford Ranger pickup dubbed the Ranger Edge. Ford said
it would also offer a stronger 4-liter V6 engine that makes 205 horsepower in
the Ranger.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ranger has been the market leader among compact pickups, racking up
348,353 sales in 1999. But sales have been dropping since August, and the
upcoming versions will face newer versions of compact pickups from Nissan and
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
	   And while those automakers and others are building four-door variations --
General Motors Corp. showed off its new four-door Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma
pickups Thursday -- Ford said it has no plans to follow. The Ranger is offered
in an extended cab version with two "suicide" doors that open only after the
front doors open.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford division President Jim O'Connor said Ford would rely on its Explorer
Sport Trac -- a four-door version of the Explorer with a short pickup bed -- to
compete against smaller four-door pickups. O'Connor also said the company would
expect to sell about 350,000 Rangers again this year, at prices similar to the
$11,500-$19,000 that current models sell for, despite all the new competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Other announcements Thursday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mitsubishi said that it would build the next version of its Montero Sport
SUV at its plant in Normal. Mitsubishi currently builds its Eclipse sports coupe
and Galant sedan at the plant. The new Montero, due out in 2003, will share
basic components with the next generation of the Eclipse and Galant.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi said the move was part of a $1 billion effort to design and build
vehicles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   --Korean automaker Kia showed off a subcompact sedan called Rio that will go
on sale this year. Kia said the Rio would sell for less than $9,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chicago Auto Show opens to the public Friday.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution says witnesses heard Volpe promise to "say nothin"'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors said Thursday they had witnesses
ready to testify that just before he agreed to plead guilty to a sodomy attack
on Abner Louima, officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer he would "say nothin"' to
implicate fellow officer Charles Schwarz in the crime.
<P>
	   The surprise move, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson,
injected a new element into the trial of Schwarz and two other officers for
conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Louima's civil rights
when Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty. Schwarz was convicted and faces a
possible life sentence. His appeal for a new trial was rejected by Nickerson
last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, face up
to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20, when, during a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, "confronted Volpe in the lobby" and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, currently defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial
in Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
"They know where to find me," he said. "I'd be happy to respond to a subpoena."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers in the Brooklyn trial declined comment but Bruder attorney Stuart
London said they would confer on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors' letter, dated Feb. 9, said the government hoped to call
"one or more witnesses who overheard the conversation between Volpe and Worth,"
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the conversation between Volpe and Worth occurred on May 20. Five
days later, Volpe pleaded guilty to sodomizing Louima with a broken broomstick
in August, 1997. He said a second, unnamed officer took part.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing in December 1998, where he drew a 30-year term, Volpe said
for the first time that the "second officer" in the bathroom during the attack
on Louima was not Schwarz, but Wiese, who did not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial, Worth - then Schwarz's lawyer - claimed the
government withheld from him its knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's
presence in the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of
Volpe's intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent
to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr.
Louima," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvyn Kornberg, who was Volpe's attorney, described the letter as "grasping
at straws" by the state. "It shows the prosecutors are mortally afraid of Mr.
Volpe's testimony," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony, James Burns, a former senior official of the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, described an interview with Wiese days
after the incident in which that officer identified himself as the second cop in
the bathroom and said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's
front desk.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Burns, Wiese said he helped Volpe escort Louima toward the
arrest processing room and was surprised when Volpe took a sharp right to the
bathroom, saying he wanted to "clean up the prisoner."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and found Volpe,
broomstick in hand, with his foot on the prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he
dragged Louima away from the toilet by his legs as Volpe explained that the man
had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police officer admitted he told police and state investigators he
didn't know who escorted Louima to the station house bathroom, but named Schwarz
when questioned months later by the FBI and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake... it was a mistake not to do so," Officer Mark Schofield
said when defense lawyers pressed him to explain his failure to tell what he
knew to police Internal Affairs Bureau detectives and the Brooklyn district
attorney when questioned days after the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that anyone told him to lie.

<HEADLINE> US Radio Services Raised in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. government broadcast services will be reduced in
Europe and increased in Africa and Asia to reflect new ``strategic priorities,''
the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a plan that will eliminate 51 jobs, the government's Broadcasting Board
of Governors said it is reducing services in 16 languages and enhancing service
in 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcasts include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of
America.
</P>
<P>
	   The board said in a statement that the realignment comes ``at a time of
increasingly scare resources for overseas broadcasting in the wake of the end of
the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
	   The board said it is the first step in realignments planned over several
years aimed at using funds more efficiently, supporting emerging democracies and
making use of the internet and other media to deliver programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Reduced programs will be provided in such languages as Croatian, Bulgarian,
Romania and Slovak in broadcasts to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic,
``which are now members of NATO and ... (have) fully free and open media,''
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Expected savings will be used in ``new priority areas of the world, where
U.S. International broadcasting can have the greatest impact and where democracy
is either fragile or nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   For example, money will be used to buy 24-hour broadcast frequencies in
Indonesia and expand broadcasting hours in Africa in six languages.

<HEADLINE> Remaining rebate checks expected by mid-March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - About 260,000 Connecticut residents will have to
wait until mid-March before they get the $50 rebate checks they were supposed to
receive in December.
<P>
	   Because of a miscalculation in the number of Social Security recipients
eligible for the checks, the rebate program was underfunded by about $10
million, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Now it's up to the General Assembly to plug that shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative leaders said Thursday they plan to approve the money, but they
likely won't vote to do so until March 1. The Legislature's Appropriations
Committee must support the measure before it's sent to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican lawmakers and state budget director Marc Ryan had urged House
Speaker Moira Lyons and Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, both
Democrats, to authorize a bypass of the committee process and have the $10
million spending bill ready for a vote in the General Assembly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Brian Flaherty, R-Watertown, said that plan collapsed when lawmakers
from both parties tried to pad the bill with other spending measures.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people wanted to put other things in there besides the $10 million for
the rebates," Flaherty said. "That is a rotten thing to do because it has
delayed people's checks."
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons said there was never serious consideration of filling the $10 million
gap before March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she and Sullivan said they want legislation to get speed through
the Appropriations Committee so it's ready for a vote in the General Assembly on
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter what we did, the checks wouldn't be ready to go out until Feb.
29," Lyons said. "We felt there was no need to discuss an emergency bill."
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Revenue Services Commissioner Gene Gavin said the checks could
be in the mail by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have not been printed yet," Gavin said. "We know who the checks are
going to, but we can't cut them until we get the money first."
</P>
<P>
	   The state had earmarked $108 million of last year's revenue surplus for
rebates to about 2.4 million people. At the time, only 60,000 Social Security
recipients were considered to be eligible for the rebates. But that calculation
was based on old information for the Social Security Administration, Galvin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the state received updated information, officials realized there were
200,000 more people who were entitled to rebates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're waiting until we get all the money before we send the rebates to the
Social Security recipients," Gavin said.

   TORONTO (AP) -- Three people were injured Thursday when gunfire broke out in
a high school parking lot, prompting police to hold the students inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the wounded was in serious condition following the violence at Emery
Collegiate Institute in suburban Toronto, said police Constable Nick Doria. He
was unable to confirm if the injured were students.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were still piecing together how the shooting occurred and details

	   An unknown number of students remained in the building Thursday evening, two
hours after the shooting, said a woman who answered the telephone at the school.
She did not provide more details.

suspects, Doria said. He was unable to say whether the suspects were students at

<HEADLINE> CDC: Lead Levels Up in Overseas Kids  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A study of nearly 1,800 children adopted from overseas found
they were about twice as likely as American-born youngsters to have high levels
of lead in their blood, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said parents adopting
children from foreign countries should have them screened for lead
contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC analyzed data from nine centers that screened adopted children. It
looked at 1,760 youngsters adopted between 1991 and 1999. Most of the youngsters
were from China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said that 8 percent to 13 percent of children adopted from China had
elevated levels of lead in their blood, compared with a U.S. rate of 2 percent
to 6 percent. Among Russian children, elevated blood levels were seen in 1
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, most childhood lead contamination is believed to result from
leaded gas and industrial emissions. Lead levels in U.S. children have dropped
since leaded gasoline and paint were banned in the United States decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Lead can lead to reduced intelligence, short attention span and learning
disabilities. At high exposures, it can cause coma, convulsions and death. Drugs
can sometimes be used to lower lead levels.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, about 15,000 children adopted from abroad were granted immigration
visas. Immigrants under 15 are not required to undergo blood or other tests
unless they are suspected of having syphilis or HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really want medical providers, adoptive agencies and parents to realize
these children may have high blood lead levels and they need a blood lead test,"
the CDC's Dr. Lisa Rosenblum said.

<HEADLINE> White House Room Named After Brady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a fresh coat of paint and new carpet, the White House
press briefing room is being named after Jim Brady, the press secretary who was
severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady was to return to the White House Friday for a formal dedication
ceremony led by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady's picture has hung in the briefing room since Nov. 9, 1981, when the
area was reopened after a three-month renovation. On that day, Reagan and his
wife, Nancy, came to the briefing room to join Brady at a ribbon-cutting
ceremony. Brady was still recovering from injuries suffered in the March 30,
1981, shooting outside the Washington Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady and his wife, Sarah, have joined Clinton on many occasions to press
for tougher gun controls. The most prominent measure was the Brady law, which
established a five-day waiting period and background checks on handgun
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarah Brady is the chair of Handgun Control, which bills itself as the
nations largest citizens gun control lobbying organization.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Arms Monitors Won't Return  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Thursday that it will not allow U.N. arms
inspectors back into the country to reinstate a disarmament program halted on
the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan branded U.N. arms inspectors as ``spies''
in the clearest rebuff to date of renewed inspection attempts stipulated in a
Dec. 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Iraqi leaders have decried the resolution, but left open the question
of Baghdad's cooperation. Ramadan was blunt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There shall be no return of the so-called inspection teams. We reject the
infiltration by spies using such cover,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
Ramadan as telling a visiting Russian envoy, Nikolai Kartuzov.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks come as the newly appointed chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix
of Sweden, tries to set up a new disarmament commission. Ramadan did not mention
Blix by name, but he was appointed under the December resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Iraq's leaders have
to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know what they need to do, and standing in the way and trying to
dictate the terms of engagement of any force, or who will lead such a force, is
only going to perpetuate a situation that they publicly claim that they want to
get out of, which is the U.N. sanctions,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
can be lifted only after Iraq proves to the Security Council it has destroyed
its long range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq maintains it no longer has banned weapons and is demanding the
abolition of U.N. sanctions as a condition for the return of arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman John Mills said the world body would not respond
directly to Ramadan's remarks. But he noted that Blix will not start his new job
until around March 1, so ``there isn't an inspection mechanism up and
functioning at the moment knocking on the door, asking to go into Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   Blix must first organize and staff the new commission. The resolution then
calls for inspectors to go to Iraq to draw up a list of remaining arms questions
that Iraq must answer before sanctions can be suspended -- a list that Blix and
the Security Council must approve.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, seen as Iraq's closest ally on the Security Council, sent Kartuzov
to Baghdad in a bid to persuade the government to cooperate, Baghdad-based
diplomats said. Kartuzov, a former Russian ambassador to Baghdad, also met
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run newspapers on Thursday quoted Aziz as saying Iraq will not
cooperate. Last week, Aziz said his government might cooperate if the United
Nations made the resolution palatable to Iraq. He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Off 55.53  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to another closing high
Thursday while blue-chip stocks once again lagged behind, pulled down by
persistent worries that their earnings aren't growing fast enough to offset
rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 122.39 to close at 4,485.63, the fourth record close in five
sessions for the index. Thursday's finish topped the record of 4,427.50 set on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 to 10,643.63, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 5.13 to 1,416.83.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology shares that dominate the Nasdaq rose as investors determined
that high-tech firms, with their powerful earnings growth, are in the best
position to thrive even if interest rates move sharply higher this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are seeking out the biggest earnings gains," said Joseph V.
Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. "The
companies in the Nasdaq are probably going to grow their earnings 30 percent
this year, while the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will probably see 13.5 percent
growth."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are scrambling toward the fastest-growing companies amid concerns
that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to cool the
economy and ward off inflation. Four modest rate increases since last June have
done little to slow U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors
have punished old-line industrial stocks much more severely than high-tech
shares, wagering that their slower growth rates will be especially endangered by
rising rates. On Thursday, Merck, down 2 3/8 to 69, and 3M, down 1 5/8 to 86,
led the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, DuPont fell 2 5/8 to 54 1/16 and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 2 9/16 to 91
7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, earnings were a catalyst for buying. MCI WorldCom rose 1
11/16 to 49 13/16 after the company reported fourth-quarter profits nearly
tripled from the final quarter of 1998 due to strong growth in its Internet and
data services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Dell Computer rose 3 15/64 to 38 51/64. The company, considered a
bellwether for the technology industry, released its latest earnings report
after the 4 p.m. close of trading, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials, a leading maker of equipment used to manufacture computer
chips, rose 11 1/64 to 174 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet stocks were mostly lower a day after hackers disrupted several
popular Web sites. Amazon.com fell 4 1/16 to 76 3/16 and online auctioneer eBay
fell 1 5/8 to 162 3/8. No new attacks were reported, and the FBI was continuing
its probe of the Internet vandalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts noted that in their frenzy for technology stocks, investors brushed
off some major bargain-hunting opportunities following the Dow's 258.44-point
plunge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The (Dow's) recent weakness has gone nearly unnoticed thanks to the run in
technology and growth stocks over the past two to three weeks," said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. Belski noted that
Wednesday's decline knocked the Dow below 10,700 for the first time since
mid-November and may have prompted some computer-driven selling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The market was little affected by the Labor Department's latest weekly
report on jobless claims, which showed the number of Americans filing new claims
for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in a month.
Analysts said the four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out
week-to-week volatility, fell sharply to the lowest level since Dec. 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.26 billion shares, compared with
1.28 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.20 to 542.21.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.6 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Defense witnesses say Diallo shot while standing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hoping to counter charges police kept shooting
Amadou Diallo after he was down, two medical experts testified Thursday that the
unarmed Bronx man stood throughout most of the gunfire.
<P>
	   "My primary view of the position of the deceased, Mr. Diallo, is that he's
upright," a defense pathologist, Dr. Richard Mason, said at the trial of four
police officers accused of murdering Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys also signaled they may try to discredit a volatile
eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott, by bringing out her criminal record.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical testimony backed defense claims that the officers believed
Diallo - after refusing orders to halt and pulling out a black object that
turned out to be a wallet - remained a threat the entire time it took to fire 41
bullets into his dimly lit doorway on Feb. 4, 1999. They say 19 bullets hit the
West African immigrant in well under 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors assert the gunfire took longer and, as some of Diallo's
neighbors have testified, was interrupted by a pause. The pause could be used to
argue the officers could have realized their mistake and ceased fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges. If convicted, they
face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of minorities that an appeals
court moved the case to Albany. The trial was adjourned until Monday, when the
officers are expected to begin taking the stand in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, two medical experts charging $250 an hour argued the officers'
high-powered pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet throughout
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   After reviewing Diallo's autopsy, both Mason and Dr. Martin Falkner, a
surgeon specializing in "wound ballistics," theorized that Diallo was standing
and turning to face the officers when 15 bullets hit his left side.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo then took a shot square in the chest that damaged his spine, the
doctors said. His fall then was broken by a wall of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule
where he died, they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony conflicted with that of Dr. Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner
who performed the autopsy. Cohen testified this week that the chest shot
paralyzed Diallo "early on." He said the rest of the bullets must have struck
Diallo as he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the defense asked State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to
order prosecutors to turn over the rap sheet of Elliott. The judge agreed to let
defense attorneys use the information to attack Elliott's credibility when she
resumes testifying.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But city records show
that a 32-year-old woman using the names Schrrie Elliott, Scherie Elliot and
Denise Williams has been arrested and convicted for possession and sale of drugs
at least twice between 1990 and 1994, and has served time on Rikers Island and
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, did not immediately return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled the defense could show the jury clips from two
television news interviews in which Elliott appears to support some details of
the officers' account of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interviews, the witness said that one officer yelled "Gun!" She also
indicates Diallo appeared to be on his feet for most of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott - who had refused
to work with them - to testify as a defense witness about what she heard while
walking home along Diallo's block that morning. She told jurors someone yelled
"Gun!"
</P>
<P>
	   But the move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed the
officers cornered Diallo and opened fire without warning. Prodded by prosecutor
Donald Levin, she broke into tears and said the officers kept shooting after he
fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refuse to comment on why they didn't call Elliott as their own
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   After Elliott's damaging testimony, Teresi declared her an adverse witness.
On Thursday, he rebuffed a prosecution attempt to keep out her criminal record,
saying "credibility is now an issue."

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Hacker Awareness  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging they have a difficult case to crack,
federal cybersleuths found a small silver lining Thursday in this week's
computer attacks on Internet electronic commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least, there's massive awareness of this now,'' said John Bentivoglio,
counsel to the deputy attorney general. ``This week's events did more than we
have ever been able to do with white papers and posting fixes on our website to
alert the private sector to the dangers out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   So, private internet service providers and Internet sites have been turning
over computer logs to help trace the attacks that temporarily shut sites like
eBay and ETrade, Bentivoglio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators would prefer to trace attacks while still in progress, but
that is difficult. Afterwards, they must rely on transaction records at company
sites, university computer systems and Internet service providers. The quality
of these records varies.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged Thursday: ``This is going
to be a difficult case to crack,'' but the FBI is pursuing leads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is ... a hot investigation,'' Holder said. ``These are people who are
criminals, and we will do all that we can to find them, to prosecute them and to
put them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
	   With tens of millions of dollars in losses possible, Holder said the attacks
might lead to tougher penalties than the current 10-year maximum prison sentence
for second offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House also announced Thursday that President Clinton will meet
with the nation's top computer security experts and technology executives in
part to talk about the attacks. The White House said the meeting had originally
been organized on the heels of the president's budget proposal for $2.03 billion
to protect the country's most important computer systems from cyberattacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Months ago, a Carnegie-Mellon University team issued a white paper warning
about denial of service attacks like those this week. Over the New Year's
weekend, the FBI posted free software on its website that would allow
computer-owner to detect whether denial of service tools, known as daemons, had
been secretly placed on their computers. Some 2,600 companies and others
downloaded the free software, and three found daemons, triggering FBI criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   These daemons are later activated by a signal from a remote location or an
internal timer to attack a victim computer site with so many messages it cannot
handle them all. The victim computer sites get tied up and shut down, like an
overloaded telephone system that gives only busy signals or no dial tone.
Investigators call the computers that unwittingly house these daemons ``zombie
computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government took steps Thursday to safeguard themselves from
further attacks. The Defense Department said all its computers with Internet
access will be checked to verify that they were not used as unwitting agents in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   And the General Services Administration also alerted all federal agencies to
ways they can prevent hackers from using electronic tools on their computers
that might have been surreptitiously installed.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens, even hundreds of zombie computers have been used in past attacks,
Bentivoglio said. The number could reach thousands. And the daemons arrive at
the victim site with phony return addresses, making them harder to trace.
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said there is no evidence overseas computers have been used this
week, but that isn't being ruled out because they were used past attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   So little is known about who launched these attacks, or why, that potential
suspects range ``from a teen-aged hacker to state-supported terrorists,'' said
Ron Dick head of the FBI's computer investigations section.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department has trained prosecutors throughout the nation to
respond quickly to computer attacks, but the law poses obstacles to cracking an
attack in progress, Bentivoglio said.
</P>
<P>
	   To tap a telephone line carrying an attack requires a court order, he said.
Just to trace the origin of an ongoing transmission without monitoring its
content also requires a court order, but one that is easier to get.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the administration sought $37 million in additional money to set
up 10 regional computer laboratories, train state and local officers and add 100
members to its computer response teams.
</P>
<P>
	   As it is, ``we catch some; we don't catch them all,'' Bentivoglio said.

<HEADLINE> Energy: Paducah Workers Exposed  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ZUCKERBROD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government report released Thursday confirmed what some
workers at a federal uranium enrichment plant in Kentucky suspected for years:
They were exposed to high levels of radiation on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Energy report does not specify how many Paducah Gaseous
Diffusion Plant workers developed cancer or other diseases. But it does
acknowledge that workers came into contact with radioactive materials and
hazardous chemicals between 1952 and 1990 at levels much higher than allowed
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Those radiation levels usually were within industry and government standards
for the period, though at least two times in 1968 workers were exposed to levels
above even what was allowed then, said David Michaels, assistant secretary for
environment, safety and health at DOE.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm both angered and saddened,'' he said. ``We certainly made some
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michaels said it was impossible to know how much radiation workers were
exposed to because the Paducah plant, which enriched uranium for nuclear weapons
and non-military uses, operated in a ``climate of secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been suspicious ever since I worked there. Different guys were always
getting sick,'' said Al Puckett, a plant employee from 1952 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Puckett is among workers who have filed lawsuits seeking compensation for
radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has proposed spending $21.8 billion to compensate
Paducah workers who have developed cancer. Congress has yet to approve the
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOE investigation began in August after three employees sued, alleging
former operators Lockheed Martin Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. profited by
lying about the extent of environmental pollution and worker exposure to
radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1950s, plant managers did not understand the dangers of
radiation, the report said. But it did cite a letter from 1960 that showed plant
officials were aware of the potential hazards of radioactive material. The
document stated that 300 plant workers ``should be checked out,'' but that
management was hesitant to study the issue for fear the workers' union would
demand hazard pay.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, plant employees were exposed to ``crude experiments'' in the
1950s, in which they inhaled or ingested uranium compounds, according to the
report. It said managers were trying to determine the efficiency of worker
protection systems and the effects of exposure to radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record is unclear as to whether the personnel involved in the
experiments were volunteers or informed participants,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also stated workers' families may have been exposed to radiation
when the workers took contaminated clothing home to be laundered, and that there
was significant contamination of the air, ground and water outside the plant.

<HEADLINE> Rumors About Warren Buffett Denied  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY BEDLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc. denied rumors Thursday that
billionaire investor Warren Buffett is seriously ill, even as investors pushed
the stock to a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
	   Rumors about Buffett's health have been circulating in Internet chat rooms
for the past few days, prompting the company to issue a statement calling the
rumors "100 percent false."
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Marc Hamburg would not elaborate on the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Buffett's company is obligated to report if the 69-year-old
investor is seriously ill or risk facing lawsuits from shareholders who could
lose thousands of dollars if that important information were withheld.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have pushed the price of Berkshire's Class A shares down nearly 8
percent this week. Shares finished Thursday at $47,600, down $900. The stock's
52-week high was $81,100.
</P>
<P>
	   The rumors may have prompted some short-term investors to dump their stocks,
but most of Berkshire's longtime followers likely are still holding on, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyone who would make an investment decision based on what they found in an
Internet chat room is not a sophisticated investor," said George Morgan, a
longtime Buffett watcher and vice president of Kirkpatrick Pettis Investments in
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Berkshire's earnings come from insurance, through its ownership of
General Re, the nation's largest reinsurer, and car insurer Geico. The company
also holds stock in companies including Coca-Cola, Gillette and the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor performances by companies held by Berkshire, not rumors, have likely
caused its drop in stock prices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would imagine that Berkshire is low because some of its portfolio
companies are not performing well, not because people say Warren Buffett is
sick," said Alex Paris Jr. with the Chicago-based investment broker Barrington
Research.
</P>
<P>
	   At Berkshire's annual meetings in May in Omaha, Buffett often is the first
to admit that he will not be around forever. He has long joked that the company
operates on its own, giving the avid bridge player plenty of time to play cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "He buys talented managers and he lets them operate the company for him,"
Morgan said. "Without Buffett, Berkshire may not have the aura but the talent is
there for when he is gone."

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges End to Misleading Calls  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT LAWN, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain on Thursday demanded George W. Bush's
campaign stop making misleading phone calls to voters about him after a woman
told the senator her 14-year-old son was brought to the brink of tears by a
pollster.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor denied his presidential campaign was behind such calls,
and promised, ``If anyone in my campaign has done that, they're going to be
fired.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a day that Steve Forbes officially dropped out of the Republican race,
Bush also offered fresh criticism of chief opponent McCain for transferring $2
million from his Senate campaign account to his presidential fund -- a practice
Bush said he would work to end if president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's political team, meanwhile, continued its work to calm jittery
Republican leaders. In a conference call Wednesday with GOP supporters, campaign
manager Joe Allbaugh said this week was intended to ``staunch the hemorrhaging''
caused by McCain's New Hampshire win and he said campaign polls show that Bush's
more aggressive campaign against the Arizonan ``was having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conference call was private, but two officials who participated
confirmed the events on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead, Allbaugh said the campaign plans next week to describe McCain
as a senator who never accomplished major legislative goals, one official said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the third day running, the two GOP contenders exchanged harsh words long
distance in the battleground state of South Carolina, which holds its primary
Feb. 19. A new American Research Group poll showed a tight race, 46 percent
support for Bush and 39 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, the two clashed over the practice of ``push polling,'' in which
one campaign's pollsters call voters and offer distorted appraisals of
opponents' positions.
</P>
<P>
	   At a town hall meeting in Spartanburg, Donna Duren told McCain that her
14-year-old son, Chris, took a call Wednesday from a ``push poller,'' although
she couldn't name the polling firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren said her son admires McCain and was on the verge of tears after
talking to the pollster who described the candidate, in Duren's words, as ``a
cheat, a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was so mad last night I couldn't sleep,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he would call the boy and he told the woman his campaign doesn't
conduct push polls. ``I promise you, I have never and will never have anything
to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would hope people would contact the Bush campaign,'' McCain said. ``I
can't believe that someone from a good family such as George Bush wouldn't stop
this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governor, campaigning in Fort Lawn, decried the incident and he called
on McCain to join him in letting the public see the scripts they use to call
possible supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to battle for the vote,'' Bush said as he arrived at the
Catawba Fish Camp for a fish fry. ``But there is not authorization, and it's not
going to happen in my campaign, for calling him a liar. It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer released a script for what he said was the
only call the Bush campaign was making. It criticizes McCain for ``negative
campaign tactics,'' but it does not refer to his honesty and asks only one
question, will you support Bush in the GOP presidential primary?
</P>
<P>
	   Calls are being placed to several hundred thousand people identified as
favorable to Bush or undecided in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer accused McCain of using the incident to divert attention from his
fund-raiser Thursday night at a hotel across the street from the White House.
The organizers included two lobbyists whose clients have interests before the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who heads the committee, has decried the effect of special interests
on the political process. Campaign funding reform is the hallmark of his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new line of attack on McCain, Bush criticized the senator for
transferring $2 million from his Senate campaign account to his presidential
fund. And the governor noted that in a speech McCain made on the floor of the
Senate in 1990 he said that rolling over money from one account to another was a
practice used to ``intimidate'' challengers and amounted to ``hypocrisy'' among
reformers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to say something, it's another thing to do it in
politics,'' Bush said. ``I want to make sure that people understand that a
campaign funding reformer must be held to high standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the senator was speaking in 1990 about
the practice of Senate incumbents building warchests to scare off challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that anyone is intimidated by John McCain's fund-raising,
and the Bush campaign continues to try to twist John McCain's words to
substantiate their special interest-funded campaign,'' Opinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Brawlers Found Innocent of Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSIE SEYFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FAIRFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Two men arrested in a stabbing committed by
someone else during a street fight were cleared Thursday of murder charges
brought under a seldom-used legal principle.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury rejected prosecutors' efforts to hold Justin Pacheco and David
Moreno responsible for the death of their friend Jerry English.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men had fought on the same side in a 1997 brawl between two groups
of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   Someone on the other side, Chad O'Connell, stabbed English, but prosecutors
decided O'Connell acted in self-defense and he received only probation for
possession of a weapon. Prosecutors charged Moreno and Pacheco under the
provocative act rule, which allows instigators of fights that end in a death to
be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members cried, hugged and made the sign of the cross as the verdict
was read.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finally, 12 people have brains. It's justice. Now everyone will know
they're innocent,'' Pacheco's mother Joann said, wiping away tears.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacheco and Moreno were ordered released after spending nearly 2 1/2 years
in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a wonderful vindication of common sense, and that's what a jury is
supposed to do,'' said Gerald Uelmen, a law professor at Santa Clara University.
He said the verdict ``will certainly give prosecutors second thoughts'' about
invoking the provocative act rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights groups had charged that Moreno and Pacheco, now both 21, were
singled out by prosecutors because they were the only Hispanics among the nine
people in the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   The provocative act rule, observed in Maryland and California, has been used
only a few times in the past couple of years. Some defense attorneys say it is
being abused as a tool against gang-related crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The brawl stemmed from a series of put-downs and fights between two groups
of teen-agers in Vacaville, a small agricultural town in California's Central
Valley. The night before the deadly brawl, the two groups had scuffled, and a
window was broken on Moreno's car.
</P>
<P>
	   The next day, according to prosecutors, English, Moreno and Pacheco went
looking for O'Connell and his friends. They spotted them and got out of their
car swinging pipes and clubs, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connell, then 16, stabbed the 17-year-old English.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks after Moreno and Pacheco were charged with murder, a judge said the
case had no merit and threw it out. But another judge overruled the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury convicted the two young men in an earlier trial, but the verdict was
thrown out after several female jurors said they had been browbeaten by male
jurors into voting guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Solano County district attorney, David Paulson, said he was disappointed
by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was and remains the position of the Solano County district attorney's
office that these two defendants and their accomplice acted with conscious
disregard for human life,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department disclosed Thursday it is reviewing
whether racial minorities have been unfairly given more federal death sentences
than white defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The review, initiated two months ago at Attorney General Janet Reno's
request, is not a moratorium on executions like that announced recently by
Illinois Gov. George Ryan in his state, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House said last Friday that President Clinton is considering a
Democratic senator's request for a suspension of federal death penalties pending
the outcome of a study like the one Reno ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the system is as fair as it can be,'' Holder
told a news conference. ``It's a historical study of the federal system with an
emphasis on finding out whether or not there are inappropriate racial
disparities'' in the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The study was ordered by the attorney general, I'd say almost out of an
abundance of caution,'' said Holder, who is leading the review. ``We don't have
anything to our knowledge that gives us reason to believe that there is a
disparity within the system. But we want to make sure that is so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said the study would not prevent the Bureau of Prisons from setting
an execution date for any of the 21 people on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. Two-thirds of those prisoners are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   With appeals under way, no dates have been set for their executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno established an elaborate Justice Department review system for deciding
whether to seek death penalties, including private hearings for defendants'
lawyers. But the final decision belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she personally opposes the death penalty, Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek death penalties in 149 cases, out of 517 reviewed under her
procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   The last federal execution was in 1963. In 1972, The Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty had been unfairly applied. State and federal procedures were
revised, so the high court restored the death penalty on the federal level in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, R-Vt., said he was planning legislation
that will allow death row inmates to introduce new DNA evidence in an attempt to
prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is concerned
about the issues raised by Illinois' decision and will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being reviewed by White House counsel, Lockhart said. He added there's no
guarantee President Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Gov. Ryan's halt of executions in Illinois
until authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered fairly.
Since 1977, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 Illinois death row
inmates have been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a
few cases, persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal executions and have Reno
thoroughly review how the federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Earnings Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drugmaker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn on Thursday reported
fourth-quarter profits rose 11 percent due to surging sales for its glaucoma and
overactive bladder drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the company reported some disappointing news on its experimental
anti-depression drug that is awaiting U.S. approval. Pharmacia said Vestra
failed to perform better than a placebo in one of two U.S. clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how that disclosure will impact obtaining Food and Drug
Administration approval, though it could hurt sales if Vestra is cleared for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacia, the maker of Nicorette smoking cessation products and Rogaine for
baldness, said its net earnings, adjusted for legal costs and the sales and
acquisitions of some businesses, rose to $261 million, or 50 cents per share, up
from $235 million, or 45 cents per share a year ago. Results matched
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the impact of its recent acquisition of South San Francisco
biotech company Sugen Inc. and the sale of most of its nutrition business,
profits for the October-December quarter jumped 75 percent, to $214 million, or
40 cents per share, from $122 million, or 22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 5 percent, to $1.94 billion from $1.85 billion. Adjusting for
1998 and 1999 divestments of parts of the nutrition business, sales were up to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, profits adjusted for the divestments and
</P>
<P>
	   other factors hit $944 million, for $1.80 per share. That was up 13.6
percent from net earnings of $631 million, or $1.58 per share, in 1998. Sales
for 1999 rose 12 percent, to $7.2 billion from $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Xalatan, the company's biggest seller and the world's No. 1
glaucoma medication, were up 53 percent for the year to $507 million. Sales rose
53 percent in the fourth quarter to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overactive bladder drugs Detrol and Detrusitol saw sales jump 162 percent to
$329 million for the year, with a 33 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for growth hormone Genotropin, contraceptive injection Depo-Provera
and colorectal cancer drug Camptosar all increased significantly, while sales of
anti-anxiety pill Xanax dropped 15 percent to $72.5 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Last December, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced plans to buy St. Louis-based
Monsanto Co. for about $27 billion. The deal is expected to close by summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Pharmacia fell $1.81 1/4 to $50.06 1/4 at 4:30 p.m. EST on the New
York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Test Blood Clot Zappers  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Doctors trying to stop a stroke in its tracks are
developing some entirely new approaches that use lasers and other gadgets to
blast, smash or grab blood clots lodged deep inside the brain.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology is still in its infancy, and the first report on one of these
devices -- a laser beam on the tip of skinny, flexible tube -- was made Thursday
at a conference in New Orleans of the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Strokes are the nation's No. 3 killer, after heart attacks and cancer. They
are also among the most frustrating of diseases because there is so little
doctors can do for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Most strokes occur when a blood clot gets stuck in one of the brain's
arteries, choking off the blood supply. Unless it can be dislodged within six
hours or so, a section of brain dies, causing paralysis and other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clot-dissolving drugs can stop strokes if given quickly enough, but the
therapy can also trigger bleeding in the brain, so doctors are often reluctant
to offer it. Other recent attempts at developing stroke medicines have been
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
	   Now experts say at least a dozen companies are developing devices intended
to physically remove or destroy these clots. The first results were reported by
Dr. Wayne M. Clark of the Oregon Stroke Center in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark tested a laser developed by TaLIS Inc. of Coon Rapids, Minn. The
results demonstrate both the difficulties and the promise of this approach.
</P>
<P>
	   The arteries inside the head are very narrow and kinked with hairpin turns.
Just reaching them without causing damage is a technological feat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark's team so far has used the laser on five patients with strokes in the
middle cerebral arteries or their branches. In two cases, the laser never
reached the clot. In one case, it partially obliterated the clot, while in
another it destroyed the clot.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in the most recent case, one of the steps in the treatment poked a
hole in the clogged artery, triggering bleeding in the 79-year-old woman's
brain. The patient died, although it is unclear whether the laser or the stroke
itself was to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   In the one success, Clark said, a 78-year-old woman came to the hospital
unable to talk and paralyzed on her left side. She "went from a huge stroke to,
three months later, living alone and taking care of herself. But it's just one
case, and maybe the clot would have dissolved by itself."
</P>
<P>
	   The program has been suspended temporarily while doctors investigate the
death. Eventually, they hope to do 12 procedures, then assess whether the
technology is worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
	   "An adverse event would not necessarily mean they should abandon the effort.
But it means they have to figure out what went wrong," said Dr. Lynn A. Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   TaLIS's president, Charles Hadley, said the laser was developed more than a
decade ago at Massachusetts General Hospital to remove red birthmarks. Because
the laser is absorbed only by red material, doctors looked into the possibility
of using it to blast the blood clots that trigger heart attacks, but that work
was eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
	   The laser is threaded into the brain through a liquid-filled catheter that
is one millimeter thick. Doctors use X-rays to follow its progress.
</P>
<P>
	   To work, the laser must get within a centimeter of the clot. It takes a
minute or two of laser blasting to destroy it. In theory, the artery walls
should not be harmed because they are white, not red, and so will not absorb the
laser energy.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one other company, EndoVasix of Belmont, Calif., is also testing a
laser on stroke patients. Stephen Johnson, the chief financial officer, said the
company hopes to have results by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Employing an altogether different approach, Possis Medical Inc. of
Minneapolis has developed a catheter designed to suck blood clots out of the
brain. The device fires a high-speed water jet away from the clot. This create a
vacuum that draws the clot into the catheter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can get into the upper reaches of the middle cerebral artery," said
Eapen Chacko, a Possis spokesman. "We think we can do that and evacuate the
clot."
</P>
<P>
	   Testing of the approach is set to begin in March at six medical centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other devices in the works could obliterate clots with sound waves or grab
them with a variety of mechanical claws and haul them out. Still another
approach is to try to put oxygen into the brain to compensate for the blocked
blood flow.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides potentially being less likely to trigger bleeding, these mechanical
devices may also work faster than clot-dissolving drugs, which take an hour or
two to break up a clot.
</P>
<P>
	   "The idea is, the quicker you get it removed, the better," Clark said. Using
a laser, "it takes seconds vs. hours."

<HEADLINE> Government releases more money to New York to help poor pay heating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration announced Thursday that it
is providing New York with an additional $34 million in emergency funds to help
low-income people deal with soaring heating oil costs.
<P>
	   The government is releasing $130 million nationally, one-third of it going
to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've gotten the message. We know there's a crisis in the Northeast. We
hear our people are hurting," Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This funding will ensure that the program is adequately funded to meet the
additional demands this winter," Gov. George Pataki said. "These high costs
threaten the health and safety of children, families and the elderly. It's
obvious the federal government realized their error in the last round of
funding."
</P>
<P>
	   New York received only $2.6 million in the Clinton administration's last
round of emergency fuel help last month. That was well below what state
officials had sought for the 1.4 million poor residents eligible for federal
assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   The spike in heating oil costs has struck particularly hard in New York,
which relies on heating oil more than any other state. Forty-three percent of
New York households use oil for heat. Of those 2.9 million households, nearly 80
percent are concentrated in New York City metropolitan area, according to F.
William Valentino, president of the New York State Energy and Research and
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   He said over the past three weeks retail heating oil prices have increased
by more than 75 cents per gallon to $2.02 per gallon on average statewide. In
the New York City area, prices are running $2.25 per gallon. Last year, the
price was 91 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Valentino testified Thursday before the House International Relations
Committee hearing on the oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   At that hearing, Democratic and Republican lawmakers blasted the Clinton
administration for not taking the problem seriously enough. They also attacked
the administration for not putting enough pressure on oil-producing nations to
loosen their stranglehold on the supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices soared after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
cut the supply by 4.3 million barrels a day last year after oil prices dipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's matter of trying to get the OPEC nations to turn on the spigot and let
the market determine what the prices should be," said the committee's chairman
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-Middletown.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices have also been pushed skyward by severe weather in the Northeast.
Frigid temperatures have forced consumers to use more oil and have clogged
waterways with ice making it more difficult for barges to deliver oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers on Thursday also questioned why the government had not released
oil from the emergency government stockpile to try to dampen prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said unless something was done to break OPEC's
stranglehold, gas prices would also soar this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said the administration remains opposed to using the
strategic reserve to affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this administration's view the markets should dictate prices,"
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson said a variety of measures would be taken to try to boost
heating oil production at Northeast refineries.
</P>
<P>
	   These include issuing temporary waivers at some refineries for compliance
with clean air laws, urging refiners to defer routine maintenance and lifting
waivers on the hours that truckers carrying heating oil may work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson also said the U.S. Coast Guard was creating a task force to give
priority to heating oil shipments at terminals and the government was urging
utilities to switch from heating oil to natural gas in an effort to ease the
price crunch.

<HEADLINE> Two arrested in multimillion-dollar inspection sticker scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Two Jersey City men made millions selling
hundreds of phony car inspection stickers and insurance cards for $200 apiece -
a price inflated by New Jersey's well-documented auto inspection troubles,
police said Thursday.
<P>
	   The state's recent trouble installing its new inspection system, which
caused hours in delays, helped triple the price of these counterfeit stickers in
recent weeks, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you go inspect your car, four hours on the line," Police Sgt. Edgar
Martinez said. "No one wants to wait four hours on the line. So that's why it
turned out to be a big business."
</P>
<P>
	   The centralized inspection lines became clogged after new emissions and
safety inspection tests were installed Dec. 13. State officials have taken some
measures to cut down on the lines at the busiest stations while the private
vendor, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, tries to fix computer problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Charged were Rafael Ottenwalder, 44, and Jesus Valle, 57. Police arrested
Valle on Wednesday while pursuing an investigation of "chop shops" and Valle led
police to Ottenwalder, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police seized 25 fraudulent state inspection stickers and 113 counterfeit
insurance cards from State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual and Prudential at
Valle's tire shop.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers found 249 fraudulent inspection stickers and 108 counterfeit
insurance cards at Ottenwalder's business, Jersey City Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottenwalder was earning more than $3 million a year selling the documents,
while Valle earned more than $1.8 million, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They looked so real that no one would know that they're fake," Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating to determine whether the stickers and cards were
stolen from the state and insurance companies or were counterfeited.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottenwalder and Valle were both charged with forgery and various counts of
possessing false documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also recovered a 1984 Jeep Cherokee stolen from a car dealership in
March 1998 at Valle's home. The car had been retagged with a new vehicle
identification number, police said. Several thousand used tires were also
discovered on the property.

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Clinton Farm Aid Inadequate  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans opened an election-year battle over aid to
farmers Thursday by saying the administration's $5.8 billion package of farm
assistance is "woefully short."
</P>
<P>
	   "The initial reaction to it is, is that all there is? Where is the rest of
it?" the House Agriculture Committee chairman, GOP Rep. Larry Combest of Texas,
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's plan, which would be the third
multibillion dollar farm bailout in as many years, is a new "supplemental
income" program that would cost $3.1 billion and be targeted toward small and
moderate-size farmers. An additional $1.3 billion is earmarked for farmers who
participate in conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest said he did not think the administration's package is "going
anywhere" and called it "something that is woefully short."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., the chairman of the Senate's agricultural
appropriations committee, told Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman at a hearing
Thursday that many Southern producers would not qualify for the supplemental
income program because of a proposed $30,000 cap on payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said his proposals should serve as an "intellectual framework for
what the emergency package should look like."
</P>
<P>
	   The supplemental income payments would be pegged to the average gross income
nationally over the past five years for eight major crops -- corn, wheat,
cotton, rice, soybeans, sorghum, oats and barley.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has provided $15 billion in special assistance to farmers over the
past two years to compensate for low commodity prices and crop failures.
Glickman had criticized the way Congress distributed the money in 1998 and 1999
but did not propose an alternative plan for making the payments until this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department expects net farm income this year to drop $7.6
billion, or 16 percent, barring another aid package from Congress. Existing
government programs are expected to provide farmers with $17 billion in direct
payments this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said it was important to direct some of the extra aid that Congress
approves this year toward conservation programs, another idea to which
Republicans have reacted coolly.
</P>
<P>
	   Combest announced plans for a series of hearings on farm policy that will
start March 6 in Lubbock, Texas, and continue March 17-18 in Memphis, Tenn., and

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co Sues Over 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that insures ABC's hit game show, "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire," is suing to get out of its contract because it claims the
questions are too easy and they're at risk of paying out too much prize money.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC says viewers shouldn't worry about the legal fight -- they're planning
no changes to the show.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based insurance underwriters Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in
Britain's High Court of Justice on Jan. 24 against Buena Vista Entertainment,
Inc., the show's producers, to end its contract.
</P>
<P>
	   In essence, Goshawk said it needed assurances that "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" would ask harder questions and select dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" has been the television sensation of the year, frequently
pulling in 30 million viewers a night and propelling ABC to the top of the
ratings. Host Regis Philbin's question -- "Is that your final answer?" -- has
become a national catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
	   Other television networks have quickly tried to imitate "Millionaire," to
mixed success.
</P>
<P>
	   Under its contract, Goshawk is required to pay out prize money to
contestants who win $500,000 or more on the show. There's a deductible of $1.5
million before Goshawk is required to pay and a ceiling of $5 million. That
means, for example, Goshawk would only be required to pay prizes to five winners
of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reached in London on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Goshawk refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unquestionably, the integrity of the show is above reproach and nobody is
claiming otherwise," ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said. "This is simply a
dispute in which the company providing insurance is trying to get out of
coverage on the basis of a conversation it had with a broker."
</P>
<P>
	   Two "Millionaire" contestants -- an Internal Revenue Service agent from
Connecticut and a Miami attorney -- correctly answered 15 questions and won $1
million. By contrast, no player on the original British version of the game show
has ever won the big prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Through 51 shows, there have also been three $500,000 winners. "Millionaire"
has given out a total of $9,314,000 in prize money since it has been on the air,
according to ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. One
contestant was asked which condiment is also known as a Latin dance, correctly
choosing salsa over the other options: mustard, mayonnaise and relish.
</P>
<P>
	   They get harder as the stakes grow higher. The first million-dollar winner
won by correctly identifying the U.S. president to appear on the television
show, "Laugh-In." The second had to know the distance between the Earth and the
sun.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Goshawk said it needed "significant changes in the level of
control" to "reduce the unacceptable level of losses." Specifically, the
syndicate asked for changes in the method of contestant selection and the degree
of difficulty of the questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Since no changes were made since it first asked for them in late December,
Goshawk said that "substantial losses under the insurance are expected."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoover was not sure what the next step in the case would be.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the show's producers were to lose the insurance, it wasn't likely to
affect ABC's commitment to the series. It now airs three nights a week, and
gives ABC bragging rights as the No. 1 network -- with the substantial
advertising revenue that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, ABC announced on Thursday that it was airing three more special
editions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" during the February ratings
"sweeps."

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell sharply across-the-board
Thursday after investors greeted a $10 billion government auction of new
long-term securities with a notable lack of enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   Bids received on the notes were the lowest in at least 17 years, analysts
said. The auction was the final phase of a $32 billion quarterly government
refinancing.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell 1 9/16 points, or $15.63 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose to
6.43 percent from 6.32 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight losing session for the benchmark long-term bond.
The bond fell 1 3/16 points, or $11.87 1/2, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond market volatility has mirrored the rapid and violent swings in the U.S.
stock markets since a recent announcement that the federal government plans to
pay down the national debt by reducing the amount of bonds in circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices rose sharply late last week on fears that the supply of the
highly popular 30-year bond would dwindle. Now the prices are falling as rapidly
as they climbed.
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility has kept many investors out of the Treasury markets, which
has reduced liquidity -- or the ability to make trades. And that lack of
liquidity has only contributed to the market's roller coaster behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Only $13.3 billion in bids was received for the $10 billion in bonds sold
Thursday, an unusually light display of trader interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged or fell 1/32 point
Thursday, while intermediate maturities fell 9/32 point or 27/32 point,
according to the Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.65
percent, with the discount falling 0.03 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.49
percent. Six-month yields were 5.96 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage
point from Tuesday to 5.70 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.17 percent,
with the discount rising 0.01 percentage point to 5.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.81 percent from Wednesday's 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 3/32 point to 91 29/32. The
yield was 6.26 percent, up from 6.25 percent Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Hacker Awareness  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging they have a difficult case to crack,
federal cybersleuths found a small silver lining Thursday in this week's
computer attacks on Internet electronic commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least, there's massive awareness of this now,'' said John Bentivoglio,
counsel to the deputy attorney general. ``This week's events did more than we
have ever been able to do with white papers and posting fixes on our website to
alert the private sector to the dangers out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   So, private internet service providers and Internet sites have been turning
over computer logs to help trace the attacks that temporarily shut sites like
eBay and ETrade, Bentivoglio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators would prefer to trace attacks while still in progress, but
that is difficult. Afterwards, they must rely on transaction records at company
sites, university computer systems and Internet service providers. The quality
of these records varies.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged Thursday: ``This is going
to be a difficult case to crack,'' but the FBI is pursuing leads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is ... a hot investigation,'' Holder said. ``These are people who are
criminals, and we will do all that we can to find them, to prosecute them and to
put them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
	   With tens of millions of dollars in losses possible, Holder said the attacks
might lead to tougher penalties than the current 10-year maximum prison sentence
for second offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House also announced Thursday that President Clinton will meet
with the nation's top computer security experts and technology executives in
part to talk about the attacks. The White House said the meeting had originally
been organized on the heels of the president's budget proposal for $2.03 billion
to protect the country's most important computer systems from cyberattacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Months ago, a Carnegie-Mellon University team issued a white paper warning
about denial of service attacks like those this week. Over the New Year's
weekend, the FBI posted free software on its website that would allow
computer-owner to detect whether denial of service tools, known as daemons, had
been secretly placed on their computers. Some 2,600 companies and others
downloaded the free software, and three found daemons, triggering FBI criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   These daemons are later activated by a signal from a remote location or an
internal timer to attack a victim computer site with so many messages it cannot
handle them all. The victim computer sites get tied up and shut down, like an
overloaded telephone system that gives only busy signals or no dial tone.
Investigators call the computers that unwittingly house these daemons ``zombie
computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government took steps Thursday to safeguard its computers from
being used as ``zombies'' in such attacks. The Defense Department said all its
computers with Internet access will be checked to verify that they were not used
as unwitting agents in this week's attack.
</P>
<P>
	   And the General Services Administration also alerted all federal agencies to
ways they can prevent hackers from using electronic tools that might have been
surreptitiously installed on their computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens, even hundreds of zombie computers have been used in past attacks,
Bentivoglio said. The number could reach thousands. And the daemons arrive at
the victim site with phony return addresses, making them harder to trace.
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said there is no evidence overseas computers have been used this
week, but that isn't being ruled out because they were used past attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   So little is known about who launched these attacks, or why, that potential
suspects range ``from a teen-aged hacker to state-supported terrorists,'' said
Ron Dick head of the FBI's computer investigations section.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department has trained prosecutors throughout the nation to
respond quickly to computer attacks, but the law poses obstacles to cracking an
attack in progress, Bentivoglio said.
</P>
<P>
	   To tap a telephone line carrying an attack requires a court order, he said.
Just to trace the origin of an ongoing transmission without monitoring its
content also requires a court order, but one that is easier to get.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the administration sought $37 million in additional money to set
up 10 regional computer laboratories, train state and local officers and add 100
members to its computer response teams.
</P>
<P>
	   As it is, ``we catch some; we don't catch them all,'' Bentivoglio said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Laments Plight of Child Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday
lamented the plight of child soldiers like those in the Myanmar rebel group
God's Army, which was involved in a disastrous raid on a Thai provincial
hospital two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan praised Thai authorities for bringing the siege to an end without
harming any of the hundreds of hostages, but said the incident pointed to the
increasing use of child soldiers across the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Children are being turned into ``fighting machines,'' he was quoted as
saying by Thai government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart after a meeting with Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels, including three students who took shelter with God's Army after
pulling off a raid at the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok in October, took over the
hospital to pressure Thailand to grant them refuge from fighting with Myanmar
forces. All ten hostage-takers were shot and killed by Thai commandos.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army, led by 12-year-old twins Johnny and Luther Htoo, is fighting for
survival in jungles along the Thai-Myanmar border. They have battled the
military regime of Myanmar, also known as Burma, for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins, who were not among the 10 killed at the Ratchaburi hospital, are
believed by their 100 to 200 followers to have mystical powers that make them
invulnerable in battle. Many of their followers are children as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The Myanmar government has been criticized by the United Nations for
widespread human rights abuses. It claims that God's Army is a front for a
bigger rebel army of ethnic Karen insurgents and that the Karen rebels are using
the children to win international sympathy for their cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan is in Thailand for the opening of a major U.N. trade and development
conference that starts Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of counterterrorism efforts ahead of that conference, hundreds of
Thai security forces and sniffer dogs swept through Myanmar refugee camps
looking for arms Thursday. No arms or explosives were found.
</P>
<P>
	   During his meeting with Annan Thursday, Chuan raised the issue of the over
100,000 Myanmar refugees sheltering in Thai camps on the border between the two
countries. Thailand wants the UNHCR to play a ``more active'' role at the
border, Akapol quoted Chuan as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Struggles With China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House knows it has a struggle on its hands
getting fellow Democrats to sign on to a new trade agreement with China, Cabinet
secretaries and President Clinton's top aide said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on Capitol
Hill,'' said White House chief of staff John Podesta, as he asked for lobbying
help from agricultural interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration wants a vote as early as possible, and definitely
before midsummer, on trade accords that would set China on the path toward
joining the World Trade Organization. The accords would do away with the annual
fight in Congress over granting China normal trading status by making that
status permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized labor, environmental groups and many Democrats in Congress oppose
the agreement as dangerous to U.S. workers or complain it gives the United
States less leverage to win improvements in human rights and individual freedoms
in China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are people who have strong views who don't agree with us,'' Podesta
told farm groups at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration is arguing that the trade deal is especially good for
farmers because it eases export restrictions for agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
	   Winning the vote will depend in large part on farm and business interests
making their case with individual members of Congress, Podesta and other
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who is leading the administration lobbying,
said he is already encountering heavy pressure from the other side. He and other
administration officials meet weekly to discuss strategy, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an extremely aggressive program going on because the stakes are
extremely high,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle last year, defeat of the
trade accords ``would send a terrible signal'' to other countries that look to
the United States as a free-trade leader, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After reporters were ushered from the meeting room, Daley gave a frank
assessment of the difficulty a Democratic administration will have in pressing a
case opposed by so many of its own. His comments were still being broadcast to
reporters outside the room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an issue that is divisive in the Democratic caucus,'' Daley said.
``The question is, do you want to go through this every year or maybe bite the
bullet and let's get on with it.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Argues for Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bill Bradley, standing Thursday with parents of children
killed by guns, accused Al Gore of coming late and ending up weak on the
emotional issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Framing his contrast in unusually barbed terms, Bradley said: ``This is not
an issue that I came to after seeing television pictures of Columbine. This is
an issue that I believed as a matter of fundamental principle throughout my
public life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore has not always
done that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign countered that Bradley was trying to manufacture
differences where none exist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Gore has been a strong advocate for gun safety laws,'' said
Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer,
co-chair of Gore's California campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But spokesman Chris Lehane acknowledged that Gore's record in Congress bears
little resemblance to his gun-control stance of today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His position changed to match the changing times,'' Lehane said, noting
the proliferation of gun violence in the past decade. ``The public looks for
leaders who respond to the changing times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to youngsters at El Sereno Middle School -- parents of youngsters
who were killed standing with him -- Bradley said Gore voted against a 1990 bill
to expand a federal ban on assault weapons and only wants to register new
handguns while ignoring an estimated 60 million current weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he wants to license and register all handguns but Gore has
dismissed the plan as too difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The essence of leadership is to take on that which is considered too hard
to do and make it happen. That's what leaders do as opposed to politicians,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to national registration of handguns, Bradley's plan calls for
banning gun dealers from residential neighborhoods, limiting the number of guns
a person can buy each year, banning small, cheap ``Saturday night specials'' and
ordering background checks for purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   As a senator, Gore in 1985 voted against a 14-day waiting period for handgun
purchases and in 1990 voted against an amendment that would have prohibited the
sale of large-capacity ammunition magazines and banned a dozen types of
assault-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth on guns came as both Democratic presidential contenders
campaigned in California with an eye on the state's primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Washington, negotiations between their campaigns for weekly debates
broke down over the Gore camp's insistence that Bradley give up all television
ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, trying to revive his campaign after losing in Iowa, New Hampshire
and Delaware, instead announced new campaign ads starring former basketball star
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's calculus for a comeback includes ferreting out vulnerabilities in
Gore's record as a U.S. representative and senator from Tennessee. In New
Hampshire, Bradley closed the gap with women voters after reminding them that
Gore cast dozens of anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley planned to bring back the abortion issue in a Seattle appearance on
Friday, and supporters were staging 25 news conferences around the country to
talk about the candidates' gun control positions.
</P>
<P>
	   On another issue, Bradley's campaign issued a new analysis of his and Gore's
health care proposals. The statement said the University of California, Los
Angeles, Center for Health Policy Research analyzed the plans at the campaign's
request.
</P>
<P>
	   The analysis concluded that Bradley's plan would subsidize 82 percent of the
3.46 million uninsured adults in California with incomes up to 250 percent of
the federal poverty level, while Gore's would help 43 percent, or 1.48 million
people.
</P>
<P>
	   During his school visit, Bradley was joined by Margaret Ensley, Sheri
Barnett and Ruett Foster, all of whom had lost children to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ensley, president of Mothers Against Violence in Schools, banged a miniature
coffin against the lectern. ``This does not have to be the legacy,'' she said,
emphasizing her support for Bradley's proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Michael Shawn Ensley, was shot to death at his high school in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Foster's 7-year-old son, Evan, was struck in the head by a bullet in 1997 as
he sat in his mother's car while she signed him up for a basketball league.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnett's son, Tony, was shot to death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's speech was applauded by the sixth-to-eighth graders at the
eastside school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most presidents don't know about gun violence. I think he knows,'' said
Angela Pando, 12, who lost a 15-year-old cousin in a drive-by shooting several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Students recently held a candy drive to fund a gun buyback campaign. When
two students who organized the program asked how many students knew someone who
had been injured or killed by a gun, more than half the 100 youngsters raised
their hands.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Opposition Lauds EU Move  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's opposition leaders on Thursday praised
the U.S. and European Union decision to ease sanctions against their country,
saying it would benefit the democratic forces, not President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help the people of Serbia fully realize that we are the democratic
alternative ... that we are making life better here and take our country out of
isolation, back to the world community,'' said Democratic Party leader Zoran
Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
	   Ending the air embargo will also be a major boost to the image and rating of
opposition parties, Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing ordinary Serbians to fly from Belgrade will underline the travel
ban on Milosevic and hundreds of his associates who remain unwelcome within the
European Union and other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United States
endorsed a move by the European Union to lift the ban on commercial air travel
with Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, while keeping up political and
economic pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   The formal EU decision is expected on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Marriage Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   How the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates would address the
``marriage penalty'' in the tax code:
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: Would let married couples among the working poor make $2,000
more before the earned income tax credit starts phasing down, and make other
improvements in the credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: Would make the standard deduction for couples who don't itemize
twice that of singles, and let couples among the working poor make more before
starting to lose the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: Would make the income limit for the lowest tax bracket for
couples twice that for single filers, so that the first $12,000 for couples and
the first $6,000 for singles would be taxed at a new rate of 10 percent. The gap
between couples and singles would not be closed in the higher tax brackets or in
the standard deduction. But the plan for across-the-board tax cuts would restore
a specific Reagan-era deduction: In a two-earner family, the spouse making less
could deduct 10 percent -- up to $3,000 -- of his or her income.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: Would replace income tax with national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: Would make the standard deduction for married couples twice
that of a single person, and would make the income limit for the 15 percent tax
bracket for married couples double that of single filers, in a plan similar to
that passed by the House. Plan also expands the income limit for the 15 percent
bracket to $70,000 for couples, much higher than in the House bill.

<HEADLINE> VA Office Warnings Predated Audit  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Months before an audit uncovered similar problems, the
Veterans Affairs Department's chief financial officer repeatedly alerted top
officials to concerns about the spending and hiring practices inside the
agency's congressional liaison office, memos show.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have rarely encountered such flagrant disregard for managerial
responsibilities,'' chief financial officer Edward A. Powell wrote to VA
Secretary Togo West in one of several internal memos that expressed dismay about
the office while it was headed by Sheila Clarke McCready.
</P>
<P>
	   Other officials, including the department's internal watchdog, also sent up
warning flags about McCready's office, according to memos and electronic mail
messages obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The warnings began about a year ago. But little action was taken until an
audit last month concluded McCready, as head of the Office of Congressional
Affairs, overspent her $2.3 million budget and improperly used consultants to do
the work of career employees.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Powell had to transfer $390,000 to cover extra spending in the
liaison office, records show. The audit alleged the office failed to answer
congressional requests on behalf of veterans for months.
</P>
<P>
	   McCready since has been transferred to a job in the Veterans Health
Administration but continues to earn more than $130,000 a year. She did not
respond to phone messages Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Her attorney, Richard Gordin, said she ``was carrying out the secretary's
instructions in her efforts within the department and a full disclosure of all
memoranda and e-mails would confirm that she acted completely appropriately.''
He would not supply any of those documents.
</P>
<P>
	   West is likely to field questions about the audit at a Feb. 17 House
Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on the agency budget. A key veterans group
said Thursday it was concerned VA officials had early warnings about a situation
that slowed responses to veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had over a year to correct the problem, this organization is very
concerned with the absence of proper management,'' said Alan G. Lance, national
commander of the American Legion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of our veterans ... who do not receive satisfactory responses,
adequate care or entitlements go directly to their congressmen,'' Lance said.
``As a result of the failure to correct the problem, how many veterans failed to
get legitimate benefits?''
</P>
<P>
	   VA spokesman John Hanson declined comment Thursday on why West did not act
sooner. Hanson pointed out that McCready has been transferred and all but one
consultant -- who now is one of West's schedulers -- had their contracts
terminated.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal memos detail a yearlong campaign by Powell, the chief fiscal
officer, and others to raise concerns about McCready's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell wrote McCready on Feb. 22, 1999, that he was ``troubled'' by her
desire to add staff without a department-required reorganization plan, and
added, ``I am not inclined to support additional funding for new personnel''
without such a plan.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Powell wrote VA chief of staff Janice Joyner that McCready
``has consistently overspent her budget and continues to do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powell was not alone in his criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Gaskell, an official in the inspector general's office, wrote
McCready on Sept. 24 that her actions to extend the temporary detail of a
Defense Department employee were ``inappropriate'' under terms of the federal
Anti-Deficiency Act.
</P>
<P>
	   That law prevents federal officials from spending money before they know the
funds are approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months earlier, VA budget official Kathleen Hamilton raised concerns
that she had ``not received any documentation'' from McCready to justify the
Pentagon detail -- a legal requirement for such interagency agreements
</P>
<P>
	   Gordin, McCready's attorney, said his client's hiring and spending decisions
were ``within the guidelines that she as a career government employee was
provided by appropriate officials within the department.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, McCready denied in an e-mail to Powell that she improperly
used consultants or exceeded ``my amended budget authority.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powell continued to take his case up the VA chain of command, eventually
writing West last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Again and again, Sheila would request funding for activities which had not
been authorized,'' Powell wrote West on Jan. 19. His memo added that McCready
``threatened me with your displeasure if I did not let her do what she wanted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
investigations subcommittee, complained that McCready still holds a high
position in the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the real world, a corporate executive who overspent his office budget
by almost $390,000 and reduced his organization to chaos would be shown the
door,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Accuses Mayor on Letters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday accused Senate
rival Rudolph Giuliani of running a campaign based on insults and demanded he
make public the fund-raising letters he has sent out for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of New York's Conservative Party called on Richard
Viguerie, a guru of conservative direct-mail fund raising, to drop Giuliani as a
client.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not a conservative,'' Michael Long wrote Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Long was the latest sign that the small, but politically
important party would shun Giuliani. Since 1974, no New York Republican has won
a statewide race without also having Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second straight day, the first lady criticized the New York City mayor
for sending out a fund-raising letter to conservatives that accused her of
harboring ``hostility toward America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is wrong to use religion as a political weapon and he should
know that,'' Clinton said outside the Ann Street Restaurant &AMP; Deli in Little
Falls, about 60 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she wanted the mayor to release all his fund-raising letters
because, ``I would like the people of New York to know there's a big difference
between the kind of campaigns we're running. I intend to run a campaign based on
issues and ideas, not on insults.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he had on Wednesday, Giuliani continued to laugh off the Clinton attack.
The mayor said Thursday he would make public his fund-raising letters only if
Clinton reimbursed the federal government for the full cost of her travel on
government airplanes during her campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they make out the check, we'll make the letters available,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has said it has reimbursed the government what it is
required to.
</P>
<P>
	   Also taking Giuliani to task for sending out his fund-raising letter was the
head of the Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am frightened by the specter of a New York senatorial campaign that
turns religion into a political football,'' the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the 100,000-member organization, wrote in a letter to both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton obviously intended to stay on the attack, she did end up
giving the mayor faint praise when a reporter asked whether he might be taking
too much credit for the crime rate reduction in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's been a good partnership and a good team and I give full
credit to the mayors of all the cities, including New York, who have used the
tools at our disposal, who have worked with the federal government and
particularly with the president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the improving economy, her husband the president and the
Congress -- and Giuliani's first police commissioner, William Bratton, whom the
mayor fired -- should also share in the credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said she was ``very grateful'' that Giuliani helped
lobby for President Clinton's Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994 aimed at putting an
extra 100,000 police officers on the streets. The mayor's support for the
president had been criticized at the time by some Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to give credit where credit is due,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Still Not Ready To Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- There won't be a Valentine's Day return to the air for
heart patient David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, CBS will continue to air versions of "Late Show Backstage," where
stars are interviewed reminiscing about their appearances on Letterman's show.
With guests like Julia Roberts and Jerry Seinfeld this week, the specials have
been unexpected ratings winners.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Barrymore and Ray Romano will appear next Monday, interviewed by Paul
Shaffer, "Late Show" executive producer Rob Burnett said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Robin Williams, Bill Murray and Alec Baldwin are other potential guests next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "This idea will run its course by the end of next week," Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Letterman is not ready to return by Feb. 21, CBS will likely use guest
hosts to fill in for him "or some other crazy idea," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There had been rumors that Letterman would be ready to come back by Feb. 14,
but Burnett said they were overstated. He said Letterman is recovering from his
Jan. 14 emergency bypass with no complications.

<HEADLINE> Defense witnesses say Diallo shot while standing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hoping to counter charges police kept shooting
Amadou Diallo after he was down, two medical experts testified Thursday that the
unarmed Bronx man stood throughout most of the gunfire.
<P>
	   "My primary view of the position of the deceased, Mr. Diallo, is that he's
upright," a defense pathologist, Dr. Richard Mason, said at the trial of four
police officers accused of murdering Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys also signaled they may try to discredit a volatile
eyewitness, Schrrie Elliott, by bringing out her criminal record.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical testimony backed defense claims that the officers believed
Diallo - after refusing orders to halt and pulling out a black object that
turned out to be a wallet - remained a threat the entire time it took to fire 41
bullets into his dimly lit doorway on Feb. 4, 1999. They say 19 bullets hit the
West African immigrant in well under 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors assert the gunfire took longer and, as some of Diallo's
neighbors have testified, was interrupted by a pause. The pause could be used to
argue the officers could have realized their mistake and ceased fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges. If convicted, they
face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked enough
pretrial publicity and protest over police abuse of minorities that an appeals
court moved the case to Albany. The trial was adjourned until Monday, when the
officers are expected to begin taking the stand in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, two medical experts charging $250 an hour argued the officers'
high-powered pistols fired fast enough for Diallo to stay on his feet throughout
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   After reviewing Diallo's autopsy, both Mason and Dr. Martin Fackler, a
surgeon specializing in "wound ballistics," theorized that Diallo was standing
and turning to face the officers when 15 bullets hit his left side.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo then took a shot square in the chest that damaged his spine, the
doctors said. His fall then was broken by a wall of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule
where he died, they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony conflicted with that of Dr. Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner
who performed the autopsy. Cohen testified this week that the chest shot
paralyzed Diallo "early on." He said the rest of the bullets must have struck
Diallo as he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the defense asked State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to
order prosecutors to turn over the rap sheet of Elliott. The judge agreed to let
defense attorneys use the information to attack Elliott's credibility when she
resumes testifying.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But city records show
that a 32-year-old woman using the names Schrrie Elliott, Scherie Elliot and
Denise Williams has been arrested and convicted for possession and sale of drugs
at least twice between 1990 and 1994, and has served time on Rikers Island and
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott's attorney, Kevin Fee, did not immediately return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled the defense could show the jury clips from two
television news interviews in which Elliott appears to support some details of
the officers' account of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interviews, the witness said that one officer yelled "Gun!" She also
indicates Diallo appeared to be on his feet for most of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott - who had refused
to work with them - to testify as a defense witness about what she heard while
walking home along Diallo's block that morning. She told jurors someone yelled
"Gun!"
</P>
<P>
	   But the move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed the
officers cornered Diallo and opened fire without warning. Prodded by prosecutor
Donald Levin, she broke into tears and said the officers kept shooting after he
fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refuse to comment on why they didn't call Elliott as their own
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   After Elliott's damaging testimony, Teresi declared her an adverse witness.
On Thursday, he rebuffed a prosecution attempt to keep out her criminal record,
saying "credibility is now an issue."

<HEADLINE> Truckers cruise statehouse to demand relief from high fuel prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Horns blaring, engines roaring and transmissions
stuck in first gear, about 100 trucks slowly circled the streets around the
Statehouse on Thursday morning to protest steep increases in diesel fuel and to
ask Gov. Christie Whitman for help.
<P>
	   The protest, organized by independent truckers from southern New Jersey,
tied up traffic in the capitol area for several hours. But most of the
slow-moving rigs crept along just enough to avoid running afoul of police who
kept a close eye on the procession.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're here today to send a message to the governor about the impact these
fuel prices are having on our industry," said Thomas Pokrywka, president of the
Owner Operator Trucking Association of South Jersey. "We're asking the governor
if we can temporarily repeal the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need the governor to know this isn't a situation that can go on for the
next few months until prices go down in the spring," he said. "A lot of guys
won't make it 'till spring. You have truckers who now have to choose whether to
put fuel in the tank or food on the table. It's that bad."
</P>
<P>
	   One trucker who's having trouble making ends meet is Ed, an independent
driver from Vineland who allowed a reporter to ride with him during the protest
on the condition his last name not be published. He contracts with companies to
haul loads of gravel, sand or other materials to and from construction sites six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Normally I spend $75 a day on fuel," he said, while inching his shiny black
dump truck and its 100-gallon tank along West State Street and waving to fellow
truckers. "Now I'm paying $160. The other day I paid $172.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, it's costing all of us 15 to 30 percent more to operate," said
Ed, who's been driving a truck for three years. "I have a wife, two kids, a
mortgage and a dozen credit cards."
</P>
<P>
	   He said others will soon feel the same pinch truckers are feeling.
</P>
<P>
	   "What people don't realize is it's going to hit them soon, too," he said.
"Everything you buy comes off a truck somewhere down the line. You'll pay more
for food at the grocery store. Then you'll go to Wal-Mart and pay more there,
too."
</P>
<P>
	   Ed said truckers don't understand the rapid run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody is telling us why this is happening," he said. "Nobody understands
why."
</P>
<P>
	   Other independent truckers held a similar protest Thursday in Port
Elizabeth, where they formed human blockades, surrounding other truckers who
were still working and asking them to join in. Some talked tough but no violence
was reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's gonna be a bloodbath out here," said one.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers said they planned another protest on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Dressler, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers
Association, said the price increases were caused by Middle East oil-producing
nations agreeing to cut back production, driving up the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
	   He and other truckers said they hoped Whitman would use her influence with
federal authorities to start a government investigation into possible price
gouging by refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks ago, the governor wrote to President Clinton asking him to help
bring down the cost of home heating oil and diesel fuel by releasing some oil
from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. She also asked to have the
appropriate federal agencies investigate possible price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said Thursday she will ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
as a last resort to allow New Jersey to burn oil with a higher sulfur content so
that more fuel would be available until prices come down.
</P>
<P>
	   And U.S. Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly, asked U.S. Secretary of Energy
Bill Richardson on Thursday to release petroleum reserves, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman did not address the truckers' request for a temporary fuel tax
repeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "To do something like that would require legislation, and the governor feels
this is something that needs to be addressed immediately, which is why she's
focused on things like getting fuel released from the strategic reserve," said
spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers said the rapid increase in diesel fuel prices is forcing many
truckers to park their rigs.
</P>
<P>
	   "How does fuel go from 87 cents a gallon in September to $1.97 now?" asked
Rollo LaSasso of Hammonton, a driver for Habina Trucking in Blackwood. "Our
company has 12 to 14 trucks, and they've all been parked for a week. It's just
not feasible to run the equipment."
</P>
<P>
	   Pokrywka said most independent truckers have contracts with their customers
to haul goods or materials at a set price.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't go back to them and ask them to pay 20 to 30 percent more because
fuel costs went up," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vehicles, mostly dump trucks, met up in Hammonton and formed a convoy
along Route 206 into Trenton, where they began slowly circling the blocks in
front of the Statehouse before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Trenton police issued two summonses to truckers involved in the
demonstration, said Sgt. Don Berry. One was for running a red light; he did not
know what the other was for. He also said two television cameramen covering the
protest were issued summonses for interfering with traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar protest occurred Wednesday in Rhode Island, where about 60 trucks
circled the capitol building.

<HEADLINE> Daschle PAC Raised $819K in 1st Year  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first year of operation, Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle's political action committee raised $819,000 and gave money to
virtually every Democratic senator up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
	   About half the money raised by DASH PAC -- Dedicated Americans for the
Senate and House -- came from other PACs, according to documents filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   DASH PAC contributed about $150,000 to two dozen Democratic candidates last
year. Among the recipients were New York Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who picked up $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The only Democrat facing re-election who did not receive money was Sen. Herb
Kohl of Wisconsin. He does not accept PAC contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   For many years, Daschle, D-S.D., advocated banning PACs and said it would be
hypocritical of him to have one. He changed his mind about a year ago,
concluding a PAC is one of the ``cleanest and most appropriate'' ways to finance
campaigns because the money is fully reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Leadership'' PACs like Daschle's allow contributors to give twice to
politicians: once to their re-election campaign and once to the their PAC.
Daschle is not up for re-election until 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report in Washington,
said Daschle's PAC performed well, partly because Democrats are hopeful they can
regain control in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So a contribution is seen as a potential investment in a Democratic
majority and a majority leader, who would be none other than Tom Daschle,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Meehan, Daschle's political director, said the senator hopes to give
the maximum $10,000 contribution to every Democratic challenger in a competitive
Senate race this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the PACs contributing to DASH PAC were those for GTE, Northwest
Airlines, the American Bankers Association, the American Hospital Association,
Microsoft and the National Education Association. Individual contributors
included Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, Washington Wizards owner Abe
Pollin and Gateway CEO Ted Waitt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dash PAC had $373,000 cash on hand at the end of last year.

	   Today is Friday, Feb. 11, the 42nd day of 2000. There are 324 days left in
the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 11, 1929, the Lateran Treaty was signed, with Italy recognizing the
independence and sovereignty of Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
	   On this date:
</P>
<P>
	   In 1812, Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry signed a redistricting law
favoring his party, giving rise to the term ``gerrymandering.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1847, American inventor Thomas Alva Edison was born in Milan, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1858, a French girl, Bernadette Soubirous, claimed for the first time to
have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary near Lourdes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1861, President-elect Lincoln departed Springfield, Ill., for Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1937, a sit-down strike against General Motors ended, with the company
agreeing to recognize the United Automobile Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1945, President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and
Soviet leader Josef Stalin signed the Yalta Agreement during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. and Life magazine canceled plans to
publish an autobiography of reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes that turned out
to be fake.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Church Leaders Plan Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A delegation of American religious leaders wrapped up a
three-day visit to Cuba this week, calling for increased exchanges between the
two countries' religious communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe the time has arrived for an expansion of contacts between
religious groups in the United States and Cuba,'' said Rabbi Arthur Schneier of
New York, president and founder of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneier said that before returning to New York late Wednesday, the group
agreed to put together a postgraduate study program for Cuban clergy in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While in Havana, delegation members met with Ricardo Alarcon, president of
Cuba's National Assembly and Fidel Castro's key man for U.S.-Cuba relations, and
Cardiad del Rosario Bello Diego, Director of Cuba's Office of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   They also spoke with top religious leaders, including those from the Roman
Catholic church, the Cuban Council of Churches and Cuba's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co Sues Over 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that insures ABC's hit game show, "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire," is suing to get out of its contract because it claims the
questions are too easy and they're at risk of paying out too much prize money.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC says viewers shouldn't worry about the legal fight -- they're planning
no changes to the show.
</P>
<P>
	   The London-based insurance underwriters Goshawk Syndicate filed suit in
Britain's High Court of Justice on Jan. 24 against Buena Vista Entertainment,
Inc., the show's producers, to end its contract.
</P>
<P>
	   In essence, Goshawk said it needed assurances that "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" would ask harder questions and select dumber contestants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" has been the television sensation of the year, frequently
pulling in 30 million viewers a night and propelling ABC to the top of the
ratings. Host Regis Philbin's question -- "Is that your final answer?" -- has
become a national catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
	   Other television networks have quickly tried to imitate "Millionaire," to
mixed success.
</P>
<P>
	   Under its contract, Goshawk is required to pay out prize money to
contestants who win $500,000 or more on the show. There's a deductible of $1.5
million before Goshawk is required to pay and a ceiling of $5 million. That
means, for example, Goshawk would only be required to pay prizes to five winners
of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reached in London on Thursday, a spokeswoman for Goshawk refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unquestionably, the integrity of the show is above reproach and nobody is
claiming otherwise," ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said. "This is simply a
dispute in which the company providing insurance is trying to get out of
coverage on the basis of a conversation it had with a broker."
</P>
<P>
	   Two "Millionaire" contestants -- an Internal Revenue Service agent from
Connecticut and a Miami attorney -- correctly answered 15 questions and won $1
million. By contrast, no player on the original British version of the game show
has ever won the big prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Through 51 shows, there have also been three $500,000 winners. "Millionaire"
has given out a total of $9,314,000 in prize money since it has been on the air,
according to ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The multiple-choice questions are frequently easy in the early rounds. One
contestant was asked which condiment is also known as a Latin dance, correctly
choosing salsa over the other options: mustard, mayonnaise and relish.
</P>
<P>
	   They get harder as the stakes grow higher. The first million-dollar winner
won by correctly identifying the U.S. president to appear on the television
show, "Laugh-In" (Richard Nixon). The second had to know the distance between
the Earth and the sun (93 million miles).
</P>
<P>
	   Simply getting on the show can actually be harder than winning big money: it
requires potential contestants to successfully navigate a three-tier elimination
process where they are judged on speed and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Goshawk said it needed "significant changes in the level of
control" to "reduce the unacceptable level of losses." Specifically, the
syndicate asked for changes in the method of contestant selection and the degree
of difficulty of the questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Since no changes were made since it first asked for them in late December,
Goshawk said that "substantial losses under the insurance are expected."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoover was not sure what the next step in the case would be.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the show's producers were to lose the insurance, it wasn't likely to
affect ABC's commitment to the series. It now airs three nights a week, and
gives ABC bragging rights as the No. 1 network -- with the substantial
advertising revenue that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, ABC announced on Thursday that it was airing three more special
editions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" during the February ratings
"sweeps."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Law License Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Arkansas Supreme Court has given President Clinton 30
days to respond to two ethics complaints seeking to strip him of his law license
because of his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's Committee on Professional Conduct notified the Southeastern
Legal Foundation, which filed one of the complaints, that it is notifying
Clinton of the deadline and he is entitled to have a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the attorney (Clinton) takes exception to the committee's decision, he
has a right to request a public hearing,'' the committee's executive director,
James Neal, wrote the foundation on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers told The Associated Press that Clinton has received notification of
a second complaint seeking to revoke his license and must respond in 30 days,
although Clinton can seek a 30-day extension. The lawyers spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The second complaint specifically cites as evidence against the president
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright's ruling that Clinton gave intentionally
false testimony about his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula
Jones civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's decision resurrects a controversy that Clinton hoped was put
behind him at an impeachment trial last year. His lawyers will now have to
defend his license at a time when Clinton is trying to close out his presidency
with initiatives ranging from tax cuts to new benefits for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton attorney David Kendall declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-member committee that will review Clinton's case includes three
members who have contributed to the Democratic Party in Arkansas or Democratic
candidates, though not Clinton specifically, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two alternates who could end up judging Clinton if there are vacancies on
the panel have contributed to Clinton's presidential campaigns, said the
Democrat-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint that has been served on the president focuses on his
statements about Ms. Lewinsky in the Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding Clinton in contempt of court last April, Wright cited 10 alleged
lies by the president that ``no reasonable person would seriously dispute.''
</P>
<P>
	   Five dealt with Clinton's denials that he had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky. Five others involved Clinton's saying he could not recall being alone
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president responded to plaintiff's questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial
process,'' Wright wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright cited Clinton for civil contempt rather than criminal contempt, thus
preserving the authority of the Office of Independent Counsel, now headed by Ken
Starr's successor, Robert Ray, to pursue criminal charges against Clinton later
if Ray chooses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because much of the president's conduct has been or is being investigated
by OIC, and in order to prevent any potential double jeopardy issues ... this
court will forgo proceedings'' under criminal statutes ``and address the
president's contempt by focusing on those undisputed matters that are capable of
being summarily addressed pursuant to'' civil law, Wright wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding the members of the Committee on Professional Conduct, two
alternates and three full members made 30 contributions totaling more than
$16,000 to Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
	   Full members who contributed to Democrats, though not Clinton, are Richard
Reid of Blytheville, Bart Virden of Morrilton and Dr. Patricia Youngdahl of
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   The alternates, David Solomon of Helena and Dick Hatfield of Little Rock,
donated to Clinton's 1992 or 1996 presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon, Hatfield and Virden said their contributions would have no impact
on their impartiality if Clinton's case comes before them. Reid and Youngdahl
did not return telephone messages.

<HEADLINE> Dell earnings rise slightly  </HEADLINE>
    By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose slightly
from the year-ago period, meeting analysts' reduced expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the three months ended Jan. 28 was $436 million, or 16 cents
a share, compared to $425 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago, the
company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The results include an investment gain equal to 1 cent per share, the
company said. Excluding that gain, Dell matched the revised analyst estimate of
15 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell announced two weeks ago that earnings would not meet expectations,
because of problems getting computer chips and slower-than-expected post Y2K
sales. Analysts had been expecting earnings for the quarter would be 21 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, said
Thursday he expects revenue growth at Dell will slow from its previous torrid
pace of nearly 50 percent a year, but that doesn't mean stockholders should go
rushing to unload their shares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody goes through some level of maturation," Jaruzelski said. "It was
not possible to keep up with that level of staggering growth, but it's still
staggering."
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported revenue of about $6.8 billion for the fourth quarter,
up 31 percent from the prior-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of revenue and averaged $40
million per day, up from $14 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell vice chairman Kevin Rollins said the company was focusing on the
positives, such as its growing Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that this is a tough industry and people like to know what's good
and bad. We think our company has tremendous growth potential," Rollins said. "I
think that the one thing we can agree with is that it's probably not logical for
a company of our size to continue growing at 50 percent a year."
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Dell's revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of 38
percent over the prior year's $18.2 billion. Net earnings were $1.66 billion, or
61 cents per share, up from prior-year earnings of $1.46 billion, or 53 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Dell rose $3.23 to $38.80 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market
before the news was announced Thursday. In after-hours trading, shares were
drifting slightly lower, finishing at $37.87 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department disclosed Thursday it is reviewing
whether racial minorities have been unfairly given more federal death sentences
than white defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The review, initiated two months ago at Attorney General Janet Reno's
request, is not a moratorium on executions like that announced recently by
Illinois Gov. George Ryan in his state, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House said last Friday that President Clinton is considering a
Democratic senator's request for a suspension of federal death penalties pending
the outcome of a study like the one Reno ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the system is as fair as it can be,'' Holder
told a news conference. ``It's a historical study of the federal system with an
emphasis on finding out whether or not there are inappropriate racial
disparities'' in the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The study was ordered by the attorney general, I'd say almost out of an
abundance of caution,'' said Holder, who is leading the review. ``We don't have
anything to our knowledge that gives us reason to believe that there is a
disparity within the system. But we want to make sure that is so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said the study would not prevent the Bureau of Prisons from setting
an execution date for any of the 21 people on the federal death row at the U.S.
penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. Two-thirds of those prisoners are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   With appeals under way, no dates have been set for their executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno established an elaborate Justice Department review system for deciding
whether to seek death penalties, including private hearings for defendants'
lawyers. But the final decision belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Though she personally opposes the death penalty, Reno has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek death penalties in 149 cases, out of 517 reviewed under her
procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   The last federal execution was in 1963. In 1972, The Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty had been unfairly applied. State and federal procedures were
revised, so the high court restored the death penalty on the federal level in
1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was planning legislation
that will allow death row inmates to introduce new DNA evidence in an attempt to
prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is concerned
about the issues raised by Illinois' decision and will consider putting federal
executions on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request came in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
is being reviewed by White House counsel, Lockhart said. He added there's no
guarantee President Clinton will act soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Gov. Ryan's halt of executions in Illinois
until authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered fairly.
Since 1977, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 Illinois death row
inmates have been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a
few cases, persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal executions and have Reno
thoroughly review how the federal death penalty has been used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote.

<HEADLINE> Rib Injury Eyed in Navy Jet Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A pilot's rib injury may have led to the crash that
killed him and another member of the Navy's Blue Angels precision flying team
last year in Georgia, according to a report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Lt. Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor's minor rib injury might have
given him trouble tensing his abdominal muscles to avoid blacking out during
maneuvers that exert extreme gravitational forces on pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   The report rejected another investigator's conclusion that O'Connor might
have tried to avoid hitting a bird with the F/A-18 Hornet.
</P>
<P>
	   The rib injury theory is ``the most likely scenario supported by the known
facts,'' wrote Rear Adm. Michael Bucchi. The Blue Angels are based at Pensacola
Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, 35, and crewmate Lt. Kevin Colling, 32, were killed on Oct. 28
while practicing for air shows with the five other Blue Angels jets at Moody Air
Force Base. There was no evidence of a mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that six days before the crash, O'Connor had accidentally
fallen on his side against Colling's knee during a ``squadron game requiring
everyone to drop to the ground from their chairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Cmdr. Pat McMahon, the team's flight surgeon, wrote that O'Connor had
difficulty tensing his abdominal muscles in practice flights and experienced
tunnel vision because of the gravitational forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Some aviators use special suits that automatically inflate around the
pilot's legs to keep blood in the brain. The Blue Angels do not use them.

<HEADLINE> CDC Orders Audit in Hantavirus Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have
reassigned a top manager and ordered an independent audit after admitting it
diverted money earmarked to combat the deadly hantavirus, CDC Director Jeffrey
Koplan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   CDC officials told Congress the agency had spent $7.5 million on hantavirus,
even though it really spent some of the money fighting outbreaks of other
mysterious killer viruses. Koplan apologized last week and went before the House
Appropriations Committee on Thursday to further explain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not the way we want to do business,'' Koplan said. ``People just
weren't thinking in their rush to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan said he has hired the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouse Coopers to
determine how much the CDC actually spent on hantavirus and how much was
diverted to battle other diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the CDC was ``seeking new leadership'' for its viral division.
Spokeswoman Kay Sessions Golan later told reporters that meant former viral
division head Brian Mahy had been reassigned. The agency did not say when the
move occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan also said he ordered a top-to-bottom review of the agency's 133
programs and projects to determine if any other money had been diverted. Last
October, Koplan acknowledged the CDC misspent about half of the $22.7 million it
got from Congress to study chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers on the panel said they were encouraged by Koplan's actions and
were confident he could solve accounting problems at the $2.4 billion agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This doesn't have to be a disaster for the CDC,'' said Rep. Roger Wicker,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantavirus first gained attention in 1993, when previously healthy adults in
the Four Corners area of the Southwest began dying, their lungs filled with
fluid. The virus, which is spread by mice and their droppings, sickened 24
people in the United States last year and killed at least eight, CDC statistics
show. There is no cure for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Several members of the Appropriations panel -- which oversees the CDC's
budget -- said they were not upset that the CDC had diverted the money, just
that the agency did not admit doing so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It might have been stupid to fail to inform Congress, which I think it
certainly was,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the panel's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan blamed the problem on a belief within the CDC that fighting diseases
comes first and budget implications are addressed later. That attitude will
change, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe we're arrogant,'' he said. ``I think we made a serious
mistake in communication.''

<HEADLINE> Rowland requests $20 million in federal aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland Thursday requested $20
million in federal funds to help Connecticut lobster fisherman who have been
financially devastated by a mysterious die-off of lobsters in Long Island Sound.
<P>
	   The request comes about two weeks after U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley declared a fishery failure in the Sound, which allowed Congress to
appropriate money to help the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "The failure of this fishery has decimated the industry in Connecticut,
affecting not only lobster fishers, but businesses along the coast which rely on
a healthy lobster fishery," said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. senators from the northeast, including Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and
Chris Dodd, D-Conn., sent a letter Thursday to the leaders of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, urging them to include the money in the committee's
emergency disaster relief bill. That legislation, expected to be debated in the
next few weeks, is designed to provide relief funds to several regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also asked the state Department of Transportation to help the
fishermen find storage places for their pots. Because of the financial
hardships, some lobstermen cannot afford to lease storage space for the winter
and would be forced to leave the pots unattended in the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly eight out of every 100 lobsters pulled from the Sound has died in
recent months and the catch rate there plummeted 90 percent by November.
Lobstermen estimate their $36 million annual industry was been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will be used to help the fishermen meet their bills and will offer
career retraining programs. Some of the money also will go toward studies to
determine what caused the die-off. Researchers suspect a parasite that attacks
the lobster's nervous system is the likely culprit.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Gov. George Pataki has asked Congress for $15 million for

<HEADLINE> Dell Earnings Rise Slightly  </HEADLINE>
    By CONNIE MABIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose slightly
from the year-ago period, meeting analysts' reduced expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the three months ended Jan. 28 was $436 million, or 16 cents
a share, compared to $425 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago, the
company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The results include an investment gain equal to 1 cent per share, the
company said. Excluding that gain, Dell matched the revised analyst estimate of
15 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell announced two weeks ago that earnings would not meet expectations,
because of problems getting computer chips and slower-than-expected post Y2K
sales. Analysts had been expecting earnings for the quarter would be 21 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York, said
Thursday he expects revenue growth at Dell will slow from its previous torrid
pace of nearly 50 percent a year, but that doesn't mean stockholders should go
rushing to unload their shares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody goes through some level of maturation," Jaruzelski said. "It was
not possible to keep up with that level of staggering growth, but it's still
staggering."
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported revenue of about $6.8 billion for the fourth quarter,
up 31 percent from the prior-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of revenue and averaged $40
million per day, up from $14 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell vice chairman Kevin Rollins said the company was focusing on the
positives, such as its growing Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that this is a tough industry and people like to know what's good
and bad. We think our company has tremendous growth potential," Rollins said. "I
think that the one thing we can agree with is that it's probably not logical for
a company of our size to continue growing at 50 percent a year."
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Dell's revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of 38
percent over the prior year's $18.2 billion. Net earnings were $1.66 billion, or
61 cents per share, up from prior-year earnings of $1.46 billion, or 53 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Dell rose $3.23 to $38.80 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market
before the news was announced Thursday. In after-hours trading, shares were
drifting slightly lower, finishing at $37.87 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Argues for Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bill Bradley, standing Thursday with parents of children
killed by guns, accused Al Gore of coming late and ending up weak on the
emotional issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Framing his contrast in unusually barbed terms, Bradley said: ``This is not
an issue that I came to after seeing television pictures of Columbine. This is
an issue that I believed as a matter of fundamental principle throughout my
public life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore has not always
done that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign countered that Bradley was trying to manufacture
differences where none exist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Gore has been a strong advocate for gun safety laws,'' said
Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer,
co-chair of Gore's California campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But spokesman Chris Lehane acknowledged that Gore's record in Congress bears
little resemblance to his gun-control stance of today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His position changed to match the changing times,'' Lehane said, noting
the proliferation of gun violence in the past decade. ``The public looks for
leaders who respond to the changing times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was campaigning in Los Angeles Thursday, too, promoting his health care
proposal at a hospital. In a striking counterpoint, his motorcade was held up
temporarily because of a shooting at a fast food restaurant nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to youngsters at El Sereno Middle School -- parents of youngsters
who were killed standing with him -- Bradley said Gore voted against a 1990 bill
to expand a federal ban on assault weapons and only wants to register new
handguns while ignoring an estimated 60 million current weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he wants to license and register all handguns but Gore has
dismissed the plan as too difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The essence of leadership is to take on that which is considered too hard
to do and make it happen. That's what leaders do as opposed to politicians,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to national registration of handguns, Bradley's plan calls for
banning gun dealers from residential neighborhoods, limiting the number of guns
a person can buy each year, banning small, cheap ``Saturday night specials'' and
ordering background checks for purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   As a senator, Gore in 1985 voted against a 14-day waiting period for handgun
purchases and in 1990 voted against an amendment that would have prohibited the
sale of large-capacity ammunition magazines and banned a dozen types of
assault-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The back-and-forth on guns came as both Democratic presidential contenders
campaigned in California with an eye on the state's primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Washington, negotiations between their campaigns for weekly debates
broke down over the Gore camp's insistence that Bradley give up all television
ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, trying to revive his campaign after losing in Iowa, New Hampshire
and Delaware, instead announced new campaign ads starring former basketball star
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's calculus for a comeback includes ferreting out vulnerabilities in
Gore's record as a U.S. representative and senator from Tennessee. In New
Hampshire, Bradley closed the gap with women voters after reminding them that
Gore cast dozens of anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley planned to bring back the abortion issue in a Seattle appearance on
Friday, and supporters were staging 25 news conferences around the country to
talk about the candidates' gun control positions.
</P>
<P>
	   On another issue, Bradley's campaign issued a new analysis of his and Gore's
health care proposals. The statement said the University of California, Los
Angeles, Center for Health Policy Research analyzed the plans at the campaign's
request.
</P>
<P>
	   The analysis concluded that Bradley's plan would subsidize 82 percent of the
3.46 million uninsured adults in California with incomes up to 250 percent of
the federal poverty level, while Gore's would help 43 percent, or 1.48 million
people.
</P>
<P>
	   During his school visit, Bradley was joined by Margaret Ensley, Sheri
Barnett and Ruett Foster, all of whom had lost children to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ensley, president of Mothers Against Violence in Schools, banged a miniature
coffin against the lectern. ``This does not have to be the legacy,'' she said,
emphasizing her support for Bradley's proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Michael Shawn Ensley, was shot to death at his high school in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Foster's 7-year-old son, Evan, was struck in the head by a bullet in 1997 as
he sat in his mother's car while she signed him up for a basketball league.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnett's son, Tony, was shot to death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's speech was applauded by the sixth-to-eighth graders at the
eastside school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most presidents don't know about gun violence. I think he knows,'' said
Angela Pando, 12, who lost a 15-year-old cousin in a drive-by shooting several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Students recently held a candy drive to fund a gun buyback campaign. When
two students who organized the program asked how many students knew someone who
had been injured or killed by a gun, more than half the 100 youngsters raised
their hands.

<HEADLINE> Four Captives Freed in Sudan  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Pro-government fighters released four people Thursday
who had been held for a week in the southern Sudan with their U.N.-leased plane,
the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the four -- an American UNICEF staffer and two Kenyan pilots --
were flown from southern Sudan to Lokichokio, in northern Kenya, the base of
U.N. humanitarian operations for Sudan, spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three, who were not identified, were exhausted and were being examined
by doctors, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth detainee, a Sudanese national, was taken to Malakal, about 100
miles northeast of Old Fangak in Upper Nile Province where they were freed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pro-government fighters detained the four and their plane, leased by the
U.N. World Food Program, on Feb. 3. During a week of negotiations, U.N.
officials had said the militiamen were making ``impossible'' demands, but
negotiations achieved a breakthrough Thursday, U.N. spokesman John Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sudanese government accused the United Nations of ferrying militiamen on
its aid flights and suggested the seizure may have been related to that. The
United Nations says it was only carrying relief workers and aid into Old Fangak
and has launched an inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations uses local Sudanese to distribute aid in the south, where
rebels are fighting for autonomy from the government in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-government Sudan People's Liberation Army is leading a rebellion
for autonomy for the largely Christian southern Sudan from the predominantly
Muslim north. About 2 million people have died in southern Sudan since 1983 in
the fighting or in war-related starvation.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the capture of the plane, Operation Lifeline Sudan, the U.N. group
handling aid to southern Sudan, stopped making flights to the Upper Nile
Province.
</P>
<P>
	   From its base in northern Kenya, Operation Lifeline Sudan normally runs
several flights a week into the area, some 500 miles south of the Sudanese
capital, Khartoum, carrying food, medical supplies and personnel to thousands of
civilians suffering from years of unrest.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Makes Plane Tests Mandatory  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the
tails of MD-80 series jetliners and related planes for damage similar to what
was discovered in the wreckage of Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,100 jets in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and
Boeing 717s -- will be covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday
by the Federal Aviation Administration. The airlines will have two to three days
to comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing had recommended Wednesday that all 2,000 of the planes worldwide be
inspected, and all major U.S. airlines had already begun an inspection process
when the FAA decided to make it mandatory. Alaska Airlines grounded two planes
Thursday after problems were found.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers should expect minor delays, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's far more important that we get these airplanes inspected,'' said Tom
McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator for certification. ``We want it done
right, and we want it done thorough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska, which has 34 MD-80 series planes in its fleet, grounded two of the
jetliners in Seattle and Portland, Ore., because metal shavings were found
around the jackscrews -- which drive the planes' horizontal stabilizers and
control the up-and-down direction of a plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Shavings indicate wear on a nut that travels along the screw.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer, the jackscrew, nut, elevators and other
components that adjust the plane's up-and-down pitch have been the focus of the
Flight 261 investigation. The pilots reported trouble with the stabilizer and
struggled to control the plane for at least 30 minutes before it crashed into
the Pacific on Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered from the wreckage, and metal
shavings found on it were determined to have come from the nut in the mechanism.
It is unclear whether the damage was a possible cause or an effect of the crash,
and the nut has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also announced the Navy had recovered additional pieces
of wreckage from Flight 261 -- including a 12-by-7 foot section of the vertical
stabilizer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Struggles With China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House knows it has a struggle on its hands
getting fellow Democrats to sign on to a new trade agreement with China, Cabinet
secretaries and President Clinton's top aide said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on Capitol
Hill,'' said White House chief of staff John Podesta, as he asked for lobbying
help from agricultural interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration wants a vote as early as possible, and definitely
before midsummer, on trade accords that would set China on the path toward
joining the World Trade Organization. The accords would do away with the annual
fight in Congress over granting China normal trading status by making that
status permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized labor, environmental groups and many Democrats in Congress oppose
the agreement as dangerous to U.S. workers or complain it gives the United
States less leverage to win improvements in human rights and individual freedoms
in China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are people who have strong views who don't agree with us,'' Podesta
told farm groups at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration is arguing that the trade deal is especially good for
farmers because it eases export restrictions for agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor interests respond that the Chinese already have a poor record of
complying with trade deals, and the United States needs to hold onto whatever
leverage it has to protect American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think difficult situations come from difficult issues,'' said David A.
Smith, director of public policy at the AFL-CIO, about the labor-Clinton
administration split on China. ``We think they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Winning the vote will depend in large part on farm and business interests
making their case with individual members of Congress, Podesta and other
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who is leading the administration lobbying,
said he is already encountering heavy pressure from the other side. He and other
administration officials meet weekly to discuss strategy, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an extremely aggressive program going on because the stakes are
extremely high,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle last year, defeat of the
trade accords ``would send a terrible signal'' to other countries that look to
the United States as a free-trade leader, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After reporters were ushered from the meeting room, Daley gave a frank
assessment of the difficulty a Democratic administration will have in pressing a
case opposed by so many of its own. His comments were still being broadcast to
reporters outside the room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an issue that is divisive in the Democratic caucus,'' Daley said.
``The question is, do you want to go through this every year or maybe bite the
bullet and let's get on with it.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Strike Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. officials said Thursday they were still assessing
the effects of the strike by its engineering and technical workers, though the
union for the employees say the strike already was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 22,000-strong Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace walked off the job Wednesday after contract negotiations with a
federal mediator broke down the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to be obstinate," said SPEEA Executive Director
Charles Bofferding. "Until they come around, we are striking."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said the strike was already having an effect. Bofferding claimed
that a Quantas jet in Bangkok, being serviced by SPEEA members, was left
unfinished on the tarmac, and that the airline had complained. The union also
claimed that a part fabrication plant near Tacoma ground to a halt because no
SPEEA workers were there.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte could not confirm the union's claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing is still trying to figure out how many people walked out on Thursday,
he added. The company estimated about 75 percent, or 17,000, of the
SPEEA-covered employees went on strike Wednesday, while SPEEA claimed 95 percent
had walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of the number, production of aircraft remains unaffected, Conte
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our contingency plans are in place and they are working."

<HEADLINE> Democrats Continue Debate Squabbles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley continued to disagree Thursday
over planning for a series of debates leading up to the round of March 7
primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign halted discussions after Gore's representatives removed
as a possibility a Feb. 16 debate that the campaigns had tentatively agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns have agreed to debates on Feb. 21 and March 1, but there was
no indication that talks about scheduling additional debates would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had tentatively agreed to debate on the 16th, which unfortunately looks
like it won't be happening ... based on the unwillingness of the Gore campaign
to commit'' to the date, said Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke. ``We don't
know what the sticking point is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway did not deny Ludecke's assertion, but said
the Feb. 16 date was never solidified. He also said Gore's schedule is no longer
as open as it was last year when he first proposed that they have biweekly
debates in lieu of running campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was tentative discussion about (Feb. 16), but that is what tentative
means,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides jabbed at each other in letters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, wrote that the vice president will
not allow his schedule to be ``dictated by a rival campaign. Doug Berman,
chairman of Bradley's campaign, said Gore's inflexibility in scheduling shows
that he ``is not serious'' about his own debate proposal.

<HEADLINE> Two Studies Fault St. John's Wort  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- St. John's wort, a popular herbal remedy used to relieve mild
depression, can interfere with drugs used to treat HIV-infected people and heart
transplant patients, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists said the findings add to growing concerns that the herb may
interact dangerously with prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   Two studies published this week in The Lancet medical journal found that St.
John's wort dulls the effectiveness of both the HIV medicine indinavir and the
transplant drug cyclosporin, used to suppress transplant patients' immune
systems so their bodies don't reject the new organs.
</P>
<P>
	   Although both studies involved few participants, independent experts say the
way they were conducted and the strength of the results render the findings
significant.
</P>
<P>
	   In one study, the level of medicine in the bloodstream when St. John's wort
was taken dropped dramatically enough for patients to begin to reject their
transplanted hearts.
</P>
<P>
	   The other showed that St. John's wort depressed the effectiveness of a drug
used to treat HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a cautionary note," said Dr. Fred Valentine, professor of medicine
at New York University Medical Center, who was not connected with either study.
"These (herbal remedies) really aren't necessarily benign compounds."
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's wort is widely used in Germany as a treatment for depression and
anxiety. Some U.S. physicians have started recommending it to patients and
report that the herb has shown effectiveness in stemming depression.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is definitely a potential problem with St. John's wort that is only
recently becoming apparent," said Mark Blumenthal, executive director of the
American Botanical Council in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   This information "is coming out as the herb increases in popularity and is
being used by millions of people in combination with over-the-counter or
prescription medications," Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, CVS Corp., the second-largest drugstore chain in the United
States, said it had started asking customers to list the herbal supplements they
use -- in addition to their prescription drugs -- in an effort to avoid
potentially dangerous drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the new studies in The Lancet, Stephen Piscitelli and other
researchers at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md., gave eight HIV-negative volunteers indinavir, a class of HIV drug
called a protease inhibitor, three times a day.
</P>
<P>
	   On the experiment's third day, St. John's wort tablets were added and the
volunteers continued taking both pills for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood tests were taken the day before the volunteers started taking the herb
and at the experiment's end, to see if the concentration of the HIV medicine in
their blood changed by adding St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
	   The blood concentration of indinavir immediately before another dose was due
was an average of 81 percent lower when St. John's wort was added than when the
drug was taken alone, the researchers said. Overall, levels of the HIV medicine
in the blood dropped 57 percent when taken with St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
	   "When blood levels get so low, it leads to resistance and treatment
failure," Piscitelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very important for HIV patients. St. John's wort is a commonly used
product in the HIV population," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second study, scientists from University Hospital in Zurich,
Switzerland, reported that two heart transplant patients were hospitalized with
heart trouble three weeks after starting to take St. John's wort to alleviate
depression.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientists found the herb had lowered the level of the
rejection-fighting drug cyclosporin. When the patients stopped taking St. John's
wort, the problem ended, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution says witnesses heard Volpe promise to "say nothin"'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal prosecutors said Thursday they had witnesses
ready to testify that just before he agreed to plead guilty to a sodomy attack
on Abner Louima, officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer he would "say nothin"' to
implicate fellow officer Charles Schwarz in the crime.
<P>
	   The surprise move, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson,
injected a new element into the trial of Schwarz and two other officers for
conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Louima's civil rights
when Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty. Schwarz was convicted and faces a
possible life sentence. His appeal for a new trial was rejected by Nickerson
last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, face up
to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice in the
current case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20, when, during a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, "confronted Volpe in the lobby" and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, currently defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial
in Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
"They know where to find me," he said. "I'd be happy to respond to a subpoena."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers in the Brooklyn trial declined comment but Bruder attorney Stuart
London said they would confer on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors' letter, dated Feb. 9, said the government hoped to call
"one or more witnesses who overheard the conversation between Volpe and Worth,"
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the conversation between Volpe and Worth occurred on May 20. Five
days later, Volpe pleaded guilty to sodomizing Louima with a broken broomstick
in August, 1997. He said a second, unnamed officer took part.
</P>
<P>
	   At his sentencing in December 1999, where he drew a 30-year term, Volpe said
for the first time that the "second officer" in the bathroom during the attack
on Louima was not Schwarz, but Wiese, who did not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial, Worth - then Schwarz's lawyer - claimed the
government withheld from him its knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's
presence in the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of
Volpe's intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent
to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr.
Louima," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvyn Kornberg, who was Volpe's attorney, described the letter as "grasping
at straws" by the state. "It shows the prosecutors are mortally afraid of Mr.
Volpe's testimony," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony, James Burns, a former senior official of the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau, described an interview with Wiese days
after the incident in which that officer identified himself as the second cop in
the bathroom and said he never saw Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's
front desk.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Burns, Wiese said he helped Volpe escort Louima toward the
arrest processing room and was surprised when Volpe took a sharp right to the
bathroom, saying he wanted to "clean up the prisoner."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, hearing noises, Wiese said he entered and found Volpe,
broomstick in hand, with his foot on the prostrate Louima's back. Wiese said he
dragged Louima away from the toilet by his legs as Volpe explained that the man
had soiled himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, a police officer admitted he told police and state investigators he
didn't know who escorted Louima to the station house bathroom, but named Schwarz
when questioned months later by the FBI and a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake... it was a mistake not to do so," Officer Mark Schofield
said when defense lawyers pressed him to explain his failure to tell what he
knew to police Internal Affairs Bureau detectives and the Brooklyn district
attorney when questioned days after the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that anyone told him to lie.

<HEADLINE> Student surrenders after taking teacher hostage at private school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WESTAMPTON, N.J. (AP) - A student at a private school for emotionally
disturbed youngsters held a teacher's aide hostage for three hours Thursday
before surrendering peacefully. Authorities said the incident stemmed from a
fight with a classmate over cigarettes.
<P>
	   The teacher's aide convinced the student, Jonothan Fischer, to hold him
instead of the student he had taken captive.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer, 18, of Pennsauken, was arrested on kidnapping, aggravated assault,
criminal restraint and weapons charges. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident began shortly before 10:30 a.m. in a bathroom at the private
Hampton Academy when Fischer tried to bum a cigarette from another student, said
Burlington County Prosecutor Robert D. Bernardi.
</P>
<P>
	   "The scenario apparently was triggered off over the situation with the
cigarette," Bernardi said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer has been a student for several years at the school for youngsters
with learning and behavioral problems, but officials declined comment on what
prompted his placement there. Pennsauken police reported having three contacts
with Fischer: twice when he was reported missing and once when he reported
receiving harassing phone calls.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Bernardi, Fischer put a gun to the student's head when the
student refused to give him a cigarette. A teacher's aide, a man in his 30s,
intervened and exchanged himself for the hostage, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The unidentified aide was not threatened, although Fischer was armed with a
.22 caliber semiautomatic loaded handgun, authorities said. The aide had worked
with the teen in school previously, authorities believe.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernardi said the school is not equipped with metal detectors. The weapon
used was stolen several days ago from a Burlington County gun shop, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how the weapon got into the school," Bernardi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hampton Academy Executive Director Bernard Shapiro read a three-paragraph
statement at the news conference calling the incident "a very difficult
situation." He refused to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   The school is located on Burrs Road near Route 541, about a mile west of
Mount Holly, the county seat, located 15 miles east of Philadelphia. It is a
subsidiary of nearby Hampton Hospital, which treats people with drug, alcohol
and psychiatric problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're not retarded or anything, they're just bad," said Johnnie Lewis,
40, of Browns Mills, whose husband is a maintenance mechanic at the school. Mrs.
Lewis rushed to the scene after learning about the hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hostage-taking, another teacher's aide pulled a fire alarm,
summoning police and rescue personnel to the school, where faculty were already
evacuating the other students and staff. About 80 students attend the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officers, including a SWAT team, surrounded the one-story
brown school building and began negotiating with Fischer, Bernardi said. The
teen's father was also brought to the scene, but did not speak with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The Burlington County Tactical Team passed cell phones and police radios
through a bathroom window to establish contact with the student. Negotiations
followed with the teen.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer at one point demanded a cigarette and then offered to exchange the
aide for a cell phone, Bernardi said. He was given a single cigarette,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernardi said the teen eventually agreed to turn the gun over to the
teacher's aide. The aide, who asked that his name not be disclosed to reporters,
walked alone from the school and the student followed shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer is a suspect in the gun shop burglary and will likely be charged in
that incident along with at least one other suspect, Bernardi said. Two Glock
semiautomatic handguns are still missing from that burglary, he said.

<HEADLINE> Details of Marriage Penalty Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Details of the House Republican bill to cut income taxes for many married
couples, including those who have a ``marriage penalty,'' paying more income
taxes than they would if they were single, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
Total cost: $182.3 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --Adjusts upward for married couples the bottom 15 percent income tax
bracket to make it double that of single filers by 2008. If it had been in place
this year, couples would have paid a 15 percent rate on their first $52,500 of
taxable income, compared with $43,850 in current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to twice that of single filers beginning in 2001. Using this year's
numbers, the deduction would rise from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	    Impact on married couples who take standard tax deduction with two children
in 2005
</P>
<P>
	   --$20,000 income: $463 less in taxes, or 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$30,000 income: $718 less in taxes, or 93.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$50,000 income: $255 less in taxes, or 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$75,000 income: $821 less in taxes, or 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$100,000 income: $1,107 less in taxes, or 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$200,000 income: $1,158 less in taxes, or 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	    Democratic alternatives
</P>
<P>
	   --House plan costing half as much as the GOP package would have the raised
standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not itemize to double
that of single filers and made changes in the earned income tax credit so it
would not be eroded for the working poor when they make more on the job. But all
items were subject to passage of separate legislation protecting Social Security
and Medicare and paying down the public debt. And the plan proposed no change in
the 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
	   --President Clinton has proposed $45 billion in relief, although his plan
would not help couples who itemize and is focused on those with dual incomes.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired in School Parking Lot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Gunfire in a high school parking lot injured three teenagers
Thursday, and police said they were looking for two male suspects with handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting at Emery Collegiate Institute in suburban Toronto occurred as
students were going home for the day. Authorities to locked the doors and kept
many students inside the building.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the wounded was in serious condition, said police spokesman Nick
Doria. He was unable to confirm if the attackers or the injured were students.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they searched the school and surrounding neighborhood, but
released few other details of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Video footage on CTV television showed one young male victim being wheeled
into a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how many of the more than 1,000 students who attend the
school were inside when the shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Lance McLean, 19, a grade 12 student, said he was playing chess in the
school when another student told him of the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of crazy to have something like that happen at your school,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Sgt. Bruce Warren said he was unaware of any previous violence at the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the parent of two school-aged sons, I am deeply troubled by any act of
violence,'' Ontario Premier Mike Harris said in a statement issued after the
shooting. ``I will do everything in my power to ensure that our schools'' are
safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings evoked memories of school violence in Canada and the United
States in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In the worst incident, two students at Columbine high school in Littleton,
Colo., killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 before killing themselves
in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A week later, a 14-year-old student at a Taber, Alberta, high school killed
a 17-year-old student and wounded another 17-year-old in an attack considered a
response to bullying.
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said video cameras are used to monitor hallways and students
are forbidden from wearing overcoats in the halls.

<HEADLINE> Lott PAC Corrects Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fund-raising committee led by Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott has corrected reports to the Federal Election Commission,
acknowledging that erroneous figures were submitted earlier because a bookkeeper
embezzled about $85,000.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dowd, the attorney for Lott's New Republican Majority Fund, said
Thursday the money was stolen by the bookkeeper last year to support a drug
habit.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the political action committee was not seeking prosecution because
the former employee ``told us the truth, restitution was made and he went into
rehabilitation.'' Dowd identified the fired employee as James Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 31, 1999, letter to the FEC, Dowd wrote that committee officers
discovered irregularities in December.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The employee admitted that, since March 1999, he had been misappropriating
committee funds to support a drug addiction and falsifying information to
conceal his activities,'' the letter said. ``The employee was fired. The
employee's family has fully reimbursed the committee for the misappropriated
funds and the employee has entered a drug rehabilitation program.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd wrote that ``the committee has adopted a number of policies and
procedures to strengthen its internal controls to avoid future financial
irregularities of this kind from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fund is a ``leadership PAC,'' which gives money to other candidates and
also has paid for Lott's own travel. It was started in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd said 10 months of corrected reports had to be filed, and he offered to
provide the FEC any additional information.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC officials said they were unaware of past penalties in such cases and
noted that the voluntary notification would be in the PAC's favor. The
commission's major concern is to correct false information in campaign finance
reports.

<HEADLINE> US: East Timor Problems Still Loom  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peacekeeping operations in East Timor largely have been
successful and hunger no longer is a daily danger for most, the State Department
said Thursday, but residents seeking to build an independent state are starting
with virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The economy is at a near standstill; unemployment is perilously close to
universal. Regrettably, but not surprisingly, crime and lawlessness are
increasingly serious problems,'' Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for
Far East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a joint House-Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said that since Australian-led U.N. troops entered the former
Indonesian province last fall, militia violence effectively has ended and an
estimated 135,000, or roughly half of those who fled to Indonesian West Timor
during the violence, have returned. He said some do not intend to return.
</P>
<P>
	   The militia rampage after the East Timorese voted to break away from
Indonesia damaged up to 80 percent of public and private property, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth praised the Indonesian government for a recent report on atrocities in
East Timor that identified 33 individuals for further investigation, but said
the United States will continue to watch closely to see if Jakarta follows
through on the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the Australians should be
commended for helping restore peace. But, he said, the real issue as East Timor
tries to build a nation is ``what do we do now to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that only half the members of the 1,600 international police force
were on the ground, and little of the $520 million in aid pledged at a
conference in Tokyo in December has reached the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, called for the resignation of Gen. Wiranto, Indonesia's security
minister. An Indonesian government investigation blamed Wiranto, who uses only
one name, of allowing pro-Indonesian militias to devastate East Timor after the
territory voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All those responsible for the violence in East Timor must be held
accountable for their actions and brought to justice,'' Gilman said.
''(Wiranto's) resignation will send an important signal to others that the
military must remove itself from Indonesian political life and return to the
barracks.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States must play a key role ``in the democratization and
reconstruction of this new island nation,'' Gilman added.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said Congress provided $25 million in aid in last year's budget and was
increasing from 30 to 45 the number of Americans on an international police
force. He said this might be further increased and the State Department had
allocated $8.5 million in peacekeeping operations funds for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to think of them, in a benevolent sense, as an international
welfare case for a while,'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., chairman of the
House International Relations subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Ben &AMP; Jerry's: $268M Offer Reported  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. jumped more
than 11 percent Thursday following a report that an investment group has offered
$268 million for the ice cream maker.
</P>
<P>
	   Meadowbrook Lane Capital of Northampton, Mass., is leading a group of
investors portraying themselves as a socially responsible group capable of
maintaining the progressive business practices Ben &AMP; Jerry's follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the group reached by The Associated Press confirmed they have
made the bid, but declined further comment, citing a confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Meadowbrook offered $32 a share for the 8.36 million shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's
stock, The New York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The news helped push Ben &AMP; Jerry's shares up $2.87 1/2 to $28.37 1/2 in
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's spokesman Lee Holden said Thursday the company would not
comment on the report. The company last week said it had been made aware that an
offer from a socially responsible group might be coming.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's has fashioned a reputation for being socially conscious,
focusing on investing in its communities, buying from socially and
environmentally friendly suppliers and contributing to causes as diverse as
saving the rain forest and caring for children.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had announced in early December that it had been approached
about a buyout from an unidentified bidder and that its board would consider it.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the company's franchise operators have said they were concerned that
Ben &AMP; Jerry's dedication to social responsibility would be lost if it were taken
over by a large traditional company.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times' story cited a Feb. 4 letter on Meadowbrook Lane Capital
letterhead that said the group was offering $32 a share, proposed to install a
new board and a new chief executive and make the company private.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the offer topped a $31 a share offer made Feb. 2 from
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. of Oakland, Calif. It said Dreyer's proposed
operating "as two autonomous companies managed completely independently but with
common ownership."
</P>
<P>
	   Dreyer's said last week that it would not court Ben &AMP; Jerry's -- or any
other company -- without being welcomed, though it did not confirm it was
actively trying to take over the Vermont-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times said Unilever PLC, the huge European food conglomerate, has also
offered to buy Ben &AMP; Jerry's for what one person it did not identify said was
$40 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times said the Meadowbrook group includes Chartwell Investments, which
usually invests in basic and traditional industries, and Hain Food Group, which
is 20 percent owned by the H.J. Heinz Co.
</P>
<P>
	   But an executive at Hain's told the newspaper that his company's name should
not have been listed, and it was not interested in acquiring Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Chartwell had proposed Jan. 26 investing $30 million to
$50 million in Ben &AMP; Jerry's in exchange for replacing its board with one
controlled by Chartwell executives.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Arms Monitors Won't Return  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Thursday that it will not allow U.N. arms
inspectors back into the country to reinstate a disarmament program halted on
the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan branded U.N. arms inspectors as ``spies''
in the clearest rebuff to date of renewed inspection attempts stipulated in a
Dec. 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Iraqi leaders have decried the resolution, but left open the question
of Baghdad's cooperation. Ramadan was blunt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There shall be no return of the so-called inspection teams. We reject the
infiltration by spies using such cover,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
Ramadan as telling a visiting Russian envoy, Nikolai Kartuzov.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks come as the newly appointed chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix
of Sweden, tries to set up a new disarmament commission. Ramadan did not mention
Blix by name, but he was appointed under the December resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Iraq's leaders have
to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know what they need to do, and standing in the way and trying to
dictate the terms of engagement of any force, or who will lead such a force, is
only going to perpetuate a situation that they publicly claim that they want to
get out of, which is the U.N. sanctions,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
can be lifted only after Iraq proves to the Security Council it has destroyed
its long range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq maintains it no longer has banned weapons and is demanding the
abolition of U.N. sanctions as a condition for the return of arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman John Mills said the world body would not respond
directly to Ramadan's remarks. But he noted that Blix will not take up the post
until at least the end of the month, so ``there isn't an inspection mechanism up
and functioning at the moment knocking on the door, asking to go into Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mills also said Blix must first spell out the remaining arms questions for
Iraq to answer.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, seen as Iraq's closest ally on the Security Council, sent Kartuzov
to Baghdad in a bid to persuade the government to cooperate, Baghdad-based
diplomats said. Kartuzov, a former Russian ambassador to Baghdad, also met
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run newspapers on Thursday quoted Aziz as saying Iraq will not
cooperate. Last week, Aziz said his government might cooperate if the United
Nations made the resolution palatable to Iraq. He did not elaborate.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government report released Thursday confirmed what some
workers at a federal uranium enrichment plant in Kentucky suspected for years:
They were exposed to high levels of radiation on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Energy report does not specify how many Paducah Gaseous

acknowledge that workers came into contact with radioactive materials and
hazardous chemicals between 1952 and 1990 at levels much higher than allowed
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Those radiation levels usually were within industry and government standards
for the period, though at least two times in 1968 workers were exposed to levels
above even what was allowed then, said David Michaels, assistant secretary for
environment, safety and health at DOE.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm both angered and saddened,'' he said. ``We certainly made some
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michaels said it was impossible to know how much radiation workers were
exposed to because the Paducah plant, which enriched uranium for nuclear weapons
and non-military uses, operated in a ``climate of secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been suspicious ever since I worked there. Different guys were always
getting sick,'' said Al Puckett, a plant employee from 1952 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Puckett is among workers who have filed lawsuits seeking compensation for
radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has proposed offering $100,000 to each Paducah worker who
developed cancer due to on-the-job exposure to radiation, although it is not
known how many people might be covered. The administration has requested $21.8
million from Congress for expanded medical monitoring, exposure assessments and
accelerated cleanup at Paducah and uranium-processing plants in Piketon, Ohio,
and Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOE investigation began in August after three employees sued, alleging
former operators Lockheed Martin Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. profited by
lying about the extent of environmental pollution and worker exposure to
radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1950s, plant managers did not understand the dangers of
radiation, the report said. But it did cite a letter from 1960 that showed plant
officials were aware of the potential hazards of radioactive material. The
document stated that 300 plant workers ``should be checked out,'' but that
management was hesitant to study the issue for fear the workers' union would
demand hazard pay.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, plant employees were exposed to ``crude experiments'' in the
1950s, in which they inhaled or ingested uranium compounds, according to the
report. It said managers were trying to determine the efficiency of worker
protection systems and the effects of exposure to radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record is unclear as to whether the personnel involved in the
experiments were volunteers or informed participants,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also stated workers' families may have been exposed to radiation
when the workers took contaminated clothing home to be laundered, and that there
was significant contamination of the air, ground and water outside the plant.

<HEADLINE> Church Arsons Down for Third Year  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attacks against churches declined for a third straight
year following a surge in arson in 1996, a committee looking into the problem
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 churches were burned or were the targets of bombing attempts
last year, compared with nearly 300 three years earlier. The sharp rise in
attacks in 1996, particularly against black churches in the South, prompted the
formation of the National Church Arson Task Force, made up of federal and state
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While these types of cases are often times difficult to investigate and
prosecute, our cooperative efforts have brought tremendous success,'' said Bill
Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general and co-chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   During its three-year investigation, the committee looked into more than 800
arsons, bombings or attempted bombings that happened between January 1995 and
October 1999. Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies made 364 arrests
and obtained 267 convictions, according to the group's third report to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those arrested was Jay Scott Ballinger, who has been charged in
several federal courts for allegedly burning 33 churches in California, Georgia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee since 1994.
Ballinger, who has been in federal custody since his arrest in February 1999,
faces a minimum of 90 years in prison if convicted on all charges. He is to
stand trial in Indiana on June 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballinger's indictments represent the largest number of fires linked to a
single person during the investigation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of those arrested were white men and most were younger
than 25. Thirty men were convicted on federal charges of hate crimes motivated
by bias.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to going after arsonists, the committee helps communities
rebuild their burned churches and pay for prevention programs.

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges End to Misleading Calls  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT LAWN, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain on Thursday demanded George W. Bush's
campaign stop making misleading phone calls to voters about him after a woman
told the senator her 14-year-old son was brought to the brink of tears by a
pollster.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor denied his presidential campaign was behind such calls,
and promised, ``If anyone in my campaign has done that, they're going to be
fired.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a day that Steve Forbes officially dropped out of the Republican race,
Bush also offered fresh criticism of chief opponent McCain for transferring $2
million from his Senate campaign account to his presidential fund -- a practice
Bush said he would work to end if president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's political team, meanwhile, continued its work to calm jittery
Republican leaders. In a conference call Thursday with GOP supporters, campaign
manager Joe Allbaugh said this week was intended to ``staunch the hemorrhaging''
caused by McCain's New Hampshire win and he said campaign polls show that Bush's
more aggressive campaign against the Arizonan ``was having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conference call was private, but two officials who participated
confirmed the events on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead, Allbaugh said the campaign plans next week to describe McCain
as a senator who never accomplished major legislative goals, one official said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the third day running, the two GOP contenders exchanged harsh words long
distance in the battleground state of South Carolina, which holds its primary
Feb. 19. A new American Research Group poll showed a tight race, 46 percent
support for Bush and 39 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, the two clashed over the practice of ``push polling,'' in which
one campaign's pollsters call voters and offer distorted appraisals of
opponents' positions.
</P>
<P>
	   At a town hall meeting in Spartanburg, Donna Duren told McCain that her
14-year-old son, Chris, took a call Wednesday from a ``push poller,'' although
she couldn't name the polling firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren said her son admires McCain and was on the verge of tears after
talking to the pollster who described the candidate, in Duren's words, as ``a
cheat, a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was so mad last night I couldn't sleep,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he would call the boy and he told the woman his campaign doesn't
conduct push polls. ``I promise you, I have never and will never have anything
to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would hope people would contact the Bush campaign,'' McCain said. ``I
can't believe that someone from a good family such as George Bush wouldn't stop
this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governor, campaigning in Fort Lawn, decried the incident and he called
on McCain to join him in letting the public see the scripts they use to call
possible supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to battle for the vote,'' Bush said as he arrived at the
Catawba Fish Camp for a fish fry. ``But there is not authorization, and it's not
going to happen in my campaign, for calling him a liar. It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer released a script for what he said was the
only call the Bush campaign was making. It criticizes McCain for ``negative
campaign tactics,'' but it does not refer to his honesty and asks only one
question, will you support Bush in the GOP presidential primary?
</P>
<P>
	   Calls are being placed to several hundred thousand people identified as
favorable to Bush or undecided in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer accused McCain of using the incident to divert attention from his
fund-raiser Thursday night at a hotel across the street from the White House.
The organizers included two lobbyists whose clients have interests before the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who heads the committee, has decried the effect of special interests
on the political process. Campaign funding reform is the hallmark of his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new line of attack on McCain, Bush criticized the senator for
transferring $2 million from his Senate campaign account to his presidential
fund. And the governor noted that in a speech McCain made on the floor of the
Senate in 1990 he said that rolling over money from one account to another was a
practice used to ``intimidate'' challengers and amounted to ``hypocrisy'' among
reformers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to say something, it's another thing to do it in
politics,'' Bush said. ``I want to make sure that people understand that a
campaign funding reformer must be held to high standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the senator was speaking in 1990 about
the practice of Senate incumbents building warchests to scare off challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that anyone is intimidated by John McCain's fund-raising,
and the Bush campaign continues to try to twist John McCain's words to
substantiate their special interest-funded campaign,'' Opinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks To Soothe Worried Backers  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's campaign manager, in a conference call
to soothe GOP supporters and fund-raisers, said Thursday the campaign had
staunched ``the hemorrhaging'' after John McCain's New Hampshire victory
challenged their $70 million candidate, participants said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 3 p.m. call, which lasted about 20 minutes, participants
suggested finding a way to stop the Republican ``sniping'' at the Bush campaign
coming from ``inside the Beltway'' as McCain surged in the polls in several
states, according to four participants who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Joe Allbaugh said Bush's sharper rhetoric this week, which
has included holding up McCain as a hypocrite on campaign finance reform, was
intended to ``staunch the hemorrhaging'' caused by the senator's New Hampshire
win. And he said campaign polls show that Bush's more aggressive campaign
against the Arizonan ``was having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of South Carolina's key Feb. 19 primary, a new American Research Group
poll showed a tight race with 46 percent of likely GOP voters polled supporting
Bush and 39 percent McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Allbaugh assured those on the line that the Texas governor's two Capitol
Hill chairman, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri,
received talking points every day to help fight off friendly fire, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Call participants included former Republican National Committee chairman
Haley Barbour, Bush adviser Charlie Black, and Bush administration lawyer C.
Boyden Gray, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to next week, Allbaugh said Bush would aggressively portray
McCain as a career Washington politician who has no major legislation to show
for his 17 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Allbaugh said Bush also will draw stronger links between McCain and
Democrats, highlighting the Arizona senator's alliance with Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., on campaign finance reform, McCain's support from unions in
Michigan and praise from Vice President Al Gore, according to participants.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has raised about $70 million to fund his presidential campaign so far.

<HEADLINE> Gibraltar's Head Faces Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL WOOLLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GIBRALTAR (AP) -- A young lawyer who has overseen Gibraltar's robust
economic growth while fending off Spanish claims of sovereignty was headed for a
re-election Thursday as the British colony's head of government, according to an
exit poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Caruana, a 43-year-old conservative, had 60 percent of the vote
compared with 36 percent for his main rival, leftist Joe Bossano, said the poll
by the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout in this quaint patch of Britain located at Spain's southern tip was
estimated at about 44 percent, compared to 49 percent in the last election, held
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Caruana, whose title is chief minister, and Bossano, a 61-year-old
former union boss, rule out giving in to Spain's claims to the 2 1/2-square-mile
chunk of limestone that looms over the isthmus that connect the Mediterranean to
the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht, but
now wants it back. Britain says it cannot give up the territory because the
majority of residents oppose joining Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory largely controls its own internal affairs. Britain appoints a
governor and is responsible for defense and foreign affairs. Gibraltar is not
represented in the British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of the four candidates, Peter Cumming, favors any kind of
accommodation with Spain and he was running last in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruana main campaign theme was the island's vibrant economy, which has
virtually no unemployment, thanks in large part to Gibraltar's emergence as a
duty-free tourist mecca and offshore financial center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gibraltar is experiencing a breath of fresh air,'' Caruana said as he cast
his ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bossano, who served two terms as chief minister until he was unseated by
Caruana four years ago, has accused the government of failing to share the
wealth with middle and lower-class residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Gibraltar Senior Citizens Center on Thursday several voters
accused Caruana point-blank of catering to business interests and the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he is a bit of an actor,'' said Lisanne Davis, a 25-year-old
housewife. ``He promises many things but does not deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Defense: Diallo Shot While Standing  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Countering charges police kept shooting Amadou Diallo
after he was down, two medical experts testified Thursday that the unarmed Bronx
man stood throughout most of the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My primary view of the position of the deceased, Mr. Diallo, is that he's
upright,'' a defense pathologist, Dr. Richard Mason, said at the trial of four
police officers accused of murdering Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys also signaled they may try to discredit an eyewitness,
Schrrie Elliott, by bringing out her criminal record.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical testimony backed defense claims that the officers believed
Diallo remained a threat the entire time it took to fire 41 bullets into his
dimly lit doorway on Feb. 4, 1999. They say 19 bullets hit the West African
immigrant in under 10 seconds after he refused orders to halt and pulled out a
black object that turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors assert the gunfire took longer and, as some of Diallo's
neighbors have testified, was interrupted by a pause. The pause could be used to
argue the officers should have realized their mistake and ceased fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 36, Kenneth Boss, 28, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy,
27, have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder charges. If convicted, they
face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was adjourned until Monday, when the officers are expected to
begin taking the stand in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   After reviewing Diallo's autopsy, both Mason and Dr. Martin Fackler, a
surgeon specializing in ``wound ballistics,'' theorized that Diallo was standing
and turning to face the officers when 15 bullets hit his left side.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo then took a shot square in the chest that damaged his spine, the
doctors said. His fall then was broken by a wall of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule
where he died, they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony conflicted with that of Dr. Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner
who performed the autopsy. Cohen testified this week that the chest shot
paralyzed Diallo ``early on.'' He said the rest of the bullets must have struck
Diallo as he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the defense asked Justice Joseph Teresi to order prosecutors to
turn over the rap sheet of Elliott. The judge agreed to let defense attorneys
use the information to attack Elliott's credibility when she resumes testifying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Elliott's past were not revealed in court. But records show that
a 32-year-old woman using the names Schrrie Elliott, Scherie Elliot and Denise
Williams was arrested and convicted for possession and sale of drugs at least
twice between 1990 and 1994, and has served time on Rikers Island and in state
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott admitted on the stand Wednesday that she had ``had past dealings
with the law,'' but she didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ruled the defense could show the jury portions of two
television news interviews in which Elliott appears to support some details of
the officers' account of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys gambled Wednesday by subpoenaing Elliott -- who had
refused to meet with them -- to testify about what she heard. She told jurors
someone yelled ``Gun!'' before gunfire erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   But the move backfired on cross-examination when the witness claimed the
officers cornered Diallo and opened fire without warning. She also said the
officers kept shooting the unarmed victim after he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   In the television interviews, Elliott said one officer yelled ``Gun!'' But
she also indicates Diallo appeared to be on his feet for most of the shooting --
all proof, the defense says, that the officers fired because they believed
Diallo was an armed threat.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting sparked enough pretrial publicity that an appeals court moved
the trial to Albany.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Cop Wouldn't Implicate Other  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors said Thursday that days before he
pleaded guilty to sodomizing a Haitian immigrant in a police station bathroom,
Officer Justin Volpe assured a lawyer he would ``say nothin''' to implicate a
fellow officer.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to a federal judge, prosecutors said they had witnesses ready to
testify about the exchange between Volpe and a lawyer for Charles Schwarz. The
judge did not immediately rule on whether to admit the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe and Schwarz were on trial last May for violating Abner Louima's civil
rights. Volpe abruptly decided to plead guilty and was later sentenced to 30
years in prison. Schwarz was convicted and faces a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, and officers Thomas Bruder, 37, and Thomas Wiese, 34, could
also face up to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct
justice.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad, rumors
of Volpe's decision to plead guilty were circulating through the Brooklyn
federal courthouse on May 20. During a lunch recess, Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen
Worth, ``confronted Volpe in the lobby'' and asked a question. The letter
continues:
</P>
<P>
	   ``In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
`Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'. Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, defending another officer in the Amadou Diallo murder trial in
Albany, refused comment on whether he had any such conversation with Volpe.
``They know where to find me,'' he said. ``I'd be happy to respond to a
subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
	   Five days after the alleged conversation, Volpe pleaded guilty to sodomizing
Louima with a broken broomstick. He said a second officer, whom he did not name,
took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Then in December, Volpe said the second officer was Wiese, and that he did
not participate or interfere.
</P>
<P>
	   In moving for a new trial for Schwarz, Worth claimed that prosecutors
withheld from him their knowledge that Volpe would deny Schwarz's presence in
the bathroom. The prosecutors' letter suggests that Worth knew of Volpe's
intention from the officer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his
intent to `say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the sexual assault of
Mr. Louima,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvyn Kornberg, who was Volpe's attorney, described the letter as
``grasping at straws'' by the state.

<HEADLINE> A Glance at Flight Inspections  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   U.S.-based carriers with MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and 717s in their fleets
inspected the tail sections of those planes because of the damage found in the
wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   A look at those inspections by major carriers:
</P>
<P>
	   -- ALASKA: Inspected 31 of 34 MD-80s in fleet. Two were grounded after
fibers were found around jackscrews. Three remain to be inspected, airline
president Bill Ayer said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- AMERICAN: Expects to complete inspections of its 284 MD-80s and MD-90s
within a week. The airline would not say whether any problems had been detected.
</P>
<P>
	   -- CONTINENTAL: Expects to complete inspections on its 69 MD-80s this
weekend. ``Nothing noteworthy's been seen in the inspections,'' spokesman David
Messing said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- DELTA: Has inspected 115 of its 120 MD-88s and 16 MD-90s and found no
problems, spokesman John Kennedy said. The checks were to be finished by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   -- NORTHWEST: Has no MD-80s in its fleet of 416 aircraft; expected to finish
inspections Thursday on its 172 Boeing DC-9s. It had found no problems by
Thursday afternoon, spokesman Dennis Mollura said. The company also was checking
the maintenance histories of all its aircraft and had found no past problems
with the horizontal stabilizers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- TWA: Was to begin inspecting its fleet of 103 MD-80s and 29 DC-9s
Thursday night, spokeswoman Julia Bishop said. The airline will inspect the jets
during routine maintenance checks and does not expect travel disruptions, she
said. She did not know when the inspections would be completed.
</P>
<P>
	   -- UNITED: Unaffected by the inspection recommendations and orders,
spokesman Joe Hopkins said. It flies no MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s or 717s.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Candidate Eyed for Arson Link  </HEADLINE>
   By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A former suburban City Council candidate who faked his name
and lied about his past was arrested Thursday for allegedly skipping out on a
prison sentence stemming from a 1970 Vietnam War protest.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. marshals said Gary Tredway, who dropped out of the City Council race in
Scottsdale this week after admitting he had faked his identity, is really Howard
Mechanic, who was convicted of throwing a ``cherry bomb'' at firefighters during
a demonstration at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstration was held the day after four students were shot by National
Guardsmen quelling an anti-war protest at Kent State University in Ohio.
Mechanic was a student at Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Mechanic was sentenced to five years in prison in the case. He failed to
appear in court after being released on his own recognizance and a warrant was
issued for him in 1972. He hadn't been found since.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Republic quoted a source who knows Tredway as saying he admitted
being Mechanic. The newspaper shared the information with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Tredway said Monday he was dropping out of the City Council race because he
suffered from leukemia. But then he admitted that was a lie.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix that had been
investigating his past, that he had lied about his identity, his college
background, birthplace and family background.
</P>
<P>
	   While not saying he was Mechanic, Tredway told the newspaper that he was
living under an assumed name to avoid being prosecuted for a past crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The man marshals say is Mechanic was arrested Thursday afternoon in downtown
Phoenix. A court appearance was scheduled for Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Promotes Farr To CEO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. promoted controller Kevin M. Farr to
chief financial officer Thursday in a move that an analyst said could lend
stability to the company's hierarchy following the resignation last week of
chief executive Jill Barad.
</P>
<P>
	   Farr, 42, succeeds Harry J. Pearce, who announced his retirement plans last
March.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to holding the job of controller since 1996, Farr is a senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   By announcing a replacement for Pearce, Mattel has removed some of the
uncertainty about the company's future management, said Sean McGowan, an analyst
with Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me its a step toward fixing the problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad resigned after Mattel reported a steep loss for the fourth quarter.
The board appointed two of its own members to interim leadership roles, picking
William Rollnick as acting chairman and Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was under pressure from investors and Mattel directors to explain big
losses at the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Farr joined Mattel in 1991 as director of the company's tax division. Before
he worked for Mattel, Farr spent 11 years with the professional services firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.

<HEADLINE> Justice Reviews Elian's Guardians  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing whether
alcohol-related driving violations or other actions by Elian Gonzalez' relatives
in Miami warrant moving the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That matter is under review,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said
when asked Thursday about the violations. ``We will look at that, try to make
some kind of factual determination and then decide what steps, if any, need to
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the department is still considering a request last week from
Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody
shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo
Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro
Gonzalez's family has permitted and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists
selected by Lazaro Gonzalez's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, the possibility of a meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno
and Lazaro Gonzalez's family re-emerged Thursday. Reno agreed to a meeting
earlier this week, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw the request.
But discussions have been renewed, a Justice official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, two of Elian's Miami cousins sought support on Capitol Hill
for legislation that would help keep the boy in America. One of them,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, told a news conference that reports of alcohol-related
violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said Elian's father had intended to flee Cuba
himself, but was being coerced by the Castro government to stay and make certain
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba,'' Cid said. She said
she and other family members had spoken to Elian's father by phone both before
and after the mother perished.
</P>
<P>
	   The father's response when learning that his boy was safe in Miami was
``take care of him until I can go, meaning go to the United States,'' Cid said.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Florida lawmakers introduced legislation this month to grant
Elian American citizenship, which would take the decision about Elian's future
away from INS and give it to a Florida family court. Support for the bill has
been waning.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has already met with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and a Catholic nun from
Miami who oppose his return to Cuba, as well as with Elian's two grandmothers
from Cuba, who want him returned.
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana, Elian's father joined President Fidel Castro on Thursday in a
packed auditorium in what has become a daily public rally to press for the boy's
return. Speaker after speaker denounced the United States and extolled the
virtues of Cuba's communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice official, who requested anonymity, said the department has
authority, if necessary, to shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro
Gonzalez. The boy was placed in his care after being found clinging to an inner
tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following a boat wreck that killed his
mother and 10 other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of the
father's request that the boy be returned to him in Cuba, but that decision was
put on hold while the Miami relatives battle in federal court to keep him in
this country.
</P>
<P>
	   Holder said that INS acted appropriately but ``now that we have this new
information, we'll have to look at it, and see, like I said, what steps if any
are appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida state records show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found guilty of driving
under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997. Records also
show Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found
guilty at least twice of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Castro's
key man for U.S.-Cuban relations, said the convictions prove the homes of those
uncles are no place for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the
future, joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of
the child,'' Alarcon told reporters in Havana. He said Elian was ``surrounded by
two drunks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed the
criticism: ``Elian is surrounded by love.'' Elian's relatives and other Miami
supporters say his mother died to give him freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily Gramma, published a letter
Thursday from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No material good exists that can compete with the value of the family, and
it is humiliating for us that people are still questioning our love and the
future that awaits Elian at his home,'' said a Spanish version of the letter,
dated Feb. 4.

<HEADLINE> 'Ernest' Actor Jim Varney Dies At 50  </HEADLINE>
   By JOE EDWARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jim Varney, the rubbernecked comic who portrayed
his rube character ``Ernest'' from hundreds of television commercials to a
series of movies, died Thursday. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Varney died of lung cancer at his home in White House, Tenn., about 20 miles
north of Nashville, said his attorney Hoot Gibson.
</P>
<P>
	   Varney became a cult figure in the 1980s in a series of regional
commercials, portraying Ernest P. Worrell, a know-it-all good ol' boy whose
best-known phrase was ``Know-what-I-mean?'' and who addressed a character known
as ``Vern.'' His last film role was in the 1999 film ``Daddy and Them,''
directed by Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any of us who knew Jim well, know that the world will never exactly know
what a great talent and extraordinary human being we have lost,'' Thornton said
in a statement. ``I loved him dearly.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Ernest commercials, he got his fingers slammed in a house window,
fell off a ladder and got electrically shocked fooling with a broken TV set. He
plugged a variety of sponsors, including dairy products, car dealerships, pizza
and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ernest is a neighbor or relative that we've all had at one time,'' he once
said. ``He's abrasive, but he doesn't mean to be. He gets excited and ends up
standing on your toes. I try to make him clownish and I don't want him too low
key; and he's physically funny.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been my biggest sounding board. I've grown to know him well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1987 and 1990, he was in four ``Ernest'' movies for Disney. Five
more Ernest films were released independently, mainly for the video and
television markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Varney also was the voice of Slinky Dog in ``Toy Story'' and Toy Story II.''
</P>
<P>
	   His movie credits included ``Ernest Goes to Camp''; ``Ernest Rides Again'';
``Ernest Saves Christmas''; ``Ernest Goes to Jail''; ``Ernest Scared Stupid'';
``Ernest Goes to School''; ''100 Proof,'' an independent film; ``The Beverly
Hillbillies'' (as Jed Clampett); and ``Treehouse Hostage.''
</P>
<P>
	   His TV credits included ``Hey Vern, It's Ernest,'' ``Roseanne,'' ``The
Simpsons,'' ``The Rousters,'' ``Alice,'' ``Operation Petticoat,'' ``Fernwood
2-Night'' and ``Pop Goes the Country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest usually was dressed in a baseball cap, T-shirt, blue denim vest and
blue jeans. He had a generous nose. He was hapless and harmless.
</P>
<P>
	   About his outfit, he told The Associated Press in 1984, ``It's a lovely
outfit that can be worn gracefully six days a week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Lexington, Ky., Varney began acting in local theater at 8. By the
age of 16 he was playing Shakespeare in a professional theater, though he didn't
tell his teachers. He sought his acting fortune in New York at 18 and slogged
through off-Broadway, dinner theaters and comedy clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a rough department, stand-up comedy,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At one point I had an act where I could go 30 or 40 minutes, and I knew
the material I was going to do, the timing, etc. You could play it one night and
knock'em over. The next night you could play the same material -- nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Varney got the cancer diagnosis in August 1998, and within months it had
spread to his brain. The cancer appeared to be in remission in late 1999 though
radiation had left him bald. Despite his illness, in 1999 he filmed the movie
``Daddy and Them'' starring Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody likes Ernest unless they're too cool,'' Varney said in a 1990
interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people who like sports cars and sunglasses are not our audience. They
like that action-adventure, tough-guy stuff,'' he said. ``From 14 down and 25
up, we have a huge audience. Older people aren't afraid to laugh at him, and
kids aren't self-conscious yet.''

<HEADLINE> Bill would put physicians' malpractice history online  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With a click of a mouse, patients would be able to
learn about a physician's medical malpractice track record, under a bill
approved Thursday by a Senate committee.
<P>
	   Doctors' education, experience, and any criminal or disciplinary record
would also be included on a new Web site, under the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said the legislation, S-575, fills a need for information-hungry
health care consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Detractors say it could include misleading information that could unfairly
sway patients away from deserving doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey, the bill sponsor, said he is
confident that the measure will pass his house, despite the opposition of the
Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Society counsel Vince Maressa asked members of the Senate Health Committee
to amend the bill. He wants the state to use discretion to delete Internet
records of isolated medical malpractice awards against otherwise good doctors.
As written, the bill would include any judgment or settlement against a doctor
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The existence of a malpractice judgment "doesn't mean the physician is good,
bad or indifferent," Maressa said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not indicative of the quality of medicine that doctor practices, any
more than one accident is indicative of the quality of a motorist's ability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maressa said he has no quarrel with the rest of the bill. But if lawmakers
want to release doctors' malpractice records, they should at least do the same
with hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Codey countered that the society ought to give more credit to Web-savvy
consumers. Doctors will be grouped together by specialty on the Web site, he
noted. So patients will be able to view in context the records of
obstetrician-gynecologists, who are sued more often than, say, foot doctors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more information consumers have, the better off they are," Codey said.
"This is something whose time has come."
</P>
<P>
	   "No way" will he allow the bill to be amended to appease the Medical
Society, he later said.
</P>
<P>
	   Codey pointed out that his bill allows the doctor space within the Web
profile to write a disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1994, the Medical Society has contributed $266,000 to political action
committees run by Republican legislative leaders, and $68,700 to PACs run by
Democratic legislative leaders, according to an Associated Press review of
campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey would join Massachusetts, California, Maryland and Florida among
states with similar physician Web sites, the sponsor said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to any malpractice, criminal and disciplinary information, the
site would also include data on a doctor's office hours, hospital privileges,
faculty appointments, accreditation and Medicaid acceptance. The bill would
spend $300,000 to set up the special Web site, and also recommends a study to
determine whether the site should be expanded to include other health care
professionals such as dentists, nurses and therapists.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure now goes to the Senate budget committee.

<HEADLINE> Potential Allergen Spurs Meat Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 211,000 pounds of steak products are being recalled
because the packages don't disclose that they may contain the allergens
buttermilk and whey.
</P>
<P>
	   The products being recalled by Advance Food Co. Inc. of Enid, Okla., were
distributed to stores throughout the United States and Puerto Rico,the
Agriculture Department said Thursday. They are labeled ``Steak for Country
Frying -- Fully Cooked Cubed Beef Steak'' and sold in 2 1/2-pound packages.
``Est. 2260Y'' appears inside the USDA inspection mark.
</P>
<P>
	   The recall applies to packages that don't carry the phrase ``Buttermilk
Blend (Buttermilk, Whey)'' in the ingredient statement. The recalled packages
are marked with the letter D followed by any four-digit number, or one of these
specific numbers, E0012, E0071, E0141, E0191. E0221, E0251, E0261 or E0311.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Urged To Support China Criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- An international coalition urged the European Union on
Thursday to support U.S. efforts to criticize China's human rights record at an
upcoming U.N. meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind-the-scenes efforts by the EU to improve the human rights situation in
China have failed to stop violations, much less improve the overall situation in
the country, the coalition said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   With Beijing's current crackdown on dissidents and the banned Falun Gong
spiritual movement, the EU should change strategy and cosponsor a resolution
censuring China at the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva,
which begins March 20, the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dialogue without pressure in the face of persistent gross violations of
human rights is simply appeasement and degrades the authority of international
human rights standards,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition includes Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters
Without Borders, Human Rights in China, the International Federation of Human
Rights and the International Campaign for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States announced in January it would again seek to pass a
resolution criticizing China's record at the commission's annual meeting and
launched an international campaign to get support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight attempts to censure China at the U.N. commission have failed since
1990, as Beijing mobilized support from the developing countries that dominate
the 53-member group.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, American officials couldn't muster enough support to even include
the question on the commission's agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European nations didn't back the U.S. initiative then. The European
Union said last week it didn't yet have a position on the new proposed U.S.
resolution.

<HEADLINE> McCain Tries Balancing Act  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the campaign trail where he decries the Washington
money chase, Sen. John McCain beamed his image into the ballroom of a capital
hotel where corporate lobbyists helped raise as much as $500,000 for his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the same lobbyists who press McCain's Senate Commerce Committee to
act on legislation that affects their corporate clients -- AT&AMP;T, United Airlines
and other giants.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is running on a pledge to change the way campaigns are financed,
finds himself having to use the system he criticizes in order to fund his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   His Washington fund-raiser Thursday -- where tickets went for $500 and
$1,000 -- was the centerpiece of a one-day series of events expected to bring in
as much as $500,000. About 200 people attended, and many of the lobbyists
present wore red-white-and-blue stickers provided by the campaign that said,
``McCain voted against my bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain actually was campaigning in South Carolina, but he spoke in
Washington and 17 other locations via satellite. In addition, 500 people paid
$100 apiece to chat with him over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're running this campaign because we want to give the government back to
the people,'' McCain said. ``We want to break the iron triangle of lobbyists,
big money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The events have given his chief rival for the Republican presidential
nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a line of attack.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ellen Miller, director of the campaign finance advocacy group Public
Campaign, said, ``John McCain is the perfect example of someone caught in a bad
system. He really has no other way to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself, asked earlier in the day about the propriety of raising
money from the lobbyists, said, ``They are supporting my candidacy because
they're sick and tired of the system in Washington today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the contributions ``are in keeping with the reforms I want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other congressional committee chairmen, McCain is following the
well-worn path of raising campaign money from the industries that come under his
panel's jurisdiction. Three-fourths of the 44 members of McCain's ``victory
committee'' for Thursday's fund-raiser were lobbyists, most of them with
interests before the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The list includes lobbyists from CSX and Union Pacific, as well as the
president of the Association of American Railroads. McCain has introduced
legislation to renew the Surface Transportation Board, which regulates the
railroad industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad association president, Edward Hamberger, has known McCain for
20 years, said Steve Hart, senior vice president for policy and communications.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory committee also includes lobbyists from CBS, Fox and the National
Association of Broadcasters. McCain has introduced legislation to allow the
networks to increase the number of TV stations they own so they can reach half
of the national audience, up from the current 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also is playing a leading role in negotiations with the House on
legislation to renew the Federal Aviation Administration and on a bill that
would privatize the world communications satellite network and end Comsat's
monopoly in giving U.S. companies access to it.
</P>
<P>
	   Three members of the law firm of Higgins, McGovern &AMP; Smith helped to raise
money for the fund-raiser. The firm's clients include America West and PanAmSat.
The Senate version of the FAA bill would make it possible for America West to
offer service to Arizona from Reagan National Airport, while PanAmSat has
lobbied to end Comsat's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Smith, a partner in the law firm, said he served with McCain in the
Navy and was supporting him now.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of overhauling the campaign finance laws point out that McCain is
complying with the provisions of the legislation he has championed in the
Senate. The bill, co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, would ban ``soft money,'' the unregulated corporate, union and
individual contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has pledged not to let the Republican Party spend soft money to help
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is he's against soft money and he's not raising soft
money,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who has sponsored similar
legislation in the House. ``Does he have to raise money to run a campaign? The
answer is yes. Is he abiding by his legislation? Yes. That's the important
thing.''

   TORONTO (AP) -- Three teenagers were wounded Thursday when gunfire erupted in
a high school parking. Police said they were looking for two male suspects with
handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting at Emery Collegiate Institute in suburban Toronto occurred as
students were going home for the day, prompting authorities to locked the doors
and keep many students inside for two hours as a safety precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was seriously injured, said police Sgt. Jim Muscat. He said one
of the wounded was a student at the school and another was a former student. He
was unable to confirm if the attackers were students.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they searched the school and surrounding neighborhood, but
released few other details of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Video footage on CTV television showed one young male victim being wheeled
into a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Lance McLean, 19, a grade 12 student, said he was playing chess in the
school when another student told him of the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of crazy to have something like that happen at your school,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Sgt. Bruce Warren said he was unaware of any previous violence at the
school, which has a population of about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the parent of two school-aged sons, I am deeply troubled by any act of
violence,'' Ontario Premier Mike Harris said after the shooting. ``I will do
everything in my power to ensure that our schools'' are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings evoked memories of school violence in Canada and the United
States in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In the worst incident, two students at Columbine high school in Littleton,
Colo., killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 before killing themselves
in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A week later, a 14-year-old student at a Taber, Alberta, high school killed
a 17-year-old student and wounded another 17-year-old in an attack considered a
response to bullying.
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said video cameras are used to monitor hallways and students
are forbidden from wearing overcoats in the halls.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Switched Baby Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a $31 million negligence lawsuit
filed by the mother of one of two babies switched at birth in a Virginia
hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Johnson has raised Callie Conley since taking her home from the
state-run University of Virginia Medical Center in 1995. Callie is actually the
biological child of a Buena Vista couple who died in a car crash in July 1998,
about the time the switch was discovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Stafford Circuit Judge James Haley Jr. on Wednesday dismissed Johnson's
lawsuit against the state, the hospital and 17 physicians and nurses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're pleased with the decision of the court,'' David Botkins, a spokesman
for the state attorney general's office, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Johnson, an attorney for Paula Johnson, said her client was upset
but not surprised by the dismissal. ``There's plenty of room for appeal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling, Haley said Johnson failed to allege any physical injury to
herself in her negligence claim and that emotional distress to parents stems
from damages negligently inflicted on the child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No child is party to this action,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two investigations failed to determine how the switch occurred.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Says Combs Offered Bribe  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap mogul Sean "Puffy" Combs offered his driver $50,000 and
a diamond ring Jennifer Lopez had given him if the driver would say he owned a
gun police found as they fled a nightclub shooting, a prosecutor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos said Combs, 30, offered to bribe Wardel
Fenderson, 41, at the police station where they were arrested on weapons charges
early on Dec. 27. The prosecutor asked a judge to increase Combs' bail from
$10,000 to $150,000, but no ruling was immediately made.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, denied that his client had offered anyone a
bribe and said he was "astonished by the prosecutor's outrageous and baseless
statements."
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and Fenderson were arrested with Anthony "Wolf" Jones, 34, Combs'
bodyguard; and Jamal "Shyne" Barrow, 19, a Combs rap protege, after Barrow
allegedly shot and wounded three people inside the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogdanos said the shooting stemmed from an argument in which an unidentified
man threw money in Combs' face. He said both Combs and Barrow pulled guns,
Barrow fired, and Combs and Lopez left.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs is charged with having two stolen guns in his sport utility vehicle as
he fled the shooting. One gun was found by police in the vehicle, and the other
was thrown out of the vehicle, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gun that Combs allegedly wanted Fenderson to claim was a loaded 9 mm
automatic that police found on the floor of the vehicle. Fenderson was driving;
Combs, Lopez and Jones were passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and Jones could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted; Barrow
could get up to 25 years. Fenderson has not been charged.

<HEADLINE> New JetBlue Air Offers Low Fares  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Low fares, deep pockets and even something to keep the kids
from driving everyone nuts -- live cable TV.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what's being offered by JetBlue Airways, a new discount carrier whose
first $79 flight from New York to Fort Lauderdale takes off Friday, with $49
flights to Buffalo a week later. Prices are 30 to 65 percent below typical
fares, which can cost $200 or more one-way between New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   But can JetBlue survive in an extremely tough industry? Of the 39 jet
carriers that began operation between 1989 and 1999, only 17 remain in business,
according to figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's a matter of survival," JetBlue's founder David Neeleman
insisted at a news conference Thursday at Kennedy Airport. "We have the capital
to survive. We're going to be profitable within a year. Our costs are
significantly lower than the majors. ... When you use technology the way we do,
you can be efficient."
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue claims to be the best-financed start-up in aviation history, with
$130 million in backing from billionaire George Soros and Chase Capital
Partners. The money has enabled Neeleman to buy all new Airbus jets, which cost
less to operate than older models. His 300 employees include stay-at-home moms,
who take reservations from home on their laptops in his native state of Utah,
and airport staff wearing preppy blue polo shirts. Passengers can also arrange
their own ticketless travel through a Web site, www.jetblue.com.
</P>
<P>
	   In a few weeks it will also become the first airline to offer live
transmission of 24 cable channels, at your seat, from takeoff to landing. The TV
service includes several stations for children, comes with earphones and costs
$5 per flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he's a college drop-out, Neeleman has a heap of experience in his
industry. He helped found Morris Air, a Utah-based carrier that Southwest
Airlines bought for $129 million in 1993. He's also worked for WestJet, a
profitable Canadian discount carrier, and was CEO of Open Skies, a reservations
company now owned by Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
	   This summer JetBlue will become the first airline at JFK to offer a shuttle
bus directly from its terminal to a nearby Long Island Rail Road station in
Jamaica, Queens. From there it's a short train ride to Manhattan. This will
increase options for travelers whose alternatives now include $30 cab rides and
90-minute bus-and-subway rides.
</P>
<P>
	   New York State has some of the highest in-state fares in the country, a
factor that hurts efforts to attract new business upstate.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest -- a discount airline based in Texas -- recently began service
from New York, flying out of a small airport in Islip, Long Island. The carrier
plans to fly planes out of Albany beginning in May to four unannounced
destinations.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of the year, Neeleman plans to add eight planes to JetBlue's
current two, and fly to Tampa, Rochester, Syracuse and Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
	   JetBlue hopes to fly to another 38 cities over the next three years,
including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Indianapolis, Nashville, New
Orleans, Salt Lake City and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Strike Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. officials said Thursday they were still assessing
the effects of the strike by its engineering and technical workers, though the
union for the employees say the strike already was having an effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 22,000-strong Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace walked off the job Wednesday after contract negotiations with a
federal mediator broke down the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company continues to be obstinate," said SPEEA Executive Director
Charles Bofferding. "Until they come around, we are striking."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said the strike was already having an effect. Bofferding claimed
that a Qantas jet in Bangkok, being serviced by SPEEA members, was left
unfinished on the tarmac, and that the airline had complained. The union also
claimed that a part fabrication plant near Tacoma ground to a halt because no
SPEEA workers were there.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte could not confirm the union's claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing is still trying to figure out how many people walked out on Thursday,
he added. The company estimated about 75 percent, or 17,000, of the
SPEEA-covered employees went on strike Wednesday, while SPEEA claimed 95 percent
had walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of the number, production of aircraft remains unaffected, Conte
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our contingency plans are in place and they are working."

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar Inspects Mexican Project  </HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH DALZIEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey witnessed the
perseverance of drug traffickers Thursday as he inspected Mexican efforts to
guard borders against drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   A small plane disguised with military markings and loaded with a half-ton of
cocaine, flew into Mexican airspace about 30 miles from where McCaffrey was in
the city of Huixtla, near the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal police seized the four-seat Cessna 210 after it landed at a small
airfield. They found the cocaine and arrested the two Colombian pilots. Police
believe the plane came from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see, relatively infrequently, aircraft flying out of Colombia try and
get into southern Mexico,'' McCaffrey said later to The Associated Press. He
added that traffickers are trying other routes in the face of what he called ``a
deterrence wall against cocaine and heroin smuggling'' being built in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're doing pretty well in the air,'' he said. ``They (traffickers) are
already reading this situation, and they're landing in Guatemala, El Salvador,
or shipping by ferry and air into Panama.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spurred by U.S. criticism of it's anti-drug efforts -- and concerns about
growing domestic drug use and violence -- Mexico is spending hundreds of
millions of dollars to install large X-ray units to detect drug shipments at its
Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico has also mounted a land, sea and air campaign involving about 20,000
military personnel to patrol the country's Caribbean coast and intercept drug
shipments flown in, or dropped from planes into the sea to be picked up by
waiting boats.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey, the top U.S. anti-drug policy official, praised the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my judgment in the next five years this strategy will work in a
significant way,'' he said. ``We've got to go look at where these people
(traffickers) are going to go next.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, McCaffrey said about 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United
States is still shipped through Mexico. He said better intelligence-sharing on
the tracking and interception of drug flights -- and especially drug-laden boats
-- is still needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout his three-day visit to Mexico, McCaffrey has stressed that
cooperation between the two countries is key in fighting the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is only the beginning,'' McCaffrey said. ``There is a strong belief
in the hemisphere that we must work in partnership to protect our people''
against drugs.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Argues for Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bill Bradley, standing Thursday with parents of children
killed by guns, accused Al Gore of coming late and ending up weak on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not an issue that I came to after seeing television pictures of
Columbine,'' Bradley said. ``This is an issue that I believed as a matter of
fundamental principle throughout my public life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore has not always
done that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign countered that Bradley was trying to manufacture
differences where none exist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Gore has been a strong advocate for gun safety laws,'' said
Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General Bill Lockyer,
co-chairman of Gore's California campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But spokesman Chris Lehane acknowledged that Gore's record in Congress bears
little resemblance to his gun-control stance of today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His position changed to match the changing times,'' Lehane said, noting
the proliferation of gun violence in the past decade. ``The public looks for
leaders who respond to the changing times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was campaigning in Los Angeles on Thursday, too, promoting his health
care proposal at a hospital. In a striking counterpoint, his motorcade was held
up temporarily because of a shooting at a fast food restaurant nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to youngsters at El Sereno Middle School -- parents of youngsters
who were killed standing with him -- Bradley said Gore voted against a 1990 bill
to expand a federal ban on assault weapons and only wants to register new
handguns while ignoring an estimated 60 million current weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley wants to register and license all handguns and their owners, an idea
Gore has dismissed as impractical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The essence of leadership is to take on that which is considered too hard
to do and make it happen,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's plan also calls for banning gun dealers from residential
neighborhoods and limiting the number of guns a person can buy each year. Like
Gore, he would ban small, cheap ``Saturday night specials'' and have background
checks for purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   As a senator, Gore in 1985 voted against a 14-day waiting period for handgun
purchases and in 1990 voted against an amendment that would have prohibited the
sale of large-capacity ammunition magazines and banned a dozen types of
assault-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign handed out National Rifle Association literature from
the early to mid-1980s giving Gore its highest rating for being ``pro-gun.''
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange on guns came as both Democratic presidential contenders
campaigned in California with an eye on the state's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Washington, negotiations for weekly debates broke down over the Gore
camp's insistence that Bradley give up all television ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, trying to revive his campaign after losing in Iowa, New Hampshire
and Delaware, instead announced new campaign ads starring former basketball star
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's is trying to ferret out vulnerabilities in Gore's record as a U.S.
representative and senator from Tennessee. In New Hampshire, Bradley closed the
gap with women voters after reminding them that Gore cast many anti-abortion
votes.
</P>
<P>
	   During his school visit, Bradley was joined by Margaret Ensley, Sheri
Barnett and Ruett Foster, all of whom had lost children to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ensley, president of Mothers Against Violence in Schools, banged a miniature
coffin against the lectern. ``This does not have to be the legacy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Michael Shawn Ensley, was shot to death at his high school in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Foster's 7-year-old son, Evan, was shot in the head in 1997 as he sat in his
mother's car while she signed him up for a basketball league.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnett's son, Tony, was shot to death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's speech was applauded by the sixth-to-eighth graders at the
east-side school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most presidents don't know about gun violence. I think he knows,'' said
Angela Pando, 12, who lost a 15-year-old cousin in a drive-by shooting several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Students recently held a candy drive to fund a gun buyback campaign. When
two students who organized the program asked how many students knew someone who
had been injured or killed by a gun, more than half the 100 youngsters raised
their hands.

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Ban Denounced  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Black college students and hundreds of other
critics of Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to get rid of affirmative action packed Capitol
hearing rooms Thursday to denounce the effort as an attack on women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not attend the third and final set of hearings on his ``One
Florida'' proposal, which would eliminate race and gender as factors in
university admissions and the awarding of state contracts. He watched some of
the hearings on closed-circuit television in his office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The One Florida plan will not work,'' said Anthony Viegbesie, president of
the Tallahassee branch of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. ``The One Florida plan is anti-minority, anti-women,
anti-poverty and must be killed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor has insisted the plan would improve diversity in
education and contracting jobs by increasing outreach efforts to minorities
historically shut out of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   Students who take a difficult enough course load and finish in the top 20
percent of their high school graduating class would be guaranteed admission to
some state universities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The athletes that are needed to win football games will be included in
that 20 percent whether they have the grades or not,'' said Brenda Holt, a high
school teacher in Quincy. ``If the government in this state does not protect us
from the good-old-boy system, then who does?''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislators hearing testimony were split into two groups to accommodate
the crowd. About 1,200 people attended, and 100 spoke. Each speaker was limited
to three minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the governor has his heart in the right place, but has been
misguided in his approach so far,'' said Kelvin Lawrence, a sophomore at
predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, leaders in Florida's black community have protested against the
plan. In January, two black lawmakers staged a 25-hour sit-in inside Lt. Gov.
Frank Brogan's office, demanding that Bush rescind his executive order to put
One Florida in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refused, but he agreed to three public hearings on the plan. The
previous two, in Tampa and Miami, also were dominated by critics.
</P>
<P>
	   Then this week, while 1,000 students protested in the Capitol rotunda, Bush
met with four students from Florida A&AMP;M and agreed to add a three-year
``accountability measure'' to make sure enough minorities are admitted into
state universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Brogan said Thursday the plan would increase opportunities for minorities
and streamline the application process for state business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People worked and labored long on the vineyards of civil rights,'' he
said. ``What we're asking for is people to take a small slice of that courage
and create greater opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Chestnut, a Florida State University sophomore, said he has read the
plan several times and found several problems.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, the plan to guarantee college admission to the top 20 percent
of high school students might encourage students to attend schools with lesser
academic reputations to make it easier to get into college, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some participants were angry at Bush for not attending the meetings, just a
brief walk from his office. ``You are a he-devil,'' said Robert L. Lewis, an
elder at Words of Life church in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's Board of Regents is scheduled to vote next week on some portions
of the plan, including the part guaranteeing college admission to the top 20
percent of students. The regents' decision must be approved by the independently
elected Cabinet, which serves as the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature will also have significant say on the One Florida plan,
including changes in how state contracts are awarded. Opponents plan to march on
the Capitol on the opening day of the legislative session, March 7.

<HEADLINE> Smokers' Lawyer Accused of Pandering  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A black attorney for the tobacco industry on Thursday accused
a smokers' attorney of "blatant racial pandering" to a six-member jury with four
blacks, and asked for a mistrial in the 19-month case.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Rosenblatt, attorney for smokers in a massive class-action trial,
said he was "just stunned and highly insulted" by the charge from Brown &AMP;
Williamson attorney Andrew Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Judge Robert Kaye called for an end to animosities and took the
mistrial motion under advisement along with several other motions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This court is strongly of the opinion that race has no place in this trial
or this courtroom," the judge said. "To create an issue is terribly wrong and
won't be permitted."
</P>
<P>
	   During cross-examination of an industry witness, Upshaw said Rosenblatt
cited news articles about the lung-cancer death of singer Nat King Cole and
mentioned the country of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   "The evil genie of race has already been released in this courtroom. We
can't put it back in the bottle," Upshaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenblatt, who is white, said the accusation was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were a lawyer of African-American descent, I would worry about my
people who were killed and mutilated by the tobacco companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is proceeding before the same jury that in July found the nation's
five largest cigarette makers produced a product that causes emphysema, lung
cancer and other illnesses. In this phase, the jury is hearing evidence to
determine what, if any, damages should be awarded.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has warned that the jury might award a crippling verdict of
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants are: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris Inc., Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., the Council
for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute.

blacks, and asked for a mistrial in the 19-month case.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Rosenblatt, attorney for smokers in a massive class-action trial,
said he was "just stunned and highly insulted" by the charge from Brown &AMP;
Williamson attorney Andrew Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Judge Robert Kaye called for an end to animosities and took the
mistrial motion under advisement along with several other motions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This court is strongly of the opinion that race has no place in this trial
or this courtroom," the judge said. "To create an issue is terribly wrong and
won't be permitted."
</P>
<P>
	   During cross-examination of an industry witness, Upshaw said Rosenblatt
cited news articles about the lung-cancer death of singer Nat King Cole and
mentioned the country of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   "The evil genie of race has already been released in this courtroom. We
can't put it back in the bottle," Upshaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenblatt, who is white, said the accusation was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were a lawyer of African-American descent, I would worry about my
people who were killed and mutilated by the tobacco companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is proceeding before the same jury that in July found the nation's
five largest cigarette makers produced a product that causes emphysema, lung
cancer and other illnesses. In this phase, the jury is hearing evidence to
determine what, if any, damages should be awarded.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has warned that the jury might award a crippling verdict of
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants are: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris Inc., Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., the Council
for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Comes Down on Kilborn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- Craig Kilborn has incurred the wrath of Kentucky
lawmakers over his on-air jokes about tornado-ravaged Owensboro.
</P>
<P>
	   A House resolution adopted this week said lawmakers are "deeply aggrieved at
the lack of compassion" shown by the host of "The Late, Late Show with Craig
Kilborn" on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure asks Kilborn to apologize to Kentuckians for saying replacement
trailer houses were on their way to Owensboro residents whose homes were
destroyed by the Jan. 3 tornado, which caused an estimated $70 million worth of
damage in western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers also want Kilborn to say he's sorry for referring to the
commonwealth as "Kensucky."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Enders, a CBS spokesman, said "we certainly regret if we added to the
pain of their tragedy in any way."
</P>
<P>
	   Kilborn's publicist, Steven Rubenstein, said no harm was intended.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a comedy show and we didn't mean to offend anyone," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Won't Reopen Commune Fire Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY REEVES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- New claims about a fire that killed four children
at a religious commune don't warrant reopening the investigation into the blaze,
which was ruled an accident, the state fire marshal said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A mother and son who used to live at the Holyland commune contend its
founder, Luke Edwards, repeatedly predicted children would die in a fire in a
girl's dormitory. A dorm building caught fire in 1998, killing the four
children.
</P>
<P>
	   An officer with the state fire marshal's office on Wednesday questioned the
former residents, who were not interviewed during the initial review of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigator, Jimmy Graham, found no reason to reassess his original
finding that the blaze was sparked by an electric lamp placed too near a bed,
said state Fire Marshal John Robison.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of Holyland say children are routinely beaten and denied food for
days as punishment. The state is investigating conditions at the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Holyland resident Geraldine Wilson and her 15-year-old son Jeffery
claim Edwards predicted at least two blazes that occurred at the commune.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He foretold that the girls' dorm was going to burn down and God was going
to take some children with it,'' said Ms. Wilson, who lived at the compound on
and off for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffery Wilson said Edwards also predicted a fire that destroyed the boys'
dormitory at the Holyland last November. No one was hurt in that blaze, which
was also ruled an accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Holyland spokesman Jerry Brown said Edwards talked of dreaming of a fire,
but he did not predict a blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   A Holyland deacon, Albert Roberts, pleaded innocent Wednesday to a charge
that he assaulted Ms. Wilson's 13-year-old son Derrick with a piece of wood at
Holyland. His trial is set for March 13.

<HEADLINE> State keeps money from Parsons; Farmer names investigation panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Whitman administration began hitting a
contractor running problem-plagued centralized auto inspection stations in the
pocketbook on Thursday.
<P>
	   State officials late Thursday said they were withholding a scheduled $10
million capital construction payment from Parsons Infrastructure and Technology
until the firm can come up with a "recovery plan" to finish work to iron out
problems that surfaced when a new emissions and safety inspection system was
launched in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The state also removed $369,000 from Parsons' February payment for operating
the lanes, saying this is a penalty for long waiting times that plagued New
Jersey motorists in the month of December. The state on Thursday paid Parsons
$2.5 million for inspections it had conducted in January. The firm was paid $1.7
million last month for December inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, state Attorney General John Farmer named former state Insurance
Commissioner Kenneth Merin and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Walter F. Timpone
to help him conduct a probe into why a subcontractor's consistent and prophetic
warnings of problems with inspections weren't heeded.
</P>
<P>
	   The auto inspection system has forced long lines at many stations since it
was implemented to help New Jersey meet its federal mandate to clean the air.
The Whitman administration says Parsons fell down on the job, but Parsons
officials maintain state officials also bear some of the blame. The state has
suspended a tougher emissions test and a complicated computer system at 15 of
the state's 32 inspection lanes to allow Parsons time to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Gov. Christie Whitman has been announcing and repeating figures of
"fines" against the company since December, Thursday's action was the first time
the state actually withheld any money from Parsons.
</P>
<P>
	   The $10 million capital construction payment, due Friday, won't be paid
until Parsons submits its plan to remove computer gremlins, build more lanes,
increase staffing, and take other actions designed to ensure the lines won't
return when the tougher test is implemented again in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state wants to make sure it gets that plan for addressing the
problems," said state Treasury Department spokesman Francis Rapa.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, spokesman for Parsons, said the plan is expected to be
submitted "mid to late next week." State officials are expected to make that
payment if the plan meets their approval.
</P>
<P>
	   A battle, however, is brewing over the $369,000 the state withheld from
Parsons' payment. This is a penalty for long waiting times at centralized
inspection centers in December. Rapa said the state is expected to withhold more
money next month to penalize Parsons for long waiting times in January.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say the penalties were assessed because Parsons did not meet
the contractual demand to keep waiting times below 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons officials, however, say a big reason for the delays were computer
glitches they maintain were prompted by the state's action in developing
software.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the state's project manager last May, Parsons said it was
told the state would detail the computer program by August 1998, and that was
later pushed back to October 1998. However, the letter said when the company
raised concerns in late September 1998, it was told the computer specifications
"would have to be Parsons' responsibility if it was going to be completed in a
timely manner because resources were not available at the state to develop it."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter also warned that officials with the Department of Environmental
Protection and the Division of Motor Vehicles "were advised, on several
occasions, beginning in October 1998, that if changes and additions continued to
be made to the specifications, it would be impossible for Parsons to complete
installation according to schedule."
</P>
<P>
	   "There were, in our judgment, mitigating circumstances that led to some of
the delays," said Golden.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials maintain that even though concerns were raised, Parsons
nonetheless assured them that the system would be operational in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The money the state withheld from Parsons was placed into an escrow account
while talks between the company and state officials continue, Rapa said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general's probe, meanwhile, is designed to see who didn't heed
warnings of impending DMV disaster during the implementation period. Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco, the State Commission of Investigation and the
consumer watchdog group New Jersey Citizen Action are also planning probes or
public hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer said Merin and Timpone "bring a balance of investigative and
governmental experience to this inquiry ... In addition, each brings a
reputation for independence and integrity that will serve the panel well."
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union, criticized the selection, saying neither
knows about an auto emissions system, and predicted the outcome would be
"protection of the administration."
</P>
<P>
	   Merin and Timpone will each be paid $130 an hour for their services,
according to Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Farmer. Thus, while the Whitman
administration withholds money from Parsons, its attempts to either investigate
or mitigate problems involve spending money. A plan to subsidize private garages
while Parsons attempts to solve the problems is expected to cost taxpayers up to
$12 million.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Chides Clinton Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Count Bill Bradley as one Democrat not at all happy to
see President Clinton back on the trail raising money for the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's got to be some restraint here,'' Bradley said in a television
interview Thursday. ``How can you be for eliminating soft money and be
participating in the process of raising it?''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said this week that Clinton, now in the final year of his
presidency, is ready to raise millions for the Democratic National Committee by
attending four or five events a month for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will go toward a variety of efforts that may include ``issue ads''
later this year, DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on MSNBC's ``Hardball with Chris Matthews,'' Bradley said: ``This
is the same old Washington scene, where you find people contributing large sums
of money so they have access, so that they will be able to get the government to
do something that will help their bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, an advocate of campaign finance reform, reiterated his warning that
should Vice President Al Gore win their fight for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Republicans will play up his role in fund-raising excesses
associated with the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reality here is that the events of 1996 were a disgrace,'' Bradley
said. ``They were an embarrassment to everybody in politics, the Republicans and
Democrats both, but Democrats in particular bear some responsibility because we
were in power and we're also the party of reform, supposedly, and the party that
fights for the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said Gore will swear off soft money, but
only if Republicans agree to as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unlike Bill Bradley, Al Gore feels an obligation as leader of the
Democratic Party to help the party raise funds,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview, Bradley reiterated his complaint that Gore ``simply
den(ies) reality when it suits his purposes.'' He said Gore was wrong to allege
that Bradley waited until this week to make his first speech on education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been talking about education from the very beginning of this race,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley touted the education proposal he released Wednesday that would
double federal money for distressed schools, allow parents to choose different
public schools if their own don't measure up, set aside $500 million for charter
schools and boost standards for teachers.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Continue Debate Squabble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley continued to disagree Thursday
over planning for a series of debates leading up to the round of March 7
primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign halted discussions after Gore's representatives removed
as a possibility a Feb. 16 debate that the campaigns had tentatively agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns have agreed to debates on Feb. 21 and March 1, but there was
no indication that talks about scheduling additional debates would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had tentatively agreed to debate on the 16th, which unfortunately looks
like it won't be happening ... based on the unwillingness of the Gore campaign
to commit'' to the date, said Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke. ``We don't
know what the sticking point is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway did not deny Ludecke's assertion, but said
the Feb. 16 date was never solidified. He also said Gore's schedule is no longer
as open as it was last year when he first proposed that they have biweekly
debates in lieu of running campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was tentative discussion about (Feb. 16), but that is what tentative
means,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's refusal to end campaign advertising also is a major issue, he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides jabbed at each other in letters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, wrote that the vice president will
not allow his schedule to be ``dictated by a rival campaign. Doug Berman,
chairman of Bradley's campaign, said Gore's inflexibility in scheduling shows
that he ``is not serious'' about his own debate proposal.

Reform Party Reports Flood of Membership Applications
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Almost 3,000 people have signed up to become Reformers in the
past two weeks as part of a membership blitz before a referendum on merging the
party with the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials said Thursday that new and lapsed members are sending in
applications to make an April 16 deadline to vote on whether to form a broader
right-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Constituency offices have been canvassing hard, while Reform Leader Preston
Manning and various MPs hold meetings with Reformers across the country to sell
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Alliance opponent Ron Thorton says the increase in memberships, coupled with
Manning's campaign, seems like a bald effort to pad numbers on the Yes side in
time for the vote.

Health Minister Mum on Private Hospitals for Alberta
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Health Minister Allan Rock says he will wait until Alberta
brings in legislation to permit private hospitals before he decides whether the
policy is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
	   Alberta officials say they believe Rock's silence probably indicates Ottawa
is preparing to accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expect their silence indicates acceptance, but we don't know that for
sure, '' David Bray, a spokesman for Alberta Health Minister Halvar Jonson, said
in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of nurses unions discussed the issue with Rock in a closed
meeting Thursday but emerged with little in the way of new information.
</P>
<P>
	   Rock has maintained silence about Alberta's plans since expressing concerns
last fall. At that time he demanded answers to a list of concerns, but he has
not said whether the responses were satisfactory.

Legal Problems Tie Up Cash for Saskatchewan Farmers
</P>
<P>
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Even the good news seems to end up as bad news
for struggling farmers in Saskatchewan these days.
</P>
<P>
	   Just hours after the federal government freed up $100 million on Thursday
for a blanket payment to the province's grain farmers, legal problems blocked
the move.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers occupying the Saskatchewan legislature dismissed the whole exercise
as inadequate anyway. They want $300 million from the province alone before
they'll end their five-day-old sit-in.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa agreed to let the Saskatchewan government opt out of its
much-maligned farm aid scheme, the Agricultural Income Disaster Assistance
(AIDA) program.
</P>
<P>
	   That appeared to clear the way for the province to withdraw its $100-million
contribution, which it wants to spread evenly among all grain farmers -- about
$2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   But Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Dwain Lingenfelter now says legal
problems could keep the province from following through with the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is that the federal government has already started processing
AIDA claims for 1999 based on the assumption that the province is paying its 40
per cent share.
</P>
<P>
	   The province worries that farmers who have applied will sue if it withdraws
its money now.

Ontario Is Faulted on Smog Control Efforts
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- As federal environment officials prepare to meet with their
U.S. counterparts to cast an agreement for cleaner skies, activists said
Thursday that Canada won't have leverage unless smoggy Ontario cleans up its
act.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which begin in Ottawa on Wednesday and are expected to last until
fall, are aimed at reaching a joint Canada-U.S. commitment to reduce pollution
drifting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   It's estimated that 16,000 Canadians die prematurely from air pollution each
year.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Environment Canada officials consulted with industry representatives
and environmentalists in Toronto on Thursday, critics predicted little progress
in the talks unless the country's most smog-ridden province does more to curb
pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to give something to get something,'' said environmentalist Dan
McDermott, whose group Ontario Campaign has lobbied the province for stricter
caps on smog-causing emissions such as nitrogen oxide.
</P>

Three Provinces Seek Changes in Refugee Process
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Three provinces joined forces Thursday
to demand the federal government streamline the refugee process and assume the
cost of providing services to claimants.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa's response to the money demands: ``Get serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec issued a joint news release Thursday
accusing the federal government of mismanaging the refugee claimant system.
</P>
<P>
	   The long delays in processing claimants cost the taxpayer millions while
causing hardship for legitimate refugee claimants, the release said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three provinces -- where more than 95 per cent of refugees to Canada
make their claims -- want changes to federal immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
	   They want Ottawa to speed the time it takes to process refugee claims, to
deport illegitimate claimants and to pay for giving claimants social assistance
and other services.

<HEADLINE> Al Gore Appears on The Tonight Show  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- He was mistaken first for Prince Charles, then for
``governor of the United States.'' One of his Secret Service agents was caught
laughing at a Monica Lewinsky joke.
</P>
<P>
	   So much for Al Gore's debut on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, who has labored for six months to loosen up his image on
the presidential campaign trail, made his first appearance on the NBC program
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The joke, as usual on these late-night talk shows, was on him -- from Leno's
opening monologue (``Earlier today, computer hackers actually shut down Al Gore
for two hours'') to the game-show parody that preceded Gore's entrance on the
set.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore managed a few good lines of his own.
</P>
<P>
	   When Leno offered an apology for all the Gore jokes he's done over the
years, Gore shrugged it off. ``We have kind of a family ritual. We just sit
around the dinner table every night around 11:30 and make jokes about you,''
Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked which Republican he would rather face in a general election, Gov.
George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain, Gore didn't miss a beat: ``Whichever one
loses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he bristled when Leno showed the audience what his staff came up
with when sent to hunt for a ``sexy'' photo of Gore. It was an old
head-and-shoulders shot of a bare-chested Gore looking lustily into the lens.
</P>
<P>
	   Leno: ``What reason would the vice president have to stand around naked with
his head cocked like that?''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore: ``We were at the beach. Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
	   Of his campaign style, Gore said, ``I'm not really kind of a natural
backslapper.''
</P>
<P>
	   The real laughs came when Leno staged a current-events game show just before
Gore's brief turn on stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Four twentysomething-year-old contestants were shown a photo of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Isn't he the prince -- I can't remember -- Charles something,'' guessed
Kristina Meisner.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the line, Angela Ramos had better luck. ``Is it Gore?''
</P>
<P>
	   It was his title that stumped her. ``Governor? of the United States?''
</P>
<P>
	   As if such poor name recognition weren't a dismal enough sign for the man
hoping to succeed President Clinton, Gore found himself tangling still with
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
	   Leno asked Gore how he feels ``every time you put your arm around your
friend Bill Clinton.'' Gore replied that Clinton was a friend who ``made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   One agent with the Secret Service, which prides itself on its poker-faced
sobriety, was positioned on the side of the stage and couldn't help himself when
Leno delivered the punchline on a Lewinsky joke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whoop! I got a laugh out of the Secret Service guy,'' Leno bragged.

<HEADLINE> Vlasic Foods Restructures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Vlasic Foods International warned Thursday it
would post a loss for the fiscal second-quarter and is hiring an investment bank
to explore strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of condiments, frozen dinners and other food products said
Thursday it also will reduce staff at its suburban Philadelphia headquarters by
20 percent, or about 45 positions.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, the company expects to record a loss of 32 to
36 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
expected the company to earn 6 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The results are to be released Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss mainly was due to special charges from changes in promotional
campaigns related to the company's spinoff from Campbell Soup Co. nearly two
years ago, Vlasic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, sales of its Swanson frozen foods and Vlasic lines, while up 3

hurt earnings -- for the rest of the year, Vlasic said.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we continue to see increases in our frozen food and condiments
businesses, particularly in our pickles, pot pies and dinners businesses, we had
expected more robust overall growth," said Robert F. Bernstock, president and
chief executive officer. "These lower than expected levels of sales are likely
to continue and impact our earnings for the remainder of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Vlasic is taking several steps to improve its position, such as
combining all its North American businesses into a single unit and naming an
interim chief financial officer, Peter Menikoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also will explore strategies such as joint ventures,
acquisitions, or selling all or part of its business.

<HEADLINE> McCain Mixes Reform, Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the campaign trail where he decries the Washington
money chase, Sen. John McCain beamed his image into the ballroom of a capital
hotel where corporate lobbyists helped raise as much as $500,000 for his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the same lobbyists who press McCain's Senate Commerce Committee to
act on legislation that affects their corporate clients -- AT&AMP;T, United Airlines
and other giants.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is running on a pledge to change the way campaigns are financed,
finds himself having to use the system he criticizes in order to fund his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   His Washington fund-raiser Thursday -- where tickets went for $500 and
$1,000 -- was the centerpiece of a one-day series of events expected to bring in
as much as $500,000. About 200 people attended, and many of the lobbyists
present wore red-white-and-blue stickers provided by the campaign that said,
``McCain voted against my bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain actually was campaigning in South Carolina, but he spoke in
Washington and 17 other locations via satellite. In addition, 500 people paid
$100 apiece to chat with him over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're running this campaign because we want to give the government back to
the people,'' McCain said. ``We want to break the iron triangle of lobbyists,
big money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the Internet chat, McCain appeared on video from the College of
Charleston and fielded questions on the environment, Internet taxes and Reagan
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to change politics in America,'' McCain said of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The events have given his chief rival for the Republican presidential
nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a line of attack.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ellen Miller, director of the campaign finance advocacy group Public
Campaign, said, ``John McCain is the perfect example of someone caught in a bad
system. He really has no other way to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself, asked earlier in the day about the propriety of raising
money from the lobbyists, said, ``They are supporting my candidacy because
they're sick and tired of the system in Washington today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the contributions ``are in keeping with the reforms I want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other congressional committee chairmen, McCain is following the
well-worn path of raising campaign money from the industries that come under his
panel's jurisdiction. Three-fourths of the 44 members of McCain's ``victory
committee'' for Thursday's fund-raiser were lobbyists, most of them with
interests before the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The list includes lobbyists from CSX and Union Pacific, as well as the
president of the Association of American Railroads. McCain has introduced
legislation to renew the Surface Transportation Board, which regulates the
railroad industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad association president, Edward Hamberger, has known McCain for
20 years, said Steve Hart, senior vice president for policy and communications.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory committee also includes lobbyists from CBS, Fox and the National
Association of Broadcasters. McCain has introduced legislation to allow the
networks to increase the number of TV stations they own so they can reach half
of the national audience, up from the current 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also is playing a leading role in negotiations with the House on
legislation to renew the Federal Aviation Administration and on a bill that
would privatize the world communications satellite network and end Comsat's
monopoly in giving U.S. companies access to it.
</P>
<P>
	   Three members of the law firm of Higgins, McGovern &AMP; Smith helped to raise
money for the fund-raiser. The firm's clients include America West and PanAmSat.
The Senate version of the FAA bill would make it possible for America West to
offer service to Arizona from Reagan National Airport, while PanAmSat has
lobbied to end Comsat's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Smith, a partner in the law firm, said he served with McCain in the
Navy and was supporting him now.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of overhauling the campaign finance laws point out that McCain is
complying with the provisions of the legislation he has championed in the
Senate. The bill, co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, would ban ``soft money,'' the unregulated corporate, union and
individual contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has pledged not to let the Republican Party spend soft money to help
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is he's against soft money and he's not raising soft
money,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who has sponsored similar
legislation in the House. ``Does he have to raise money to run a campaign? The
answer is yes. Is he abiding by his legislation? Yes. That's the important
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Judge Bans Topless Parading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A juvenile court judge in northeastern Brazil
on Thursday banned minors from parading topless during this year's carnival,
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bahia state Judge Salomao Reseda ordered the ban to help prevent sexual
abuse during the early March event, the Estado news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Rio's carnival, where women can frequently be seen topless on parade
floats, women rarely bare their breasts during the carnival in Salvador, Bahia's
state capital, 750 miles northeast of Rio.
</P>
<P>
	   The carnival in Salvador is already Brazil's biggest. It draws 2 million
people, including 800,000 tourists, to its streets and generates $254 million in
business.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban comes just weeks after Rio de Janeiro officials declared that women
going topless on the beach would no longer be prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Details of Marriage Penalty Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Details of the House Republican bill to cut income taxes for many married
couples, including those who have a ``marriage penalty,'' paying more income
taxes than they would if they were single, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
Total cost: $182.3 billion over 10 years
</P>
<P>
	   --Adjusts upward for married couples the bottom 15 percent income tax
bracket to make it double that of single filers by 2008. If it had been in place
this year, couples would have paid a 15 percent rate on their first $52,500 of
taxable income, compared with $43,850 in current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not
itemize to twice that of single filers beginning in 2001. Using this year's
numbers, the deduction would rise from $7,351 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
	   --Raises the income cutoff for lower-income couples who claim the earned
income tax credit by $2,000 beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	    Impact on married couples who take standard tax deduction with two children
in 2005
</P>
<P>
	   --$20,000 income: $463 less in taxes, or 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$30,000 income: $718 less in taxes, or 93.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$50,000 income: $255 less in taxes, or 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$75,000 income: $821 less in taxes, or 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$100,000 income: $1,107 less in taxes, or 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --$200,000 income: $1,158 less in taxes, or 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	    Democratic alternatives
</P>
<P>
	   --House plan costing half as much as the GOP package would have the raised
standard income tax deduction for married couples who do not itemize to double
that of single filers and made changes in the earned income tax credit so it
would not be eroded for the working poor when they make more on the job. But all
items were subject to passage of separate legislation protecting Social Security
and Medicare and paying down the public debt. And the plan proposed no change in
the 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
	   --President Clinton has proposed $45 billion in relief, although his plan
would not help couples who itemize and is focused on those with dual incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- For married couples with two children earning $30,000 a
year, current law would give them a tax refund of $765 if they claimed the
earned income tax credit. Under the GOP bill, that same couple would get a
refund of $1,483, a difference of $718, or 93.9 percent. Couples in this group
would benefit most from the GOP proposal because they would be eligible for a
greater refund under the earned income tax credit than they are under current
law.

<HEADLINE> Sister Ida Peterfy Dies at 77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sister Ida Peterfy, who founded an order of nuns that
survived under Nazi and Communist rule and became one of the first in the United
States to relinquish the traditional habit, has died. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterfy was diagnosed with lymphoma in 1995 and died Tuesday at the
Northridge headquarters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sisters all came in and we had a vigil for eight hours,'' Sister Jane
Stafford said. ``We sang her goodbye. If you want to talk about a holy death,
this was it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peterfy was born in Hungary, where she founded the religious education order
in 1940. During World War II, she helped hide several Jewish families from the
Nazis. When Communists took control after the war, she kept the order together
under the cover of a secretarial school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was always resourceful,'' said Stafford, who is now the order's
superior. ``If you called your organization a school, you could live together
and own property. It was brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
	   The order's eschewing of traditional garb was controversial when it arrived
in Los Angeles in 1956. Cardinal James McIntyre, then head of the Los Angeles
Roman Catholic Archdiocese, urged Peterfy to retain the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mark my words: The church will need you as you are,'' he told her,
according to Sister Agnes Raday, a longtime member of the order.
</P>
<P>
	   The nuns used puppets, song, dance and education techniques developed by
Peterfy to teach church doctrine to children.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterfy produced the children's show ``My Friend Pookie'' in the early 1970s
to carry her message. It ran locally for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, she produced 30 half-hour installments of the ``Sacred Hearts
Kids' Club,'' which are still shown around the world, although they never aired
in Los Angeles, Raday said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterfy also was an avid hiker and camper who took the sisters on several
trips to the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of her death, the order had 52 nuns from various countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to its mother house, the order has a novitiate in the
neighboring San Fernando Valley area of Winnetka, a Burbank convent, several
other Los Angeles-area houses and missions in Hungary and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Flee to Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Leftist guerrillas from Colombia cross into Ecuador to
purchase weapons and supplies, a top Colombian police official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that criminals and the guerrillas elude lawful forces, taking
refuge across the border,'' Colombia's national police operations director Gen.
Alfonso Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There they buy arms, food and rest after battles,'' said Arellano, who was
in the capital, Quito, for an international public security seminar.
</P>
<P>
	   Arellano told the Quito newspaper El Comercio that a force of 1,500
Colombian police patrol the 350-mile) jungle border separating the two nations
to stem illegal smuggling and common crime. Colombia's military is more involved
in dealing with leftist guerrillas, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of Ecuador's jungle frontier town Lago Agrio have said for years
that suspected Colombian guerrillas in civilian clothing regularly arrive to
purchase supplies. But only in recent months have officials from either country
acknowledged their presence.

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged in Alleged Check Scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSBURG, W. Va. (AP) -- In this small West Virginia town where Bank One
tellers see the same faces all the time, Kimberly Felicetty turned heads with
her auburn hair, stylish clothes and relaxed, chatty manner.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say Felicetty used her poise and good looks as a participant
in a bad-check scheme that defrauded banks in five states of at least $1
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was very personable, very confident,'' Albert Cox, vice president of
Bank One's Clarksburg branch, said Wednesday. ``She talked about her husband and
dropped names. She was not nervous, not hurried. She was slick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Felicetty at a walk-up window Feb. 4, then found her two
alleged partners in a car around the corner. Felicetty, 29, of Pittsburgh, was
charged with passing bad checks. She was jailed along with Jeri Lynn Erb, 48, of
Wilkinsburg, Pa., who faces the same charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say the women are believed to have been working for Craig Stevens,
39, also of Wilkinsburg. Stevens was jailed on charges of engaging in fraudulent
schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Ron Alonso said the two women and possibly others used fake IDs created
with stolen customer account numbers and security information to cash genuine
checks from defunct businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Between Jan. 19 and Jan. 23, the three allegedly passed more than 15 checks
at banks in Clarksburg and four other West Virginia towns.
</P>
<P>
	   The scam apparently originated in Pennsylvania then moved into Ohio, New
Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   During a court appearance, the defendants said they could not afford lawyers
and would need a court-appointed attorney.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Makes Plane Tests Mandatory  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the
tails of MD-80 series jetliners and related planes -- about one-fifth of the
nation's airline fleet -- for damage similar to what was discovered in the
wreckage of Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,100 jets in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and
Boeing 717s -- will be covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday
by the Federal Aviation Administration. The airlines will have three days to
comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing had recommended the inspections on Wednesday, and all major U.S.
airlines already began an inspection process when the FAA decided to make it
mandatory. Alaska Airlines grounded two planes Thursday after problems were
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers should expect minor delays, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's far more important that we get these airplanes inspected,'' said Tom
McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator for certification. ``We want it done
right, and we want it done thorough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska, which has 34 MD-80 series planes in its fleet, grounded two of the
jetliners in Seattle and Portland, Ore., because metal shavings were found
around the jackscrews -- which drive the planes' horizontal stabilizers and
control the up-and-down direction of a plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Shavings indicate wear on a nut that travels along the screw.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer, the jackscrew, nut, elevators and other
components that adjust the plane's up-and-down pitch have been the focus of the
Flight 261 investigation. The pilots reported trouble with the stabilizer and
struggled to control the plane for at least 30 minutes before it crashed into
the Pacific on Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered from the wreckage, and metal
shavings found on it were determined to have come from the nut in the mechanism.
It is unclear whether the damage was a possible cause or an effect of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, the Navy recovered the nut.
</P>
<P>
	   The recovered nut will be sent to Washington for extensive laboratory
analysis -- as was the jackscrew assembly. The entire horizontal stabilizer
assemblies from the two grounded Alaska jets will also be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also announced the Navy had recovered additional pieces
of wreckage from Flight 261 -- including a 12-by-7 foot section of the vertical
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska has 34 MD-80 planes and 31 have been inspected, spokeswoman Heather
Hiestand said. Of those, 26 were cleared and returned to service.
</P>
<P>
	   Some airlines were not immediately disclosing the results of their
inspections, but Continental, Delta and Northwest -- with 377 jets to be
inspected -- said they had found no problems so far.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cop Tells of Criminal Clique  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A criminal clique within the Los Angeles Police
Department gave plaques to honor officers who shot people, says a disgraced
former officer whose allegations are at the heart of a scandal that has led to
the overturning of more than 30 verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that it had obtained 2,000 pages of
transcripts including 50 hours of interviews with former Officer Rafael Perez.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 32 criminal cases have been reversed as a result of the
investigation and 20 officers have been relieved of duty, suspended or fired or
have quit.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez told investigators more than 30 current and former anti-gang officers
at the Rampart station were ``in the loop'' and routinely broke the law by
either committing crimes or covering them up, according to the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
	   One document said more than 70 officers are under investigation for either
committing crimes or covering up criminal activity, the newspaper said. The
number suggests a police scandal more serious than previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   The ongoing corruption probe centers on Perez, a former member of the
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) anti-gang unit. The scandal
came to light last September when Perez pleaded guilty to stealing eight pounds
of cocaine from an evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to make a very broad statement. And you're not going to like
it,'' Perez told investigators shortly after agreeing to a plea bargain. ``I
would say that 90 percent of the officers who work CRASH, and not just Rampart
CRASH, falsify a lot of information. They put cases on people .... It hurts me
to say it, but there's a lot of crooked stuff going on in the LAPD.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after Perez entered his plea, Javier Francisco Ovando was set free
from prison. Perez said he and a former partner handcuffed Ovando, shot him and
planted a gun on him, then lied about the confrontation in court. Ovando,
paralyzed in the shooting, was sentenced to 23 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez told investigators that Rampart CRASH officers did not mind such
shootings, in fact celebrated them and even handed out awards, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plaque that you probably saw in my house ... you know what that plaque
is even about?'' Perez asked the investigators. He said a sergeant gave him the
CRASH plaque, with a red heart playing card and two bullets, for shooting
Ovando. He said the plaques had black cards if the suspect died.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is it more prestigious to get one that is black than red?'' a detective
asked, according to the transcript.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah. I mean, you know, the black one signifies that a guy died,'' Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also described two other shootings, including one in which a 21-year-old
suspect was left bleeding to death while officers discussed a cover-up story and
another in which fellow anti-gang officers opened fire early on New Year's Day
1996 on two men who posed no direct threat, according to the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times also reported that Perez has failed a polygraph test while
cooperating with authorities. Perez may be a poor polygraph test subject because
of the anxiety and stress brought on by the corruption probe, the newspaper
quoted unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The lie detector test also indicated that some of Perez's statements were
untruthful, though investigators independently verified their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said Thursday he is expanding his probe from
seven to 10 full-time investigators and expects another six to 10 convictions to
be dismissed next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said his priority is releasing those who have been imprisoned
because of perjured testimony and false evidence. However, he said he is not
ready to file charges against other officers.

cases,'' he said. ``But I can't tell you if that's going to be weeks or
months.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke is expected to
travel to Portugal next week to discuss the new U.N. peacekeeping operation in
the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. peacekeeping force is under deployment in East Timor, replacing
Australian-led peacekeepers who restored calm in the territory after its vote
for independence from Indonesia on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Pro-Indonesian militias went on a looting and killing rampage to protest the
vote results, destroying most of East Timor and driving tens of thousands of
refugees into neighboring Indonesian-held West Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke, who will visit Lisbon from Feb. 16-20, has demanded that
Indonesia do more to allow the refugees to either return home or resettle
elsewhere in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Affirmative Action Ban Denounced  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Black college students and hundreds of other
critics of Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to get rid of affirmative action packed Capitol
hearing rooms Thursday to denounce the effort as an attack on women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not attend the third and final set of hearings on his ``One
Florida'' proposal, which would eliminate race and gender as factors in
university admissions and the awarding of state contracts. He watched some of
the hearings on closed-circuit television in his office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The One Florida plan will not work,'' said Anthony Viegbesie, president of
the Tallahassee branch of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. ``The One Florida plan is anti-minority, anti-women,
anti-poverty and must be killed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor has insisted the plan would improve diversity in
education and contracting jobs by increasing outreach efforts to minorities
historically shut out of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Justin Sayfie said after the meeting that Bush still wants
quick approval on key parts of the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor is committed to moving ahead with the One Florida plan,''
Sayfie said. Delay ``would mean African-American high school seniors would lose
an opportunity to attend the State University System.''
</P>
<P>
	   Students who take a difficult enough course load and finish in the top 20
percent of their high school graduating class would be guaranteed admission to
some state universities under the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The athletes that are needed to win football games will be included in
that 20 percent whether they have the grades or not,'' said Brenda Holt, a high
school teacher in Quincy. ``If the government in this state does not protect us
from the good-old-boy system, then who does?''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislators hearing testimony were split into two groups to accommodate
the crowd. About 1,200 people attended, and 100 spoke. Each speaker was limited
to three minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the governor has his heart in the right place, but has been
misguided in his approach so far,'' said Kelvin Lawrence, a sophomore at
predominantly black Florida A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, leaders in Florida's black community have protested against the
plan. In January, two black lawmakers staged a 25-hour sit-in inside Lt. Gov.
Frank Brogan's office, demanding that Bush rescind his executive order to put
One Florida in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refused, but he agreed to three public hearings on the plan. The
previous two, in Tampa and Miami, also were dominated by critics.
</P>
<P>
	   Then this week, while 1,000 students protested in the Capitol rotunda, Bush
met with four students from Florida A&AMP;M and agreed to add a three-year
``accountability measure'' to make sure enough minorities are admitted into
state universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Brogan said Thursday the plan would increase opportunities for minorities
and streamline the application process for state business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People worked and labored long on the vineyards of civil rights,'' he
said. ``What we're asking for is people to take a small slice of that courage
and create greater opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Chestnut, a Florida State University sophomore, said he has read the
plan several times and found several problems.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, the plan to guarantee college admission to the top 20 percent
of high school students might encourage students to attend schools with lesser
academic reputations to make it easier to get into college, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some participants were angry at Bush for not attending the meetings, just a
brief walk from his office. ``You are a he-devil,'' said Robert L. Lewis, an
elder at Words of Life church in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's Board of Regents is scheduled to vote next week on some portions
of the plan, including the part guaranteeing college admission to the top 20
percent of students. The regents' decision must be approved by the independently
elected Cabinet, which serves as the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature will also have significant say on the One Florida plan,
including changes in how state contracts are awarded. Opponents plan to march on
the Capitol on the opening day of the legislative session, March 7.

<HEADLINE> Police arrest suspect in medical waste left at Stamford synagogue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A 56-year-old Jewish man was charged Thursday
with leaving a swastika-emblazoned bucket filled with medical waste outside a
Stamford synagogue last August, a week after a man went on a shooting spree at a
California Jewish community center.
<P>
	   Alan Jay Lorenz, of Weston, was arrested on a federal criminal complaint
charging him with obstructing persons in the free exercise of their religious
beliefs, a civil rights offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Stamford police discovered bucket on the lawn of Temple Beth El on Aug. 17.
The white plastic container was marked with swastikas. A newspaper photograph of
Buford Furrow Jr., the man accused in the California shooting, was taped to the
container, along with a caption saying, "A WAKEUP CALL TO AMERICA TO KILL THE
JEWS." The word "warning," standard on containers used to store medical waste,
had been circled in black marker. Inside were several syringes, gauze, cotton,
glass tubes and plastic straws - some with blood on them. Other medical waste
was found on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Robinson said Lorenz's motive is not clear.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't matter why he did it, whether his motivation was political or
financial doesn't matter," Robinson said. "What matters is that he attacked us
all."
</P>
<P>
	   Stamford police Chief Dean Esserman said Lorenz is also a suspect in a
similar incident at a Norwalk synagogue.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is our expectation that further charges will be following," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Esserman would not comment on how police caught Lorenz. But the federal
complaint said fingerprints were recovered from evidence left at the Stamford
temple. The FBI later determined that they were the fingerprints of Lorenz, who
works as a salesman of medical waste disposal equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   After the incident, Stamford police initiated a task force made up of
Stamford and Norwalk police and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime frightened many people in Stamford and the region, coming just a
week after a gunman, identified by police as Furrow, opened fire and wounded
five people at a Granada Hills, Calif., Jewish community center. Police said
Furrow then fatally shot a Filipino postal worker.
</P>
<P>
	   "Communities throughout the region were terrorized by the actions of this
individual," Esserman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz was scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted in the Stamford incident, Lorenz faces up to one year in prison
and a fine of up to $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Renews U.N. Tribunal Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Encouraged by the arrests of two key genocide
suspects abroad, Rwandan authorities on Thursday resumed cooperation with the
U.N. tribunal seeking the leaders of the 1994 massacres.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda had suspended ties with the U.N. tribunal for Rwanda in November
after judges ordered the release of a chief suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were some difficulties, but they were overcome,'' Vice President
Paul Kagame said after meeting Carla del Ponte, the chief U.N. prosecutor for
the U.N. tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Kagame's announcement came just days before the U.N. tribunal judges were to
review their decision to release Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza. They had ordered his
release, saying he had been held too long without being charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Barayagwiza is alleged to have been one of the architects of the Hutu
government-orchestrated killings of more than 500,000 people from April to July
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Del Ponte won back Rwanda's favor in recent weeks after achieving the
arrests and agreement of transfer to the tribunal of a former Rwandan army
officer living as a refugee in Britain and a former Rwandan education minister
living in France.
</P>
<P>
	   Kagame said that although Barayagwiza's case is still pending, it should not
obstruct working relations between Rwanda and the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its establishment in late 1994, the U.N. tribunal has delivered seven
verdicts. It is holding 39 people in custody in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda has been conducting its own trials. More than 125,000 suspects are in
jail. So far, more than 1,500 have been tried. The first 22 people condemned to
death were executed in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Makes Plane Tests Mandatory  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the
tails of MD-80 series jetliners and related planes -- about one-fifth of the
nation's airline fleet -- for damage similar to what was discovered in the
wreckage of Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,100 jets in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and
Boeing 717s -- will be covered by an order that was being drafted late Thursday
by the Federal Aviation Administration. The airlines will have three days to
comply.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing had recommended the inspections on Wednesday, and all major U.S.
airlines already began an inspection process when the FAA decided to make it
mandatory. Alaska Airlines grounded two planes Thursday after problems were
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers should expect minor delays, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's far more important that we get these airplanes inspected,'' said Tom
McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator for certification. ``We want it done
right, and we want it done thorough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska, which has 34 MD-80 series planes in its fleet, grounded two of the
jetliners in Seattle and Portland, Ore., because metal shavings were found
around the jackscrews -- which drive the planes' horizontal stabilizers and
control the up-and-down direction of a plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Shavings indicate wear on a nut that travels along the screw.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal stabilizer, the jackscrew, nut, elevators and other
components that adjust the plane's up-and-down pitch have been the focus of the
Flight 261 investigation. The pilots reported trouble with the stabilizer and
struggled to control the plane for at least 30 minutes before it crashed into
the Pacific on Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A 2-foot section of the jackscrew was recovered from the wreckage, and metal
shavings found on it were determined to have come from the nut in the mechanism.
It is unclear whether the damage was a possible cause or an effect of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, the Navy recovered the nut.
</P>
<P>
	   The recovered nut will be sent to Washington for extensive laboratory
analysis -- as was the jackscrew assembly. The entire horizontal stabilizer
assemblies from the two grounded Alaska jets will also be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also announced the Navy had recovered additional pieces
of wreckage from Flight 261 -- including a 12-by-7 foot section of the vertical
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska has 34 MD-80 planes and 31 have been inspected, spokeswoman Heather
Hiestand said. Of those, 26 were cleared and returned to service. The other five
include the two that were grounded and three that are temporarily out of service
while undergoing routine maintenance not connected to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some airlines were not immediately disclosing the results of their
inspections, but Continental, Delta and Northwest -- with 377 jets to be
inspected -- said they had found no problems so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Alfred Boehm, who brought the Guinness Book of World
Records to the United States, died Sunday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Boehm published thousands of titles at Sterling Publishing Co., which he
founded in 1949. But his road to fame began in 1956 when he discovered a pile of
unsold books on the shelves of a Boston warehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Boehm traveled to London, and obtained the licensing rights to the Guinness
Book of Superlatives by offering a percentage of future book sales. Soon after,
the Guinness Book of World Records was born.
</P>
<P>
	   The original book had been founded by the Guinness Brewery in 1951 to settle
barroom arguments. Soon Sterling and Guinness were divvying up $1.7 million a
year from sales of hundreds of thousands of books and from licensing the name to
everything from museums to paper cups.
</P>
<P>
	   Boehm's success was so dramatic that more people knew Guinness for the book
than as a creamy Irish stout. After a series of legal fights in the 1980s,
Guinness bought back the license for its name for $8 million in 1989.
Steve Furness
</P>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Steve Furness, who became a starter on the Pittsburgh
Steelers' Steel Curtain defensive line in the mid-1970s, died Wednesday of a
heart attack. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
	   Furness played with the Steelers from 1972 to 1980 and replaced Ernie Holmes
on what is considered the best defensive line in NFL history: Holmes, ``Mean''
Joe Greene, L.C. Greenwood and Dwight White. He was a member of Super Bowl
championship teams in 1975, 1976, 1979 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Furness was drafted in the fifth round in 1972 by Steelers coach Chuck Noll.
He played nine seasons and started in 49 games, recording 32 career sacks,
including a career-high 8 1/2 sacks in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   After retiring, Furness was an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1983
to 1990 and a line coach for the Indianapolis Colts in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Furness returned to the Steelers in 1992, replacing Greene as a defensive
line coach on Bill Cowher's first staff.
Beau Jack
</P>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Beau Jack, who twice held the world lightweight title in the
1940s, died Wednesday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack became a professional fighter in Holyoke, Mass., in 1940 and moved to
New York in 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack turned into one of the most popular fighters at Madison Square Garden.
Jack still holds the Garden record for most main event fights, 21, including
three within a month in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack retired in 1955 with a record of 83-24-5 with 40 KOs.
Frederic Mather Lord
</P>
<P>
	   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Frederic Mather Lord, a mathematician who built
statistical models for college entrance testing, died Saturday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
	   Lord spent more than 30 years in educational testing and remains the
preeminent authority in the statistical theory of mental tests.
</P>
<P>
	   His work allowed students to take different tests yet obtain scores that
were comparable. His idea, called item response theory, made tests adaptive in
that they became more or less difficult depending on the ability of the students
taking the tests.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1944 he began a long career with Educational Testing Service where he
remained until his retirement in 1982.
Ida Peterfy
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sister Ida Peterfy, who founded an order of nuns that
survived under Nazi and Communist rule and became one of the first in the United
States to relinquish the traditional habit, died Tuesday. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterfy was born in Hungary, where she founded the religious education order
in 1940. During World War II she helped hide several Jewish families from the
Nazis. When Communists took control after the war, she kept the order together
under the cover of a secretarial school.
</P>
<P>
	   The order 's eschewing of traditional garb was controversial when it arrived
in Los Angeles in 1956. Cardinal James McIntyre, then head of the Los Angeles
Roman Catholic Archdiocese, urged Peterfy to retain the policy.
Arthur Seelen
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Arthur Seelen, a former actor who owned the nation's oldest
performing-arts bookstore, died Monday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1958 Seelen bought the Drama Book Shop in Manhattan from Marjorie
Seligman, who founded the store in 1923. He ran the business with his wife,
Rozanne.
</P>
<P>
	   A meeting ground for actors, playwrights, directors and others, the Drama
Book Shop has 40,000 titles, including plays, biographies and theatrical
histories. A bulletin board at the entrance informs aspiring performers about
work opportunities in and out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
	   He continued his theater career in New York, appearing in children's theater
on Broadway, and as an understudy in ``The Wall'' in 1960.
Wilfred Cantwell Smith
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Wilfred Cantwell Smith, a scholar of comparative religion
and leading proponent of interfaith dialogue, died Monday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith promoted religious understanding in some of the dozen books he wrote,
including ``The Meaning and End of Religion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ordained as a Presbyterian minister, Smith taught in India and later
established the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University in Montreal,
where he taught from 1949-63. He recruited Muslim scholars to participate in
research formerly carried out primarily by Westerners.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1964, he became director of Harvard's world religions center, then moved
to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1973 to establish the comparative religion
department at Dalhousie University.

</P>
<P>
	   Varney also was the voice of Slinky Dog in ``Toy Story'' and ``Toy Story

</P>
<P>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Andrzej Zakrzewski, a former Solidarity activist who
served as a key aide in former President Lech Walesa's first post-communist
administration, died Thursday from an undisclosed illness. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
	   As culture minister since March, Zakrzewski prepared new copyright laws
intended to improve protection of authors and producers in line with Western
standards and has fought for lower taxes on books to increase readership.
</P>

Airlines Ordered To Inspect Planes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The government is requiring airlines to inspect the
tails of MD-80 series jetliners and related planes for damage similar to what
was discovered in the wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. About 1,100 jets
in the United States -- all MD-80s, MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s -- will be
covered by an order that was being drafted late today by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The airlines will have two to three days to comply. Passengers
should expect minor delays, the FAA said. "It's far more important that we get
these airplanes inspected," said Tom McSweeny, the FAA's associate administrator
for certification.

Economy Should Continue Expansion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion, already the longest in
the nation's history, should keep going this year and beyond even though a
recent surge in productivity may not last, the Clinton administration said
today. The administration used this year's 432-page "Economic Report of the
President" to take part of the credit for the good times, with unemployment and
inflation both at 30-year lows and consumer confidence at record highs. While
praising the Federal Reserve for pursuing an astute monetary policy, the
economic report said the administration deserved credit for making the tough
choices to eliminate the soaring government deficits it had inherited.

McCain Mixes Reform, Fund Raising
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the campaign trail where he decries the Washington
money chase, Sen. John McCain beamed his image into the ballroom of a capital
hotel where corporate lobbyists helped raise as much as $500,000 for his
presidential bid. They are the same lobbyists who press McCain's Senate Commerce
Committee to act on legislation that affects their corporate clients -- AT&AMP;T,
United Airlines and other giants. McCain, who is running on a pledge to change
the way campaigns are financed, finds himself having to use the system he
criticizes in order to fund his presidential bid. His Washington fund-raiser
today -- where tickets went for $500 and $1,000 -- was the centerpiece of a
one-day series of events expected to bring in as much as $500,000.

Internet Cos. To Strengthen Systems
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unnerved by a rash of hacker attacks on the world's leading
Web sites, big Internet companies rushed to strengthen their computer systems
today in a high-tech game of cat-and-mouse with the phantom perpetrators. Taking
advantage of an apparent lull in major disruptions, big Web companies and
government agencies stepped up training of technicians in detecting unusual
activity. Others installed advanced software filters to detect and block
delivery of suspicious electronic data. No major new outages surfaced on today,
though related disruptions emerged after the three-day spree that briefly downed
the popular Yahoo! destination and others.

Mistrial Sought in Tobacco Case

	   MIAMI (AP) -- A black attorney for the tobacco industry today accused a
smokers' attorney of "blatant racial pandering" to a six-member jury with four
blacks, and asked for a mistrial in the 19-month case. Stanley Rosenblatt,
attorney for smokers in a massive class-action trial, said he was "just stunned
and highly insulted" by the charge from Brown &AMP; Williamson attorney Andrew
Upshaw. Circuit Judge Robert Kaye called for an end to animosities and took the
mistrial motion under advisement along with several other motions.

'Millionaire' Questions Prompt Lawsuit

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that insures ABC's hit game show, "Who Wants to

questions are too easy and they're at risk of paying out too much prize money.
ABC says viewers shouldn't worry about the legal fight -- they're planning no
changes to the show. The London-based insurance underwriters Goshawk Syndicate
filed suit in Britain's High Court of Justice on Jan. 24 against the show's

piece of the deal came when Griffey agreed to a nine-year contract worth $116.5
million, the richest package in baseball history. The pact covers from 2000-09,
and the Reds even have an option for a 10th season. Reds pitcher Brett Tomko and
outfielder Mike Cameron were sent to Seattle along with a pair of minor
leaguers.

<HEADLINE> Former Chavez Ally: Govt. Is Corrupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A growing division in President Hugo Chavez's
political coalition deepened Thursday when a fellow former coup leader charged
that Chavez's first year in government has been marked by corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, who resigned recently as the head of the
political police, delivered evidence to the national prosecutor's office of what
he said were 46 cases of corruption he uncovered in the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations were the latest attack against Chavez and his inner circle
by three of the former officers who helped him stage the failed 1992 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The three charge that Chavez's so-called ``peaceful revolution'' -- a
radical reform program whose professed goal is to clean up rampant corruption in
the oil-rich South American nation -- is losing direction.
</P>
<P>
	   But some analysts also think the feud is part of a power struggle, since the
fellow coup leaders may feel sidelined now that Chavez is president.
</P>
<P>
	   Urdaneta said he advised Chavez of most of the allegations during the last
year. He charged that he was forced out of his post three weeks ago because
Chavez wanted the investigations stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have been firing accusations at one another for the last week,
raising the specter of a major division in Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole
coalition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ship Not Seen as a Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's acquisition of a Russian-built destroyer is not
expected to pose a significant threat to the U.S. military presence in Asia, the
State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While clearly improving China's naval capabilities, it is fair to say the
appearance of one additional modern warship will not fundamentally alter the
regional balance of power, spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Taiwanese defense expert said Wednesday U.S. ships that have protected
Taiwan could be threatened by the delivery of the Sovremenny-class destroyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Cheng-yi, a researcher at the state-run Academia Sinica research center
in Taipei, said the 8,000-ton destroyer, equipped with SSN22 anti-ship missiles,
would threaten Taiwanese ships as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The warship was one of two that China ordered from Russia in 1997, in a $1
billion deal. The second ship will be delivered later this year, Russian
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the United States has been closely monitoring Russian sales of
military equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to either minimize the potential threat nor exaggerate that
threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have made clear their concerns to China on military issues
military developments, including its missile deployments and their influence on
the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We retain and continue to have a strong interest in the maintenance of
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,'' he added. ``That is why we have
approved defensive arm sales to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act and consistent with the various communiques.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Taipei, an official said China's acquisition of the destroyers could
increase regional tension.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the government Mainland Affairs Council,
also said it would be unwise for Beijing to seek to use violence to resolve its
problems with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Student surrenders after taking teacher hostage at private school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WESTAMPTON, N.J. (AP) - A student at a private school for emotionally
disturbed youngsters held a teacher's aide hostage for three hours Thursday
before surrendering peacefully. Authorities said the incident stemmed from a
fight with a classmate over cigarettes.
<P>
	   The teacher's aide convinced the student, Jonothan Fischer, to hold him
instead of the student he had taken captive.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer, 18, of Pennsauken, was arrested on kidnapping, aggravated assault,
criminal restraint and weapons charges. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident began shortly before 10:30 a.m. in a bathroom at the private
Hampton Academy when Fischer tried to bum a cigarette from another student, said
Burlington County Prosecutor Robert D. Bernardi.
</P>
<P>
	   "The scenario apparently was triggered off over the situation with the
cigarette," Bernardi said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer has been a student for several years at the school for youngsters
with learning and behavioral problems, but officials declined comment on what
prompted his placement there. Pennsauken police reported having three contacts
with Fischer: twice when he was reported missing and once when he reported
receiving harassing phone calls.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Bernardi, Fischer put a gun to the student's head when the
student refused to give him a cigarette. A teacher's aide, a man in his 30s,
intervened and exchanged himself for the hostage, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aide was not threatened, although Fischer was armed with a .22 caliber
semiautomatic loaded handgun, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aide, Patrick Spain, told KYW-TV in Philadelphia that he knew Fischer
"and I just felt I could sit down and talk to him and it could end peacefully."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was getting to a point where I didn't feel I was in danger," he said. "I
felt that maybe he was in danger. I took the weapon. I hugged him, he was
crying."
</P>
<P>
	   Spain, who said he worked with troubled soldiers when he was in the Army,
said before police officers came into the room, he checked Fischer's coat
pockets to make sure he didn't have another weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was laying on the floor, crying and I hugged him again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernardi said the school is not equipped with metal detectors. The weapon
used was stolen several days ago from a Burlington County gun shop, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know how the weapon got into the school," Bernardi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hampton Academy Executive Director Bernard Shapiro read a three-paragraph
statement at the news conference calling the incident "a very difficult
situation." He refused to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   The school is located on Burrs Road near Route 541, about a mile west of
Mount Holly, the county seat, located 15 miles east of Philadelphia. It is a
subsidiary of nearby Hampton Hospital, which treats people with drug, alcohol
and psychiatric problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're not retarded or anything, they're just bad," said Johnnie Lewis,
40, of Browns Mills, whose husband is a maintenance mechanic at the school. Mrs.
Lewis rushed to the scene after learning about the hostage drama.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hostage-taking, another teacher's aide pulled a fire alarm,
summoning police and rescue personnel to the school, where faculty were already
evacuating the other students and staff. About 80 students attend the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officers, including a SWAT team, surrounded the one-story
brown school building and began negotiating with Fischer, Bernardi said. The
teen's father was also brought to the scene, but did not speak with him.
</P>
<P>
	   The Burlington County Tactical Team passed cell phones and police radios
through a bathroom window to establish contact with the student. Negotiations
followed with the teen.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer at one point demanded a cigarette and then offered to exchange the
aide for a cell phone, Bernardi said. He was given a single cigarette,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernardi said the teen eventually agreed to turn the gun over to the
teacher's aide. The aide, who asked that his name not be disclosed to reporters,
walked alone from the school and the student followed shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer is a suspect in the gun shop burglary and will likely be charged in
that incident along with at least one other suspect, Bernardi said. Two Glock
semiautomatic handguns are still missing from that burglary, he said.

<HEADLINE> Louisville 82, No. 4 Syracuse 69  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE BAILEY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tony Williams scored 20 points and Marques Maybin
added 16 as Louisville handed No. 4 Syracuse its second straight loss, 82-69 on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was Louisville's fourth over a ranked opponent. Top-ranked
Cincinnati is the only ranked team to beat the Cardinals (13-9) this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Hart scored 16 points to lead the Orangemen (19-2), who lost for the
second time this week after opening the season with 19 straight wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville shot 58 percent from the field and got outrebounded by only one,
36-35, by the much taller and more physical Orangemen. The Cardinals also dished
out 22 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse shot only 43 percent, making 5 of 19 3-pointers and only 8 of 17
free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams added eight rebounds and four assists for the Cardinals, and
freshman point guard Reece Gaines had 10 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Etan Thomas had 12 points and nine rebounds and Ryan Blackwell added 10
points and nine rebounds for the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville led 64-52 with 10 minutes to play. An 8-0 Syracuse run, capped by
a thunderous dunk by Thomas, cut the margin to four points with 5:26 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But a 3-pointer by Gaines and a jumper by Dion Edward put the Cardinals back
up by nine and dashed any hopes of a Syracuse comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville hit five of six free throws over the final 1:30 to preserve the
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading 32-24, a putback by Williams and a layup by Gaines forced a Syracuse
timeout with 6:53 to play in the first half. Johnson's three-point play with 53
seconds remaining gave the Cardinals a 46-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville shot 61 percent in the first half, hitting five of eight from
3-point range.

<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jason Woolley scored on a deflection with 51.8
seconds left in overtime to lead the Buffalo Sabres to a 2-1 victory over the
Nashville Predators on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Woolley redirected Miroslav Satan's wrist shot from the right point past
Predators goalie Tomas Vokoun. Seven of Woolley's 40 career goals have been
game-winners.
</P>
<P>
	   Vaclav Varada also scored for the Sabres, who got 27 saves from Dominik
Hasek.
</P>
<P>
	   Ville Peltonen scored for the Predators, who missed a scoring chance in
overtime when Drake Berehowsky's shot hit the post on a power-play.
</P>
<P>
	   Varada got the game's first goal at 11:50 of the second period when he fired
a hard wrist shot from between the circles past Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
	   Peltonen tied it 1-1 just 1:07 later to snap a personal 32-game goal
drought. Peltonen took Scott Walker's backhand pass, stickhandled around Hasek
and beat him with a backhander in close.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo's Vladimir Tsyplakov hit the post on a 4-on-2 near the end of the
second. In the third, Hasek stopped Vitali Yachmenev on a slap shot from
point-blank range with 6:20 left and Bill Houlder from the right point moments
later.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasek, who returned last week after missing 40 games with a groin injury,
appeared in just his 12th game, but second in three nights. The five-time Vezina
Trophy winner hasn't played less than 58 games in a full season since 1992-93,
his first year with the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville's Cliff Ronning banged a shot off the right post in the scoreless
first period.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Accuses Mayor on Letters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday accused Senate
rival Rudolph Giuliani of running a campaign based on insults and demanded he
make public the fund-raising letters he has sent out for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of New York's Conservative Party called on Richard
Viguerie, a guru of conservative direct-mail fund raising, to drop Giuliani as a
client.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not a conservative,'' Michael Long wrote Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Long was the latest sign that the small, but politically
important party would shun Giuliani. Since 1974, no New York Republican has won
a statewide race without also having Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second straight day, the first lady criticized the New York City mayor
for sending out a fund-raising letter to conservatives that accused her of
harboring ``hostility toward America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is wrong to use religion as a political weapon and he should
know that,'' Clinton said outside the Ann Street Restaurant &AMP; Deli in Little
Falls, about 60 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Clinton's own fund-raising letters, The Associated Press learned
Thursday that she asked for contributions from organizations that include the
Democratic Socialists of America.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters were mailed to individuals whose names appeared on lists of
potential donors operated by San Francisco-based Names in the News, a broker
that specializes in renting such lists to campaigns and other groups seeking to
raise funds through direct mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Anstrand, the CEO of Names in the News, said Clinton's letters went to
groups including the Democratic Socialists, the Nicaragua Cultural Alliance,
U.S. Friends of Nicaragua, Colorado Model Liberals and Liberal Congressional
Donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said the groups represent the far
left. But Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady's fund-raising
appeals had little in common with Giuliani's letters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mayor's ads are vitriolic, are negative and in the latest ad, question
Hillary Clinton's commitment to America's religious traditions,'' said Wolfson.
``There's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she wanted the mayor to release all his fund-raising letters
because, ``I would like the people of New York to know there's a big difference
between the kind of campaigns we're running. I intend to run a campaign based on
issues and ideas, not on insults.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he had on Wednesday, Giuliani continued to laugh off the Clinton attack.
The mayor said Thursday he would make public his fund-raising letters only if
Clinton reimbursed the federal government for the full cost of her travel on
government airplanes during her campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they make out the check, we'll make the letters available,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has said it has reimbursed the government what it is
required to.
</P>
<P>
	   Also taking Giuliani to task for sending out his fund-raising letter was the
head of the Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am frightened by the specter of a New York senatorial campaign that
turns religion into a political football,'' the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive
director of the 100,000-member organization, wrote in a letter to both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton obviously intended to stay on the attack, she did end up
giving the mayor faint praise when a reporter asked whether he might be taking
too much credit for the crime rate reduction in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's been a good partnership and a good team and I give full
credit to the mayors of all the cities, including New York, who have used the
tools at our disposal, who have worked with the federal government and
particularly with the president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said the improving economy, her husband the president and the
Congress -- and Giuliani's first police commissioner, William Bratton, whom the
mayor fired -- should also share in the credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton said she was ``very grateful'' that Giuliani helped
lobby for President Clinton's Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994 aimed at putting an
extra 100,000 police officers on the streets. The mayor's support for the
president had been criticized at the time by some Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to give credit where credit is due,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Suns 101, Timberwolves 85  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns forced Kevin Garnett into a 5-for-21
shooting night and handed the Minnesota Timberwolves their second blowout loss
in as many nights, 101-85 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett scored 10 points to barely keep alive his double-figure scoring
streak at 176 games, the longest currently in the NBA. He didn't reach double
figures until 5:05 remained in the game and left for good shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns, who go into the All-Star break on a three-game winning streak, had
six players in double figures, including all five starters.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Kidd and Cliff Robinson scored 16 apiece. Luc Longley had 14 points
and a season-high 12 rebounds, while Penny Hardaway and Shawn Marion added 12
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Mitchell scored 16 for Minnesota, which shot just 38 percent compared
with the Suns' 49 percent. Malik Sealy scored 11, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves, beaten by the Lakers by 31 points Wednesday night in Los
Angeles, were down in a hurry against Phoenix, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns used a second-quarter blitz to build a 22-point lead and were up
59-39 at the half. Phoenix started the third quarter with a 10-2 run to go up
82-43 on Kidd's 15-footer with 7:12 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota cut the lead to 15 after both teams emptied their bench in the
final minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns outscored the Timberwolves 30-6 during an 8 1/2-minute span in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The onslaught began when Phoenix made the last two baskets of the first
quarter to go ahead 27-25 and didn't end until Robinson's two free throws made
it 53-31 with 3:59 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Marion, in his second game back after missing 31 while recovering from
arthroscopic knee surgery, scored 10 during the surge, including a one-handed
tomahawk jam and a two-handed stuff on the fast-break. In just eight minutes on
the court in the first half, Marion was 4-for-5 from the field and grabbed five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett, guarded tightly usually by Robinson and double-teamed almost every
time he got the ball in the post, was 2-for-9 for four points in the first half.
He had

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged in Alleged Check Scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSBURG, W. Va. (AP) -- In this small West Virginia town where Bank One
tellers see the same faces all the time, Kimberly Felicetty turned heads with
her auburn hair, stylish clothes and relaxed, chatty manner.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say Felicetty used her poise and good looks as a participant
in a bad-check scheme that defrauded banks in five states of at least $1
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was very personable, very confident,'' Albert Cox, vice president of
Bank One's Clarksburg branch, said Wednesday. ``She talked about her husband and
dropped names. She was not nervous, not hurried. She was slick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Felicetty at a walk-up window Feb. 4, then found her two
alleged partners in a car around the corner. Felicetty, 29, of Pittsburgh, was
charged with passing bad checks. She was jailed along with Jeri Lyn Erb, 48, of
Wilkinsburg, Pa., who faces the same charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say the women are believed to have been working for Craig Stevens,
39, also of Wilkinsburg. Stevens was jailed on charges of engaging in fraudulent
schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Ron Alonso said the two women and possibly others used fake IDs created
with stolen customer account numbers and security information to cash genuine
checks from defunct businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Between Jan. 19 and Jan. 23, the three allegedly passed more than 15 checks
at banks in Clarksburg and four other West Virginia towns.
</P>
<P>
	   The scam apparently originated in Pennsylvania then moved into Ohio, New
Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   During a court appearance, the defendants said they could not afford lawyers
and would need a court-appointed attorney.

<HEADLINE> Gay Group Backs Marriage Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A proposed same-sex marriage ban on California's
March ballot is drawing some unexpected support from a small group of gay men
and women.
</P>
<P>
	   The Proposition 22 campaign on Thursday announced formation of a coalition
called ``Gays for 22.''
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative states that the only valid marriages in California are those
between men and women. California already withholds legal recognition from gay
marriages performed in the state. The proposition is aimed at blocking the state
from recognizing gay marriages performed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the new coalition said they back the initiative because they
believe Californians should make their own decisions about what marriages are
legally recognized.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the initiative said the coalition members are naive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is part of a much larger organized campaign across the country to
roll back protections of gay and lesbian people,'' said Laurie McBride of the No
on 22 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Beddingfield, 24, a gay political consultant from San Jose and coalition
chairman, said he has been seeking other gays who share his support for the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an anti-gay initiative,'' Beddingfield said. ``California needs
to be protected from other state judges redefining our law for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how many people were part of the coalition, he said there were about
50 statewide.

<HEADLINE> WR Tim Brown Stays With Raiders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Wide receiver Tim Brown passed up a chance at free
agency and instead will remain with the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was signed to a new contract, Raiders coach Jon Gruden said Thursday.
Terms of the pact were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raiders also re-signed Greg Biekert, the team's leading tackler last
season, and guard Steve Wisniewski as well as backup quarterback Bobby Hoying.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, the Raiders all-time leading receiver, could have exercised a clause
in his contract allowing him to become a free agent and for a time it appeared
he would.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as two weeks ago, Brown said he felt unappreciated in Oakland
and complained he never got so much as a pat on the back from Raiders managing
general partner Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown also criticized Davis for failing to resolve stadium issues that cloud
the team's future in Oakland, saying a resolution is needed both for the
players' peace of mind and to foster the bond between the community and the
club, which hasn't had a sellout in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Brown, who begins his 13th season next year after joining
Oakland as a first-round pick in 1988, ultimately decided to remain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gruden declined to address Brown's criticisms,, but added he wasn't
surprised Brown decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't listen to any of the radio broadcasts nor did I read many of the
articles," Gruden said. "Tim Brown is a guy that wants to be with this
organization. He's a very loyal person and loyalty is a two-way street, the
organization to the player and the player to the organization. Tim called me
yesterday and told me he wanted to stay with the Raiders. The rest was easy."
</P>
<P>
	   The re-signing of Biekert, Oakland's defensive captain, and Wisniewski, who
like Brown declined to trigger a free agency rider in his contract, also were
critical to the Raiders, who went 8-8 under Gruden for the second straight
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very confident in the direction the team is going, and obviously to
have three of your team captains avoid free agency and stay, I think that says
enough about where we're heading," Gruden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raiders also released four players Thursday -- cornerback Darrien
Gordon, strong safety Anthony Newman, linebacker Richard Harvey and tight end
Derrick Walker.

<HEADLINE> Community Revisits 1919 Race Riot  </HEADLINE>
   By PEGGY HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELENA, Ark. (AP) -- Historians and community residents opened a two-day
discussion Thursday of a 1919 race riot that they hope will resolve some hard
feelings among blacks and whites in this Mississippi Delta region.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants are revisiting the day -- Sept. 30, 1919, near Elaine -- when a
white deputy was killed and white posses from Arkansas and Mississippi
apparently took revenge on blacks, killing anywhere from 20 to 200 or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, race relations in Phillips County are particularly strained. The
West Helena mayor's office and city council are divided along race lines, and
last year's organizers of a popular Blues Festival at Helena were criticized by
a former state lawmaker, who's black, as being racist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Crabb of the Phillips County Historical Society said the meeting was
not organized in response to current disputes but has been in the works for
about two years.
</P>
<P>
	   About 220 people gathered at an old movie house Thursday night for the
conference. They viewed a documentary on the Elaine race riot, heard an overview
on racial violence in Arkansas and listened to recollections from people who
grew up in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe this meeting will bring about a little more closeness and people
will understand blacks and whites are due justice,'' said Ora Quarles, whose
father was a lawyer for blacks arrested in the riots.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkansas isn't the only state trying to confront past violence. The state of
Oklahoma is debating what reparations, if any, it should award those who
survived a 1921 race riot at Tulsa. Historians say between 100 and 300 people
were killed in that riot and more than 10,000 were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   No one in Arkansas is leading an effort for reparations. Historians say so
much conflicting information surrounds the race riots at Elaine that the
conference will serve as a helpful beginning step toward figuring out exactly
what happened 80 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Motorcade Held Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's motorcade was delayed for about
a half hour Thursday afternoon after three people were shot on a street near Los
Angeles County USC-Medical Center, where the Democratic presidential candidate
was campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was promoting his health care proposal at the hospital when the
shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   According to police, three people were shot near a fast-food restaurant a
few streets away from the Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The gunfire erupted just before Gore was to leave the hospital, and neither
he nor anyone else in his motorcade was ever in any danger, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It did not impact the motorcade procession for Vice President Al Gore. It
did not have any major impact on his departure,'' said police Sgt. Wayne
Guillary.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, who were not identified, were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were investigating, but did not know if the shooting was a drive-by
attack or gang-related. No one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Guillary said the Secret Service, Los Angeles police and other officials
``just wanted to make sure all was clear'' in holding up the motorcade.
