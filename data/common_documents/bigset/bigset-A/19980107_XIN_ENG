<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- German Sven Hannawald won the
Four Hills ski jumping competition in Bischofshofen, Austria on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hannawald jumped 124 meters and 123m with his two efforts to
finish first with 247.6 points.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Hansjorg Jaekle was a surprise second on 235.2
points after jumps of 119.5 and 122 with Finland's Janne Ahonen
third on 232.7 points (118/121).
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kazuyoshi Funaki was attempting to become the first man
in history to win each of the Four Hills competitions, but
finished well down after a disappointing second jump. The
22-year-old had a final points tally of 218.9.
</P>
<P>
Funaki had the satisfaction of becoming the first Japanese
jumper to carry off the overall Four Hills title after his wins in
Germany at Obersdorf on December 29 and Garmisch-Partenkirchen on
New Year's Day, and in Austria at Innsbruck on January 4.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Top Leader Vows to Continue Renovation Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Communist Party chief
Le Kha Phieu said the only chance for Vietnam to develop is the
continuation of its renovation policy "along the socialist line."
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu, elected the party general secretary in December
last year, made the remarks in an interview published Tuesday by
the Vietnam news agency.
</P>
<P>
"The latest changes in the highest level of the party hierarchy
were effected with a high degree of unanimity by the central
committee and completely suited to the party's valuable tradition
of renovation, continuation and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu said Vietnam's achievements have proven the
correctness of the economic policy adopted by the party.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Vietnam is still facing many
difficulties on the road of development, and that the fourth
plenum of the Communist Party gave priority to the need to enhance
self-sovereignty and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Le Kha Phieu said, the Vietnamese government
"advocated global and regional integration at an early date,"
fully aware of the opportunities and challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
The fourth plenum of the party reiterated the country's resolve
to participate in the global and regional integration, while
stressing the necessity to preserve the national character and
protect the national interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only enhanced self-sovereignty and self-reliance can ensure
efficiency in integration and secure good conditions for the
national construction and development," said the party chief.

<HEADLINE> UK Medium-Sized Firms Plagued By Shortage of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Half of firms in the
mid-corporate market in Britain are finding it difficult to
recruit skilled workers, according to a survey released on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This situation is fueling fears that the profits of
medium-sized firms will suffer a severe downturn this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on a sample of 2000 firms, shows that they
are already in the throes of the biggest profits squeeze since the
last recession.
</P>
<P>
One in five firms is being forced to cut prices to compete
against cheap foreign imports and domestic rivals.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly acknowledged here that the skills shortage will
erode profits further as businesses are forced to pay higher wages
to attract competent staff.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of medium-sized businesses took on new workers
over the past six months, the largest rise for five years.
</P>
<P>
Employment agencies say the biggest shortages are in
computer-literate office staff, electronics and telecommunications
workers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported almost half of firms in Britain are now
operating at full capacity, the highest since the survey began in
1992.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls for Stronger British-Zambian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
today spoke highly of Britain's continued assistance to Zambia
and called for stronger Anglo-Zambian ties, the Zambia News
Agency ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Receiving in the State House credentials from Thomas Young,
new British high commissioner to Zambia, Chiluba noted that
Zambia has been receiving British support in the balance of
payment and other economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his government will continue working together
with its British counterpart to realize sustainable development
in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Strong economic foundation has been set up in Zambia, Chiluba
noted, without which real development for the nation is
impossible.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program is on its course, said the
president, adding that the government will continue with the
process of dialogue with the opposition parties as part of the
country's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the meeting, Young, the British high commissioner
said that the British government attaches great importance to the
close and warm relations existing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged ties of brotherhood and the common understanding
should be used for the benefit of Africa and the world at large,
Young added.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy stressed Britain's respects for Zambia's
rule of law and sovereignty in line with the United Nations
Charter.
</P>
<P>
This is an apparent response to the recent strong accusations
made by the Zambian government that Britain and the U.S. as well
as some other countries are interfering with Zambia's internal
affairs concerning the continued detention of former president
Kenneth Kaunda, who is allegedly connected with the country's
abortive military coup last October.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. expressed deep concern after Kaunda was
arrested last December and asked the Zambian government either to
release him or to charge him immediately.

KATHMANDU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister
Rabindra Nath Sharma said Tuesday that the government introduced
the value added tax (VAT) because it will do away with aberrations
and anomalies in the existing tax system.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a discussion program on the VAT held in Morang
District of eastern Nepal, the finance minister said that as a
scientific accounting system characterized by transparency, the
VAT will be of concrete help in running business and industry
through healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
There should be cooperation between businesses, industry and
the bureaucracy to make the VAT a success, the official RSS news
agency quoted Sharma as saying.
</P>
<P>
He assured his audience that octroi would be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government formally introduced the VAT on November
16, 1997 despite strong opposition from the business community.
</P>
<P>
Sharma has defended the VAT on several occasions since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Banks may call in up to 19.2
billion U.S. dollars of loans from small firms that fail to
prepare for the millennium computer bug, said British business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
More than a million companies, a quarter of the small business
community, could find lending facilities withdrawn or curtailed,
according to the Federation of Small Businesses.
</P>
<P>
The British government last week urged small businesses to take
measures to the millennium bug. It sets to head a taskforce to
alert firms to the dangers.
</P>
<P>
A research by leading factoring company Alex Lawrie shows that
more than 80 per cent of small businesses have done nothing to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
The bug is a threat because many computers cannot recognize the
digits 00 as the start of a new century. Experts believe it will
send systems haywire.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses
estimates that unless firms are ready for 2000 by the end of this
year, in 1999 the banks may withdraw up to a third of the 56
billion U.S. dollars of loans outstanding.

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Virus Detected in Disease Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus
has so far been confirmed as one of the causes of the mysterious
disease outbreak in north-eastern Kenya which has killed at least
300 people, according to a press release issued here on Tuesday by
the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
RVF may not be the only cause of the 300 deaths observed in the
current disease outbreak as some other cases have shown no
evidence of RVF infection, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Because the population affected is undernourished and subject
to various diseases, particularly those associated with a lack of
clean drinking water and of health services, WHO pointed out,
other severe diseases that normally occur in the area, such as
shigellosis and malaria, may partially explain the large number of
deaths in the region.
</P>
<P>
RVF virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and many different
species can serve as vectors, WHO explained. Humans can also be
infected by contact with blood or body fluids from infected
animals which may occur during slaughtering of the animals or
handling of aborted foetuses.
</P>
<P>
The risk of human-to-human infection through direct contact
appears to be very low, WHO said.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Protestant Extremists Refuse to Back Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Protestant
leaders held an emergence meeting with jailed pro-British
extremists in Northern Ireland today but failed to get their
support for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the inmates of Ulster Defense Association
(UDA) and Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) in the Maze prison refused
at the meeting to back the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP),
the loyalist guerrilla groups' political arm, said after the talks
that he wanted the peace process to continue and talks with UFF
leaders were planned.
</P>
<P>
"We owe a responsibility to try and ensure that there remains
to be a commitment to this process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Loyalist sources said the prisoners' decision is not a signal
that they want the ceasefire to end, but politicians regard it as
a worrying development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam held a second
day of separate meetings with major political parties in the
province, including Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army (IRA), and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
chief advocate of British rule.
</P>
<P>
She said rival political parties do not want a return to the
dark days of sectarian warfare and are determined to make progress
in the round-table talks due to resume next week.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, responding to the Unionists's
refusal to talks with anti-British republicans, said the Unionists
are trying to assert a veto in the Northern Ireland peace talks
and have left a vacuum filled by loyalist killings.
</P>
<P>
Tension has risen in the British-ruled province after a
guerrilla flare-up claimed three lives in a week and plunged hopes
of an early political agreement into gloom.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. factory orders went
up a 2.5 percent in November, mainly due to demand for commercial
aircraft and parts, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The gain to a seasonally adjusted 345.1 billion U.S. dollars,
the sixth consecutive monthly growth, was the largest in 14
months, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders alone shot up 21 percent, almost entirely
due to demand for aircraft and parts. It was the largest growth
since July 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the transportation sector, orders fell 0.3
percent in November, the second decline in a row.
</P>
<P>
In November, orders for durable goods, expensive items which

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Complete for Gas-Saving Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. car makers are completing
for energy saving vehicles, which may kindle a revolutionary
change in engine technology.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., the country's No. 3 automaker, unveiled plans
today to make its popular sports vehicles as fuel-efficient as
cars.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. said Sunday and Ford announced Monday that
they would be ready to produce a hybrid-electric vehicles by 2001
and fuel cell cars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the industry is locked in a brutal race to
develop the technology to replace the internal-combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler will reduce the polluting emissions in its Jeep
Wranglers, Cherokees and Grand Cherokees beginning with the 1999
model year, it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The company is also developing a hybrid car that would run 70
miles per gallon, cost the same as a conventional car and be ready
for production as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid car uses a small battery to power the car's
accessories and boost the engine during hard acceleration, but
otherwise runs on a diesel engine.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius hybrid electric-and-gasoline car,
which gets an estimated 66 miles a gallon and went on sale in
Japan last month.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the auto industry will also affect many
industries, according to analysts. So-called energy stations will
replace many gasoline stations. They are also pushing the oil
industry to cut the sulfur content of gasoline in the U.S. to help
them further reduce vehicle emissions.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Become S. Africa's Major Trade Partner: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Spain is gearing to become
one of the South Africa's biggest economic partners in Europe,
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a Spanish diplomat
as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
"Spain has the determination and capacity to increase its
economic relations with South Africa in numerous fields, such as
the automotive industry, energy, tourism, defense, transfer of
technology and last but not least, the fishing industry," Spanish
ambassador Miguel Carriedo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Spain is trying to win the South African defense tender valued
at more than 7.5 billion Rand (1.6 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Trade with South Africa currently accounts for only one
percent of Spanish exports and two percent of imports. There are
no bilateral investments of importance.
</P>
<P>
Spanish fishing experts visited South Africa in November last
year on a fact-finding tour of the local fishing industry. The
information would be evaluated following which an agreement of
cooperation would be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would include technical and financial assistance
regarding fishing techniques, ship building, international
marketing, processing and freezing techniques and the
construction of fish processing plants valued at more than 61
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Spain had initiated a 35 million Rand (7.1 million U.S.
Dollars) project aimed at developing the South African tourism
industry into one of the country's major foreign exchanges
earners and job providers, Spanish counsellor to South Africa Jos
Pasqual Marco said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Approves Iraqi Food Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had approved Iraq's distribution plan of food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies on Monday night, the Office of the
Spokesman for the Secretary-General announced today.
</P>
<P>
The distribution plan for phase three under the oil-for-food
program was approved last night, and the Secretary-General
had informed the president of the Security Council as well as
the Iraqi Government about the approval, the spokesman's office
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq, which has been under UN
economic sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in 1990, is allowed to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy
necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, first implemented in December, 1996, was
renewed last month for the third time. But Iraq said it would
not export any oil until the UN chief approved the food
distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said on Tuesday in
Baghdad that Iraq would export oil under its oil-for-food deal
with the United Nations two days after approval of the
distribution plan by the UN Secretary-General.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Changes Force Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Another Nigerian general has been
named as force commander of the west African peace-keeping force
known as ECOMOG to replace Major-General Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Major-General Timothy Shelpidi, the defense
Chief of Training, Operations and Plans (CTOP) in Nigeria, will
take effect this Thursday, according to the defense headquarters
today.
</P>
<P>
Malu, who will soon return from Liberia, has been equally
appointed as the general officer commanding (GOC) 2 mechanized
division of the Nigerian army stationed in Ibadan, one of the
biggest cities in the west.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi was a principal staff officer in the presidency
between 1990 and 1993. He was also a GOC 82 division of the
Nigerian army before he became CTOP, reportedly the number two
person in the defense headquarters, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new CTOP has not been named, neither did the authorities
make known the appointment of the ECOMOG chief.
</P>
<P>
However, defense spokesman Col. Godwin Ugbo described the
appointment as "purely military affair" when asked about whether
it had anything to do with the apparent cold relations between
Malu and Liberian President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The two men reportedly disagreed on whether ECOMOG would
involve in the restructuring of Liberia's post-war armed forces
as mandated by the 1996 Abuja peace accord, which brought an end
to the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Liberian government has begun
preparations for the restructuring by itself, although the ECOMOG
operations in that country has not been "dismantled" by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) high command.
</P>
<P>
As the first step of a phased pullout plan, 1,205 ECOMOG
officers and soldiers had been pulled out of Monrovia two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some of them have been redeployed to Sierra Leone
to join in the full operation there.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now still has six battalions in Liberia whereas Ghana
has two, he said, adding, "when the orders come to move finally,
we will move."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dollar to Slide Further: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Dollar which
depreciated 23 percent last year will fall further by an
estimated 20 percent this year, economic commentators predicted
today.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Dollar which plunged to an all time low
last year against major currencies under immense pressure from
high import demand would remain under the same pressure this
year.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. Dollar equals to 17 Zimbabwe Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Andy Hodges, money market analyst from the Commercial Bank,
said the local currency is likely to fall by between 19 and 20
percent by April and even further by between 22 and 23 percent at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
As long as the import-export imbalance continued, he said, it
would drop further.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep on importing more than we export, then we will
always have a high demand for foreign currency, putting pressure
on the Zimbabwe Dollar," Hodges noted.
</P>
<P>
John Makamure, an economist from the Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce, blamed the slide of the local Dollar on the
country's declining exports.
</P>
<P>
"The Dollar will continue under pressure because our export
sector is weak which means our inflows of foreign exchange are
less than the outflows," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Makamure added that fears of an El-Nino-induced drought would
further worsen the situation as the government might be forced to
import food.
</P>
<P>
The recent release by the World Bank of one billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (60 million U.S. Dollars) to the Zimbabwe government for
balance of payments support would only stabilize the exchange
rate in the short term, since the export sector remained weak, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank Zimbabwe said in its latest economic
bulletin that "with the need to revise the mini-budget, resumed
donor funding would appear to be off the agenda until the second
quarter of 1998. Accordingly, during 1998 the Zimbabwe Dollar is
likely to depreciate a further 20 percent."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unveils Budget for 1998/99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
Tuesday evening announced a balanced budget for the fiscal year
1998/99 starting on April 1, targeting higher oil revenues,
non-oil exports and increased development aid.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised address to the House of People's
Representatives, Soeharto submitted a 133.49 trillion rupiah
(about 33.37 billion U.S. dollars at the conversion rate of 4,000
per dollar) draft budget, a 32.1 percent increase over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which is expected to be passed into law by
legislators, forecasts domestic revenues to reach 107.688 trillion
rupiah, an increase of 22.3 percent. Development revenues are
expected to reach 25.804 trillion rupiah (includes 6.8 trillion
rupiah for program aid and 19.004 trillion rupiah for project
aid), a rise of 98.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas revenues are forecast to climb sharply to 27.286
trillion rupiah, a growth of 83.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from non-oil and gas are expected to increase by 9.9
percent to 80.402 trillion rupiah with the largest source coming
from income tax and value added tax of 54.167 trillion rupiah, an
increase of 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's economic growth dropped to 5.1 percent in
1997 from the previous year's 7.98 percent as a result of the
prolonged monetary crisis and natural disasters which badly hit
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency rupiah has lost more than 100 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar since July last year and many
small and medium-sized firms have closed down because of the
government's tight monetary policies and banks' higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, Indonesia's economy will grow by four percent
during 1998-99. "It is a very low figure, compared to our annual
economic growth during the last 30 years, that reached an average
of around 7 percent," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate, which had been declining since
1993, rose to 11.05 percent in 1997 compared with 6.47 percent in
1996. The main cause was a 6.28 percent rise in foodstuffs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the higher inflation rate and monetary crisis,
with all its consequences, will continue to persist in 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary turmoil, the president said the draft state
budget is designed to overcome the crisis and that the private
sector should follow government efforts to limit expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The private sector and the government should examine and
correct themselves, he said, adding that they should be wise in
choosing which projects should be given priority and which should
be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto pledged to continue the economic reform program,
including financial reforms and restructuring covering the
monetary sector, banking, fiscal issues, domestic and foreign
trade, investment and the privatization of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the poverty eradication program should still be
given priority.
</P>
<P>
"(In the draft budget) the amount for poverty eradication is
two-thirds of government savings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, foreign loans will be used to accelerate
rural development.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Issue, Concern to UK: British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A visiting British Minister
today said he will discuss Zimbabwe's land issue when meeting
Zimbabwe's acting President Simon Mudenda at their scheduled
meeting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office Tony Lloyd made the remarks when arriving in Harare today
as the first minister in the new British Labor government to
visit Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Britain could only support Zimbabwe's resettlement
program if schemes were designed to help the poorest people in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He comes to Zimbabwe at a time when the Zimbabwe government
has released the list of over 1,500 commercial farms targeted for
compulsory acquisition under which compensation would only be
for developments made and not for the land itself.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, currently on holiday in
Europe, has said Britain should provide the money for land
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said that his government is concerned that Zimbabwe's
latest plans on the land issue might not best benefit the
landless poor.
</P>
<P>
''We can only supportean the land scheme to help people living
in poverty,'' Lloyd said, adding, ''what we can't help is the
scheme as it is now. We are concerned that the present plan will
not solve the problems of the poor landless people in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
He was speaking soon after meeting over 400 squatters at Porta
farm, 40 km west of Harare.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd will discuss other bilateral issues with Muzenda after
which he will hold a press conference.

LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
appealed here today for 378-million U.S. dollar emergency aid to
help ease the food shortages in the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference launching the program, WFP
executive director Catherine Bertini said: "The international
community has been very generous in the last year and we are
calling on it to be more generous to prevent food shortages
becoming a famine."
</P>
<P>
Bertini noted that the WFP appeal would form part of a large
request by the United Nations later this month for medicines and
special agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
A WFP report said that it needed 657,972 tons of food to
distribute to 7.5 million people in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The new WFP program is designed to provide food aid to most of
those people under 12 and help pregnant women, nursing mothers,
orphans and the handicapped.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, US Airlink May be Restored Soon: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi has raised hopes of restoring airlink with the United
States, which was severed 54 months ago by the U.S. for alleged
security lapses at the Lagos International Airport.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the settlement of the aviation dispute with
Britain for now until the latter recognizes Nigeria's
independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was quoted by local press as saying on Monday that high
level diplomatic discussion between Nigeria and the U.S. was in
progress to fine-tune areas of disagreement between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The minister confirmed that the negotiation which was being
made possible by the "positive statement" of the new U.S.
ambassador to Nigeria is expected to climax very shortly with the
resolution on areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi is scheduled to meet Ambassador William Twaddell in the
capital Abuja to find common grounds for strengthening bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of their meeting is the restoration of the
airlink between the two countries, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Washington severed direct airlink with Nigeria in August 1993
for alleged lack of safety measures in Nigeria aircraft and
airports.
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, the British Department of Transport banned
on May 15 last year all Nigeria-registered aircraft from flying
into its airspace over alleged non-compliance with safety
oversight by the Nigerian aviation authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria retaliated the following day by banning all British
registered aircraft from its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Britain lifted the ban last August when British Airways
reportedly suffered huge losses, but the face-off remains as
Nigeria insists in a review of the bilateral air service
agreement for equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, British Airways operates 14 flights a
week between the two countries, while Nigeria Airways does only
three.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official: No Troop Withdrawal From South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today that there will be no Israeli troop
withdrawal from South Lebanon unless Israel's security is
guaranteed, Israel radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who is on a tour of the security zone in South
Lebanon, also said that there will be no problem for Israel to
accept the U.N. Security Council resolution 425 calling for
Israel to withdraw from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, he said, security is important
for Israel and Israel can not pull out its troops from the
security zone because the peace and security of the region has
not been ensured.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
South Lebanon in 1985 with an aim to protect its northern areas
from cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Mordechai told the London-based Arabic newspaper
Al-Watan Al-Arabi that Israel will accept the U.N. Security
Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, dating back to 1978, calls for an Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon, the restoration of peace and
security and the extension of Lebanese authority over the region.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the rest of his cabinet
expressed their support on Sunday for the statement made by
Mordechai that Israel will be willing to implement the
resolution, provided Israel reaches an agreement with the Lebanese
government to ensure security arrangements.

African countries achieve their national development programs.
</P>
<P>
She referred to the UNDP's program for Africa on health and

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Accuses ECOMOG of Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone today reacted
strongly to the ECOMOG commander who said that 10,000 troops
currently in Liberia are to be deployed in Freetown "with or
without the consent" of the ruling military junta.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Commander of the west African Peace-keeping Force
(ECOMOG), General Victor Malu made the statement in Monrovia
Monday as he planned to return to Nigeria on the coming Thursday
to head a military training college.
</P>
<P>
"The statement disregards Sierra Leone's territorial
sovereignty and tantamounts to a declaration of war," charged
Amedu Bah, the junta public relations officer.
</P>
<P>
"It is an act of aggression which we as a government is
capable of resisting. ECOMOG has no such mandate of unilaterally
bringing in troops just like that. It proves how Nigeria is
taking unilateral decisions in the guise of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The military junta frowns on ECOMOG as the later imposed
sanctions to force it to return power in April to the civilian
government it ousted last October in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the current wave of fightings between government
soldiers and Kamajors rages on in the southeast, political
analysts said the Conakry Peace Agreement is "now almost in
tatters."
</P>
<P>
Travelers arriving in the capital early today from war-torn
areas in the south reported fresh fightings on the outskirts of
Bo, the second biggest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
In one of such attacks to dislodge the Kamajors from their
base, said an eyewitness, government soldiers overpowered the
militia who subsequently ran out of ammunition and fled into
different safety zones.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan to Join Efforts on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Pakistan today announced
their readiness to make joint efforts to bring peace to the
war-torn Afghanistan, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The stance of the two neighbors of Afghanistan was announced
in a meeting between Pakistani special envoy on Afghanistan
issue Iftikhar Murshid and his Iranian counterpart Alaeddin
Boroujerdi this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Murshid said in the meeting that Pakistan would continue its
talks with Iran on the Afghan issue until its final solution,
adding that the Pakistani government has reached the conclusion
that dialogue among various Afghan groups was the only way for the
Afghan rival leaders to reach understanding among them.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan as two important neighbors of Afghanistan
should spare no efforts to bring peace in the war-torn central
Asian country, said the Pakistani official who arrived here this
morning for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to recent talks between Pakistani officials and the
Afghan Taliban group, he said that Islamabad has encouraged the
Taliban to join the Afghan peace talks and it would continue this
policy in the future.
</P>
<P>
Iran's special envoy on the Afghan issue Boroujerdi also
voiced Tehran's willingness to cooperate with Islamabad over the
Afghan issue, but expressing concern over Taliban's refusal to a
ceasefire during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran, as chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), would continue its efforts to implement
the OIC resolutions on Afghanistan in order to restore peace in
that country.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the needs to dispatch more humanitarian
assistance to the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani ambassador to Iran Javid Hossain,
Murshid's visit was aimed at exchanging views with Iranian
officials and seeing "how the two countries can work together in
encouraging the peace talks in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has backed the Taliban forces while Iran supported
former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, whose government was
ousted by the Taliban forces in September, 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the OIC summit held here last month, Iran and Pakistan
jointly proposed a resolution on Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, a team of
Chinese mountaineers have successfully conquered the 5,895-meter high
peak of Uhuru in Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest in Africa, sources said
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhixin and Wang Yongfeng from the Chinese Mountain-Climbing
Team reached the top of the peak at 07:40 local time (04:40 GMT) on
Monday, said Li, the team leader, from their base camp at the foot of
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Li said that starting at
02:00 in the morning, the team, braving severe snowstorm, chose a
difficult route and finally erected a Chinese national flag on the
peak.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the members of the Chinese
Mountain-Climbing Team to ascend the top of Kilimanjaro located in
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese journalists, Wang Haozheng, female, from the Beijing
Youth Daily, and Zhang Wei and Pan Yansheng, from the China Central
Television, also climbed along with the two mountaineers to a camp as
high as 4,750 meters.
</P>

Yongfeng have so far conquered the world's highest mount Qomolangma in
Asia as well as the highest mountains in North America, South America,
Europe and the Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
Their next goal is to climb up the highest mountain in Oceania,
thus completing their ambitious plan to conquer all the highest
mountains in the seven continents of the world.
</P>
<P>
The snow-capped Kilimanjaro, which is an active volcano located
near the Equator, attracts a great number of mountaineers as well as

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Debunks S. Leone's Claims on Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military today debunked
claims by Sierra Leone's ruling junta that officers of Yoruba
extraction involved in peacekeeping operations in S.Leone had
been arrested and sent back home for trial.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, Defense Spokesman Godwin Ugbo said
that no Nigerian military officer involved in any overseas operation had
been brought back home for trial.
</P>
<P>
The junta was just exploiting Internet services to perpetuate
falsehood, he said, adding that "There is no iota of truth in the
allegation."
</P>
<P>
Ugbo, who described the junta's claims as " mischievous and
malicious", noted that it was aimed at causing disharmony among
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The alleged claims followed the arrest of Nigeria's Chief of
General Staff, Oladip Diya, and 11 others in connection with
a foiled coup plot uncovered by the Nigerian government on December 21
last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of those arrested are from the Yoruba ethnic group, one of the
largest in Nigeria mainly living in the west.
</P>
<P>
Ugbo further described the claims as an attempt by the junta to
cover up the break-up in its ranks, citing the recent dismissal of
several of its leading members for looting the Iranian embassy in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The sacked members included Tamba Gborie, who announced the
military coup on May 25 last year, ousting President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to try to attack the residence of the junta
leader Johnny Paul Koroma.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Faces Pressure in Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami is facing mounting pressures as the countdown started for
his first address to the "great American people" scheduled on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers from the right-wing factions recently published
interviews and speeches of hardline political officials,
lawmakers and religious figures, voicing opposition to any
contacts or dialogues with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The time is not ripe for resumption of diplomatic ties with
the United States and the resumption will only cause Iran to lose
its dignity, political independence and the Islamic nature of the
country," local newspapers Tehran Times and Resalat quoted their
interviewees as saying.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, soon after the conclusion of the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Tehran, Khatami
announced his readiness to have a dialogue with the "great
American people," a proposal welcomed by top U.S. officials
including President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Mohammad Hussein Zare said that it would be
no use to develop contacts with the United States because "the
history of our contacts with the U.S. and our experience with that
nation have sufficiently proved that the U.S. does not pay any heed
to our interests or it would be more appropriate to say that they
do not care for others."
</P>
<P>
He said that any contacts, which can be fruitful or can
enhance the prestige of the Islamic Revolution, should be
welcomed, but "the case of the United States is different from
others."
</P>
<P>
"President Khatami in his address to the people of the
U.S. should explain the realities and clarify the
misunderstandings created by the U.S. government in a deliberate
attempt to distort the image of the Islamic Revolution," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian officials criticized Washington for the
continuation of its hostile policies toward Iran, saying that "so
far the U.S. has not demonstrated any change in its attitude
toward Iran."
</P>
<P>
"When President Khatami decided to send a message to the
people of the United States, the U.S. officials put forward a
series of conditions" for a possible dialogue between the two
sworn enemies, said Mahmoud Alavi, another parliament member.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said earlier that
"the ball is in the American court."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with all nations, provided they are
ready to establish relations with us based on mutual respect,"
Kharrazi said, adding that there would be no dialogue between
Tehran and Washington unless the U.S. changes its policies toward
Iran.

ADDIS ABABA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Salvation Council
(NSC) of Somalia today announced here that differences among Somali
faction leaders over the recent Cairo Agreement have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, five co-chairmen of the NSC
said they convened the 3rd regular meeting here and agreed to take
measures to correct the Cairo Agreement.
</P>
<P>
They said the measures taken to correct the Cairo Agreement will
be discussed with Hussein Aideed.
</P>
<P>
They described the recent Cairo meeting as supplementary to
the peace and reconciliation process, and said although the Cairo
conference had included Hussein Aideed, the boycott by two
co-chairmen of the NSC widened the misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
The two co-chairmen walked out the Cairo negotiations saying the
power sharing in the future Somali government is not based on fair
representation, the co-chairmen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the co-chairmen, they reached an agreement after
making amendments on the question of fair representation based on
clan.
</P>
<P>
They said they have agreed to hold a reconciliation conference
in Baidoa beginning on February 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the evacuation of Hussein Aideed's militia from Baidoa
is made a precondition for the convening of the reconciliation
conference, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Baidoa conference will discuss the structure of the future
Somali government which they said will be headed by a prime
minister and have a 180 member General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The self-proclaimed Somaliland President, Mohammed Igal will
attend the conference as individual participant, according to the
co-chairmen.

MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia does not agree to settle
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict by using military forces, Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Tarasov said the use of force

has been preserved there for more than three years, and over
50,000 refugees have returned to the Galy district. This has
proved the high effectiveness of peacekeeping efforts in Abkhazia,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expects to Improve Relations with Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior advisor to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said today that Egypt expects the turning
of "a new leaf" in its relations with Sudan, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt welcomes turning a new leaf in Sudanese-Egyptian
relations in all domains," said Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's political
advisor, while addressing an Islamic forum co-sponsored by Egypt's
Ministry of Waqfs (Religious Endowments) and Al-Azher, the country's
highest Islamic institution.
</P>
<P>
In a show of rapprochement with Khartoum, whom Egypt has
accused of harboring militants who try to overthrow Egypt's secular
government, Baz described the Cairo-Khartoum ties as "time-honored
and highly special."
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the recent statements by some Sudanese
officials calling for iron out their differences in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Amid signs of improved Cairo-Khartoum ties, Egyptian Trade and
Supply Minister Ahmed Gowaili has invited his Sudanese counterpart
Othman al-Hadi to visit Egypt in mid-January for talks on
enhancing joint investment and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, a delegation of the Sudanese Ministry of
Communications and Transports arrived here for talks on
resuming Nile navigation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On January 3, Sudanese First Vice President Zubeir Mohammed
Salih confirmed that Egyptian and Sudanese efforts for restoring
bilateral relations are going in full swing and will be crowned by
a visit of President Omar al-Bashir to Egypt soon.
</P>
<P>
The present thaw in bilateral relations followed assurances
from Khartoum that it will no longer provide support for Islamic
militants attempting to undermine the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has already nominated its ambassador to Cairo and Egypt is
expected to nominate its ambassador to Khartoum soon.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Egypt and Sudan have been strained after Egypt
accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and plotting to assassinate
Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 1995. Sudan has denied
the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey For Violation of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece today criticized Turkey for
violation of its airspace, saying that this did harm to the mutually
agreed stance of respecting major religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
When Greece celebrated Epiphany today, Turkish F-16s warplanes
infringed air control regulations in the Athens flight information
region (FIR) north and south of Lesvos island in the eastern
Aegean Sea and on 14 occasions violated Greek national airspace in
the region over the islands of Psara, Chios and Oenousses, the
Greek Defense Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time that the Turkish airforce is carrying out
provocations during a religious holiday in violation of an agreement
to refrain from such actions during religious holidays and
anniversaries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the violations were not related to an ongoing
major Turkish wargame in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Greek Defense Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis
stressed that the Greek armed forces were cautiously monitoring the
Turkish military exercise and would take all necessary measures if the
manoeuvres were carried out in unauthorized Greek areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Greece and Turkey reached a "memorandum agreement" to
promote confidence-building measures between the two countries on the
principle of good-neighborliness. The agreement included respect of
each other's major religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, Athens also condemned Ankara for the violation of
its airspace by Turkish jet fighters.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Reaffirms Stand on Advancing Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed here today that only after
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fulfills its commitment to
fight terrorism, the Mideast peace talks could be pushed forward.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross in the Prime Minister's Office, Netanyahu told reporters
that it is the duty of his coalition government, which just
survived the budget crisis Monday, to continue advancing the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This government was elected to advance the peace process
under the principles of the Palestinians' compliance with the
obligations given to us, given to the United States, and to the Oslo
Accord," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly stressed recently that the PNA must
adhere to all the commitments it undertook with regard to Israel's
security before the further redeployment in the West Bank can be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The scope and timing of the second redeployment will also be
the main subject of the meeting between Netanyahu and Ross, who
arrived here today in a bid to narrow the differences between
Israel and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that despite the political turmoil in Israel
generated by Foreign Minister David Levy's resignation over the
budget dispute, he would work with Netanyahu and PNA President
Yasser Arafat to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his consultations with Israeli and Palestinian
officials will be a preparation for the expected meetings of
U.S. President Bill Clinton with Netanyahu and Arafat in
Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu confirmed Monday that the Israeli cabinet will draw
up a plan on the precise scope of the second pullback from the
West Bank before he leaves for Washington.
</P>
<P>
But analysts believed that it will be very difficult for
Netanyahu to finish a plan, which will satisfy both the
U.S. Administration and the members of his coalition, which was
dominated by extreme right-wingers after moderate Levy's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Netanyahu, Ross will go to the West Bank
city of Bethlehem tonight for talks with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Turkish-Israeli-US Maneuvers Ill Timed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today criticized the controversial naval exercises
involving troops of Turkey, Israel and the U.S. in the East
Mediterranean, saying the timing for the exercises is wrong.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that "Egypt does not see any
justification for carrying out these maneuvers at the present
time."
</P>
<P>
Egypt considers that the basis of the maneuvers, scheduled for
Wednesday, is wrong and the thinking and orientation on which they
are based are also wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of the maneuvers is wrong and consequently what is
built on this is also wrong, therefore this is considered a
negative step in the light of the stalled peace process and
intransigence in Israeli policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Military officials who will take part in the three-way drill
said the exercises are aimed at coordinating search-and-rescue
procedures and will not pose any threat to other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Despite Arab criticism of the growing Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation, Jordan has decided to send an observer to the
controversial "Reliant Mermaid" exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, when asked on the impact of the
political crisis in Israel on the peace process, said the crisis
is Israel's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
"We shall wait to see what attitude the Israeli government will
adopt in the coming few days and the offers it will make at the
coming meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli
Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu,)" Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington meeting is important as it is related to the
U.S. role and the Israeli attitude toward the peace process and
its future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet separately with Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in
Washington this month in order to end a nine-month-old crisis in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock in the troubled Mideast peace process is coupled
with recent political turmoils in Israel over the resignation of
Foreign Minister David Levy, which has left Netanyahu's coalition
much weakened.

<HEADLINE> Penalties on Gas Flaring Increase in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said today that penalties
on flaring natural gas have increased from 50 Kobo (half Naira)
per thousand cubic feet to 10 Naira (about 0.125 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new rate is part of measures the government has adopted to
end gas flaring in the country's oil fields and to promote gas
utilization, according to Finance Minister Anthony Ani in his
presentation of the 1998 budget breakdown in a nationwide
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The old rate was fixed in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, gas utilization projects will now
be taxed under the commercial companies tax act at 30 percent,
instead of being assessed under the petroleum tax regime at 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
Industries in the country are also encouraged to switch to the
use of gas in order to make the government goal realized.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's natural gas reserve is estimated at 150,000-300,000
billion cubic meters, ranking the 10th in the world.
</P>
<P>
But due to lack of utilization, most of the resources have
being flared, leading to serious environmental protection problem
and huge economic losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cour de Cassation, France's
highest court, Tuesday ordered the resumption of judicial pursuit
against Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, a Rwandan Roman Catholic priest
accused of joining the genocide against Tutsis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Wenceslas was arrested and jailed in July 1995 by a French
court in Privas, Ardeche in southern France, for "genocide,
complicity in genocide, tortures, and inhuman and degrading
treatment."
</P>
<P>
But an appeal court in Nimes, southern France, ordered the
release of Wenceslas on March 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wenceslas served as the vicar of the Saint-Famille Church in
the Rwandan capital Kigali, where hundreds of Tutsi refugees took
refuge during the genocide from April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
When the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front took Kigali,
Wenceslas fled Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Wenceslas is now serving as a Roman Catholic priest in Andelys
west of Paris.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Continue to Deliberate Bombing Conspirator's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Jurors in Denver, Colorado,
resumed their deliberations Tuesday in an effort to determine
whether Terry Nichols should die for his lesser role in the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The federal jury deliberated five hours Monday without reaching
a verdict.
</P>
<P>
The jurors convicted Nichols of conspiracy and involuntary
manslaughter on December 23 but acquitted him of first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
The basic inconsistency in the initial verdict is something
these jurors are having problems with now, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Nichols was convicted of conspiracy and eight counts of
involuntary manslaughter for the April 19, 1995, bombing that
killed 168 people. In addition to first-degree murder, he also was
acquitted of use of a truck bomb in the deadliest terrorist act
ever on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
In June, co-conspirator Timothy McVeigh was convicted on eight
counts of first-degree murder and three other charges and
sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
Jurors must decide if Nichols should receive the same sentence,
life in prison or a lesser term to be determined by the judge. The
judge will sentence him on the involuntary manslaughter
convictions later.
</P>
<P>
Nichols was accused of helping McVeigh acquire key bomb
ingredients and hiding them. He was at home in Herington, Kansas,
when McVeigh set off the bomb.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Borrows No Foreign Loans Since 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Government has not
negotiated any new loans from international creditors since 1995,
Finance Minister Anthony Ani said today in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998 budget breakdown relayed on a nationwide broadcast, Ani
said that rather than enter into new credit agreements, the federal
government had started discussions with its creditors on the need to
get some debt reliefs and concessions.
</P>
<P>
He said that conscious efforts have been made to reconcile the
nation's debt figures with the creditors, including the London and
Paris Clubs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Nigeria's aggregate foreign debt stock stood
at 27.08 billion U.S. Dollars as of December 31, 1997, compared with
28.06 billion dollars in 1996 and 32.58 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had allocated two billion dollars
in this year's budget to service foreign debts, the same amount as
last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the successes recorded in the country's debt management in
the past two years, Ani said, the debt overhang would remain a heavy
burden without concessional debt relief from the foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
He said that following a successful negotiation of a medium-term
economic strategy with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
Nigeria would press for concessional debt relief from the creditors.

<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Teachers in Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown have defied a call by the Education Ministry to re-open
schools closed since the May 25 coup last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here said today, some children
waited at schools in the city for several hours Monday, hoping
their teachers would turn up, but the staff followed a boycott call by
the Sierra Leone Teachers' Union.
</P>
<P>
However, teaching resumed in some other parts of the west African
country, such as the major eastern town of Kenama and Makeni in the
north.
</P>
<P>
Education Ministry officials said Monday that they were deeply
disappointed by the failure of teachers to start a new term and
accused them and parents of gambling with their children's future.
</P>
<P>
The Teachers' Union said early last December tht teachers would
return to school this month if their demands were met, including a
claim for pay arrears and the junta's implementation of a peace plan
that will lead to the restoration of ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah by April.
</P>
<P>
"The re-opening of schools will happen if all armed personnel are
disarmed according to the Conakry peace plan and if those armed
fighters now occupying school premises are evacuated immediately," the
union said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, universities remained closed as many
academic staff fled abroad after the coup.

WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Tuesday defended its involvement in a trilateral exercises with
Israel and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, saying it was
only a "humanitarian operation."
</P>
<P>
"This exercise is a humanitarian exercise. It's about a
scenario in which a ship is suffering and needs assistance in a
humanitarian operation," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reporters. "We think it's certainly appropriate for the
United States, Israel, and Turkey to engage in that."
</P>
<P>
But countries in the Middle East regarded the exercise, named
"Reliant Mermaid," as a threat to the region's security as the
exercise indicates a growing military ties between Israel and
Turkey and these countries were irked by U.S. involvement in the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Syria, in comment on the exercise, said on Saturday that the
maneuvers constituted "an encouragement to Israel to continue
its aggressions against peace and Arab and Islamic states."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Mussa on Sunday pointed out that
"Turkey must know that any alliance will trigger the establishment
of a counteralliance."
</P>
<P>
In response to Egypt's warning, Rubin repeated U.S.
supporting stance for the exercise, and said "we certainly don't
think it would justify any ramping up of any body else's
military considerations."

U.S. and Turkish vessels on Monday arrived at Israel's port
city of Haifa and three countries are now preparing for the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Medicare Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today proposed to let early retirees and laid-off workers buy into
Medicare -- the federal medical insurance program -- as early as
age 55.
</P>
<P>
"This is an entirely new way of adapting a program of the past
for the needs of the future," Clinton said in an announcement at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is similar to an option offered by Social
Security, in which people can spread their pension benefits over a
longer period, starting at age 62 instead of 65.
</P>
<P>
"These people have spent their lifetimes working hard,
supporting their families, contributing to society," Clinton said.
"Just at the time they most need health care, they are least
attractive to health insurers who demand higher premiums or deny
coverage outright."
</P>
<P>
The president's plan, which needs approval by Congress, would
let some Americans between 62 and 65 pay a monthly premium of
about 300 dollars, plus an additional monthly payment of 10 to 20
dollars, to get government health insurance through Medicare. Once
they became fully eligible for Medicare at age 65, people who
bought in early would pay slightly higher out-of-pocket fees than
those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, laid-off workers over age 55 would be offered a
similar buy-in option.
</P>
<P>
All three proposals were designed to be fully paid for by new
beneficiaries, so as not to add costs to the already-strained
Medicare program, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But Congressional Republicans have expressed doubt that the
buy-in could work without additional government spending.
</P>
<P>
And health policy experts noted that a Medicare buy-in program
would do little to thin the ranks of America's uninsured.
</P>
<P>
Only about 900,000 of the 41.4 million Americans without health
insurance are between the ages of 62 and 64, according to
estimates based on a 1997 Census Bureau survey.
</P>
<P>
But compared to many younger people in good health who go
without insurance by choice, access can be a bigger problem for
older people. Not quite 60 percent of the 5.8 million Americans 62
to 64 have group-discount insurance through a current or former
employer. About 13 percent privately purchase individual policies.

<HEADLINE> Germans Save Less Money, Says Bank Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Germans have cut their savings due
to low interest rates and joblessness, while investing more in
stocks, said a "Bank News" report released Wednesday in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Germans put 5.2 billion marks (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) in
banks in the first nine months of 1997, compared to 52 billion
marks (29 billion dollars) in the same period of 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of deposits was because of the country's current
low interest rate of 3 percent on savings, rising unemployment as
well as the shift of money to stocks, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Geological Prospecting in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it has
started geological prospecting operations in the Caspian Sea in
order to confirm its oil and gas reserves, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Oil Minister for Oil and Gas in the Caspian Sea
Ali Majedi was quoted as saying that it was the first time for
Iran to carry out geological prospecting works in the Caspian sea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the prospecting operation was an essential step
for the country to estimate the oil and gas reserves in the area.
</P>
<P>
Although the Caspian littoral states and some international
institutions have announced their estimates about the oil and gas
reserves in the Caspian Sea, he said, the estimates could not be
confirmed because prospecting works have not been carried out
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, with an estimated reserve of 15.5 billion
barrels of crude oil and some 8.3 trillion cubic meters of natural
gas, is reported to be another oil and gas production center like
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the legal status of the sea, Majedi said that it
comprises the rights of sea navigation, exploitation of natural
resources over and under the seabed and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
However, the five Caspian littoral countries, namely Iran,
Russia, Khazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, have not reached
an agreement over the issue, he said, adding that the most
serious difference among the littoral states was how to explore
the natural resources in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly announced opposition to any unilateral
exploitation of the natural resources in the Caspian Sea, urging
the littoral states to speed up their negotiations to determine
the legal status of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Iran lodged a strong protest against Azerbaijan
after Baku started its oil exploitation from the Cheragh
reservoir of the Caspian Sea.

PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- the president of the centrist
Union for French Democracy, Francois Leotard, Wednesday suggested
extending the International Tribunal on war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that France, and perhaps with the support of Britain,
the chairman of the European Union, could take the initiative of
an intervention by the (U.N.) Security Council ... to open the
field of application of the tribunals to the situation in
Algeria," Leotard said.
</P>
<P>
"No country can exercise its internal sovereignty while crimes
against humanity and war crimes are at work as those are today in
Algeria," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council created two international tribunals
to try suspected war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda. The two courts are based in the Hague, the Netherlands,
and Arusha, Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> HK's Financial Policies Remain Appropriate: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong SAR secretary for
financial services, Rafael Hui, said here Wednesday that Hong
Kong's financial system has been proved to be sound and robust
during the financial crisis and existing relevant policies remain
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider an independent investigation committee
necessary," he said in a written reply to a question at a plenary
session of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) about whether
 the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) would consider setting up such a committee to look into
matters relating to the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the financial crisis review being carried out by
the government, Hui noted that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
has so far held five meetings with academics, analysts, bank
treasurers and capital market participants, apart from the
financial secretary's meeting with academics on November 14 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The discussions focused on the technical aspects of the
operation of the linked exchange rate system between the local
currency and the U.S. dollar and proposals made by the academics,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hui noted that there was clear support for the maintenance of
the pegged exchange rate system and general recognition that
volatility in interest rates cannot be avoided in the event of a
speculative attack or an external shock.
</P>
<P>
Hui went on to say that there has been good progress in the
financial review which is being carried out under three principles.
</P>
<P>
"First, the linked exchange rate system remains
unchanged. Secondly, Hong Kong's position as an international
financial center must be maintained. And thirdly, we should
address the operation of the financial markets and explore ways
to improve the technical aspects of the mechanism."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that some preliminary findings of the
review will be available next month.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's plenary session of the Provisional Legislative
Council, other SAR government officials also answered questions
concerning the measures to stem the source of bird flu, Hong
Kong's holidays and travel advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Legislators had the first and second reading of the Housing
(Amendment) (No.3) Bill 1997 at the session and a number of
motions tabled by government officials or PLC members were
adopted, including a motion to appoint Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
and Lord Hoffman as judges of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.

Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region.
</P>
<P>
The number two of FN Bruno Megret said that the regional
elections would start at "a relatively critical moment of the
political situation" in France.
</P>
<P>
He said that the FN would focus his platform on three points:
unemployment, immigration and crimes.
</P>
<P>
The FN is trying to grasp some of the electorate among the
jobless people and the working class from the leftwing parties,
while playing up the problem of immigration which links with
crimes in cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the beginning of a phenomenon of Intifadha of the
suburbs," he said in reference to the recent riots which took
place in poor suburbs where usually live a large number of Arab
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, 69, will tour 10 cities during the regional election
campaign.

GUANGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The food problems for the

<HEADLINE> Lost Ancient Chinese Paintings Housed Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 23,000 ancient Chinese
paintings are housed in collections overseas, including one of the
most famous Chinese paintings dating back some 1,600 years old.
</P>
<P>
The painting in question -- "Nu Shi Zhen" which depicts a
beautiful lady, was painted by Gu Kaizhi, a noted painting master
of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) who is considered to be the
father of traditional Chinese painting. The painting, looted by
the Allied Forces in 1860, is currently housed in London's Museum
of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
Other invaluable artifacts include painted pottery dating back
to the late Stone Age and bronze and jade pieces from the Xia
(21th-16th Century B.C.), Shang (16-11th Century B.C.) and Zhou
(11th Century-221 B.C.) dynasties, as well as silk painting pieces
from the Chu State of the Warring State Period (475-211 B.C.) and
numerous famous paintings from later dynasties.
</P>
<P>
"All of the works are of high academic and artistic value,"
according to Lin Shuzhong, a professor of art history at the
Nanjing Institute of Art in the capital of east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The works constitute only a small part of Chinese works which
were taken overseas in the century following the Opium War in
1840," said Lin, adding that an untold number of works have not as
yet surfaced.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that approximately 33 percent of the 23,000 paintings
are in the Americas, mainly in the United States and Canada, with
another 33 percent in Japan, and the remainder in European
nations, including Germany, Britain, France, Belgium and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of works in Europe were looted from a cave at
Dunhuang's Mogao Grottos in northwest China's Gansu Province at
the beginning of the century, with other works spirited overseas
between 1930-1940 when the country was in the midst of war and
neglected the protection of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who initiated his research of Chinese paintings in
overseas museums in 1985, is currently compiling an 800,000-word
pictorial of the 23,000 paintings.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Fine Arts Publishing House will publish the book at a
cost of four million yuan (480,000 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Malawian Kwacha Depreciates Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian Kwacha has
depreciated drastically due to the government's fiscal
indiscipline, Zambia News Agency ZANA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha has depreciated from 15.35 to the U.S dollar in
July 1997 to 21.9 during the first week of January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted analysts as saying that unless the Malawian
government put brakes on its expenditure, the currency would
continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to mitigate the negative effects is for Malawi
to reinforce fiscal discipline," said Matthew Chicaonda, governor
of the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team, which was recently
in Malawi, said they were unhappy with what they found during
their routine review visit of the Malawi economy.
</P>
<P>
Although foreign aid has not been suspended, the economists
said, the government appeared to have contravened the agreements
with the fund to restrict its spending.
</P>
<P>
This may partly explain the sudden shortage of foreign
exchange on the Malawi market, they added, and hence the rapid
depreciation of the Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Kwacha is expected to continue until
April when the tobacco marketing season starts and dollars start
to flow into the country.

TAIYUAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The old, conventional practice
of the government appointing directors of state-owned factories in
north China's Shanxi Province is giving way to the new method of
public nominations and selections through a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
The fact that public opinion is sought during the process has
enabled common workers to play a bigger role in the selection of
their bosses.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the new method was used to select the presidents
and/or directors for 192 state-owned firms, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The new practice enables the qualified individuals to seek
leading posts in state-owned enterprises on their own, or through

have is due to Singapore's defense philosophy, which is to be

"Our spending on defense, which we have as a policy capped at 6
percent of the gross domestic product, is a small premium to pay

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A national ordnance industry
work conference opened here today as part of the effort to
add impetus to the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, on behalf of the State Council, sent a
congratulatory letter marking the opening of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The ordnance industry, a basic sector facing great
difficulties, plays an important role in advancing the
modernization of national defense, according to Wu, who is also a
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the industry focused on reversing decreasing economic
returns by restructuring operations, introducing new management
strategies and expanding its product mix.
</P>
<P>
A majority of enterprises in the sector are expected to recoup
deficits over the next three years, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
The industry has substantially increased its output of products
for civilian use, including automobiles and motorcycles. In
addition, its 1997 output of mini-buses exceeded 127,000
units. The sector is also encouraging the establishment of an
increasing number of enterprise groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Personal bankruptcies in the
United States hit record in 1997 despite an economic boom with low
unemployment and strong consumer confidence, Visa USA said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Visa USA, the world's largest credit card company, said 1.34
million credit card holders in America filed for bankruptcy in
1997, rising 19.5 percent from the 1.12 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Personal bankruptcies have increased by over 400 percent in the
country since 1980, the company said, based on findings by a daily
tracking system of all bankruptcies filed in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
While no states had a decline in the number of bankruptcies in
1997, West Virginia had the largest growth with a 54.2 percent
rise and Wyoming had the smallest with a 6 percent rise, it said.
</P>
<P>
One reason behind the record, it said, is the fact that there
was less stigma attached to bankruptcy, with many people now
willing to pursue it as a first opinion instead of a last resort.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these people could have avoided bankruptcy altogether
had they been aware of options like credit counseling, said Visa
USA's Senior Vice President Kenneth Crone.
</P>
<P>
He said Congress is considering new laws which would require
courts to inform debtors of alternatives to bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Paris to Collect Less Tax From Parisians in 1998: Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi said
Wednesday his municipal government will collect less tax from
residents of the city in 1998 compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year good wish message sent to deputies of the Council
of Paris, the local parliament, Tiberi said "fiscal pressure" on
residents of this capital city will diminish in this year.
</P>
<P>
The tax reduction measure, likely to be announced next week
before it is submitted to the city council for approval, followed
tax increases of 4.5 percent in 1997 and 6.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
City officials said the reduction will be "considerable," so as
to achieve zero growth of tax collection on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Both the municipal government and city council of Paris are
controlled by the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR).
</P>
<P>
The tax reduction could be a move to win support for the RPR in
the forthcoming regional elections scheduled for March, as the RPR
is expected to be challenged by the Socialist Party in Paris.

which covers 4,400 square kilometers and is known for the unique
sight of fish and birds peacefully coexisting. The ban's aim was
to recover the diminishing huso sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
The fish gains only half a kilogram in weight on average in
a decade due to adverse conditions, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They further warned that the birds would fly away if the fish
were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Local fishing administration departments have stopped many lake
poachers, and more than 2,000 have been punished.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture
have decided to spend 4 million yuan to help restore the fish
population, local sources said.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Prevention Efforts in Snowstorm Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Local medical departments in Nagqu
Prefecture, an area in the northern part of the Tibet Autonomous
Regions struck by heavy snowstorms, have worked out active,
effective measures to prevent the outbreak of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of medical teams, dispatched by local governments and
units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), have been working in
the area, according to Adain, executive vice-president of the
Autonomous Regional Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snowstorms devastating Nagqu Prefecture since last
September have created enormous difficulties for local life and
production.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to prevent the possible outbreak of
epidemic diseases in the area, local medical authorities have sent
teams of experts to look into the situation and have followed-up
by dispatching medical teams to carry out prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
Adain said local medical teams are capable of preventing the
outbreak of any form of epidemic disease. The Regional Health Care
Bureau have provided epidemic prevention drugs valued at 240,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
No epidemic outbreaks have been reported in Nagqu so far, said
Adain.
</P>
<P>
A general mood of order and serenity is prevalent in the
region, where local government departments and schools are in
operation as usual, so as post offices and telecommunication
networks. Shops along main roads are packed with all commodities
and, in grocers and free markets there are abundant meat foods as
well as a dozen varieties of fresh vegetables from Lhasa and the
neighbouring Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
Yet, urgent meetings are in session in prefectural government
offices, and a number of work teams have gone among snowstorm
victims to lead them in rescue work.

<HEADLINE> Australia Survived With Tough Win in Hopman Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's world number two
Pat Rafter stormed his way back from the brink of defeat to beat
Spain's Carlos Moya and keep alive the host nation's hopes in the
Hopman Cup in Perth on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, trailed 1-4 in the third set
after losing formidably the second 1-6 to Spain's world number
seven Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
But he managed to capture his belated rhythm and rallied from
the brink of defeat against the Barcelona baseliner to win 7-5,
1-6, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tough match. I am annoyed with myself for having
let him back in," the 25-year-old Queenslander said.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's win brought a crucial tie at 1-1 against top seeds
Spain and kept Australia's hopes alive in the mixed teams event
when Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Rafter's teammate
in their earlier clash.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez had an easier passage, winning the home country's
inexperienced Annabel Ellwood in straight sets 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding mixed doubles the Australian team beat the
Spanish duo 7-5, 6-2 for a 2-1 win over the top seeds in the
eight-team round robin tournament.
</P>
<P>
Rafter and Ellwood on Thursday meet Karol Kucera and Karina
Habsudova of the Slovak Republic for a place in Saturday's final.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End 1.5 Pct Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
lost nearly 1.5 percent Wednesday as profit takers capitalized on
recent gains in banking stocks while resources were sold off on a
poor commodities outlook.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 38.4 points to 2,646.9. "Stocks
with exposure overseas, earning other currencies, were quite
strong and stocks with Australian exposure were a bit weak," Steve
Negrine from Reynolds and Co said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 53.2 points to 4,563.2, with the
fall led by banking stocks which had experienced strong recent
rises on the flight into high yielding shares in the wake of
falling bond yields.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank dropped 58 cents while Westpac was 13
cents lower, and there was also profit taking in ANZ, which fell
eight cents while Commonwealth Bank held up against the market to
lose four tenths of a cent.
</P>
<P>
News Corp shares, which had benefited on the low dollar and
receipts from its Fox studio's successful Titanic movie, also fell
17 cents.
</P>
<P>
Telstra's installment receipts were also sold off, down seven
cents.
</P>
<P>
The day's sharpest falls came in resources, with the major
stocks sold down significantly on a cautionary mode caused by a
doubtful outlook for any improvement in commodities stocks.
</P>
<P>
WMC was hit the hardest, dropping 32 cents while MIM was also
sold off by the market, down four cents, BHP also suffered,
falling 36.7 cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 28.4 points to 1,114.5.
</P>
<P>
The gold index closed 19.9 points lower at 982.4. Gold stocks
were also sold off despite a 0.55 US dollar per ounce rise in the
bullion price to 281.45 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for the day was a tepid 271.22 million shares
at a value of 675.27 million Australian dollars (432.17 million US
dollars), with falls outnumbering rises 677 to 388.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Short-Term Debts Only 30% of Total Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's short-term debts
as of the end of June in 1997 accounted for only 30 percent of the
total external outstanding debts, the State Bank announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This contrasted significantly to the ratio of 56 percent
published earlier by the Zurich-based Bank of International
Settlement (BIS), the State Bank, the country's central bank, said
in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the BIS data refers only to bank lending,
a higher proportion of which is short-term.
</P>
<P>
"Including medium and long-term debts with remaining maturity
of one year, the ratio would be 39 percent," the State Bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that as of the end of June, 1997, Malaysia's total
borrowing, comprising short-, medium- and long-term debts,
amounted to 45.2 billion U.S. dollars, or 42 percent of its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
These loans include inter-company borrowing, bonds raised in
the international capital markets and bank lending.
</P>
<P>
Medium- and long-term debts accounted for 70 percent or 31.7
billion dollars of the total external debts, the bulk of which
(63 percent) are with remaining maturity of between four and 20
years, the State Bank said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ready to Stop Attacks on Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), the de facto central bank of Singapore, said on
Wednesday that it is ready to stop any speculative attacks on the
Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore currency fell further to 1.78 against the U.S.
dollar at one point of the day's trading, hitting the lowest level
in six years. Other regional currencies continued to decline to
their new record lows on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MAS emphasized in a statement that it manages the currency
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies "and not against any
single currency."
</P>
<P>
While the Singapore dollar has weakened against the U.S.
dollar, the Deutsche mark and pound sterling, the MAS said, it has
risen against the Malaysian ringgit, the Thai baht and the
Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, on a trade-weighted basis, its (the Singapore
dollar's) value has remained stable, notwithstanding the currency
turmoil," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar has depreciated by about 18 percent since
July last year when the currency stood at 1.43 to the greenback.

HEFEI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
introduced the nation's first local regulation formulated
specifically for the protection of local ancient dwellings.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Police Get New System for Better Emergency Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- With the introduction of the
Caller Number Display (CND) system here on Wednesday, Hong Kong
police can now achieve greater efficiency in the 999 emergency
service, according to senior Police officers.
</P>
<P>
The CND system has been provided for all 999 operators at Hong
Kong Police's Regional Command and Control Center of Hong Kong
Island (RCCC/HKI) since early December last year.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, all incoming telephone numbers can now be
seen at 999 operators telset at the center, Chiu Yat-sing, chief
telecommunications engineer, told a RCC/HKI press conference on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nuisance calls which range from children playing with the
telephone to people maliciously making hoax calls always tie up
999 lines, reducing the efficiency of the 999 service and making
callers in genuine emergency difficult to gain access, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are under way to install the CND system at RCCCs
in Kowloon and the "New Territories" and it is expected that the
two RCCCs will have the system by April this year after the
telephone system is upgraded there.
</P>
<P>
"The system is very useful to deal with hoax or nuisance
telephone callers," said Peter Hunt, senior superintendent of
support at the Hong Kong Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, the 999 operators now can find the
locations of the callers through telephone companies. This can be
achieved even if the callers cannot give their locations because
either they are too confused, or they don't know where they are or
they just don't have time, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
And the 999 operators can still register the telephone numbers
in case of line blocking or call blocking as they are provided
with a blocking override device on all calls to 999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of nuisance calls is likely to drop when all callers
 to 999 are aware that their telephone numbers will be displayed
on the 999 operators telset and that tracing of such calls has
now become easier. And action could be taken against persistent
nuisance callers, Hunt added.
</P>
<P>
When replying questions about the language used by the 999
operators, Hunt said all the telecommunications officers speak
English and Cantonese and two-thirds of them can speak Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts are being made to encourage all the officers
to be "tri-lingual and bi-literate," including arranging courses
for the officers and giving them appropriate training, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Price Slumps To 18-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) - The price of gold fell to its
lowest since 1970s with the London market fixing the morning price
on Tuesday at 281.80 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Although the price recovered one dollar in the afternoon
price-fixing session, it still fell 1.60 dollars an ounce on the
day.
</P>
<P>
Gold was last at that level on July 3, 1979 - though it soared
to end that year at 524 dollars an ounce and reached 850 dollars
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady slide in the price during the 1980s and
1990s as bullion lost its investment appeal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the latest fall came as investment funds
short-sold gold again and Australian mining companies have moved
to hedge future production.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was also damaged by the national campaign in
South Korea to persuade citizens to sell personal gold jewelry
for dollars.
</P>
<P>
The campaign began on Monday and a further 6.8 tons were handed
in on Tuesday, bringing the total to ten tons, valued at about 100
million dollars on world markets.
</P>
<P>
The gold price has also been under pressure after comments by
Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that with
inflation under control, deflation could prove to be a problem for
the U.S. economy in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been worried by signs that central banks, which
hold reserves sufficient to meet worldwide demand for the next ten
years, are considering disposing of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Central Bank last year admitted selling two
thirds of its stocks - the first time a leading gold producer had
disposed of its reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Central Bank -- one of the largest institutional gold
holders -- has also hinted that it may sell 1400 tons.
</P>
<P>
The market is likely to remain nervous before publication of
the Gold Fields Mineral Services report on Thursday, which will
provide estimates of supply and demand last year and could reveal
if any central banks have made further disposals.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Stable operation has enabled
the Fujian Industrial Bank, located in east China's Fujian
Province, to grow into a powerful regional bank, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The joint-stock bank, established in 1988, had 30 billion
yuan in total assets, 3.5 billion yuan in net assets, and 2.7
billion yuan in profits at the end of November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank's network has expanded to include 10 provincial
branches, 20 sub-branches and 31 representative offices, in
addition to its affiliated Fujian Industrial Securities Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, the Fujian Industrial Bank has
attached great importance to improving its operation to meet the
needs for the development of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank has granted 75 billion yuan in loans to support pillar
industries, major enterprises and key projects in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the bank has raised 159 million US
dollars in commercial or syndicated loans from the international
market to promote the development of Fujian's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the bank's stable operation is partly
reflected by its emphasis on establishing and improving internal
control mechanisms and preventing and limiting financial risks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Baht's Fall Still Unpredictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The grim moment has eventually
come when the Thai currency has devalued by more than 100 percent
in exchange with the U.S. dollar since its float last year and it
is expected to continue its fall although the extent of the
decline is hard to predict.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the second trading day in the new year, the
exchange rate sank 2.3 baht to close at a historical low of 52.2
baht to the dollar, after dipping to as low as 52.75 in local
trade.
</P>
<P>
Offshore, the baht fared even worse, dropping to as low as
54.75 per dollar before picking up to close at 52.50/53.00.
</P>
<P>
The baht's nose-dive on Wednesday followed the slide on Monday
when the currency closed at 49.9 onshore and 50.10/50.40 offshore
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Before it was floated on July 2, the Thai currency's exchange
rate had been pegged, for 13 years, to a basket of foreign
currencies, with the U.S. dollar weighing about 80 percent. In
most of the 13 years, the baht moved within a very small range of
between 25.50 and 26.50 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Compared with its pre-float value of 25.79 to the dollar, the
baht has plunged by 100 percent against the dollar when the
exchange rate hits 51.58 baht. This means that a baht holder will
have to pay exactly twice as much to buy one U.S. dollar and his
assets in dollar terms are worth half as much as before the float.
</P>
<P>
The free fall of the baht in recent weeks has been primarily
driven by an investor confidence crisis, locally and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Before New Year's Day, Prime Minster Chuan Leekpai said that
the Thai economy would not start bottoming out until the third
quarter, instead of the earlier-predicted second quarter, of 1998
and that because of the impact of the regional money markets, the
baht will experience further turbulence before it stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, although Thailand has enjoyed a surplus in foreign
trade in recent months, demand for dollars still outstrips supply
in the domestic market as local corporations buy forward cover to
hedge against future foreign debt repayments.
</P>
<P>
Another critical factor pushing the baht downward is the
capital flight of about 3 billion U.S. dollars per month. The
withdrawal of about 100 million dollars per day by foreign
investors from the country creates added demand for the greenback
in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A treasury dealer said that at 50-52 baht to the dollar, there
are not going to be many players willing to speculate short term
in the market. The demand for dollars is very real and comes from
local firms needing to repay their foreign debt and foreign
investors pulling out of their baht-denominated assets.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Suthee Losoponkul, vice president of
Nakornthon Bank, there are three main factors driving down
confidence in the baht: the country's relatively high level of
foreign debt, which exceeds its gross domestic product; the fact
that a large proportion of foreign debt is short-term; and that
most foreign borrowing had not been hedged for currency risk
before the baht was floated.
</P>
<P>
Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had misjudged the
real strength of the baht as it did not expect that the currency
could have plummeted to such a low in six months after its float.
</P>
<P>
When the IMF signed its 17.2 billion dollar bailout package
with Thailand in early August last year, the program was based on
an estimate of about 33 baht to the dollar, much higher than the
present exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the IMF at that time believed incorrectly, and acted
accordingly, that Thailand's monetary crisis was only an isolated
case and that it would not be adversely affected by other
currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Now the question is that if the IMF, which is supposed to have
the world's top-most economic wizards, made misjudgments and
miscalculations, who on earth at this stage can predict how much
lower the baht will sink?
</P>
<P>
But one thing seems certain: With so many adverse domestic and
regional factors and the IMF's suspected wrong medicine, the
baht's decline will continue for some time.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Official Complains about Arrest of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETWON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Abu Sillah, president of the
professional Drivers Association, said today that he is currently
negotiating with Nigerian troops in ECOMOG in Sierra Leone for
the release of over 15 drivers arrested and detained at the Jui
checkpoint since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint is 13 miles east of the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
According to Sillah, five trucks from Kono and Konoma in the
east, and Bo in the south conveying produce and other essential
foodstuffs to Freetown were intercepted by the troops.
</P>
<P>
He said another vehicle belonging to the state-run National
Petroleum Company with 1,800 gallons of diesel for Nakoni in the
north as well as nine trucks going to neighbouring Guinea were
also intercepted.
</P>
<P>
Sillah said passengers on board the vehicles were allowed to
remove perishable goods such as cassava, potatoes and oranges
from the vehicles on Sunday but were not allowed to take away
cash crops such as cocoa and coffee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some of the drivers were airlifted without
explanation to another ECOMOG base manned by Nigerian soldiers at
the Lungi International Airport, some 10 miles across the Sierra
Leone estuary.
</P>
<P>
Sillah said when his office was contacted about the incident,
he visited the ECOMOG base at Jui but was referred to ECOMOG
Military Intelligence Unit at Kossoh Town, two miles from Jui.
</P>
<P>
"The officers said they had received orders from the ECOMOG
High Command in Liberia to intercept commercial vehicles," Sillah
added.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the officers as saying, "our action is part of the
economic sanction on Sierra Leone which we are now enforcing."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the military junta has protested to
ECOWAS headquarters in Nigeria over what it called "the inhuman
treatment" of two Lieutenants in the Sierra Leone People's Army
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said the two military officers in separate
incidents were punched, kicked and stripped bare by Nigerian
soldiers when they found a pistol and some light arms on board
their vehicles. The junta described the action by the Nigerian
soldiers as barbaric and the culprits should be disciplined.

FREETOWN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian jet belonging to
the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG dropped at
least three cluster bombs on the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown
at 08:00 hours local time, sending market women into flight and

It was not immediately known why the bombs were dropped or the

The Xinhua correspondent heard the bombing sound in the west

This is the first time the jet had dropped bombs in the city

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ringgit Recovers After Bank Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's currency ringgit
recovered from an intra-day low to settle at 4.5900 to the U.S.
dollar Wednesday after intervention by the State Bank.
</P>
<P>
The local currency touched its lowest intra-day level of 4.8800
earlier in the day. But the day's closing level was still lower
when compared to Tuesday's close of 4.3450/50 as the demand for
the U.S. dollar remained strong.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was seen intervening in the foreign exchange
market to sell U.S. dollars at a range of 4.600 to 4.800 earlier
in the day, pushing the ringgit sharply up to 4.5900, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no fundamental reasons for the dollar/ringgit to go
up that high. The ringgit is just tracking the regional currencies
such as the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht which had fallen
quite badly," one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The current regional financial crisis continued to put pressure
on the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, the ringgit was on a continuous
downward trend. On Monday, the ringgit breached the level of four
ringgit against the greenback due to prolonged commercial interest
for the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local unit ended Monday at 4.0550/50 to the dollar from
last Friday's close of 3.9250./50.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said in a statement issued earlier in the day that the
ringgit had now become grossly undervalued in an environment of
highly unstable market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said "intervention operations" had been conducted to ensure
the efficient functioning of the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"While Malaysia will continue to pursue a policy of flexible
exchange rates, these rates should reflect the underlying
fundamentals. It should not be a situation in which the exchange
rate determines the fundamentals," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for an open economy such as Malaysia, these
developments, if allowed to persist over a prolonged period, will
be damaging to the economic and financial fundamentals.

<HEADLINE> Second U.S. Noted Figure Killed in Skiing in a Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Representative
Sonny Bono, an avid skier, died when he skied into a tree Monday
at a resort on the Nevada-California line, reports reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Bono had been reported missing two hours before
his body was found at 6:45 p.m. Monday near South Lake Tahoe on
the California-Nevada border, about 90 kilometers south of Reno,
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
He was killed when he hit a tree, resort officials was quoted
as saying. Bono, who had skied at the resort for more than 20
years, was killed when he was skiing with his family.
</P>
<P>
A Bono spokesman, Frank Cullen Jr., said he was at the resort
in a family vacation. "He was a very proficient skier. He skied
frequently with his family and, yes, he was an athletic guy,"
Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
Bono had skied on ahead of other family members when the
accident happened.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Mary Whitaker, reported him missing about the time
the resort closed at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Bono's death came less than a week after Michael Kennedy,
39-year-old son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, was killed in a
skiing accident.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was also killed when he smashed into a tree in playing
football on a ski slope in Aspen, Colorado, on the Eve of New Year.
</P>
<P>
Learning the news of Bono's death today, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said he was saddened.
</P>
<P>
"His joyful entertainment of millions earned him celebrity, but
in Washington he earned respect by being a witty and wise
participant in policymaking processes that often seem ponderous to
the American people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he and his colleagues "lost a
very, very dear friend."
</P>
<P>
Flags were lowered to half staff over the Capitol in Washington
where Bono was serving his second term in the House.
</P>
<P>
He was elected mayor of Palm Springs in 1988 and was elected to
the House in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Forty people were murdered in
two Rwandan communes of Central Gitarama Prefecture early this
week, officials in the area told the Rwanda News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
According to Col. Balthazar Ndengeyinka, Commander of
Gitarama-Kibuye Brigade, a large group of "Interahamwe" militia
armed with guns, machetes, and axes massacred 14 peasants Monday
night in Nyabikenke commune, north of Gitarama town.
</P>
<P>
"The attack occurred at 7:00 p.m and was perpetrated by
assailants from neighbouring Ndusu commune in northern Ruhengeri
prefecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two people were critically wounded and are currently being
treated at Kabgayi Hospital in Gitarama. The victims included two
genocide orphans as well as two grass-root administrative
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The same Monday night, another group of "Interahamwe"
militiamen attacked Nyakabanda commune, killing 26 people using
guns, grenades, and all sorts of traditional weapons.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Biggest Toys Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, the world's leading
toy exporter, opened Asia's largest toys show here Wednesday
with the participation of a record number of exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
At the 24th Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair, more than 1,400 toys
manufacturers and dealers from 27 countries and regions have set
up their display stalls, occupying a total of 46,000 square meters
in five halls at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Both the number of exhibitors and the exhibition space have
increased by nearly 50 percent compared with the previous fair in
1996, according to the organizer, the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The exhibition zone is divided into eight sections, featuring a
 variety of products -- soft toys and dolls, mechanical toys and
action figures, educational toys and games, battery-operated and
electronic toys, baby toys, gifts, outdoor and sporting items,
and parts and accessories.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 local toy makers are taking part in the four-day
fair.
</P>
<P>
"We're still the world's leading exporters of toys and the
industry is growing bigger and better," said Edmund Young,
chairman of the TDC Toys Advisory Committee, at the opening
ceremony Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success of Hong Kong toy companies to their
consistent focus on high quality and innovative designs.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1997, Hong Kong's total exports of
toys reached 77.76 billion HK dollars (about 10 billion U.S.
dollars), up 10 percent from the same period of 1996, according to
Young.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October in 1997, exports to the United
States, which took in nearly half of Hong Kong's exports of toys,
also rose by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to predict the performance in 1998,
Young said: "We can expect continued demand from many key markets
like the United States and Western Europe."

<HEADLINE> Indian People Tired of Instability: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua)-- A.B. Vajpayee, senior leader of
India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its candidate for prime
minister, said Wednesday that people are tired of instability and
are looking forward to a stable government.
</P>
<P>
"They see the BJP, the biggest opposition party in India, as
the only option before them," he said at a press conference in
Jalna, Maharashtra State during his campaign tour.
</P>
<P>
The electorate would give a clear-cut verdict in the coming
general elections and there is no possibility of a hung
parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of BJP and its allies will definitely succeed
as it would emerge as the single largest party with others
supporting it," he said.
</P>
<P>
On economic issues, Vajpayee said the government has a role to
play in providing basic infrastructural facilities like power and
roads.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Toy Exports to Grow Ten Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, the world's biggest
exporter of toys, continued to hold its leading position in 1997
with a predicted ten percent growth.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten month of 1997, Hong Kong exported toys worth
77.76 billion HK dollars (ten billion U.S. dollars), an
encouraging rise of ten percent over the same period of 1996 given
the general market downturn in Asia, said Edmund Young, chairman
of the Trade Development Council's Toy Advisory Committee,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Toys and
Games Fair which opened here Wednesday, Young added that exports
of toys to the United States also went up by ten percent between
January and October last year. As the biggest export market for
Hong Kong toys, the United States took in 48.4 percent of the
Special Administrative Region's exports.
</P>
<P>
Other leading markets, including Japan, Western Europe, China's
inland areas and Canada, also registered substantial increases in
imports from Hong Kong, according to Young.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent financial turbulence in Asia, Young still
expected steadily growing demand from many key markets like the
United States and Western Europe in 1998. He said that South
America and the Middle East would be the fastest growing markets
in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong derives 70 percent of the industry sales from
licensing and contract manufacturing for overseas toy companies,
and the rest from making brand toys for overseas proprietary
product manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong toy companies have moved their factories to inland
provinces of China and other Asian countries to take advantage of
inexpensive labor and lower rents there. Currently, 95 percent of
Hong Kong's exports of toys are originated from the Chinese
inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Improvement Called Key to Relieving Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economist said today
that ecological improvement might be a key to relieving poverty in
the mountainous areas of China where 84 percent of the country's
592 poor counties are located.
</P>
<P>
Most of the needy people who live in these areas suffer from
serious ecological destruction on northwest China's loess plateau,
or in southwest China's Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces and
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, noted Shi Shan, vice-president
of the Ecological Economics Association of China.
</P>
<P>
The bad ecological factors in these areas include serious soil
erosion, the comparatively slow pace of replacing forests, the
rapid increase of sludge in rivers and lakes, and the degradation
of grasslands, Shi told a symposium on sustainable development in
poor rural areas which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Ecologically friendly farming and integrated agricultural
development in river valleys have been feasible methods to improve
the ecology, he said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to provide enough food and clothing for 80 million
needy people during the 1994-2000 period. To date, only about 28
percent of the plan has been realized, with 58 million needy
people remaining to be fed, the symposium was told.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium is being sponsored by the China
Association for Science and Technology and the Amity Foundation, a
non-governmental organization which receives donations mainly from
overseas to aid China's needy people.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Football's international
governing body, FIFA, Wednesday ruled out any joint hosting of
the 2006 World Cup finals by England and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The federation made it clear the 2002 finals in South Korea and
Japan was a special case not to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Speculation mounted after Germany's bid chief Franz Beckenbauer
said his country would not oppose sharing the 2006 finals with
England. The two nations have launched campaigns that threaten to
turn into a costly and damaging rivalry before a decision is made
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Both England and German have good claims and there is no point
in them making a bid together," said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper,
speaking at the Football Expo '98 fair in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"As far as FIFA is concerned it is not an option as Japan and
South Korea was a one off.
</P>
<P>
"We are between the devil and the deep blue sea. We are not
considering it but if another finals was co-hosted it would mean
that every World Cup is co-hosted."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Port Places 12th in World Container Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- With last year's container
handling volume topping 2.5 million TEUs, the entry port of
Shanghai now ranks 12th in the world.
</P>
<P>
This largest port in China is marching toward the world's Top
Ten, said an official from the Hong Kong Oriental Overseas
Shipping Group, predicting that the port's handling capacity is
expected to reach 14 million TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units)
by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The port's sustainable annual growth rate, which has averaged
25 percent in recent years, has guaranteed its momentum. In 1995
the Shanghai port entered the world's Top 20 with its total volume
posting 1.53 million TEUs. A year later, it had 1.9 million TEUs,
ranking 17th in the world. Last year, its container shipping
volume increased 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's fast-growing economy and its role as China's largest
commercial and manufacturing center have been the major reasons
for the port's dramatic expansion, which now handles one quarter
of the country's international cargo shipping and a third of the
country's container shipping.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has nearly 20 shipping routes accommodating 281
dockings monthly to more than 50 countries and regions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Shipping Trade Center was set up in November 1996
to standardize Shanghai's port transportation. It finished 36
million tons of cargo trade by the end of October 1997.
</P>
<P>
China plans to upgrade container ports in east China's Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces on the eastern coast to make them part of
an international container shipping hub. The construction will be
centered in Shanghai with an administrative institute set up here
last year.
</P>
<P>
Some projects have been launched, such as the rebuilding of
three container berths and massive dredge work in the deepwater
lane at the Yangtze River mouth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the headquarters of the China Ocean Shipping Corp,
one of the four largest shipping groups in the world, will be
moved to the municipality this year.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched in HK Against Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Business Software Alliance
(BSA) launched here Wednesday its new year campaign against
corporate software piracy in small and medium-sized businesses
(SMBs).
</P>
<P>
A survey commissioned by the BSA last year found that many SMBs
in Hong Kong were taking serious risks by using illegal software,
said Tom Robertson, vice president of the alliance which groups
leading software producers such as Lotus, Microsoft and Novell.
</P>
<P>
Their piracy has led to huge losses to the software industry in
Hong Kong, Robertson claimed.
</P>
<P>
The campaign grants the firms 45 days to legalize their
software use or face legal action.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the BSA had taken high-profile actions against
illegal software use in large companies. A total of 18 cases have
so far been settled with 5.8 million HK dollars (740,000
U.S. dollars) recovered.
</P>
<P>
According to Kevin Henshaw, the BSA's Hong Kong chairman, the
alliance will also continue its efforts in educating the business
community on responsible software use. The first seminar will be
held in March for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged local business organizations to join the BSA in
eradicating software piracy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on an increased number of raids carried out in the
past several months by the Special Administrative Region
authorities against software piracy, Henshaw said, "Their action
should be commended."
</P>
<P>
A new Copyright Ordinance, which came into force in June 1997,
contains several new provisions strengthening the Customs and
Excise Department's ability to fight corporate end-user and retail
software piracy.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1988, the BSA represents the software industry in its
efforts to eradicate the illegal copying, sale and distribution of
computer software around the world. It achieves this through
educational initiatives and legal proceedings.

MACAO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Macao's inflation for the first 11
months of 1997 reached 3.6 percent, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
on Wednesday also show that inflation rate for the 12-month period
dating back from last November reached 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The composite consumer price index (CCPI) in November grew 2.4
percent from the same month in 1996. But it dropped 0.2 percent
from last October.
</P>
<P>
The price decline in November was due mainly to lower cost of
transportation and foodstuff excluding alcoholic drinks. But the
price index of garments and footwear rose a bit in November.
</P>
<P>
Macao's economic growth has been slowing down since 1993, and
the growth rate of 1997 is estimated at less than one percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes at New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The besieged Australian dollar
continued to falter Wednesday, hitting a new 11-year low of 63.19
US cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 63.43 US cents, little changed
from Tuesday's finish of 63.47 but barely holding above key
support levels at 63.20 after plumbing new depths in midday trade.
</P>
<P>
A rampant US dollar and plummeting Asian currencies have kept
the local unit on its toes, with traders ascribing it to a "sell
the rally" mentality.
</P>
<P>
The Australia dollar was last at these levels in October 1986
when it was recovering from its historic post-float low of 57.10
US cents in July 1986.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia senior foreign exchange dealer Darrin Stewart
said current support levels for the Australian dollar at 63.20 US
cents would depend on the US dollar/yen exchange rate and
developments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no real support. If the Aussie doesn't go down today
it'll go down later in the week," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is any significant news out from the Fed or some
concerted intervention, the Aussie will continue to probe lower
levels over the next few days," he added.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian currencies led by the Indonesian rupiah
continued their fall to record lows against the US dollar
following Indonesian President Soeharto's budget speech on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer refused to comment
on the value of the Australian dollar, saying the Australian
economy is well set to weather the Asian storm.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in good shape," Fischer said in response to
questions from journalists.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 84.61 yen,
from 85.83 Tuesday and at 1.1634 marks, from 1.1628.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Exchanges Between Judicial Departments of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Exchange of visits and cooperation
 between judicial departments of Macao and China's inland areas in
1997 promoted mutual friendship and understanding, contributing
to the smooth transition in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Six Chinese judicial delegations visited Macao last year. They
included such high-level delegations as the Chinese Prison Society
 and high-ranking procurators of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
In return, Macao sent four high-level delegations to Beijing,
Xi'an and Hangzhou. Director of the Macao Justice Department
Carlos Dias, President of the Supreme Court of Justice Manuel
Antonio Maduro, Assistant General Procurator Antonio Simoes
Redinha, and Chief Commissioner of the Anti-Corruption and
Anti-Illegal Administration Commission of Macao Luis de Mendonca
Freitas joined the delegations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the exchange of visits, legal experts and lawyers of
both Macao and the inland jointly hosted several seminars last
year on the new Code of Criminal Procedure of Macao, intellectual
property rights, and legal issues in the transitional period of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Lawyers Association of Macao jointly hosted
a "Pearl River Delta Law Conference" with its counterparts in Hong
Kong and neighboring Guangdong province, South China, last
November. Lawyers of Macao, Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Shenzhen met for
the first time to exchange views on legal issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of books on the study of Macao's legal
system and laws were published in the inland or Macao with
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the exchange of visits and cooperation
between Macao and the inland in the past year covered a wide range
of issues.
</P>
<P>
"The increased contacts in the legal field between the two
places will not only help promote understanding and friendship, it
is also helpful to a smooth handover of power and the prosperity
of Macao," said an analyst who prefers not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The localization of law, he said, remained one of the major
issues in the bilateral contacts. That will help promote the
successful localization of law in the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
As 1999 approaches, further contacts between the two sides are
needed to pave the way for a smooth handover of power.

<HEADLINE> Swimming Worlds Farewells Unlimited Underwater Kick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The 8th world swimming
championships will farewell the unlimited underwater kick that
many say has revolutionized the butterfly stroke, and which
Australia's Michael Klim used to break the world 100m record in
October.
</P>
<P>
The International Swimming Federation (FINA) decided days
before the world championships to limit underwater butterfly to 15
meters from the start and from turns.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Dennis Pankratov of Russian dived for
35-to-40 meters of the first 50 meters in the 100m butterfly at
the Atlanta Olympics, where he set the previous world record of
52.27 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Klim dived for 25 meters to break that record, setting the new
mark of 52.15 seconds at Australia's world championship trials in
Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
American Misty Hyman, currently ranked world No.1 in the
women's 100m butterfly, has reached today's fame mainly by kicking
underwater.
</P>
<P>
Of the current world long-course butterfly records, only two
were not set using the underwater kick -- the women's 100m and
200m marks set by American Mary Meagher in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will come into force on March 6, FINA announced
after January 5 congress.
</P>
<P>
The other rule changes include the reintroduction of
semi-finals in swimming, which were last conducted in 1976. How
this rule is to be applied will be decided by the FINA Bureau
later.
</P>
<P>
World records for 50m backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly
will now be recognized, as it already the case for competitions in
world short-course championships, according to the world swimming
ruling body.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been opposing the inclusion of 50m races
in the events except freestyle. It's also against the
reintrodution of the semi-finals and the limit of the underwater
kick.
</P>
<P>
Hyman's coach, Bob Gillett, had been lobbying for the unlimited
underwater kick prior to the Perth Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"The underwater fly or fish kick is innovative, it's exciting.
It's fun. And it does fall under the current definition of
butterfly," he said in November's issue of the Swimming World.

LHASA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region is no longer an isolated place whose residents are more
eager to learn Chinese and foreign languages as a means to
communicate with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 private schools have opened in Lhasa, capital of

<P>
Lhasa Language School, located on Bargor Street in the city's

Six one-story classrooms are crowded with Tibetan students

<HEADLINE> 356 Detained Over Drug in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Anti-narcotics unit in Kampala
detained 356 suspects over drug dealing and possession last year,
''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,900 kilograms of cannabis have been recovered and
980 plants destroyed in the period.
</P>
<P>
At the Entebbe airport alone, the authorities have arrested 32
people, most of them foreigners, for the possession of drugs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was used by drug smugglers as an intermediary station
from Latin America and Asia to Europe and the U.S. in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that anti-narcotic unit in the country
arrested only one tenth of the drug smugglers due to lack of
equipment to detect drugs.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, Uganda is now buying new equipment
and sending its anti-narcotic personnel abroad for training, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Employers in Malaysia Urged Not to Reduce Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Malaysian
trades union Congress (MTUC) Wednesday urged employers in Malaysia
not to reduce workers but to work out a mutual arrangement so that
workers can still keep their jobs amid the current economic
setback faced by the country.
</P>
<P>
MTUC President Zainal Rampak said in a statement that employers
should first consult the trade unions before embarking on any
downsizing, retrenchment or closure exercise.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that through negotiation and dialogue sessions
between workers and employers, a mutually acceptable arrangement
can be worked out so that workers can keep their jobs and there
will be industrial peace and harmony," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MTUC chief said companies employing non-unionized workers
should first approach the Human Resources Ministry for
consultation before initiating any measures that might affect
their workers.
</P>
<P>
He said the MTUC had written to Human Resources Minister Lim Ah
Lek on January 1 asking him to convene a meeting of the National
Labor Advisory Council to examine recent developments.
</P>
<P>
It would be unwise for companies to prematurely lay off workers
or close down their operations in Malaysia under the pretext that
it was no longer viable to do business here, as Malaysia was not
the only one affected by the foreign exchange problem, Zainal
said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Night Schools Draw a Crowd in Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, more than 10,000 students have studied in the school
since it opened nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa Sparetime Language School, Lozhu, a lama in red
kasaya, concentrated on his conversation book in English, Tibetan
and Chinese. He frequently made notes on the margins in pencil.
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old lama from Johkang monastery which is a major
antique temple in Tibet, has been studying English here for six
months.
</P>
<P>
"I will be able to introduce the monastery in English to
foreign tourists," he said. More and more lamas such as Lozhu are
paying the tuition themselves to study languages.
</P>
<P>
Many young people have found satisfactory jobs after studying
in the language school, and more people have begun applying to
study here, said Nyima, headmaster of the school.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believe that these private schools play a
positive role in the educational development of Tibet, and have
fine prospects.
</P>
<P>
When night falls, the lights of the night schools form a sharp
contrast with the neon lights in downtown Lhasa. Headmaster Losang
said, "Tibetan people need book shops, libraries and night schools
more than bars, dancing halls and billiard rooms."

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index lost 71.06 points to close at 1,368.06
points on Wednesday, hitting the lowest level in five years.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the further plunge of the share prices reflected
investors' concerns over the continuing fall of regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
They said that the fall of the currencies was attributed to the
spill-over of negative sentiment over an austerity budget for
Indonesia's next fiscal year, which was unveiled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 202.66 million units,
valued at 369.89 million Singapore dollars (about 208.98 million
U.S. dollars). Declines again overwhelmed advances by 329 to 43,
while 240 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Engineering was the most actively traded counter
as it registered a turnover of 12.05 million units. It was
followed by DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Land which had
7.56 million shares traded. RHB Capital was next with 6.54 million
shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Asean Fund led the gainers of the day as it rose by 50 cents to
finish at eight Singapore dollars. Roth Singapore increased by 35
cents to end at 8.85 Singapore dollars. GP Bat picked up by 22
cents to close at 4.52 Singapore dollars.
</P>

declined by 2.6 Singapore dollars to end at 31 Singapore dollars.
Parkway Warrant98 fell by 69 cents to close at 61 Singapore cents,
while MISC Foreign was 66 cents lower to finish at 1.81 Singapore
dollars.

BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 British
universities for the first time will show their academic pride
with an exhibition before a nation with a 5,000-year-old
educational tradition this weekend in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the biggest one on international education in

<HEADLINE> Zambia's State of Emergency Worries EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
deeply concerned about the continuing state of emergency in
Zambia, particularly the arrest of opposition leaders, The Post
paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The EU, in a statement issued by the outgoing Luxembourg
Presidency on all EU members and released in Lusaka today, urged
the Zambian government to either charge or release opposition
leaders, namely former president Kenneth Kaunda and Dean
Mung'omba of Zambia Democratic Congress, according to the
independent paper.
</P>
<P>
"The EU urges the government of Zambia to complete their
investigation into all those detained under the current state of
emergency and in particular leaders of the opposition parties
with all speed and either charge or release them," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, leader of the country's largest opposition party, the
United National Independence Party, was arrested last December
and later shifted to house arrest for alleged involvement into an
abortive coup last October.
</P>
<P>
While Mung'omba was detained by police two days after
President Frederick Chiluba declared the state emergency
following the foiled coup on October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a response to external pressures to push for the release of
opposition leaders, Chiluba Monday denounced donor countries,
particularly Britain and the U.S., over their opposition to his
state of emergency and detention of Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
He also advised other African heads of state to be wary of
"colonial masters" whose reoccupation, he said, was "to divide
and rule."

</P>
<P>
-- A study conducted from 1991 to 1995 in the Paris region,
Ile-de-France, said that pollution accelerates the installation of
chronical respiratory diseases, such as asthuma, among children. The

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Industry Becoming Powerhouse (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry is
becoming a new powerhouse of the national economy after the sector
completed a strategic shift from military production to civilian
application.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, Zhang Huazhu, deputy general
manager of the China Nuclear Industry Corp., explained that the
adjustment, which has taken two decades to complete, was designed
to improve the industrial structure and development plans for the
country's nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
"China's nuclear industry is now operating under a new system
featuring a combination of military and civilian production,
development of nuclear power and a diversified economy, with
nuclear as the foundation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the nuclear sector has established a large
number of enterprise groups over the past few years in the
economically-developed coastal areas such as Shanghai, east China,
and Guangdong Province of south China and has developed more than
1,500 kinds of civilian products.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear industrial economy has been expanding in China by
maintaining a high growth rate in a succession of years, resulting
in remarkable improvement in the country's comprehensive economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output of civilian products now makes up over 80
percent of China's nuclear industrial output, which is 20 times
the total when adjusting efforts first began.
</P>
<P>
Development of nuclear power is a major way for the industry to
make strategic adjustments, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station of east China's Zhejiang
Province and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in south China's
Guangdong Province have been operating safely and their combined
annual power output is three times the equivalent of China's total
power generation in 1952.
</P>
<P>
The two nuclear power stations have not only alleviated
electric power shortages in east China and Guangdong, but also
have transmitted a large quantity of power to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two nuclear power stations, which are now under commercial
operation, have both been economically viable. Per-capita annual
output of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is more than 4
million yuan, while per-capita annual output of the first phase of
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station exceeds 700,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that the investment return rate of nuclear
power development is not lower than that of coal-burning electric
power stations. The nuclear industry with power development as its
main feature has become a new powerhouse of China's national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the second and third phases of Qinshan, and the
Ling'ao and Lianyungang nuclear power stations are all in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
By early next century China's nuclear power generating capacity
should amount to 9.2 million kilowatts and, by then, earnings from
sales of nuclear power are expected to reach 30 billion yuan a
year. The industrial structure of the country's nuclear industry
will be further improved at that point, coupled with improved
economy and technology.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power now contributes one percent of China's total
power output, but nuclear power makes up 17 percent of the world's
total power output. Clean and highly efficient, nuclear power has
advantages in the market based on a range of factors such as
energy structure, the environment and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces of east China, Hainan
Province of south China and Hunan Province of central-south China
have all been active in making preparations for constructing their
own nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
In the next century, China is expected to have a significant
development in nuclear power. By the year 2010 China's nuclear
power-generating capacity will reach 20 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
And, by 2020, China's nuclear power-generating capacity should
reach 40 million kilowatts and the proportion of nuclear power in
the country's total power production should increase to five
percent.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Killer Disease Named as Rift Valley Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts have said that
the mysterious disease which has claimed more than 300 lives and
killed hundreds of livestock in northeastern Kenya is likely to
be the Rift Valley Fever.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted Maina Kahindo, Head of the
Communicable and Vector Borne Control Division in Kenyan Health
Ministry, as saying that specimens of samples so far analyzed
"strongly identify the mysterious killer disease to be Rift
Valley Fever".
</P>
<P>
He said "our local analysis and that of South Africa's
Reference Laboratory strongly point to the Rift Valley Fever."
</P>
<P>
Kahindo noted that a field surveillance team comprising
medical and veterinary experts and entomologists had been
established in the affected areas in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, two leading virologists in the
country are still analyzing samples for various haemorrhagic
fevers whose symptoms are bleeding from body orifices and "that
is why we are yet to conclusively say what this epidemic is."
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes
and is predominantly found in domestic animals. It can also
affect human beings exposed to heavy infection by direct contact
with infected animals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cholera Situation Stabilized in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of cholera in
Mozambique has been brought under control since late last
December, the health authority said.
</P>
<P>
Avertino Barreto, Deputy Director of the National Health
Department was quoted by Noticias Paper as saying in Maputo
Tuesday that since the last three deaths on December 27, no
further deaths have reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said only five patients were hospitalized Monday,
compared to between 200 to 300 daily at the height of the
outbreak last November.
</P>
<P>
The cholera outbreak in Mozambique has claimed 267 lives since
it broke out last August. About 9,144 patients were registered.
</P>
<P>
Barreto also disclosed that the authorities have closed one of
the two cholera treatment centers at the Maputo Central Hospital
and another in the suburban area, as the number of patients
decrease.
</P>
<P>
He, however, warned that some of the illegal food markets
closed by the government may stage a comeback and that the
unclean food sold at the markets is a major cause of the cholera
outbreak.

<HEADLINE> PNG Relief Supplies Halted After Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Relief food supply to one of
the worst affected drought-stricken provinces in Papua New Guinea
has been suspended after the looting and vandalism of a supply
truck, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trucking operator Pagini &AMP; Transwest, in a fax to rice supplier
Trukai, said it had halted all food deliveries from Mt. Hagen to
Enga province and that the delivery would not be resumed until the
safety of its workers was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
A truck carrying 25 tons of rice and 25 tons of cooking oil was
stopped and looted by a large crowd of people while on its way to
the Engan capital of Wabag on Monday, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The truck was escorted by police who were overwhelmed by the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new report by Australia's aid agency AusAID said
more than one million Papua New Guineans were now facing food
shortages because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
Trukai's marketing manager Neville Whitecross said 135 tons of
food supplies were in Mt. Hagen waiting to be delivered to the
province.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the looting incident, self-proclaimed chairman of a
local drought relief committee Ronald Rimbao said 70,000 people in
the Wapenamanda district of Enga were facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
He said his people would stage sit-ins along the highway and
stop vehicles unless the government acted.
</P>
<P>
Police have made no connection between Rimbao's threats and
Monday's incident.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Slams Foreign Link in Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has claimed that foreign
governments are behind the coup plot the government uncovered
last December, in which the head of state was slated to be
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations of the alleged plot had "indicated
possible foreign involvement, which included the collusions of
their diplomatic missions with the coup plotters in the foiled
coup plot," said Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, quoted by press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The actual details of the involvement was being investigated,
Ikimi told the corps of African ambassadors Tuesday in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, the coup suspects, including Chief of
General Staff Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya and 11 others, intended to
assassinate Head of State General Sani Abacha, some key military
officers and prominent civilians both in and out of the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said the motive of the coup suspects was to disrupt the
military regime's transition to civil rule program through the
alleged coup, which commenced three months before to government
took action to foil it on December 21 last year.
</P>
<P>
"They had also intended to put in its place a new extended
program in addition to the conspiracy to loot the nation's hard
earned foreign reserves," Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
He told the diplomats that the suspects would be tried
according to the Treason and Other Offenses Act of 1986, the
current law under which treason and other offenses committed by
military and civilian collaborators are tried.
</P>
<P>
The suspects would have ample opportunity to defend themselves
and obtain, if they so desire, legal representation from the
corps of military lawyers, in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Nigerian government briefed
foreigners on the botched coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Audio-video clips on the alleged coup plot have been shown to
top military officers, cabinet members, state administrators and
representatives of traditional rulers.
</P>
<P>
Media executives are reported to be given access to the
electronic documentary materials soon.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also gave details of the alleged coup plot during
Tuesday's meeting with the newly arrived U.S. Ambassador William
Twaddel, who reportedly could not offer any commitment on the
United States' position on the event.
</P>
<P>
The United States, among some other foreign countries, has
called for open and fair trial of the coup suspects.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Abacha urged Nigerians not to introduce
ethnic sentiments into the alleged coup issue, apparently a
response to speculations following the fact that most of those
arrested in connection with the coup plot are from the Yoruba
ethnic group in the west.
</P>
<P>
Everybody must strive to ensure national security and the
smooth execution of the transition program now than ever before,
Abacha told a delegation of traditional rulers from nine eastern
states.
</P>
<P>
The Abacha administration is scheduled to hand over power to
an elected government on October 1 this year, according to the
transition program.
</P>
<P>
It was disheartening that the persons involved in the coup
plot, who used to be his close confidants, would aim to derail
the program they had actively participated in, the head of state
said.

<HEADLINE> Red Blood Cells Found Intact on 400-year-old Human Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Experts in Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province, recently discovered complete red
blood cells in the lung of a 400-year-old male body. The cells'
shape reportedly was intact, and they had a clear structure and
bright color similar to that in living creatures.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Shanghai-based Wen Hui Daily, the body,
unearthed last July in Dantu County, was identified as the remains
of a county magistrate during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). His
surname was Jiang and he died at the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
"It is unimaginable that 400-year-old red cells are still in
good conditions," said Xu Yongqing, a researcher from the Shanghai
Museum of Natural History, adding that the discovery is the first
of its kind in China's ancient corpse research.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that in previous cases only remains of cells
could be found. They considered the new discovery a key to the
mystery of how Chinese ancestors protected bodies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ringgit Undervalued: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Wednesday that
the local currency, the ringgit, has now become grossly
undervalued in an environment of highly unstable market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit dropped sharply to the 4.7 level against the U.S.
dollar at midday from 4.22 earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"While Malaysia will continue to pursue a policy of flexible
exchange rates, these rates should reflect the underlying
fundamentals. It should not be a situation in which the exchange
rate determines the fundamentals," Anwar said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that for an open economy such as Malaysia, these
developments, if allowed to persist over a prolonged period, will
be damaging to the economic and financial fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"Intervention operations" have been conducted to ensure stable
conditions to allow for the efficient functioning of the foreign
exchange market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Policies have now been put in place to ensure the medium and
long-term prospects of the economy, Anwar said, adding, "We are
confident that these policies will increase the resilience of the
economy and financial system in adjusting during this difficult
period."

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's State Enterprise Reform to Take More Challenges in 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: To closely follow the development of China's
economy and the reform in economic life, we are offering a column,
Observation of China Economy, which will analyze and comment on
the major economic events and trends in the country on a weekly
basis. The column will be available on Wednesdays, except for New
Year's Day of the Chinese Lunar Calendar (Jan. 28). This is the
first of a series of columns.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- As Chinese people step into the
Year of Tiger, the nickname for the year 1998 on the Chinese Lunar
Calendar, the country's far-reaching reform in state-owned
enterprises will enter a special period featuring both great
opportunities to make historical breakthroughs and rough
challenges from the old economic structure.
</P>
<P>
By resorting to reform means such as regrouping, mergers and
bankruptcy, China will revamp its 5,500 debt-ridden large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises during the 1998-2000 period.
The reform will be launched first in 2,000 such enterprises this
year. Two million workers will be laid off.
</P>
<P>
Because of the more mature market economy and a growing trend
toward economic globalization, all the problems affecting
enterprise reform have "deep roots" in the present system and are
not easy to resolve, said Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have no time to postpone the solution of these
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest State Statistical Bureau (SSB), all
87,000 state-owned enterprises generated 34.2 billion yuan in
profits during the first 11 months of last year, an increase over
the same period in 1996. But the number of enterprises losing
money accounted for one-third of the total. The losses of such
enterprises was a staggering 70.5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's State Enterprise Reform to Take More Challenges in 1998 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government intends to stem losses in the
state-owned sector within three year. The reform goals include
establishing a modern enterprise system with firms running in the
red, encouraging mergers to form powerful conglomerates and moving
redundant workers to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented reform will begin with the textile industry,
which had suffered losses for three consecutive years and employs
1.8 million workers.
</P>
<P>
To make the industry into cost-efficient, the government will
reduce the 4.8 million spindles in the coastal provinces in east
China this year and relocate 600,000 workers to other jobs. The
industry expects to reduce the losses by three billion yuan
compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of spindles to be reduced and workers to be laid off
account for 50 percent of the total under the three-year reform
plan of the government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists said that, compared with other industrial
sectors, the textile industry suffers the most severe financial
trouble, the highest losses and the most workers. The textile
industry reform will be significant in the country's efforts in
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will allocate 40 billion yuan to write
off the bad debts of the large and medium-size state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country will also encourage the public listing of
enterprises with good performance to raise 100 billion yuan on
domestic and overseas stock markets. All funds raised by the
enterprises will be used in adjusting the product mix, launching
technical renovation and acquiring other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of SSB, said that the smooth
macro-economic operation in 1997 -- in addition to a relatively
abundant supply of energy, raw materials and farm produce and a
better fiscal situation -- provided solid guarantee for future
reforms.

<P>
On the other hand, steady growth in the national economy this
year should be ensured with a "significant breakthrough" in
state-owned enterprise reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasingly rough reform and readjustments in
the economic system and a possible small slump in the gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate this year, some negative
factors could be enhanced and threaten the ongoing enterprise
reform. These include financial trouble for the state-owned
enterprises, an increase in unemployed workers and poverty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said the government should pay close attention to the
change in these factors in the future.
</P>
<P>
The government should help debt-ridden enterprises adjust their
enterprise structure rather than simply issuing loans, and to
improve the management style and competitive edge of products,
according to Wang Tongsan and Liu Shucheng, two prominent
economists with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In enterprises in which products have little or no sales value
and debt is increasing, government loans should be used as living
stipends for workers rather than an investment in production.
</P>
<P>
The government has given the nod to these economists' ideas.
An official with State Economic and Trade Commission said that in
addition to helping enterprises earn more profit, the government
will speed up construction of a modern enterprise system this year
and promote the application of a shareholding system in the
state-owned sector. A number of enterprise groups also will be
established through mergers and re-organization.
</P>
<P>
Without an efficient enterprise system, the losses in
enterprises could be a lasting headache for the government, Qiu
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Rebounds After Hitting New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso rebounded
after touching a new of low of 46.50 pesos against the US dollar
in Wednesday's trading on the Philippine Dealing System (PDS).
</P>
<P>
The peso was averaged at 44.419 to the greenback at noon on the
PDS, the country's electronic currency exchange, and closed at
45.30 pesos to the dollar with a turnover of 203 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank raised the overnight borrowing rate by a
percentage point to 12 percent and said this will help the peso to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
The demand for the greenback also eased after the central bank
opened a temporary facility under which it sells short-term
non-deliverable forward contracts through the banks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
With the new low of 46.50, the peso has depreciated by about 76
percent since the currency crisis hit Southeast Asian nations in
early July last year.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises in Guangxi Get Rid of Random Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The practice of government
departments and official institutions imposing unauthorized fees
on state enterprises has been abolished in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
These random charges, which mainly came from arbitrary fund
raising, fines and requests for donations, amount to more than 250
million yuan annually, sources said. They have long been a sore
point for the enterprises in the region and have weakened their
ability to compete in the market.
</P>
<P>
A recent study in the region found 1,481 different charges,
1,131 of which were directed at the State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will abolish 377 more random charges early this year,
reducing enterprises' annual expenditure by as much as 100 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a nationwide campaign to get the
money-losing state-owned sector out of difficulties in three
years, as called for by the central government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Iraqi National Assembly Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people deeply sympathize with Iraqis who have suffered from United
Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin offered this remark here this morning
during his meeting with a delegation of the Iraqi National
Assembly led by Saadoun Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
"We have always held that the remaining issues of the Gulf War
should be settled at an early date on the basis of the relevant
resolutions of the United Nations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed the hope that Iraq would
continue to cooperate with the United Nations, properly handle and
improve its relations with the countries concerned with the goal
of winning more sympathy and support from the international
community and, eventually, that sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended a welcome to his Iraqi guests, saying that their
visit will further deepen the understanding and cooperation
between the Chinese National People's Congress and the Iraqi
National Assembly and play an active role in the promotion of
friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the
establishment of Sino-Iraqi diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with the smooth growth of bilateral ties and
is ready to further increase friendly cooperation with Iraq on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi spoke highly of China's rapid economic development and
its support to Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has maintained friendly relations with China for a long
time and hopes that such relations will grow even further, Hammadi
added.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary leader also briefed Jiang on the situation in
Iraq under the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Farming Resumes in Tanzania after Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in several
flood-stricken regions in Tanzania have resumed farm activities
on highland areas after heavy rains subsided, the Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official from the Mwanza Regional
Commissioner's office as saying that they have directed people to
embark on agricultural activities in highland areas to cushion
the effect of food shortages as a result of the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mara and Shinyanga regions said that local
authorities have urged people to prepare seeds ready for planting
when flooded areas dry up.
</P>
<P>
The Tabora Regional Commissioner, Stephen Mashishanga said
Tuesday that local residents have started reinforcing their farms
in both lowland and highland areas.
</P>
<P>
The food situation in the region is expected to improve after
the resumption of train services between Tabora and Mpanga.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) has
committed over 80,000 U.S. Dollars in assessing the 1997/98 crop
season in 14 regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
FAO representative Sulayman Sait M'boob said in Dar es Salaam
Tuesday that three teams will use hired planes and other vehicles
to carry out the task so as to come up with a thorough assessment
report.
</P>
<P>
Flood and drought have conspired to hit Tanzania last year,
making more than 1.4 million of this east African nation's 30
million population suffering from food shortage.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the FAO provided over 2.65 million U.S. Dollars for
drought relief and livestock disease control to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments have asked people to take
precautionary measures as excessive seasonal rains linked to El
Nino weather phenomenon may last till April.

JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South African police have
reached an agreement with their Lesotho counterpart to work
together to stop cross-border stock theft raids, local daily
Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police and officials from the foreign affairs departments of
the two countries met yesterday to discuss a cross-border
incident on New Year's day, in which at least seven people were
shot and hacked to death, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A team of policemen from Lesotho and South Africa would
investigate the incident, said a South African official.
</P>
<P>
South African farmers were alleged to have crossed into
Lesotho through KwaZulu Natal Province and stolen goats and
sheep. Lesotho residents retaliated, resulting in clashes that
left at least seven people dead.
</P>
<P>
Residents said up to 11 may have been killed, but mist and
harsh terrain were hampering the search. Police said it was
possible some of the bodies had been carried away.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Banks Targets Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
assured the public it will be able to achieve 6.5 to 7.5 percent
inflation rate this year despite financial market turmoil, the
Philippine News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted central bank governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that any inflationary pressures from the adjustment in the
peso-dollar rate resulting from the currency crisis will be
matched by a series of effective monetary measures to keep the
inflation rate acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The central bank already adopted the necessary measures that
will help stabilize prices in the market, Singson said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that latest preliminary data on base money and
reserve money showed an annual growth rate of between 15 to 23
percent, adding that domestic liquidity had stabilized since
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
He added that the monetary authorities will continue to rely on
open market operations and will continue to coordinate closely
with the private sector to contain any unnecessary infusion of
funds into the system.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate for 1997 declined to only 5.1
percent from the 1996 rate of 8.4 percent despite the currency
crisis which swamped across the Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has projected full-year inflation
rate at 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 1998, taking into account the
likely wage and oil price adjustments and further depreciation of
the peso.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Shortage Hits Zambian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange shortage hits
capital Lusaka, as a result of low earnings from metal sales and
supply halt by the country's biggest foreign exchanger earner,
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), The Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sam Equamo, ZCCM corporate affairs manager, in a response to a
press query on the shortage of foreign exchange on the market,
confirmed that the supply of foreign exchange onto the market has
been constrained by low earnings from copper sales, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The price of copper is currently at its lowest in many years.
The company is obliged to use the limited foreign exchange
earnings to service its debt and any surplus thereafter is then
released to the market," said Equamo.
</P>
<P>
The development has resulted to a critical shortage of foreign
currencies, mainly the U.S Dollars, in both the commercial banks
and bureax of change in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Some bureax have restricted the sale of the foreign currency
to customers who are willing to buy at 1,610 Kwacha per Dollar
while the buying price two weeks ago was 1,500 Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Zambia, the central bank, was initially the
supplier of foreign exchange from ZCCM to the financial market
but since Zambia introduced the liberalized exchange control
policy several years ago, it gave authority to the conglomerate
to retain its earnings and sell to the commercial bank's when it
deemed fit.

<HEADLINE> KANU Urges Tough Action on Threats to Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) has asked the Kenyan government to deal
strictly with any threats to the country's peace, stability and
unity, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following meetings held separately on Tuesday by the KANU
National Executive Council and the party's Parliamentary Group,
KANU First Vice-Chairman George Saitoti said that the two organs
urged Kenyans to reject any calls aimed at threatening the
country's peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two organs made a decision that KANU would hold elections
before the end of this year, which were put off last year with
most party members expressing fear that elections may break the
party as it prepared for the just concluded General Election.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government yesterday sacked all the striking nurses
and laboratory technicians who have been on strike since November
28 last year for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of New Year, President D. A. Moi asked the striking
nurses to resume duties on January 1 as the government was
looking into their grievance. However, they dismissed the call.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by the Director of Medical Services, James
Mwanzia, said that the nurses, health workers and laboratory
technicians who refused to resume duty by January 1, this year,
had been sacked.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government announced the formation of a
Task Force to review all laws governing the health services in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Shanghai Residents Marrying Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners seem to be losing
favor with the young women of Shanghai, the largest manufacturing
and financial center in China.
</P>
<P>
The city had a boom period in foreign laisions during the early
nineties, but now the city's economic development is offering
young women other opportunities for a better life.
</P>
<P>
The number of women in the city who married foreigners in 1997
was down 9 percent from the previous two years, according to the
city's civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
And, what these marriages lost in numbers, they gained in
quality as the difference in age between husbands and wives was
less dramatic than before.
</P>
<P>
In more than half the marriages last year, the age gap was only
three to five years, and it was rare to see a young woman going to
register a marriage with a man twice her age.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Shanghai's young women have more radical views
about their marriage partner and fewer of them view marriage as
the pathway to a better life or a way to see the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Inter-racial marriages began again after 1978, when China
started its reforms and opening up to the outside world.

SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- As the Spring Festival,
China's traditional lunar new year, is coming up, Shanghai Zoo is
permeated with a festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
A picture exhibition on tigers is being on show at the zoo to
help people know tigers and save them. It specifies relations
between human beings and tigers, tigers inhabiting in different
countries, tigers' current conditions and how they are endangered.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, co-sponsored by the Zoo and the Wildlife
Conservation Society, is the first of its kind ever held in
China.
</P>
<P>
Each tiger at Shanghai Zoo eats an average of seven kilograms
of beef or mutton and drinks two big bottles of milk
daily. Animals keepers often feed the tigers with some
calcium-rich and multi-vitamin tablets to keep them in good
health.
</P>
<P>
To greet the season, Shanghai Zoo plans to exhibit some albino,
such as white toad, white soft-shelled turtle, white snake, and
white yaks that recently became "residents" of the zoo. The
animals were either caught by farmers in suburban areas or bought
by urban residents from pedlars.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will also have the opportunity to watch giant pandas,
little monkeys, and kangaroos during the festival.

SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The electronics industry has a
new base in the New Pudong Area's Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The main products are computer chips, disc drives, and color
printers.
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, investors from the United States,
Japan, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Taiwan have put 500 million US dollars into the area.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the growth of foreign-funded
electronics firms here is because of preferential policies like
tax exemptions or tax refunding.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors include such international giants as
Intel, IBM, AT&AMP;T and Philips.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Denied Control of Radio, TV Transmitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The office of the High
Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina has rejected a request by the
hard-line Bosnia Serb leadership in Pale to give back the control
of radio and television transmitters, which are currently held by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Hina, the Croatian News Agency, the
office of the High Representative also dismissed Serb accusations
that transmitters had been damaged due to poor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Technicians of Serb radio and television stations have been
granted regular access to the transmitters so that they can take
care of their maintenance, said Rida ttanashari, spokesman for
the office of the High Representative in Sarajevo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Radio and television transmitters in eastern Bosnia were put
under the control of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) after the
studio in Pale had ignored the request of the international
community to change its editing policy and ban party influence
from the state media.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnia Serb television and radio program is being broadcast
exclusively from a studio in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
However, Attanashari announced that an international supervisor
would be sent to Banja Luka as well, to monitor whether
professional media standards are being observed.
</P>
<P>
At a session held on Monday in Bijeljina, Northern Bosnia, the
incumbent government of the Republika Srpska, which is made up
exclusively of the members of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS),
asked SFOR to give back the studio control.
</P>
<P>
They further said that the next session of the Bosnian Serb
Assembly, to be held on January 12, would be broadcast if their
request was met.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Car Maker Expects 30 Percent Drop in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's national car
manufacturer -- Proton -- expects a 30 percent drop in sales in
1998 given the weak market conditions, Chairman Mohd Saleh Sulong
of DRB-Hicom Group to which Proton belongs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Proton is expecting export sales to improve
tremendously as it plans to focus its effort on this area, he said
at a press conference after a ceremony in Port Klang, about 40
kilometers west from here, to mark the sending off of the first
batch of 300 cars to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Proton cars are now exported to 50 countries including Turkey
with a total of 164,153 units exported as of December 31, 1997.
Out of the 50 countries which Proton exports its cars to, only 42
are active, according to Mohd Saleh.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, Proton is targeting to export 53,000 units compared
with 32,000 units in 1997. Mohd Saleh said that the export volume
of 53,000 units expected for the new financial year beginning
April 1998 will be achieved through its present core markets and
also from five new markets which Proton hoped to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
Apart from penetrating new markets, which will provide good
volume for Proton cars, he said that special efforts would also be
focused on reviving non-active markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the European market would still continue to be an
important market for Proton which will embark on launching new
products from 1999 to the year 2000 as planned earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the new financial year, Proton hopes to be able to sell a
total of 200,00 units both at home and abroad, compared with a
total of 210,000 units sold in the current financial year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Wildlife In Desolate Lop Nur (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists and zoologists
have found that there is in fact wildlife in the desolate wastes
of Lop Nur in the Tarim Basin in the northwestern part of China.
</P>
<P>
A flock of wild geese, which was seen there in October by a
group of petroleum geologists, were flying south, only about 20
meters above the ground in a lateral formation.
</P>
<P>
The team had been in Lop Nur off and on over an eight-month
period and, according to Kong Zhongxiang, the deputy head of the
team, they were wondering how the geese could be in such a place
without any water.
</P>
<P>
Lop Nur is in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
occupies an area about the size of the Republic of Korea. It used
to have China's second largest inland lake but it turned to desert
after the Tarim River shifted course more than 2,000 years
ago. Since then, it has been regarded as a "zone of death".
</P>
<P>
One monk who passed through Lop Nur about 1,500 years ago on a
mission to Western Asian commented in his travel journal that the
place "had no birds or animals. All that can be seen are dry human
bones."
</P>
<P>
Kong and his team also saw Mongolian gazelle and wild camels
during their exploration of a 7,000-sq.km. area in eastern Lop
Nur. He says that wild camels can often be seen on both sides of
the dry Shule River course, where there are a dozen springs.
</P>
<P>
"The pools of water are shallow and clear, but too salty to
drink," he reports, but says they saw a shrub-like plant rich in
protein which seemed to be the camels' favorite food.
</P>
<P>
Zoologist Gu Jinghe, who has visited Lop Nur a number of times,
says that his team saw wild camels repeatedly and that he believes
about 300 wild camels live in Lop Nur.

<P>
Kong's team stayed at a tent camp with their vehicles,
surrounded by barren wastes, devoid of trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Then, in October, they saw larks flying near the camp.
Curiously, the birds, which are known for their lilting song, all
seemed to be mute. It turned out that the birds had followed the
vehicles which were carrying water supplies, and could manage to
live for no more than 20 days, after which they would die of
thirst.
</P>
<P>
But what surprised them most were the two crows they found
there that were as big as wild geese, Kong says. The zoologists
only collected forty specimens of animals and birds in all, says
Gu, noting that the wildlife is scattered in small groups.
</P>
<P>
And there are only a few wild camels, Tarim red deer, and Tarim
rabbits, about a hundred in all. They live mostly in a valley in
the eastern part and in dried swamps in the southwestern part
around a cluster of weather-beaten mud holes. Hardly any wildlife
is seen in the dried river basin that covers a 25,000-sq.km. area.
</P>
<P>
"On average, there's only one animal for every 1,000 sq.km. of
ground, and in this sense, Lop Nur is still a zone of death," Gu
concludes.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Misuse of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A commentary, carried by
Rodong Sinmun, the largest newspaper of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Wednesday condemned the abuse of
sanctions in the world.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the DPRK welcomes the statement,
issued by the United Nations Third Committee in Geneva recently,
which criticized some big powers for imposing sanctions on other
nations in a bid to achieve their own political goals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Third Committee, in charge of human rights and social
issues, also pointed out that sanctions hurt the basic right of
survival of the people in the sanction-hit countries, and proposed
to set up a special body to monitor the use of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that in 1990s, the U.N. Security Council
imposed a series of sanctions upon the countries including Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, many sanctions were proceeded from the considerations
of national interests of one or two big powers in the Security
Council, especially the United States, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been so active in making use of the so-called
human rights issues and terrorist activities to wantonly impose
sanctions upon other countries that a saying of "American-style
sanction" has emerged in the world, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Many unjustified sanctions, including the implementation of the
U.S. D'amato Bill and Helms-Burton Law, intensified the social and
economic instability in many countries and regions, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary noted, "the sanctions, a product left
over by the old era and a tool used by a few big powers to seek
their own interests, is strongly condemned by the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Activities against sanctions have even been dynamic in the
U.N. arena, it added.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Opposition leader Raila Odinga
has accepted the results of the December 29 General Election and
congratulated President Daniel arap Moi on his victory, according
to a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The National Development Party leader, who was third in the
just ended presidential race, sent a congratulatory letter
Tuesday to President Moi, saying that it was in the interests of
the nation and Kenyans to accept the outcome of elections.

Odinga dropped his earlier rejection of election results and
demand for repeat elections within 21 days which he made jointly
with Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki last Friday.

<P>
In his letter, Odinga said that everyone should "join hands in
the challenging task of reforms and economic reconstruction of
our country."
</P>
<P>
His party would collaborate with other democratic forces in
pursuit of a people-centered reform package within and outside
Parliament, he added.
</P>
<P>
Odinga is the second key presidential loser to accept the
election results following the acceptance by Ford-Kenya Chairman
Kijana Wamalwa whose position is fourth in the presidential race.
</P>

Kibaki who came second in the race and Charity Ngilu of Social
Democratic Party who is fifth have so far not accepted the
outcome of the election.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Has More Than One Million People Buying Stocks </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that
450,000 more people in China's capital invested in the stock
market in 1997, bringing the number of investors there to 1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
Most new investors in the second half of 1997 were middle-aged
or young professors, scientists, and technicians, while in the
first half of the year, most were middle-aged or elderly, and were
jobless, many of them former employees of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In April and May, when the stock market had some obvious rises,
there were at least 50,000 new investors each month and 3,000 per
day during the busiest days.
</P>
<P>
After the country adopted new stock market regulations, fewer
people became interested in the stock market and an interest rate
cut in October had little impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts here say they believe this indicates that
investors are more mature and aware now.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Increase Exports to Avoid Regional Monetary Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is trying to speed up the
bureaucratic processing of imports and exports to avoid the
effects of the regional monetary crisis dramatically affecting the
national economy, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam expects to earn about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars from
exports while spending about 2.77 billion dollars on imports in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official was quoted as saying the trade ministry and
other relevant organizations needed to promptly allocate quotas on
key exports in order to facilitate the signing of long-term sales
contracts among traditional and new partners.
</P>
<P>
Government office director Lai Van Cu said everything should
be done quickly to avoid the affects of the current monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country is facing many difficulties in the first quarter of
this year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The main exports in the first quarter will consist of 3.2
million barrels of crude oil, 850,000 tons of coal, 180,000 tons
of coffee beans, 50,000 tons of rubber latex, 700,000 tons of
rice, 260 million U.S. dollars worth of seafood, 350 million in
textile and garment products and 300 million pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
These exports are expected to increase by 29 percent compared
with the same period last year, an amount equal to 23 percent of
the government plan for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, import value is expected to rise by just three
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Joint-ventures with foreign investment are scheduled to earn as
much as 230 million dollars from their exports, which will account
for nearly nine percent of all exports.
</P>
<P>
Products imported by foreign invested joint-ventures are
expected to amount to 700 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and a number of entrepreneurs will visit India on
January 8-11 for talks aimed at boosting trade.
</P>
<P>
The Polish news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Marek
Greli as saying the president's India visit, which follows about
two months after his China tour, exemplifies the country's keen
interest in developing economic and trade relations with Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
During Kwasniewski's visit to India, Poland will not sign any
protocols or agreements, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the visit will give impetus to bilateral
cooperation in the area of electric power generation, agricultural
processing, the food industry and railway transportation. The two
sides will also discuss the terms of an arms export agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of last year, the trade turnover between
the two countries amounted to 162 million U.S. dollars. Greli
predicted it could possibly reach one billion U.S. dollars in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Pak Revenue Collection Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Central Board of Revenue
of Pakistan collected 138 billion rupees (about 3.13 billion U.S.
dollars) during the first half of 1997-1998 fiscal year, leaving a
shortfall of 6 billion rupees (about 136 million dollars) against
the target.
</P>
<P>
Major reasons behind the shortfall in revenue collection are
the reduced customs tariff, income tax cuts introduced to promote
business activity and a 252 million dollar fall in the volume of
imports, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor in the failure to achieve the target is
that the government could not enforce the general sale tax from
the start of the fiscal year as planned, the reports quoted an
official from the Central Board of Revenue as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This caused a loss in revenue of about 5 billion rupees (about
114 million dollars) during this period," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Due to the dismal performance in the first half of the current
fiscal year starting from July 1, 1997, the Central Board of
Revenue will have to collect 186 billion rupees (about 4.23
billion dollars) in the second half to meet the revenue target of
324 billion rupees (about 7.36 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is considered "a very difficult target" to achieve, the
official noted.

<HEADLINE> Cold Wave, Fog Cause Havoc in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Normal life and business in
Bangladesh have nearly come to a standstill due to days of cold
wave and fog all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's national airline, Biman, had canceled all its
domestic flights and delayed all its international flights due to
the poor visibility caused by the thick sheet of fog, press
reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the Dhaka-Aricha highway, a seven-kilometer-long queue of
vehicles was formed as dense fog disrupted ferry service in two
routes from the Aricha and Nawa ghats.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Aricha, 80 kilometers west of Dhaka, said the
ferries there experienced a most sever traffic congestion as about
6,000 vehicles remained stranded there awaiting to be ferried
across the rivers of Padma and Jamuna.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 people have died so far in the current cold spell that
started about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The government has started distributing warm clothes in the
cold spell-hit districts, mainly in the northern and western parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry have so far
allocated 11,600 quilts, and the prime minister's Relief Fund has
also distributed a large number of winter clothes in 22 districts,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts said the sever cold associated with the
blinding fog was likely to continue for one or two days. "Another
cold wave is likely in the middle of the month," they said.

NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- India is to host the
first-ever international conference here this month to discuss
coal and coal-related issues, Coal Ministry officials said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled for January 12 and 13, will provide
an opportunity to coal producers, power utilities, other users of
coal, technology suppliers, equipment manufacturers and financial
institutions to exchange views on some of the topical issues.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be deliberated include the latest technologies of
coal washing as available in India and the rest of the world,
environmental and other economic benefits of the use of washed
coal, government policy and the role of the private sector in the
development of washeries.
</P>
<P>
India's coal reserves are estimated at 203 billion tons, of
which over 85 percent is of inferior quality, with an ash content
of up to 45 percent and sometimes as high as 50 percent or more,
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Credit for Vietnam's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved a 35 million U.S. dollar credit to support commercial
debt and debt service reduction operations in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The project will help finance Vietnam's Debt and Debt-Service
Reduction (DDSR) agreement with its London Club creditors.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which is provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending wing for
developing countries, will finance a portion of the costs of the
DDSR Agreement signed on December 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This agreement will deliver substantial debt relief and yield a
sustainable debt service. The project will also help Vietnam
settle all its outstanding private, uninsured commercial arrears,
totaling 797 million dollars. The step will remove a major
impediment to Vietnam's access to international capital markets,
particularly to trade credits.
</P>
<P>
The project will also facilitate private sector involvement in
the financing of critical infrastructure, thereby strengthening
the country's medium-and-long-term growth prospects.

<HEADLINE> Italy Sees 2.5 Percent Growth in GDP in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Finance Minister Vincerzo
Visco said Tuesday that the country's economy was likely to grow
by about 2.5 percent next year, above the government's forecast of
two percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Italian TV, Visco said a recent upsurge in consumer
demand coupled with new tax breaks for bourse investment and other
concessions for the construction industry should power the economy
to "robust" higher-than-expected growth.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth figures next year will help Italy's efforts to
cut its deficit and gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, already
lower than the target set for joining the European economic and
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
A surge in growth, also fueled by the Bank of Italy's recent
interest rate cut, should also make it likely for Italy to achieve
a significant dent in its debt and GDP ratio, which has only
recently started to come down towards the Maastricht limit of 60
percent.

ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy will look with favor upon
Kurdish requests for political asylum, Prime Minister Romano Prodi
told German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a telephone call, the

</P>
<P>
In the long conversation described as "cordial and

control of its borders as required under the Schengen Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The asylum requests will be examined on an individual, not
collective, basis, Prodi told Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders stressed the importance of the conference in Rome,
scheduled for Thursday. The conference will focus on the recent
flood of Kurdish immigrants and fighting criminal elements
involved in the illegal trafficking of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Brussels, EU leaders are preparing for
Wednesday's inter-governmental conference which will also center on
the issue of Kurdish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to discuss border controls, ways of
fighting the falsification of identity cards and passports and
efforts to counteract the involvement of organized crime in the
illegal movement of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to determine if border controls are effective enough
or if they need to be strengthened," European Commissioner for
Foreign Affairs Hans van den Brock said.

<HEADLINE> Pisa Tower Could Be Re-opened in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The leaning Tower of Pisa, one of
Italy's most popular attractions, is expected to be re-opened to
the public in 18 months if efforts to reinforce it are successful,
Pisa City authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An international panel of experts, which has for seven years
been studying ways to halt the tower's tilt, issued its
preliminary appraisal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight years after the world-renowed monument was closed because
of its worsening tilt, the latest plan to bolster the tower
assigns the task to two cables more than 100 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Work to implement the plan has not yet started, but the cables
are expected to be in place by June, panel chief Michele
Jamiolkowski said.
</P>
<P>
By February 1999, crews will dig out portions of the ground
beneath the tower to cause part of it to sink, thereby reducing
the tilt.
</P>
<P>
By the following summer, steel anchors, more than 50 meters
long, will be put in place to further shore up the tower,
Jamiolkowski said.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to be sorry about, but I realize that seven
years is a long time, even if they were marred by enormous and
unforeseen administrative and bureaucratic problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tower, more than 58 meters tall, was built between 1173 and
1360 by Bonanno Pisano.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 plans to halt its continuing tilt have been
proposed in the past 20 years.

<P>
Some people said the new budget could serve as a turning point
for the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, President Soeharto unveiled a balanced
133.49 trillion rupiah (one US dollar equals 4,000 rupiah) draft
budget for the fiscal year 1998/99, increasing 32.1 percent in
rupiah terms and declining 52 percent in US dollar terms because
of the depreciation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Theo Sambuaga said that the draft budget was
"realistic".
</P>
<P>
"The draft budget shows that we are in a situation where we
have to tighten our belts and implement austerity measures. We
have to work hard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the government was quite open and realistic in
elaborating on the problems we are facing. That is why I'm
confident that the government's explanation will help restore
faith in our economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another legislator Hamzah Haz said that while there
was a nominal increase in the draft budget, its overall intrinsic
value decreased due to the depreciation of the rupiah against the
US dollar.
</P>
<P>
He expressed some hesitation at the 45.9 percent increase in
foreign loans in the budget, saying "this shows that we are still
dependent on external factors in our development fundings."
</P>
<P>
Ekky Syahrudin, legislator from the ruling Golkar, said the
presidential speech should indicate to everyone that the current
crisis is purely economic in nature.
</P>
<P>
"If the economic crisis can be resolved, then people will be
calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here said the draft budget was unrealistic
in the current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is overly optimistic and is almost wishful thinking,"
Indonesian Business Data Center Chairman Christianto Wibisono
said.
</P>
<P>
Economist Bomer Pasaribu and market analyst David Chang share
Christianto's view that the draft budget showed too much optimism
amid the monetary crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's annual inflation
rate was 11.05 percent in 1997, the first double-digit inflation
rate since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The high annual inflation rate last year was attributed to the
2.04 percent increase in the monthly inflation rate in December,
the Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate was checked at 11.46 percent in 1983
but it declined to between 4.94 percent and 9.5 percent in
following years until 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate in 1996 was 6.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, food prices surged 11.05 percent from 6.12 percent in
1996, while housing rose 18.45 percent from 4.72 percent and

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Energy Consumption Remains High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's energy consumption
last year was estimated to have soared by 7 percent, although the
country's economic growth was close to zero, the Bangkok Post
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
That reflected inefficient energy consumption in the country,
said Pongpisit Viseshakul, director of energy conservation at the
National Energy Policy Office (NEPO).
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai people's awareness of energy conservation has
risen, they now need to learn how to save energy in their daily
lives, Pongpisit said.
</P>
<P>
To help educate the public, NEPO will finance a short
television documentary to show how the public can save oil. The
footage will be followed by others on saving electricity and
water, Pongpisit said.
</P>
<P>
In most developing countries, energy consumption correlates
with economic growth, but Thailand has been an exception, the
director added.
</P>
<P>
Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s when the Thai economy
was booming with an average growth rate of around 7 percent, the
country's energy consumption jumped 11-12 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Home Appliance Market Competition Intensifies In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Domestic home appliance
companies are feeling mounting pressure from overseas counterparts
in market competition, today's China Daily quoted a recent survey
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese makers hold at least 70 percent of the market in color
televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, air-conditioners,
video compact disc (VCD) players, electric cookers, microwave
ovens and freezers, said the survey conducted by the Chinese
Society of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, their advantage of low product prices has little room
for manoeuvre after multiple price wars in recent years, warned
Zhang Zehou, the society's secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign appliance manufacturers, backed by their
strong financial and technological clout, are eyeing a larger
slice of the Chinese market, and many of them are opening
production bases in the country, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered 600 department stores in 121 cities
in China, showed that home appliance sales in those stores
accounted for 39 percent of the country's total in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that foreign companies had seized 96.5 percent
of the video cassette player market and 53 percent of the hi-fi
equipment market. They are likely to pose a stronger challenge
this year to Chinese refrigerator producers, Zhang predicted.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign appliance manufacturers are launching
cut-throat competition for a solid position in the market,
supported by dazzling TV advertisements. Their common efforts to
expand production capacity have led to serious oversupply. And
this, in turn, has intensified competition.
</P>
<P>
Refrigerators and VCD players may become the two major areas of
market competition in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry over digital video disc (DVD) players, the latest
generation of video appliances, has already started in earnest,
while the fight for a bigger share of traditional products
continues.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign firms are now preparing to present DVD players
priced at around 2,000 yuan, slightly more expensive than a VCD
player. "DVDs are likely to enjoy unprecedented development in
1998, adversely affecting the booming VCD market," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Urban families remain the major purchasing power for home
appliances. But rural areas are emerging as a potential market,
Zhang reminded producers.

<HEADLINE> Some 130,000 Enterprises Privatized in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister and
State Property Minister Farid Gazizulin said Tuesday that about
130,000 enterprises have been privatized in Russia by January 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Gazizulin, who made the remarks at a press conference, said
that of the privatized enterprises, 31,000 were done last year,
while the number was 5,000 in 1996 and 10,000 in 1995,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The State Property Ministry and the Russian Federal Property
Fund completed 280 percent of the budget in 1997, which has
increased the country's income by 17.9 trillion roubles (about 3
billion U.S. dollars) last year and 1.1 trillion roubles (about
187.4 million dollars) in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this year's budget of 8.1 trillion roubles (about
1.4 billion dollars) will be completed on the condition that the
State Duma (the lower house of parliament) passes the
privatization plan of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The State Property Ministry is expected to "make some necessary
adjustment" over the management of 29,000 federal enterprises and
strengthen control on overseas state property in 122 countries,
Gazizulin said.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Philippines Shrink </HEADLINE>

MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The continued regional financial
crisis has slowed down investments in the Philippines as some
big-ticket projects stayed on the sidelines, latest data released
by the Board of Investment showed.
</P>
<P>
Registered investments in the last quarter of 1997 fell by 81
percent to 54 billion pesos (1.3 billion US dollars) from 298
billion pesos (7.2 billion dollars) in the corresponding period of
the previous year, the data showed.
</P>
<P>
However, total investments registered in 1997 reached 554
billion pesos (13.5 billion dollars) from 395 billion pesos (9.6
billion dollars) in 1996, 40 percent higher than 400 billion pesos
(9.8 billion dollars) of the government's target for the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the total investments was due to huge projects
registered during the first half of the year, the data said.
</P>
<P>
The government is aiming for a goal of 700 billion peso (17
billion dollar) investments for 1998.

<HEADLINE> China's Light Industry Sets Sights on Foreign Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry need to
boost exports and attract more foreign capital and technology this
year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Exports should increase by over six percent, the newspaper
quoted Yu Zhen, chairwoman of the China National Council of Light
Industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the export target of light industrial
products is set at 58 billion U.S. dollars this year, comparing
with 34.8 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, the light industrial sector should focus on
developing more overseas markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America,
Eastern Europe and the other nations of the Commonwealth of the
Independent States in the year of 1998, said Yu.
</P>
<P>
She noted the importance of expanding markets in the Middle
East, which is abundant in natural resources but lacks daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
Light industrial enterprises are also urged to cooperate via
multiple channels with foreign companies by actively participating
in international shows and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Yu emphasized that quality is the key in establishing the
reputation of China's light industry at domestic and overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson urged light industrial enterprises to make
greater efforts to improve quality and technological content of
traditional labor-intensive exports and to improve the proportion
of capital-intensive machinery and electronics in overall exports,
as well as encouraged light industrial enterprises to expand
business overseas.
</P>
<P>
She added China's light industry expects to attract more
foreign capital and technology this year as China will give tariff
exemption to imported technologies and equipment China can not
produce.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Reforms Agriculture for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will speed up the
introduction of European Union (EU) agriculture standards and
legislation reforms in preparation for accession to the union,
Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Ventsislav Vurbanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By March 15, 1998, Bulgaria must launch its Cooperation for
Accession programme to prove to the European Commission that it is
working hard to overcome shortcomings in its agriculture,
Vurbanov told a news conference at the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government's priorities should include building a modern
export-oriented agriculture, improving consumer protection,
completion of land reform, and legislative reform, Vurbanov said.
</P>
<P>
The short-term 1998 programme prioritizes legislative
reform. Bills on fodder, seeds, planting materials, fertilization
and on the selection and breeding of animals, have been drafted in
compliance with EU standards and will be introduced in parliament
in 1998, Vurbanov announced.
</P>
<P>
The implementation deadlines for these commitments will be set
in a medium term programme. Bulgarian experts said any delay in
meeting these obligations would mean an end to the Phare
programme, under which the EU would increase its financial
assistance two-to-three fold by 2003-2004, to around 70 ECU per
capita in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
A European Commission view that Bulgaria seemed to be
experiencing the greatest difficulties in its legislative
integration into the EU was also stated at Tuesday's news
conference.

The 660-pound cylindrical Lunar Prospector, the first Moon

With five scientific instruments on board, the spacecraft will

useful resources for future interplanetary exploration. But one
of its major objects is to look for the evidence that weather
there is liquid water on the Moon.
</P>
<P>
Humans last visited the Moon in December 1972. Future
pioneers could separate water, if it's there, into hydrogen and
oxygen and thus make their own rocket fuel.

COLOMBO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to establish 504
hectares of new plantations in eight districts this year to meet
the country's fuel-wood and timber requirements and to conserve
environmentally viable areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year it had established plantations in 260 hectares giving

planting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, maintenance work had been carried out in 64,000
hectares of plantations established in 15 districts and trials
have been done to evaluate plant species to identify suitable
species to be grown in the plantations in these areas.
</P>
<P>
A vegetative propagation unit will be established soon to
produce better quality seedlings this year, said the sources,

ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy's employment rate will rise
to 59.1 percent in 1998 and 59.3 percent in 1999 from 59 percent
in 1997, said a survey issued by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the improved rate will still be the lowest in the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries, said the 29-member
OECD which expects its average employment rate to climb to 70.7
percent in 1999 from 70.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Italy's employment rate would also be lower than the European
Union's average of 67.1 percent in 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
Within the OECD, only Turkey, Mexico and Hungary's employment
rates were forecast to be lower than Italy's in 1999, which would
stand at 55.1, 55.4 and 57 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD forecasts, in 1999, the highest
employment rate of 83.9 percent will emerge in the Czech Republic,
while 80.5 percent in Denmark, 79.2 percent in Japan and 77.6
percent in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Issuance of Higher Interest Rate Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The continued fall of the peso
may compel the Philippine Central Bank to consider the possibility
of floating bills that carried extremely high interest rates of 48
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Manila Chronicle Wednesday quoted Central
Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as saying that issuing so called
"Jobo-type" bills is the ultimate solution if the currency crisis
persists.
</P>
<P>
"Jobo-type" bills were issued during the height of the
country's foreign exchange crisis in the 1980s when inflation hit
64 percent by then central bank governor whose nickname is "Jobo".
</P>
<P>
The central bank had to offer interest rates of as high as 50
percent to stabilize the economy which was reeling from high
inflation and low international reserves.
</P>
<P>
The bills proved successful in containing inflation but it
contracted the economy as many businessmen were forced to shut
down due to high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I do not have to be the one to do it," Singson said,
adding the Philippines may not have the ability to absorb such
high rates of bills.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank chief said the move is one of the options
of the government.
</P>
<P>
"If this happens everyday (the fall of the peso), what do you
do? We cannot keep supplying the market. One possible option is
Jobo type bills, or Gabby bills or somebody's bill," Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said President Fidel Ramos has called for another
nationwide economic summit this month to discuss possible
solutions to the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We need to rebuild our international reserves," Singson said,
citing that the central bank's gross international reserves had
dwindled to about 9 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the need to jack up dollar reserves of the country,
he said concerns over tight credit availability and high interest
rates and the unstable peso top the list of the concerns of
monetary authorities.

CARACAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and one dolphins
have died in mass as they ran aground on a beach at Turtle Island,
state of Anzoategui in Venezuela, the Environment Ministry said

WUHAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
dealt harshly with publishers of pornography and individuals
involved in pirating audio and visual porno materials over the
past year, with authorities confiscating over 50 kinds of audio

KUNMING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has made good progress in developing basic public health
services in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 115 counties and cities, or 90.5 percent of
all the province's total, have introduced basic public health
services.
</P>
<P>
At present, 12 out of the 17 counties and cities which are
threatened by snail fever have eliminated the disease, which has
been also put under effective control in the rest five counties
and cities.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of malaria was also put under control within five
cases reported among every 10,000 people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the incidence of diseases, Yunnan has sped up the
construction of epidemic prevention facilities in border areas,
and in other places across the province.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Raises Grain Output by Developing Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, the country's most important grain reserve base, is to
turn itself into an even more powerful grain-producer by
developing water-efficient irrigation in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the eight million ha of cultivated land are
expected to produce an additional 7.5 billion kg of grain each
year. The move is to raise the province's annual output to 37.5
billion kg.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal, provincial governor Tian Fengshan urged
the whole province to develop water conservancy projects,
particularly water-saving irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2.8 million ha of farmland, or over one-third of the
province's total, were threatened by the severe and persistent
drought, according to a China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
A record 3.4 billion kg of grain, worth 5.4 billion yuan, was
estimated to be damaged by drought in 1997 in Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
To counter the challenges, water resources authorities plan to
bring more than 1.3 million ha of arid farmland under effective
irrigation in the next three years. Half of this will be
accomplished by adopting various water-saving irrigation
techniques, including building 50,000 new irrigation wells and
9,600 other watering supply projects.
</P>
<P>
The newly improved irrigated land is expected to yield 4.5
billion kg of grains or 60 percent of the increase expected by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The other 40 percent will be produced with the help of such
measures as using low-cost dribble-watering to replace the
outdated, openly cut trenches, which wasted more than 60 percent
of the total water used in irrigation.

<HEADLINE> China to Reorganize Speciality Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a
comprehensive re-organization of 50 large speciality markets
engaged in different products in the next two years to ensure
commodities on sale are wholly trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
The re-organization will give priority to large markets engaged
in marketing such products as personal computers, eye-glasses,
house-use electrical appliances, automobiles, farming machines and
construction materials, today's China Daily quotes an official
with the State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"By taking the professional and technical advantages of
technical supervision departments, we will help the markets to
establish quality control over its commodities and supervision
systems and let them serve as demonstration projects for the
re-organization of other speciality markets in the future," said
Zhu Mingxian, deputy director of SBTS.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese speciality markets have developed quickly in
recent years thanks to its flexible way of management and
effective distribution of commodities. Many of them have played a
big role in improving the reasonable distribution of commodity
resources.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a weak legal system and blind development,
problems have emerged such as disordered management, substandard
business performance, poor quality of goods and even counterfeit
commodities, which have seriously infringed the interests of the
State, enterprises and consumers, the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that SBTS arranged on-the-spot inspections and
reorganization of 16 large-size markets including the Beijing
Eyeglass Market, Shanghai New World Computer Market and Guangdong
Panyu Household Electrical Appliances Markets in the latter half
of last year.

CARACAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Export prices of Venezuelan oil
reduced 33 cents per barrel this week, the Power and Mining
Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The price dropped from 13.88 U.S. dollars per barrel on
December 31 to 13.55 dollars Monday.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts said that if the price continued declining in
the first quarter of 1998, the situation would be worse for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said the reduction in price resulted from forecasts
of a gentle winter in the United States, an excessive supply from
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the resumption
of Iraq's exports and financial turmoil of Southeastern Asian
countries.

<HEADLINE> Ministries Ready to Face Festival's Travel Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Railways and the
Ministry of Communications are ready for the transport blitz
around the Spring Festival of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which
falls on January 28.
</P>
<P>
The annual travel peak usually comes when millions of farmers
working in cities return to their villages for family reunions
before the festival and return to their jobs afterwards.
</P>
<P>
This year's peak transportation period will last 50 days,
from tomorrow to February 26, sources from the two ministries
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways plans to carry 139.3 million
passengers during the travel peak, up 3.4 percent from last year's
figure. And about 36.97 million passengers are expected to travel by
long-distance trains, up 11.7 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicts there will be 10 busy railway lines
during the period, including the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway,
Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Beijing-Kowloon Railway,
Lianyungang-Lanzhou Railway and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways has allocated 6,000 extra carriages
for the coming peak period, ministry officials said. Overall 34
pairs of passenger trains are ready for handling emergencies in
Chengdu, Changsha and Nanchang, which are the major hubs through
which migrant workers move.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming season, the country's road network is
expected to carry 1.64 billion passengers, up 5.2 percent from
last year. Water transport departments will handle 38 million
passengers, nearly the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to add more direct long-distance and charter
bus and charter boat services in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and
Fujian provinces and Shanghai and Beijing cities.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will temporarily shut
eight commercial offices and four trade centers abroad from March
31 to save money, according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also defer opening new offices as part of the
government's drive to cut spending. Last year it closed seven
commercial offices and four trade centers.
</P>
<P>
The planned closures could trim 195.44 million baht (3.9
million US dollars) from 953 million baht (19.06 million dollars)
earmarked for representation abroad this year, and as much as 371
million baht (7.4 million dollars) from 1999 fiscal year, the
ministry was quoted Wednesday by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry currently has 47 commerce offices abroad, of which
those in Bucharest, Stockholm, Colombo, Lisbon, Tashkent, Kiev,
Mexico City and Cairo will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Of the trade centers, those in Lyons, Atlanta, Warsaw and
Shanghai will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Trade centers in Kunming and Guangzhou in China and the Hague
in the Netherlands would be supervised by the Thai Foreign
Ministry.
</P>

Plans for an office in Bombay, India, would be put on hold
until the Thai economy recovered.

<HEADLINE> Renminbi Yuan Unlikely to Be Devalued: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The renminbi yuan is unlikely to
be devalued even though the sharp depreciation of currencies in
neighbouring countries will inevitably affect China's export
trade, according to an authoritative source.
</P>
<P>
A financial official who declined to be identified said the
world market should maintain its confidence in the renminbi rate's
stability. The marginal changes in the rate that follow the market
demand and supply are normal, he was quoted as saying in today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The official said China is enjoying speedy growth in foreign
trade and a constant influx of foreign funds. There has been a
glut in the foreign exchange market because of the favourable
international balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to continue as the country moves to
improve the competitiveness of its export products and encourage
foreign investment by further cutting tariffs. China's nearly 140
billion U.S. dollars of foreign exchange reserves would buffer
fluctuations in the balance of payments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official noted, China's foreign trade firms
have sharpened their non-price competitiveness in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China had more than 40 billion US dollars in trade
surplus and added 30 billion dollars to foreign exchange
reserves. Therefore, lowering the renminbi's value artificially
would only spark rifts between China and its trade partners, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He disputed the opinion that the financial crisis sweeping
Southeast Asia since last July was elicited by the integration of
the renminbi's two-tier exchange rate in 1994. "The view is
incompatible with the facts," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China unified the market and the official exchange rates of the
renminbi in 1994, causing the exchange rate of the yuan against
the US dollar to depreciate to 8.7 to 1.
</P>
<P>
He said the normal exchange rate of the renminbi actually
dropped only seven percent after the integration, instead of 33
percent or 50 percent as some people had predicted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, devaluation is not the key element behind China's
export boom in recent years, the source said. It is technical
upgrading and improvement of efficiency that have done the job.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Calls for Developing Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Experts in Kazakhstan are
calling on the government to develop nuclear power at the turn of
the century, the Kazakhstan Pravda reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted experts as saying that by the end of 2010
the country will face a serious energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
The experts said, in a just-concluded symposium on nuclear
power, that the thermal power plants, which are the major
electricity suppliers of the country, will not be able to meet the
demands of economic growth. An energy shortage would loom large in
southern industrial cities, they added.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan boasts abundant uranium and the extraction of the

<HEADLINE> Australia's Mixed Message on Low Australian Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A weaker Australian dollar
meant Australian products would be cheaper and become more
competitive in the world market, though local people, rich and
poor, will be hit by price rises of everyday household items,
local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of Australian-manufactured goods or raw materials,
such as mineral products, will be benefited from a low dollar, Tim
Blue, an economist, wrote in The Australian, the country's leading
newspaper, on the falling local currency.
</P>
<P>
The prices of Australian major export earners, such as gold,
copper, aluminum, nickel and zinc have been tumbling, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Gold reached a new 18-year low, shedding 6.70 U.S. dollars an
ounce to 282.70 U.S. dollars an ounce after weekend comments by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were interpreted by
financial markets as a warning that deflation could become a
problem for the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar, which started at 80 U.S. cents in March
last year, slipped 63.35 U.S. cents Tuesday, the lowest level
against the greenback in more than 11 years following a gold price
in freefall and continuing chaos in Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Frank Gelber, an economist, told The Australian that five years
of 65 U.S. cents an Australia dollar is what he would like to see.
</P>
<P>
"It helps our exporters and it helps our import-competing
industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
A weaker Australian dollar should boost sales and deliver
higher incomes for farmers, The Age, a Melbourne-based daily,
said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a spokesman with Australia's National Farmers
Federation as saying beef exports competing against U.S. farmers
would have a strong price advantage and it could help reduce
potential lost sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The size of the Asian market is shrinking, but the size of our
share of that market could increase", the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A lower Australian dollar would help sell wool, particularly in
emerging markets, such as India and eastern Europe, Greg Evans,
executive director of Wool Council, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But the Sydney Morning Herald argued the Australian dollar's
slump meant reduced demand for Australian exports and a higher
chance of products being dumped in Australia.
</P>
<P>
It said prices of everyday household items are set to jump by
up to 20 percent over the next six months as a result of the
falling Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Essentials such as clothes and food will not be spared, and
will rise by as much as luxury items such as European cars,
expensive sporting equipment and white goods, the newspaper said.

<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Former Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa has registered with the Commission on
Elections a new political party to serve as his vehicle in his
presidential bid in May.
</P>
<P>
De Villa is standard bearer and chairman of the Party of

Sebastian, now representative to the World Trade Organization, is
party president.

press reports Wednesday quote De Villa as saying.
</P>
<P>
De Villa quit the ruling party and declared to form the "United
Third Force" last December to continue his bid to run for
president after losing President Fidel Ramos' endorsement as the
ruling party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The former defense chief told around 2,000 followers Tuesday
when he registered the new party that he will continue the battle
against the prevailing political system that relies on patronage
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Third Force is an alternative to both
popularity politics and patronage politics.
</P>

"We will pursue the fight against this rotten system. It is
time to launch reforms in a government that neglected the people,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Economy Expected to Grow 5.2% In 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The renewed dynamism of
the Mexican economy permits a prediction of at least 5.2 percent
growth of Gross Domestic Product in 1998, the Center of Economic
Studies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
nevertheless, in order to achieve a lasting and sound economic
expansion for 1998, the country needs to undergo some structural
changes in its law system to further foster productive
activities.
</P>
<P>
The study says that the major pending issues is to put
into place a legal frame that guarantees respect to property
rights and physical security to people and their belongings.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect awaiting reform is the improvement of the
tax-collecting system and deregulation of business-making.
</P>
<P>
The experts of the center said that the main economic
"engines" this year will be consumption and therefore expansion
of domestic markets, investment and exportation.
</P>
<P>
This dynamism, the document says, could create one million jobs.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve that in the mid-term the government has
to start loosening its belt-tightening economic policy and begin
rising salaries but maintaining a restrained pace as to keep inflation
down to 13 percent, necessary condition for currency stability.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Cotton Output At Halt due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen of the
Colombian textile industry will import at least 50,000 tons of
cotton this year to meet its production needs if the fiber
plantations in the Atlantic coast do not recover.
</P>
<P>
This was warned on Tuesday by a group of specialists including
weather experts and economists.
</P>
<P>
Fear of some Colombian cotton growers for predicted harmful
effects of the El Nino climatic phenomenon and violence by
guerrillas caused cotton fields to be so scarce.
</P>
<P>
In El Cesar, one of the cotton-producing regions of Colombia,
farmers did not want to sow the land last year on 580 cotton-due
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Similar situations emerged in the regions of La Guajira and
Magdalena, where cotton is a traditional product.
</P>
<P>
Colombian experts on weather have warned that the El Nino has
not but begun its "maturing" stage and that its inclemencies are
to be felt until June.

<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Steps are being taken to protect
cultural relics in the pathway of Beijing's Ping'an Avenue, which
is under construction, according to Wang Hongnian, an official
with the Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen historical sites along the avenue, which runs
from Dongsishitiao Overpass on eastern Second Ring Road to the
Chegongzhuang Overpass on western Second Ring Road, parallel to
Chang'an Avenue, one of the city's most famous streets.
</P>
<P>
The sites include the northern gate of Beihai, an imperial
garden built in the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), and the former
residence of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, pioneer of the Chinese democratic
revolution, where he lived from the end of 1924 until his death in
1925.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in order to keep the historical sites intact,
parts of the avenue will be narrower or will have to make a
detour, and that any relics unearthed during the construction will
be well-protected.
</P>
<P>
He said that anyone who violates the cultural relics law during
this work will be penalized.
</P>
<P>
The 6,893-m. avenue is expected to cost two billion yuan (about
240 million US dollars) and will be completed by August 1999.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Holds Phone Talks With European Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
held telephone talks with leaders of Austria, France and Italy on
how to tackle illegal immigrations in Europe following a recent
influx of Kurdish refugees from Turkey to Italy.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
had telephone conservations with Chancellor Viktor Klima of
Austria, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France and Prime Minister
Romano Prodi of Italy today, as well as with French President
Jacques Chirac Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held amid increasing fears in Germany that the
1,300 mainly Kurdish refugees who streamed to Italy's southern
coast in the last two weeks as well as more refugees who are
reportedly en route would finally slip into Germany via Austria
and France.
</P>
<P>
Also today, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther made it
clear that Germany, which had already taken in about 350,000
Bosnian war refugees since 1992, would not tolerate another major
illegal immigration of foreign refugees.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Germany had already sent hundreds of
reinforcements to the police forces at its southern and western
borders in order to stem the feared influx of Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he accused Italy of failing to tighten its external
border against illegal immigrations as required by the European
Union open-border Schengen agreement which Italy joined in
October.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1985 Schengen accord, seven western European states
-- Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal
and Spain -- have already scrapped their normal interior border
controls in a bid to allow freedom of movement within the group.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Austria are also due to do the same by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the open-border arrangements would encourage more
illegal refugee movements into Germany, some German politicians,
including the interior minister of the Lower Saxony state, Gerhard
Glogowski, have demanded that the Schengen accord be suspended
until Italy tightens its asylum laws.
</P>
<P>
Kanther, however, indicated today that he did not favor
suspending the accord and that it still remained a valid way to
promote common security and freedom of movement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the German Interior Ministry said Monday that
Germany would urge its European partners to intensify the use of
possibilities provided by the Schengen accord to intercept illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of police officials from Schengen countries is due to
be convened Thursday in Rome to discuss the latest refugee issue.

<HEADLINE> NZ Dollar Falls Sharply against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar
dropped by over 80 U.S. cents in trading with the Greenback on
Tuesday, ending at a three-year low of 56.56 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi dollar was dragged down by the lower Australian
dollar, which sank to an 11-year low against the stronger U.S.
dollar. The U.S. dollar is now seen as a safe-haven currency in
the face of the continued economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwi has now fallen 20 percent against the U.S. dollar
compared with one year ago, when it peaked at more than 71 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
But experts think the decline in the NZ dollar does not mean an
immediate boom for the NZ exporters.
</P>
<P>
They noted that many exporters have protected themselves from
the harm of the rising Kiwi dollar in the past year by locking in
a set value for the currency over periods of up to one year.
</P>
<P>
This means that it will be months before the weaker dollar
brings benefits to some exporters, the experts predict.
</P>
<P>
However, they agreed that the sharp fall in the NZ currency
against the U.S. dollar will help offset the expected impact of
lower demand in Asia.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Financial Trouble Affects NZ Log Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's massive log
export trade to South Korea may drop away significantly in coming
weeks or months, according to Fletcher Forests, one the two big
suppliers to that market.
</P>
<P>
A local report Monday quoted the company as saying on Tuesday
that log exports, worth of tens of millions of dollars a year,
were in doubt because of importer's problems with South Korea's
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher Forests is refusing to ship logs without letters of
credit from buyers and buyers are finding it hard to get those
bank orders to assure exporters of payment.
</P>
<P>
The report said if the South Korean market dried up, it would
have a serious impact on Fletcher Forests, although the company
was trying to diversify into other markets and process more logs
in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Radio NZ also reported on Tuesday that Fletcher Forests was
considering to stop cutting trees if the present situation in
South Korea continued.
</P>
<P>
This would put several hundred jobs in jeopardy, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter last year, 57 percent of NZ log exports
went to South Korea, totaling 975,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Carter Holt Harvey is the other big supplier of logs to South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> US to Talk With France Over Iran Energy Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States is set to
talk with France over a French deal with Iran in the energy
section, which is involved in punishment of a French oil company
in accordance with a U.S. sanctions act, the State Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told reporters that Under Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering was to leave for Paris late today to
discuss with French officials "Iraq and Iran and other subjects."
</P>
<P>
He gave no details on the discussed issues. But analysts here
believed that the issue of imposing U.S. sanctions on the French
energy company Total SA and two other companies from Malaysia and
Russia for a 2 billion dollar gas project in Iran would come up
first on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Pickering's talks with French officials come at a time when
Washington is waiting for a statement from Iran's President
Mohammed Khatami in his interview with CNN scheduled on Wednesday,
as his statement might affect U.S. policy toward the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration was said to be eager to hear what
Khatami would say and what kind of a clearer sign would give for
the possible warming ties between the two feuding countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Washington does not expect anything dramatic from the
Iranian president, it still hopes Khatami could conceivably
designate a negotiator and propose a date and time for talks with
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Pickering's talks with French officials thus will have
potential impact on relations between the United States and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Ethanol Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Corn-based ethanol outperforms
significantly conventional and reformulated gasoline in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, according to the U.S.
Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).
</P>
<P>
A study shows that a blend of ethanol and unleaded gasoline may
reduce fossil energy use by 50-60 percent and greenhouse gas
emissions by 35-46 percent compared with conventional fuels, said
the RFA in a report today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures of Argonne National Laboratory, the RFA said the
comparison took into account ethanol's total production costs,
including corn farming, ethanol production, transportation and
distribution and ethanol combustion in motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The United States produces a total of 1.58 billion gallon
ethanol annually mainly using corn grown in Illinois, Iowa,
Nebraska and Minnesota states, the RFA said.
</P>
<P>
The use of methanol as an alternative auto fuel is among the
hot topics being discussed by U.S. auto makers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will most probably choose veteran diplomat Jeffrey Davidow as the
next U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Although he refused today to confirm the selection, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry strongly hinted that Davidow, who is
currently the assistant secretary of state for Latin American
affairs, is the right person.
</P>
<P>
"The president's been interested in finding someone who would
ably represent the interests of the United States government at a
time in which we are building a very strong partnership with the
government of Mexico and, of course, Assistant Secretary Davidow
has been involved in exactly that," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported today that Davidow was named in an
"action memo" sent to Clinton for final approval.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the process, which is obviously very far along, will
be completed shortly," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not had an ambassador to Mexico since
former Oklahoma Republican Jim Jones left the post in June.
</P>
<P>
Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld was named to fill
the vacancy by Clinton, but Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee blocked a Senate vote on the
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for Urgent Action to Save Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,600 marine
scientists from 65 countries today unanimously called for urgent
action to save the world's oceans from severe damage by human
activity.
</P>
<P>
They said quick action must be taken to combat overfishing,
pollution and coastal development in a joint petition introduced
here today at the U.S. Capitol by the Marine Conservation Biology
Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The sea is in real trouble, much more trouble than we
previously thought," said Elliot Norse, director of the institute,
at a news conference at the Capitol. "We must act now, not 20
years from now or 10 years from now if we are to prevent further
degradation of the marine environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the United Nations's International Year of the
Ocean, the scientists said in their petition entitled Troubled
Waters: A Call for Action that the destruction of marine
biological diversity from five causes: over-exploitation of
species; physical alteration of ecosystems; pollution; alien
species from distant waters disrupting local food webs; and global
atmospheric change.
</P>
<P>
They urged the world's governments and even individuals to take
measures including launching education to protect the oceans where
live 99 percent of the world's 30 million species, with less than
1 percent on land or in fresh water.

<HEADLINE> Cohen to take 11-day Visit to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon announced on
Tuesday that Defense Secretary William Cohen will visit China and
six other countries in Asia from Jan. 12 through 22.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's trip to Asia was originally scheduled in last November
but was postponed because of a weapons inspection crisis in Iraq.
But Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon in announcing the upcoming trip
said the situation in Iraq had "changed dramatically" since
November as Baghdad had allowed expelled American inspectors back
and the weapons inspections had been resumed.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Cohen will fly first to Malaysia and then to
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, China, Japan and South Korea to
discuss bilateral and regional security interests.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China on Jan. 17-20, Cohen and Chinese
defense officials will sign a maritime consultation agreement
aimed at reducing the risk of naval incidents at sea between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He will also discussed with China's Defense Minister Chi
Haotian the implementation of modest steps to boost U.S.-China
military-to-military ties, including increased exchanges of armed
forced personnel, following last October's Washington summit
between President Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Cohen planned chiefly to discuss military and
strategic issues with leaders of all the countries he is to visit,
but economic problems were likely to come up, including a
suddenly-reduced ability by Asian countries to purchase arms.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has recently announced it would delay the planned $392
million purchase of eight Boeing-built F-18 fighter jets for up to
three years. The deal was originally scheduled to be completed by
2000.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Dong-jin said during his
visit to Washington in December that his government might also
be forced to delay foreign arms purchases because of a economic
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Representative
Sonny Bono was killed when he skied into a tree Monday at a resort
on the Nevada-California line.
</P>
<P>
Bono, 62, had been reported missing two hours before his body
was found at 6:45 p.m. Monday near South Lake Tahoe on the
California-Nevada border, about 90 kilometers south of Reno,
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
Bono, who had skied at the resort for more than 20 years, was
killed when he was skiing with his family. He was at the resort in
a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
Bono's death came less than a week after Michael Kennedy,
39-year-old son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, was killed in a
skiing accident.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was also killed when he smashed into a tree in playing
football on a ski slope in Aspen, Colorado, on the Eve of New
Year.
</P>
<P>
Learning the news of Bono's death today, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said he was saddened.
</P>
<P>
"His joyful entertainment of millions earned him celebrity, but
in Washington he earned respect by being a witty and wise
participant in policymaking processes that often seem ponderous to
the American people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he and his colleagues "lost a
very, very dear friend."
</P>
<P>
Flags were lowered to half staff over the Capitol in Washington
where Bono was serving his second term in the House.
</P>
<P>
He was elected mayor of Palm Springs in 1988 and was elected to
the House in 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering WFP Fresh Food Appeal for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering new food aid to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) in response to a fresh appeal from the U.N. World
Food Program (WFP), the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will carefully examine this appeal, and the United States
intends to consult with other countries," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The food aid appeal recently made by the WFP was said to differ
from earlier ones in its size, the number of beneficiaries and the
length of time covered.
</P>
<P>
The amount requested is nearly double the total 1997 appeal.
The people to be aided will reach 7.5 million, as opposed to last
year's 4.7 million. And the length of time will cover a 12-month
period, rather than for the immediate needs as it has been in the
past. In short, the WFP says it needs 658,000 metric tons of food,
valued at 979 million US dollars, to help DPRK people from famine
in the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States has "always responded positively
to previous humanitarian appeals" from the WFP for the assistance
to the DPRK people. But he said with the increase of food
distributions the number of monitors should also be doubled.
Monitoring and distribution of aid are said to have been a
constant concern of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, however, said the monitoring will not be a concern
since Pyongyang has agreed to double the number of U.N. monitors
to 48.

ZAGREB, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 should be one in
which former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzich, who has
been charged with a war criminal by the Hague Tribunal, is finally
extradited to the Hague to answer war crime charges, said German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Hina, the Croatian News Agency, Kinkel
told the media in Leipzig that he wanted to see a more robust
international mandate in Bosnia and that he was confident that
Karadzich would be called to account this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is also seeking Karadzich's arrest this
year. UN spokesman in Sarajevo Aleksandar Ivanko said Monday that
1998 would be the year when indicted war crimes suspects in Bosnia
would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
He told the media that the Hague Tribunal was determined to
seek bigger fish, people who had been commanders during the war or
who had belonged to the management structure.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko added that Karadzich's home address in Pale was well
known and that the international police force had seen him there.

<HEADLINE> German Carmaker Facing Possible Punishment by EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, is expected to punish the
German carmaker Volkswagen once more for allegedly playing foul.
</P>
<P>
This might well be another time when the commission goes for
the carmaker after it settled a damaging row with Germany over
illegal subsidies paid to Volkswagen two months ago, a commission
source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen is accused of banning its dealerships from selling
to residents of other countries trying to take advantage of
different national prices and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints were heard for the first time in 1995 when
residents from Germany, Austria and France said they had been
refused a car from Volkswagen or its sister company Audi from
their Italian distributor called Autogerma.
</P>
<P>
German car buyers had reportedly met the same problem more
recently in Denmark and the Netherlands, where the price of cars
before tax could be up to 30 percent cheaper than in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The commission source said it was likely that the EU executive
would make a decision on the Italian case in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen could face fines or periodic penalty payments if it
does not change its present business policy. But the commission
source declined to give any details.

<HEADLINE> Intel Faces New Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Intel Inc., the world's largest
computer chip maker, is feeling the first real threat to its chip
dominance.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, the world's top PC maker, unveiled today three new
low-price PC models containing chips made by Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD). Intel's chips will be relegated to pricier
machines.
</P>
<P>
And Packard Bell-NEC, the leading maker of PCs for U.S.
consumers, plans to shift from its Intel-only strategy and ship
Cyrix-based PCs this year, according to Computer Retail Week.
</P>
<P>
AMD and Cyrix routinely undercut Intel's prices by at least 25
percent. The companies now have just 15 percent market share. But
the fast growing market of under-1,000 U.S. dollar PCs is forcing
manufacturers to turn to less expensive central processing units
(CPU), the brains of PCs.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that AMD and Cyrix could double their
combined market share to 30 percent by year's end if there is the
market demand.
</P>
<P>
Intel, however, has an inventory of about 3 million in unsold
processors, due to "massive cancellations of notebook chips." Some
analysts cited the sluggish Asian market, particularly Japan, the
second-largest computer market in the world, as one of the reasons
for the notebook chip stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said that challenge is forcing Intel to slash
prices. The company last week said it's dropping the price of its
233-megahertz Pentium II chip by 33 percent to 268 U.S. dollars.
By year's end, the tab should fall to about 100 U.S. dollars,
bringing the Pentium II into the sub-1,000 U.S. dollar PC market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Grant $29 Million for Refugees in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 6 (Xinhua)--The U.S. government has granted 29
million U.S. dollars for the financing of the return and
accommodation of refugees in Bosnia-Her-zegovina, UNHCR spokesman
Chris Janowski told reporters in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
The 29 million US dollars make one third of the money UNHCR
requested from the international community, with the aim of
implementing the return plan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be implemented primarily through the financing
of "open town" projects, which include considerable financial
assistance to municipalities willing to allow a mass return of
members of minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The whole project for the area of former Yugoslavia will cost
187 million US dollars, of which 87 million will go to
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Janowski also expressed hope that 1998 would see a mass return
of refugees to Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
So far, only symbolic results have been achieved in that part
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite verbal assurances from Biljana
Plavsich, the president of the Republika Srpska, he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 35000 and 45000 Croatian Serb refugees are still in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Janowski estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Serb refugees are accommodated in the wider Banja Luka
area, in other people's houses, and that is an additional problem
in the process of return, Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Alia Izetbegovich, the president of the Presidency of
the Bosnia-Herzegovina, suggested that the Croatian Serb refugees
firstly will return to Croatia, but the Croats didn't gave a
positive answer.

LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, whose country is holding the current European Union (EU)
Presidency, said Tuesday that there might be a EU ministeral visit
to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Cook expressed grave concern in the reported massive killings
in Algeria by saying: "Not only is the death toll appallingly
high, but the manner of the deaths is particularly distressing."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 500 Algerian civilians have been
killed in the first six days of the holy Moslem month of Ramandan
and the Armed Islamic Group was likely to be blamed for most of
those killings.
</P>
<P>
Cook note that Britain, as current EU President, would put the
issue on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting to
be held on January 26.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary stressed that the meeting would also
consider whether a EU delegation should visit Algeria to assess
the situation there.
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring with our partners the possibility of a troika
mission," Cook said. The so-called troika delegation includes the
current, the immediate past and the next EU presidency state.

LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major stock markets

with London being the only one that managed to close 1.9 points
higher.
</P>

Britain's FTSE 100 index managed to recover from a loss of 40

points, up 1.9 points, as rising gilts and benign inflation
prospects offered some support.

BRUSSELS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, said here today that it
had started probing into allegations that Polish-made
polypropylene binder or baler twine was being dumped in EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that a trade association, the EU Twine,
Cordage and Netting Industries (Eurocord), had filed a complaint
with the EU executive on behalf of producers across EU countries.
</P>
<P>
In a notice published in the EU's Official Journal, the
Commission said the allegation of dumping was based on a
comparison of domestic prices in Poland with export prices to the
EU, adding that the dumping margins calculated on the basis were
"significant".
</P>
<P>
The EU producers alleged hat the volume and prices of the
imported twine, used by farmers to bind bundles to be picked up by
automatic balers, had had a "substantial adverse effect on the
financial situation" of EU industry, according to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive has decided to give concerned parties 40 days
to submit relevant information.

<HEADLINE> EU Should Urge Turkey to Act on Kurd Influx: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
commissioner today urged the EU to ask Turkey to take measures to
stem a flood of Kurd refugees into the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for external relations with
central and eastern European countries, made the appeal at a
meeting of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee
held on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He told the committee that the EU should have to consider
tightening controls at its own outer borders to prevent mafia
smugglers of people taking advantage of the Kurds' plight.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary that we consult with Turkey to see
what, from their side, can be done to stop a completely
uncontrolled influx of immigrants," the commissioner was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Kurdish people arrived last week in Italy
aboard two boats from Turkey. More are said to be still on the
way. The arrival has caused fears among EU member countries,
especially Italy's EU neighbors, of an influx of illegal
immigrants through Italy.
</P>
<P>
EU experts who deal with the Schengen passport-free travel zone
involving a total of nine EU countries at present, are scheduled
to meet on Wednesday to discuss this matter.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said the experts would discuss whether the EU's
external border controls were an effective protection against
organized criminals dealing in illegal immigration.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Name Riel Father of Confederation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is to
name Metis leader Louis Riel a Father of Confederation as part of
reconciliation to the Aboriginal Peoples.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to be released Wednesday, the government will
recognize the contribution of Indians, Metis and Inuit peoples to
the founding of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It will also single out Riel for his role in establishing the
province of Manitoba, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Riel, who was hanged for treason in Regina in 1885 after the
Northwest Rebellion, is a controversial figure in Canada and his
death has been a cause of division between French and English
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming reconciliation statement will see Riel take
another step toward having his conviction lifted by Canada's
Parliament, according to Metis leaders.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Morin, leader of the Metis National Council, said the
statement may be tantamount to an apology for the treatment of
Riel.
</P>
<P>
"If you read between the lines, a Father of Confederation
cannot be guilty of treason," Morin was quoted as saying.
