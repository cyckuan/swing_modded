back in the hulking form of Brian Dennehy, whose sagging bulk seems
to fill up the entire doorway of his house, when he is first
glimpsed, sample bags in hand, in the new staging of the play. It

   APPLES-BOSTON (Boston) _ Boston is the most historic city in
America, a repository of our national past, yet it has an
extraordinary capacity to reinvent itself. The Pilgrims landed
nearby. Boston became the cradle of liberty, but later it became a
byword for bluenosed narrow-mindedness. It has traded and
manufactured. Nowadays it manages money, and capitalizes on the
science and technology developed in its laboratories. It has boomed
and busted and now it is a boom town again, uncouth as that sounds.
The one constant has been ideas: Boston ideas have washed across
the nation and the world for two centuries. There can be very few
cities in the country with as much to offer the visitor. Historical
sites abound, of course, enough to exhaust the most avid dwellers
in the past. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   WORLD-MUSIC (Undated) _ World music thrives on
misunderstandings. As a marketing category, it's a grand
hodge-podge. The world-music bins of any well-stocked store are
likely to hold field recordings from remote villages as well as pop
songs concocted in 64-track digital studios, and practitioners of
traditional styles end up next to hybrids of, say, didgeridoo and
Brazilian percussion and synthesizer. American popular music is
downright provincial in its mass media, rejecting nearly everything
with lyrics that aren't in English. But while world music is
ignored by commercial radio and television, many listeners who
discover it get hooked. Importers and licensers and packagers of
world music have created a small world with a huge number of
possibilities. By Jon Pareles.

   MORGAN-MANUSCRIPTS (New York) _ When is a book more than a book?
Anytime it does its job, you might well answer. That is, when its
contents awaken the mind with some combination of guidance,
distraction, insight, knowledge and pleasure. But there are
concrete ways that books can be more than books: when they combine
aspects of painting, sculpture and architecture to become works of
visual art. Books of this sort are the subject of a sumptuous
exhibition at the Morgan Library that ranges through nine
centuries, from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and early
printed books; through an extraordinary array of fine bindings from
different countries, periods and styles, to modern, mostly English
private-press books and livres d'artistes. They all come from the
collection of Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a lifelong
bibliophile. By Roberta Smith.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Up to this point, the NBA season has been anything but fun. The
lockout robbed everyone of half the season, but the way Hakeem
Olajuwon sees things, this could wind up being a fun season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olajuwon and his teammates exchanged friendly fire Thursday
night at Compaq Center, playing a scrimmage that was open to the
public, 10,414 of whom showed up to watch.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw was Olajuwon's White team pulling away at the end
for a 100-81 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what basketball is all about,'' said Olajuwon, who
finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds to lead the White team.
``This reminded me of the summertime, just out there having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable, and the game is fun. That's the way I
like to have the season, competitive but at the same time fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun was hard to come by for Olajuwon last season, when he missed
34 games because of knee problems _ 33 after surgery to remove a
medial plica from his left knee. Olajuwon averaged 16.4 points, far
below his career average of 24 per game, shooting just 48.3 percent
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But after a summer of intense work, Olajuwon, 36, is playing
free and easy. He's having fun again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working out, so getting a chance to really test it
(his knee) was exciting,'' Olajuwon said. ``You practice, but it's
different in a game situation. Just to see what I could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel? I felt so comfortable, and I felt so light on
the floor. I am looking forward to the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is because the Rockets, after an injury-filled
41-41 season, are back in the championship hunt after getting
Scottie Pippen from the Chicago Bulls. Pippen, who played on
Olajuwon's White team, finished with 17 points, five rebounds and
six assists Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And part of Olajuwon's excitement is from being back and playing
again. Olajuwon sat back after the game, ice packs taped to each
knee, and marveled at the fact he is playing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also getting back to playing basketball after being out
so long,'' Olajuwon said. ``Everybody's acting like it's a new
start. There's a lot of excitement. Everybody's positive. Myself,
I've been training, but now I get the chance to play so it's like a
new start for me also. Scottie, coming in, it's a new start for
him. Everybody has that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been playing for so long. Somebody was telling me
that it was almost seven months before we were back in this
building. I couldn't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   And they could be playing in Compaq Center for a while, too,
with the squad the Rockets will put on the floor this season.
Olajuwon put in a full summer of work to get healthy again, and so
did Charles Barkley, who is playing pain-free for the first time in
a year. Add the recent acquisition of Pippen, and you have plenty
to make Olajuwon smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is encouraging to see,'' Olajuwon said. ``And the chemistry
is there. Everybody is working together. There are so many talents
out there playing together. This should be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at this preseason, and we have only practiced
together four or five times. Let's see how quickly this team comes
together. We have the outside shooters, the inside-outside (game).
This is a complete team. We have the chemistry. We have the
experience; we have young talent playing together, an excellent
coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon's play is making the coaching staff smile. Some of
Olajuwon's highlights from Thursday's scrimmage included three
dunks, the last of which came with 1:58 to play. Barkley missed a
short shot, but Olajuwon soared in for an offensive-rebound dunk
that brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really worked hard this summer, and if I could say in one
word what I see, it's explosion,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``He's really taking it to the basket strong; he's
snatching rebounds over people and then going up and power-dunking
it over people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just part of the game, Olajuwon said, adding he is not out to
prove anything after last season's injury-marred ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not my intention to respond to that,'' Olajuwon said.
``My intention is to realize what we have to do after we built the
strength back up in my knee. I have to go do extra things to get my
legs ready so I can feel comfortable to play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the whole idea, to be able to play and have fun when
you're playing. When you're playing in pain, it's not fun. So I
know what I have to do to rebuild the strength in my knee so I
could at least enjoy what I am doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Thursday night. The Rockets made sure everyone enjoyed
themselves, sending Brent Price, Rodrick Rhodes and Cuttino Mobley
into the upper part of Compaq Center to bring down deserving fans
and award them courtside seats. Eddie Johnson and Othella
Harrington did likewise on the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, every Rocket came out and signed autographs,
including Olajuwon. He rose from his seat, peeled off his sweaty
shirt and began the walk out to the court for his turn at signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This going to be a fun season,'' Olajuwon said. ``I think I
will enjoy the journey. I just want to enjoy the journey, one game
at a time.''

NIAGRA MOHAWK IN TALKS TO SELL NUCLEAR PLANT NEAR SYRACUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., a large utility in upstate New
York, is in discussions to sell its holdings in the troubled Nine
Mile Point nuclear plant to the Amergen Energy Co., which last year
bought the only functioning unit at Three Mile Island, the site of
the nation's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk joins many other utilities that want to dispose
of their nuclear plants and focus instead on the distribution of
power, which is seen as a promising business under the coming era
of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   For Amergen, a joint venture of the PECO Energy Co. and British
Energy PLC, the potential purchase of Niagara's Nine Mile Point
property, near Syracuse, N.Y., represents a bet that it can
profitably operate the installation in a region where power prices
are high.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara said on Thursday that it was in talks with a potential
buyer, which it would not identify. A person close to the
discussions said the potential buyer was Amergen. The company
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price under discussion was not known, but it is
likely to sell for much less than the $1.5 billion value of the
property listed on Niagara's books. Amergen's purchase of the
working reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania cost
it $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara's holdings consist of a 41 percent interest in the Nine
Mile 2 reactor, which began to operate in 1988. It was one of the
most expensive nuclear plants built, costing $4.6 billion. The
company also owns all of Nine Mile 1, which is 30 years old and
cost $550 million to build.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they produce 1,753 megawatts of electricity, enough to
light nearly two million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns, estimated
that Niagara might get $135 million from a sale.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 to 1991, both plants suffered a series of outages and
were put on the watch list of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In
recent years, however, both plants have operated well. Nine Mile 1,
for example, operated above 90 percent capacity last year, which is
considered a very high level.
</P>
<P>
   Amergen is one of two companies that have been looking to buy
nuclear power plants. The other is the Entergy Corp., a major
utility in the Southwest, which recently bought the Pilgrim nuclear
plant near Plymouth, Mass. from Boston Edison for $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara's shares rose 62.5 cents on Thursday, to $15.5625.

 &HT;    Bush proposes 9 percent spending increase
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Identifying more available federal dollars than
lawmakers did, Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday laid out a $96.4
billion spending plan that, if adopted, would mean slightly more
state spending and tax relief at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bush proposed a two-year state budget that is about 5
percent larger than one filed by lawmakers a week ago and about 9
percent larger than the current state budget, which ends Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am giving to the Legislature a detailed budget which
is balanced and reflects my priorities: the schoolchildren of Texas
and the taxpayers of Texas,'' Bush told reporters. It ``meets the
basic needs of the state, makes the schools the No. 1 funding
priority and sends money back to the taxpayers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, governors are not required _ but are allowed _ to lay
out a budget. This is the second time Bush has presented a
line-by-line spending plan to lawmakers. In 1995, Bush presented
only broad ideas for the 1996-97 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the historical nature of gubernatorial budget proposals,
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said Bush has raised the importance of his
input in the state budget process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to go back for a while to remember a governor's
budget that (did) anything other than end up as a doorstop,'' Perry
said. ``I think the governor's budget proposal shows that improving
public schools, meeting the basic needs, balancing our budget and
providing significant tax cuts are all very realistic and
achievable goals. Children, families, schools, small business,
taxpayers _ they are all big winners in Governor Bush's proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers earlier this month laid out a $91.7 billion spending
plan. In the past, governors' spending proposals were largely
ignored. It is yet to be determined how closely lawmakers will
consider Bush's specific proposals, though his top priorities will
get close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals include $2 billion to cut local school property
taxes; $1 billion more for teachers; $584 million for such things
as summer-school classes, textbooks and after-school programs; $330
million in consumer sales-tax cuts on over-the-counter medicines
($150 million), diapers ($110 million), health aids ($50 million)
and Internet access ($20 million); $250 million in tax credits for
business research and development; and $57 million in franchise tax
exemptions for small business.
</P>
<P>
   Though senior lawmakers have raised concerns that not all of
Bush's ideas can be paid for, the governor would not specify an
order of priority and would not say what he would scuttle in order
to ensure passage of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty good negotiator, and one lesson is don't
negotiate with yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election campaign, Bush also called for a
``sales-tax holiday'' _ a two-week period during which sales taxes
wouldn't be collected on school clothes and shoe wear. Bush dropped
that $100 million idea, citing a lower-than-expected estimate of
state income for the next two years. He said of all his ideas, that
one would have been the most difficult to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing questions about Democratic calls for larger consumer
tax cuts and other priorities, Bush said he understands that
everyone won't agree with him. But he said he is encouraged that
Republicans and Democrats are clamoring over which taxes to cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there is not an attempt to overspend the
money,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting his tax cuts, Bush's plan is $8 billion, or about 9
percent, more than the 1998-99 budget. The majority of the
additional spending would be for education.
</P>
<P>
   In his line-by-line budget, Bush proposed slightly more spending
in every category of the state budget than lawmakers have.
According to Albert Hawkins, Bush's budget chief, many of those
state dollars help attract more federal money for such things as
transportation and health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   John Keel, head of the Legislative Budget Board, said
legislative budget writers were aware of the federal money, but
wanted lawmakers to decide how much to try to draw down from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   According to budget experts, it wouldn't make sense for the
state to disregard federal dollars, some of which are available
only if the state matches the money. But if Congress redirected
those dollars, the state would have to decide whether to cut the
services or use state funds to pay for them, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any government where there is some reliance on funds from
other than the government's own sources, there is that risk that
the purposes and objectives of the sending government changes,''
said Thomas Keel, John Keel's uncle, a former state budget official
and a lecturer at UT's LBJ School of Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his line-by-line budget, Bush proposed spending
$265.6 million from the state's settlement with the nation's
tobacco industry. Of that, $154.4 million would go to the
Children's Health Insurance Program, which offers subsidized health
coverage for children. Hawkins said the $154.4 million would help
get insurance for some 130,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal leaves about $1 billion in unspent tobacco
settlement dollars. Hawkins said Bush wants lawmakers to decide how
to use that money and might support ideas to endow permanent health
and education efforts with it.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the odds for his proposals Bush said, ``This is a
process. ... There's committee hearings here and committee hearings
there and revenue estimates here and revenue estimates there.
There's a lot of process going on.''

 &HT;    Another record for Austin United WayBy Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Central Texas workers and companies pledged a
record $12.7 million to United Way/Capital Area in 1998, 26.4
percent more than in 1997, and almost certainly setting a national
record for percentage increase in giving for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in donations was fueled by increased generosity
throughout United Way's network of about 600 participating
companies, from small shops and government employees to Austin's
major employers, the top 25 of which recorded a 39 percent
increase. Total pledges to United Way/Capital Area were
$12,773,078.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which three years ago ranked fifth in
giving, was the top corporate giver this year, increasing its
employee contributions 216 percent to nearly $2.7 million. Dell
employees gave about $1.8 million more than in 1997, accounting for
most of the entire campaign's $2.6 million increase from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokeswoman Cathie Hargett said 400 company volunteers
promoted the United Way effort enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize how fortunate we are in Austin and how lucky we
are at Dell, and we want to give back to the community,'' Hargett
said. ``The United Way is a very efficient and very direct way.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced Thursday night at the charity's 75th
anniversary gala and awards banquet at Austin Marriot At The
Capitol. About 44 Austin agencies that do everything from providing
groceries for people with AIDS to promoting low-cost dental care
for poor people will receive grants. The United Way also runs a
volunteer clearinghouse, a telephone help service and a program
that helps nonprofits improve management.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of America has not finished compiling figures for all
1,400 local United Ways, but preliminary figures show Austin will
once again have the highest increase among large United Ways,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   United Way/Capital Area serves seven Central Texas counties and
raises money primarily in Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Godsey, president and CEO of United Way/Capital Area,
attributed the fund-raising effort's success to its focus on how
United Way donations helped about 582,000 Texans last year. Central
Texas' healthy economy was another factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not finished. We need to continue to do more,'' Godsey
said. ``What we've been able to do is build a very positive
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site that also saw a big increase in donations was the
City of Austin, where donations increased 34 percent to $360,079.
Peter Rieck, the director of the city's public works and
transportation department, said about 200 volunteers participated
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, leaders of the campaign encouraged city
employees earning more than $75,000 to donate $1,000, and 38
employees agreed to do so, Rieck said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,700 donors throughout the Austin area gave $1,000, a
27 percent increase over 1997.

LOOPHOLE IN LAW LETS DRIVERS BEAT DUI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It turns out that sometimes you ``can'' drink and drive in
Arizona _ as long as you down the booze just before jumping in your
car.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you get stopped by police and cited for driving under
the influence, you can always argue later that, technically, the
alcohol hadn't yet kicked into your brain while you were behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   That is what drivers and their defense attorneys are
increasingly claiming in their efforts to beat drunken-driving
charges _ and they are winning almost half the time they use the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   They are swerving through a loophole in Arizona's DUI law to
claim that their blood alcohol content was below the legal limit of
0.10 when they were stopped, only to rise above the limit in the
time it took to submit to a breath or blood test.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they say, there is a lag time between the
consumption of alcohol and the corresponding rise in blood alcohol
level.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the defense claims are staggering:
</P>
<P>
   In Pima County Superior Court, a suspect alleged that he drank
eight ounces of rum, six beers and a small bottle of whiskey, most
of it just before driving. He claimed that his 0.168 alcohol
reading was only 0.074, below the legal limit _ while he was
driving.
</P>
<P>
   A Kingman defendant said he slammed a pitcher of beer ``just
minutes before driving'' and getting into an accident. His alcohol
level was therefore only 0.04 to 0.07 at the time of the collision,
not the 0.131 recorded later by police, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   A Tempe Municipal Court defendant said that because he drank
eight ounces of vodka just before climbing behind the wheel, his
0.14 reading would have been zero at the time he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has become so successful in Arizona that the
Legislature is being asked by law-enforcement officials to consider
eliminating the loophole _ the only one of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand why our DUI laws aren't working,''
said Sen. Tom Freestone, R-Mesa, who is sponsoring a bill to close
the loophole. ``This is one of the reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone's bill, which he planned to introduce late Thursday or
today, is being backed by law-enforcement officials and prosecutors
around Arizona but is expected to encounter strong opposition from
trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill seeks to repeal the so-called affirmative defense
clause in Arizona's DUI law. The clause basically states that it is
a valid defense if ``credible evidence'' is produced to show that a
defendant's blood alcohol level was below 0.10 at the time he or
she was driving, even if was higher at the time of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Often, defendants argue that they did most or all of their
drinking just before getting in the car, while their breath or
blood tests were administered more than an hour later _ the time
some experts say it takes for alcohol to be absorbed into the
bloodstream. Therefore, they argue, their blood alcohol level
actually was below 0.10 while they were driving.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Hamilton, Mesa's city prosecutor, said the defense is
common in cases involving alcohol levels of 0.10 or slightly above.
It also is becoming common in cases of extreme DUI, which carry
stricter penalties for drivers with blood alcohol levels above
0.18.
</P>
<P>
   Defense experts often are successful in convincing judges that
the actual level was below the legal limit _ or below the extreme
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 50 percent of the time we end up, if we go to trial,
losing those cases,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, prosecutors are forced to prove that the
drivers were impaired without the test results, which is more
difficult and can add days to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Pima County Attorney's Office and the Flagstaff
City Prosecutor's Office also say they frequently lose such cases.
The state Department of Public Safety's crime labs have 10
full-time employees who spend half their time in court debating
alcohol concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Curry, a Phoenix defense attorney, said the reason
defendants win such cases is that they have a legitimate argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it takes more than an hour before they are tested,''
Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts say it takes almost that long to absorb alcohol into
the bloodstream. So if someone drinks right before leaving a bar
and drives for 10 minutes, the alcohol hasn't gotten absorbed and
impaired the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a valid defense. That's why cops always ask how many
drinks you've had in the last hour. They know it takes time to
absorb the alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and law-enforcement officials dispute such claims,
saying alcohol actually is absorbed into the bloodstream almost
immediately. But because several variables are involved, such as
the weight of defendants and whether they ate before drinking,
estimates vary among experts. And the law requires prosecutors to
prove the actual level beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it easy for defendants to take advantage of the
loophole, regardless of how much or when they actually drank, said
Todd Griffith, scientific analyst supervisor for the DPS crime
labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is claimed routinely,'' he said. ``But it is mostly a claim
rather than actually happening. That's why it's a loophole.'' &QL;

   GREENSPAN TELLS CONGRESS NOT TO RELY ON SURPLUSES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told the Senate
Budget Committee not to count on government budget surpluses to
solve Social Security's problems. Instead, he suggested that
benefits may have to be cut or taxes raised to insure the
retirement system's future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton proposed shoring up the system with
$2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion in surpluses anticipated over
the next 15 years. But Greenspan pointed out that budget forecasts
have been notoriously unreliable in the past and are likely to
remain so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the high-flying Internet stocks are fundamentally sound
and will succeed, Greenspan said in response to a question from
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Others, however, will fail, he said. He
attributed the entire Internet-stock phenomenon to human
willingness to bet on a long shot.

   NASDAQ INDEX AT ANOTHER HIGH
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained nearly 3 percent to close at

spurred by a 2-for-1 stock split of Intel. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 81.1 points, or nearly 0.9 percent, to 9,281.33. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased 22.2 points, or 1.79

<P>
   MICROSOFT MUST PROVIDE DOCUMENTS

   The federal judge in the Microsoft antitrust case has ordered
the company to give the Justice Department an internal document

</P>
<P>
   STUDY FINDS NOT ENOUGH OVERSIGHT
</P>
<P>
   William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Federal
Reserve, headed a study that concluded a handful of the world's
largest commercial and investment banks failed to adequately
oversee lending and trading activities with the hedge-fund giant
Long-Term Capital Management. He said that the banks had been
blinded by what he called the ``magic'' of the once high-flying
firm's vaunted reputation, a situation he suggested could recur if
banks did not tighten their monitoring of such funds.
</P>

   TRW SET TO ACQUIRE LUCAS VARITY

</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors put just $3.4 billion into stock funds in

historically a strong time for mutual fund sales, is shaping up
much better than the previous month.

   Genamerica, one of the first mutual life insurance companies to
sell shares to the public under a controversial hybrid structure
two years ago, expects to become a company owned completely by
stockholders.

FORMER SENATOR DOLE ONLY CONSIDERING BUYING LEWINSKY'S OLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe Elizabeth Dole is staking out space for a campaign office.
Or perhaps Bob Dole is pining for a little elbow room in
retirement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or possibly the Doles just want to make sure they don't have
another next-door neighbor who attracts those pesky reporters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, the Doles are looking at the apartment
that Monica Lewinsky lived in recently.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to unattributed reports this week in The New York Times
and Chicago Tribune, an aide to Bob Dole said the Washington power
couple has not yet moved to purchase the condominium next to theirs
at the Watergate complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They went over and looked at it,'' said Douglas MacKinnon, an
aide to the former U.S. senator from Kansas and one-time Republican
presidential nominee. ``But they're not buying.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. MacKinnon said the couple was considering whether to
buy the apartment as a way to expand their own place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole moved into the Watergate late in 1972, just months
after the famed burglary of the Democratic National Committee that
eventually led to Richard Nixon's resignation. Elizabeth Dole
joined him there when the couple married in 1975. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis, eventually rented the
apartment next door. Lewinsky has since departed for her native Los
Angeles and her mother has gone to live with a new husband in New
York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Barnhard, a real estate broker who has had an office at the
Watergate, said both apartments fall at the low end of condominiums
at the complex. Each is a two-bedroom townhouse of about 1,800
square feet facing north toward a fire lane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some units at the Watergate fetch $600,000, she estimated
the former Lewinsky domicile would cost $250,000 to $300,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Doles could get a better bargain in the former senator's
hometown of Russell, Kan. A 2,000-square-foot, five-bedroom,
three-fireplace home there with an in-ground pool recently sold for
about $140,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prices,'' said Russell real estate broker Nadene Albrecht,
``are more reasonable.'' &QL;

TOWNSHIP MIGHT REQUIRE TIGER CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ The day after authorities shot and
killed a 600-pound Bengal tiger that had escaped into the woods,
residents awoke Thursday to learn that a one-square-mile area here
has a surprising concentration of tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were still trying to find out where the stray
tiger came from, but in searching their records, they discovered
that within a few hundred yards of where the tiger was killed, 32
tigers of various species are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Nine are among the menagerie of Great Adventure's Safari Park
and 23 are on the state wildlife agency's records as being kept at
a private preserve just a mile or so away that has been operating
here for more than 30 years without incident. Called the Tigers
Only Preserve, it is run by Joan Byron-Marasek, who has earned a
place in local lore and among local children as the mysterious
``Tiger Lady.'' But her existence was often doubted by many adults.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday investigators had determined that Great
Adventure's tigers were all accounted for and that the park never
had a yellow Bengal. They were still double-checking the earlier
counts of the tigers at the private preserve and completing an
autopsy and an examination of the contents of the dead tiger's
stomach, which may help them trace its movements and origin.
</P>
<P>
   David Chanda, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of
Fish, Game and Wildlife, said investigators had not ruled out the
possibility that the tiger was an illegally kept pet that had
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a tiger census, but I think I want one now,''
said Mayor William Allman, who was among those who knew vaguely
about Ms. Byron-Marasek's preserve. ``I knew about the Tiger Lady
and thought she had just a couple of tigers. This is the first time
I've heard that she had 23.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest known concentration of tigers in the wild is 500
tigers in a 10,000-square-kilometer area in India, or one tiger for
every 7.7 square miles, Sy Montgomery, author of the 1995 book
``Spell of the Tiger'' (Houghton Mifflin), said in a telephone
interview Thursday. She said that in this country, there were
animal training centers for circuses where there might be as high a
concentration as in Jackson Township. Grzimek's Animal Life
Encyclopedia gives a typical range for tigers in India, where game
is plentiful, as about one per 19 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Because no people were hurt while the tiger wandered the area
for seven hours on Wednesday, some residents like Karen Jonin, a
clerk at a local convenience store, thought the incident was funny.
</P>
<P>
   One of the store's patrons, Elena Scanlon, said that she lived
next to Great Adventure and awoke in the morning to the roaring of
the big cats at the zoological park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I didn't think it would be like the African veld
with them wandering around,'' she added. ``But it doesn't really
bother me. I've seen worse. I'm from New York.'' (There are no
tigers in Africa.)
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away at the Cassville Tavern and Restaurant, Fred
Messinger, a patron, said he felt as if he were in the middle of
his favorite Las Vegas act: Siegfried and Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were some strange animals being raised in the
area, like llamas and emus, but nothing like this, nothing
carnivorous,'' he said, noting that his children had often
mentioned a tiger preserve but that he had discounted it as
fantasy. ``I'd better start listening to my children more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Township, in the northwestern corner of Ocean County
near the Monmouth County border, covers about 100 square miles,
making it the fourth-largest municipality, in size, in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Before much of the growth began, Ms. Byron-Marasek and her
husband, Jan, opened their preserve 30 years ago on a 12-acre
parcel about a mile northeast of where Great Adventure was later
built. On Thursday, private guards were posted outside the property
to ward off visitors and reporters, and Ms. Byron-Marasek could not
be reached for comment.

<P>
   Broncos (1,315) _ Rushing yards allowed through 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons (1,358) _ Rushing yards allowed through 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTS: Not only does the Denver-Atlanta contest feature
dominating running games, but the teams also possess gritty run
defenses. This makes Super Bowl XXXIII a game of pure will. Which
team will be able to exert its will, especially in the running
game? Which will use that to force its style and completely color
the complexion of the game? Is Terrell Davis the man? Jamal
Anderson? The Denver defense or the Atlanta defense?
</P>
<P>
   Well, both runners have had their way recently, but it is the
run defense of both teams that presents the strongest hint of what
is to come. Though the teams through 20 games apiece show only a
43-yard differential in rushing yards allowed (advantage Denver),
what has happened in their two playoff games says which is hottest.
Against San Francisco and Minnesota in the playoffs, Atlanta
allowed 157 rushing yards. Against Miami and the Jets, Denver
allowed 28 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much character _ coach Dan Reeves, quarterback Chris
Chandler, linebacker Jessie Tuggle and receiver Terance Mathis,
just to name a few _ among the Falcons. A spate of destiny and aura
has developed among them this season and there is every reason to
believe they will fight and make enough big plays in the passing
game and on defense to create a stir.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what they face: A focused, machine-like team in
Denver that smells greatness. A team that yearns for a chance to
repeat as champions. A club that fully understands the minute, the
moment and how to capitalize. A Broncos offensive team that set
club records this season in touchdowns (62), first downs (347),
points scored (501), rushing yards (2,468), total offense (6,902),
rushing touchdowns (26), highest average gain per play (5.9) and
most passing touchdowns (32). That is a mouthful. Denver is a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   Next: Mike Freeman's selection.

A PLAYER HEATS UP, AND IT ISN'T DUVAL
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ David Duval endured one of his most
difficult rounds of the month Thursday, but Justin Leonard enjoyed
his best.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a four-under-par 67 on a blustery day at the TPC of
Scottsdale, Leonard held a one-stroke lead when the first round of
the Phoenix Open was suspended because of darkness. Paul Azinger
was alone in second place with a 68, while six golfers were tied
for third at 69 _ Lee Janzen, Payne Stewart, Bill Glasson, Gabriel
Hjertstedt, Blaine McCallister and Rocco Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duval was two over par through 16 holes, playing his
first competitive round since Sunday, when he became only the third
player to shoot a 59 in a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five players were on the course when play was halted
Thursday, but first-round play will be resumed Friday morning,
followed by second-round action.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an incredible 15-month run for Duval, who has won 9
of his last 28 starts, including both starts this year _ the
Mercedes Championships and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. How long
can Duval keep winning at that pace? Nobody knows. But even before
he teed off this afternoon, Duval knew his historic 59 would remain
one of the highlights of his career, no matter what else he
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever fully appreciate what happened on
Sunday,'' said Duval, who overcame a seven-stroke deficit in the
final round to win the Hope.
</P>
<P>
   However, Duval ended Thursday by making bogeys at both No. 15
and 16, and he was one of many players who had difficulty finding a
rhythm. Play was delayed an hour because of frost, and with morning
temperatures in the mid-40's, the weather felt more like the
British Open than the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the wind gust up to 20 miles an hour, but the rough
at the TPC of Scottsdale has been grown higher this year in an
attempt to make the course play tougher. It worked. Even some who
played well complained about the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too deep,'' said Azinger, who is trying to win on tour
for the first time since 1993, when he won the PGA Championship.
``A lot of the skill is lost when all you do is hit wedges out of
rough, especially when the greens are hard as rock like these
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard found a way to cope, in a round that included five
birdies and one bogey. This has become one of Leonard's favorite
events, and he almost won it in 1996, losing to Phil Mickelson in a
sudden-death playoff. Leonard said that playoff helped him mature
as a player, because he performed well under adverse circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Open historically attracts some of the largest and
rowdiest galleries on tour, and during that playoff in 1996, the
gallery vocally supported Mickelson, who was a collegiate star at
nearby Arizona State. Some fans heckled Leonard during his round,
hoping it would rattle him. But Leonard shot a final-round 69, then
forced Mickelson to a third playoff hole finally losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation, and I played well in it,'' said
Leonard, who won the 1997 British Open. ``I learned a lot that
week, and it's something I still carry with me. That tournament
made me a better golfer. There are times when I pull from that
experience, putting away distractions and focusing on what I have
to do. Looking back on that tournament, it was more of a confidence
builder than a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the top 11 players in the world ranking have entered
this week's event _ Tiger Woods, Duval, Vijah Singh, Jim Furyk and
Mickelson. Singh and Mickelson both struggled with 74's Thursday,
Woods was two over par through 14 holes, and Furyk was four over
par through 14 holes.

COMPLEX EL-AMIN BRINGS ENERGY TO UCONN'S ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Jim Calhoun smiled as he described the impact Khalid
El-Amin has had on his Connecticut team since his arrival last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a team in the desert and we needed some water,''
Calhoun said. ``He was the guy carrying the water. And he had ice
cubes in it.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who will lead top-ranked and unbeaten Connecticut
against No. 9 St. John's Saturday afternoon at Madison Square
Garden, jolts the Huskies like a piece of ice to the nape of the
neck, sending a shiver of excitement through a program that has
long been successful but never a champion.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin is young and very good, averaging 13.7 points and 3.8
assists, the only possible weakness being that he is still learning
that a point guard should pass more than he shoots. But the
19-year-old from Minneapolis has been a dominating force on the
court since he was in third grade and playing with a team of
sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   He led the Huskies to a regional final of the NCAA tournament
last spring and the U.S. team to a Goodwill Games gold medal last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation, he came across as wise in many ways,
speaking eloquently about his Orthodox Muslim beliefs. Yet he can
be brash in other ways, as when he discusses the opposing players
who overestimate his girth and underestimate his game.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his energy level that has elevated Connecticut to the
elite level of the sport, and why this may be the team that finally
gives Calhoun his first national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed a player like me, vocal, who could lead by
example,'' El-Amin said. ``I have always been like that. I wanted
to be the best and show everybody. You need energy for that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his short, powerful legs churning, the mouth of his round
face opened in an O whenever the ball is in play, El-Amin looks
like nothing so much as a very tall toddler _ the famously padded
body of a Cabbage Patch doll combined with the mouth of a Furby. At
5 feet 10 inches, he is usually the shortest person on the court,
but also the most compelling. He ``whoo-whoos'' at his teammates,
jokes with his coaches, chats up the team managers. He can carry on
a vivid, hilarious, motivational monologue for almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached short players and they bring an attitude,'' St.
John's coach Mike Jarvis said. ``They've been proving themselves
all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, El-Amin is as wide open as the fields of rural
Storrs, his emotions so close to the top that when Connecticut
pulled out an early-season victory in Pittsburgh with an El-Amin
buzzer beater, he vaulted onto the scorer's table for a
chest-thumping victory dance in front of the Pitt fans who had
taunted him for hours. But a second later, when Calhoun pulled him
down, El-Amin knew he had done wrong, just like a little boy caught
yanking a girl's pigtails. It is hard to imagine slowing El-Amin
down.
</P>
<P>
   Until he is asked about his marriage. And his two children.
Then, El-Amin, who is so eager to answer questions about
basketball, grows hesitant. He listens. He asks for the question to
be rephrased. He answers eventually, his voice lower than before,
and sometimes he doesn't answer at all.
</P>
<P>
   These are the two sides to El-Amin: the childlike elf who makes
frequent stops at the Huskies' sports information office to look at
pictures of himself, and the reticent adult, so private about his
personal life that for more than a year he did not bother to
correct reports that he had been divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find him to be one of the most fascinating people, young or
old, I've met,'' Calhoun said. ``And lovable all at the same time.
He's incredibly bright and incredibly mature. He's about 15 years
old to 35, depending on the subject matter and the moment. And he
always seems to know the moment. He has a switch inside that he can
really turn on. He's tremendously competitive and he doesn't ever
really turn it off, but he can take it to different levels. There's
a lot there but he will only open the door on his terms.''
</P>
<P>
   His terms are this: His wife, Jessica, whom he wed when he was
16, is off limits to reporters. She and El-Amin and their newborn
son share a large apartment with one of the team managers, Josh
Nochimson, near campus. She does attend games, frequently. When
El-Amin was 17, he fathered his first son, now 2, with another
woman in Minnesota. When El-Amin arrived in Storrs as a freshman,
Jessica was not with him, and reports had them divorcing. They did
not, and they renewed their marriage vows last summer. When Jessica
joined Khalid this season the two made a decision that is seemingly
counter to El-Amin's personality: she would not become an active
participant in El-Amin's story.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance sprang, El-Amin's father, Charles, says, from the
time a hometown columnist wrote that Minnesota should not offer him
a scholarship because he had fathered a child out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went into a shell then,'' said Charles El-Amin, a former
imam, or religious leader of the Muslim faith and now a
public-school bus driver. ``Even I notice that I have to pull
certain things out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin says only that having a family helps him focus on
basketball when he is on the court and on his responsibilities at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get home, I'm much more laid back and I'm trying to be
a family person,'' El-Amin said. ``When I was back in Minnesota,
and I was married, everybody wanted to talk about it. That was my
personal life and I wanted it to be personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the limelight, everybody wants to talk to you,
but when you're at home, you want to keep that part of your life
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems an unexpected and remarkably mature decision for
any 19-year-old to make, let alone one who is so comfortable in the
spotlight that, upon receiving the Big East rookie of the year
award last spring, he thanked those who had not believed in him
because he got to prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of kids who want to hide what their life is,''
Calhoun said. ``He's very proud. His attitude is `You know it,
that's fine, but talk about basketball and academics.'''
</P>
<P>
   He does not think about whether he will go to the National
Basketball Association after this season, he says, but having two
sons makes him work harder, so that he can provide good lives for
them. And when basketball is done maybe he will become an imam,
too, a wish his father clearly shares when he says El-Amin will be
a great leader beyond the game. Until then, El-Amin will straddle
the two parts of his personality, his priorities as varied as his
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take care of my family and keep my family up and to stay
strong in my religion,'' El-Amin said. ``And definitely to lead the
Huskies to the national championship. It's all over the place, but
they're all in perspective.'' &QL;

ROMANOWSKI: ROBO-LINEBACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The name on the back of his No. 53 jersey reads
ROMANOWSKI.
</P>
<P>
   But the man behind those thick swathes of eye black that are as
much war paint as they are protection from the glare of the sun has
always patterned his play after LAMBERT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who always stood out in my mind was Jack Lambert,''
Bill Romanowski said Thursday. ``He was a guy who wasn't fast
enough, wasn't big enough, wasn't strong enough, but was always
there making plays. He took overachiever to a new level. And his
intensity was contagious on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski grew up idolizing Lambert, the Steelers' Hall of Fame
linebacker. But he has grown into his own man, a Pro Bowl
linebacker and the leader of a much-improved Denver defense that
will have as much to do with the Broncos defending their title in
Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIII matchup with the Atlanta Falcons as
Terrell Davis, John Elway or Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have flirted with perfection in shutting down the
Miami Dolphins and New York Jets in the playoffs. Romanowski and
friends have allowed only one touchdown, and that was a 1-yard run
set up by a blocked punt. They held the Dolphins to 11 rushing
yards on eight attempts, and then did the same thing in the AFC
championship game to the Jets' Curtis Martin _ the only back to
rush for more than 100 yards against the Falcons this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the target will be Jamal Anderson, second among NFL
rushers this season only to Denver's Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole focus all week is getting a lot of bodies on him,''
Romanowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski is the best player on the Broncos' defense, an
intimidating presence who leads but also has been led astray by his
own overflowing emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, you get his best shot,'' said Shanahan, the
Broncos coach. ``The game means everything, and you can tell that
from the way that he prepares every week. It's not coincidence he's
involved in so many big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Romanowski the football player _ the very talented and
versatile football player _ can't escape the shadow of Bill
Romanowski the occasional whacko.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski has been making plays all season. Big plays. During
the regular season, he collected 95 tackles and 7{ sacks,
intercepted two passes and led the team in fumbles forced (3) and
recovered (3). In the playoffs, Romanowski is the Broncos' leading
tackler (17) and continues to make big plays (one interception, a
fumble recovery and a forced fumble).
</P>
<P>
   But the events everyone wants to focus on are his big mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The helmet-to-helmet collision with Kerry Collins in a 1997
preseason game that left the then-quarterback of the Panthers with
a fractured jaw and earned him a $20,000 fine from the league. The
classless act of spitting in the face of 49ers wide receiver J.J.
Stokes last season during a Monday night game that cost Romanowski
another $7,500 fine. Getting into the face of Kordell Stewart and
calling him dumb after the Steelers quarterback had thrown an
interception during last year's AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   These actions, and the ferocity that triggers them, not only
have left lasting impressions, they have provoked some unfavorable
first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was crazy, to tell you the truth,'' fellow
linebacker John Mobley said when asked for his initial reaction to
Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   No, says the look of determination that replaces the gaze of
dementia in Romanowski's intense eyes. Not this time. Not in this
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be a guy who pushes the limit once in awhile,''
Romanowski said. ``But in a game of this magnitude, I'll be on my
very best behavior.''

GENAMERICA TO BECOME PURE STOCKHOLDER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Genamerica Corp., one of the first mutual life insurers to
sell shares to the public under a hybrid structure two years ago,
said Thursday that it was becoming a company owned completely by
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen mutual companies have converted to hybrids, which
can sell shares worth up to 49 percent of their value while 51
percent of the company remains with the policyholders. Because the
majority ownership of the hybrids, known as mutual holding
companies, stays with policyholders, they became immune from
hostile takeovers. And the minority public stake gave the hybrid
some insulation from shareholder demands for performance that pure
stock companies faced.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, consumer advocates and executives of stock
companies allied as critics of the hybrids predicted that the
hybrids would never move toward full stock ownership. Genamerica,
one of the top 40 life insurers, with assets around $20 billion, is
the first to take that step.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the shift, said Richard A. Liddy, chief executive
of Genamerica, was to be able to raise unlimited amounts of
capital. ``We could have raised enough capital to last us awhile,''
he said, ``but sooner or later we would have to'' find ways to
raise more.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the hybrids pointed out that while the new company
could sell stock, none of it would go to the policyholders. Not
only were they denied any tangible benefit from the hybrid
structure, the critics argued, but the new structure created a
struggle over profit between policyholders and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy said he also proposed the change, which was endorsed by
the company's board Thursday, because he thought ``it was time to
deliver value to the policyholders.''
</P>
<P>
   When a mutual insurer converts to full shareholder ownership,
the company's equity is divided among the policyholders. And after
two years as a hybrid, there is more equity to be shared _ in
Genamerica's case, $1.3 billion, compared with $1 billion when the
hybrid was formed early in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That $1.3 billion will be divided among 300,000 policyholders,
an average of $4,333.33 each _ $762 more than two years earlier,
when 280,000 policyholders would have shared $1 billion. The actual
amount received will depend on the size and duration of each
policy. Furthermore, the value of the shares is almost certain to
increase when they are offered on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mayewski, a senior analyst at AM Best, said the shift was
not surprising. ``Genamerica has always been a progressive
organization, more entrepreneurial and more like a stock company
than many mutuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Seifert of Standard &AMP; Poor's said the change sent a
positive signal about Genamerica to the markets. With the hybrid
structure, she said, ``you have sort of divided loyalties and
priorities between shareholders and policyholders,'' and it ``gives
the sense that the company is not quite focused.''

NORTH TEXAS POINT GUARD DEMONSTRATES SURPRISING POISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Sometimes, Rosalyn Reades makes it look too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Too easy, at least, for a freshman. Too easy for a young player
who was thrust into the starting lineup because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Too easy for any player, regardless of age, that's playing more
than 30 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``College basketball just takes some getting used to,'' Reades
said. ``At first, I thought I was getting tired a lot. After a
while, you don't even worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reades, starting point guard for the University of North Texas
women's team, should have a lot to worry about in her first season.
Division I basketball, after all, is a different game than the one
she played at Martin High School.
</P>
<P>
   It's different than Amateur Athletic Union ball as well, though
she did play against some of the nation's best during her summer
leagues. Everything, from the pace of the game to the defense to
the shooting ability of every player, is increased at the college
level.
</P>
<P>
   Reades, however, has taken it all in stride. Watching her guide
the Eagles' offense, it's often hard to tell she only turned 19
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Even for her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level, you're just going against better athletes than
you see in high school,'' UNT coach Tina Slinker said. ``But she's
handled it so well. She handles all the pressure without being
affected by it at all. That, to me, has been the biggest
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Slinker, in her 10th year at UNT, had no doubt about Reades'
ability when she made her one of her top recruiting priorities.
Reades, after all, had been the catalyst for Martin's success and
playoff run last season and earned District 8-5A Defensive Player
of the Year honors during her senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Slinker didn't plan on Reades being such a
huge part of UNT's season so early. Reades didn't start right away,
but injuries to Ashley Norris and Shannan Stephenson forced some
lineup changes. Point guard Teri Gunnels moved to the off-guard
spot to fill the void, and Reades naturally stepped into Gunnels'
point guard position.
</P>
<P>
   That was 15 games ago. Looking back, Reades must be considered
one big reason the Eagles were 12-6 overall entering last night's
game at New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   All she's done is take over the point position, averaging 30.9
minutes a game. During Big West Conference play _ in which UNT is
4-2 _ Reades is playing 34.2 minutes a game. And sometimes, she's
virtually mistake-free during those minutes. Last week against
Boise State, Reades played 39 of her team's 40 minutes and didn't
commit one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Slinker and Reades credit that to Reades' demeanor. The relaxed
attitude she carries with her all the time seems to keep her from
getting frustrated on the court, no matter the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a positive for me,'' Reades said. ``I consider
myself to be pretty calm. I guess that makes a big difference in
pressure situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably as important is how Reades helps UNT control the tempo.
The key to success for the Eagles has been their running game,
wearing down the opponent with fast breaks and easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   That all comes back to Reades. Possibly her best attribute is
her ability to push the ball up court, whether it be after a make
or a miss by the opposition. That, and her ability to start the
break with a steal _ her 2.7 steals a game is second in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``She allows us to do what we want to do with the tempo,''
Slinker said. ``We need her on the court to win. She's really
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-5, Reades is also a strong rebounder. She's averaging
5.7 rebounds a game to go with her 58 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The only real question mark is her shooting touch. She averages
7.6 points a game, most of that coming while driving to the basket.
Some recruiters questioned her outside shooting while in high
school, but Slinker said she doesn't think it will be long until
Reades masters that as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a perfectionist, I think she will improve on
that,'' Slinker said. ``Once she does, it will make her almost
impossible to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, she finds a way to make open shots. I wouldn't leave
her open.'' &QL;

FORMER TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH COMES FULL CIRCLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After starting his career more than 30 years ago as a high
school coach in Huntsville, Texas, the man who directed Hurst L.D.
Bell to the 1982 Class 5A state championship football game is
picking up the whistle again.
</P>
<P>
   As Huntsville athletic director, the 54-year-old coaching legend
finally found someone to take charge of the football program at
Huntsville High School this week.
</P>
<P>
   Himself.
</P>
<P>
   When he began his search for a new coach in December, he
received more than 100 applicants for the Class 5A school. He
thought he had found his man _ Mickey Finley of Cuero _ but Finley
backed off when he was offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of starting another search that could have lasted two
months, Edwards was asked by Huntsville's superintendent and school
board president to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was Edwards' first day back as a high school football
coach since his days at Bell. And he couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed today as much as any day I've had in the last
three years,'' Edwards said. ``Maybe this was a sign that this was
meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent Day One away from his office and back where he once
belonged: the field house. Calls poured in from around the state,
from former players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The media again was a constant companion, and he answered enough
telephone questions to make him think he was preparing the Blue
Raiders for another playoff game, not trying to figure out a game
plan to put Huntsville football back on the map.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a hectic day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But busy days are the kind he likes best.
</P>
<P>
   When he said all that he set out to do in December was to find
the best high school coach available, he might have been right.
Edwards, who compiled a 180-98-4 record in his 30 years before he
retired, has the makeup and background to re-start a program.
</P>
<P>
   He just never knew he was available until he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards _ the only man in Texas to have coached football at
schools in Class 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, A and B _ has become only the
third man to coach a team after being inducted into the Texas High
School Coaches Association Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who joined the Hall last summer, will coach again
exactly like fellow Hall of Fame members Bob McQueen and Charlie
Johnston are doing in Temple and Childress, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Once a coach, always a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even when coaches retire, they retain their titles. Even when
they move into higher positions like athletic director, they
continue to be known as ``Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Edwards _ who began his career in the 1960s as a football,
baseball and track coach at a Huntsville junior high _ has his work
cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets were 5-5 two years ago and 1-9 last season. Let the
rebuilding begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we weren't very good,'' said Edwards, who has spent
the past year as Huntsville's athletic director. ``We were 1-9 and
we're a small 5A school. We've got a tough mountain to climb, but
I've had those mountains before.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have taken it if I wasn't excited,'' he said.
``You've got to have a lot of energy and enthusiasm and I'm ready
to go. I'm going to get it all organized and get our program going
in a positive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a negative early this week when Finley
declined Huntsville's offer turned out to be a positive when the
Hornets landed Edwards, the local boy who hopes to do good again.
</P>
<P>
   When Finley said ``No,'' Edwards shouldn't have worried. The
search for a new coach was a quick one.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsville's future coach was never far away. &QL;

BRODEUR AND DEVILS BEAT BRUINS, 2-0
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The soreness in the neck that prevented Martin Brodeur
from playing in goal against Ottawa two nights ago disappeared
against the Bruins Thursday night at the Fleet Center. Instead,
Brodeur was able to irritate Boston time after time as he came up
with 40 saves to lead the Devils to a 2-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good controlling the rebounds and staying with
the puck,'' said Brodeur, after achieving his third shutout of the
season and the 35th of his career. ``I was able to get from side to
side and it seemed that I was on the right side of the puck most of
the time. They created a lot of chances and crushed the net in
front of me, but they didn't get second chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Caron, the goaltending coach of the Devils, had
difficulty hiding his delight with Brodeur's performance. ``Marty
was specially sharp in the third period,'' Caron said. ``He didn't
give away the puck and controlled his rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fourth in a row for the Devils (27-14-5),
who got goals from Bobby Holik and Jason Arnott against Byron
Dafoe, who was also the loser in the previous two games for the
Bruins, winners of only one of their last six game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brodeur, a hefty chunk of the credit for the victory
went to the checking line of Bob Carpenter, the center, Jay
Pandolfo on the left and Brian Rolston on the right. Along with
defensemen Scott Stevens and Scott Niedermayer, they did an
excellent job of keeping at bay Boston's top line of the center
Dmitri Kristich, Sergei Samsonov and Jason Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any particular strategy against them,''
Pandolfo said. ``We just went out and did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's top line entered the game with a total of 44 goals, 20
by Khristich and 15 by Samsonov, but this combination had very few
quality chances, being limited to just five shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who scored one goal in each of their previous two
games, both losses, offered from the outset more evidence of their
inability to finish their chances. They created numerous
opportunities near Brodeur, taking 25 of their shots before the
second intermission, but Brodeur was rarely called upon for a
spectacular save during that span. His sharpest work came in the
third period, when the Bruins kept jamming his crease.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the shots challenged Brodeur too much, Boston had
outshot the Devils by 9-1 when New Jersey opened the scoring on
Holik's 20th goal of the season. The score came after Holik
attempted to center the puck from the end line on the right. The
puck hit Dafoe's skate and ended up in the net with 10 minutes 8
seconds left in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' second goal followed a spell of intense pressure on
Boston's defensemen by Arnott's line of Denis Peterson on the left
and Petr Sykora on the right. The line capitalized in the 12th
minute of the second period. A shot by Sykora hit the left post and
bounced to Arnott, who scored his 11th goal of the season from very
close range.

SHELL TESTIMONY THAT NFL STILL BEHIND TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It has been four years since Art Shell was fired as head
coach of the Raiders. Al Davis hired Shell, made him the first
African-American head coach in the modern-day National Football
League, and then he let Shell go.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Davis has since said he regretted the
move.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't even matter that Shell holds no grudges against
Davis, whom he calls a friend. Shell knows head coaches have to
take the blame. That is part of the game. He still appreciates what
Davis did for him.
</P>
<P>
   What Shell does not understand is why he has not gotten another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two phone calls in four years,'' Shell said Thursday. ``That
tells you something right there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Falcons will play the Broncos in Super Bowl
XXXIII and part of Arthur Shell, Hall of Fame lineman, pioneering
NFL coach, will be on worldwide display.
</P>
<P>
   As the offensive line coach for Atlanta, Shell is the one
responsible for the wall of protection that has given Chris
Chandler the chance to become the NFC title-winning quarterback and
finally bring his career into full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Shell also is responsible for the hole-busting line that has
made Jamal Anderson the second-best running back in the NFL, behind
Terrell Davis, so you understand what kind of showdown Sunday
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Shell also had a hand in the Falcons' terrific NFC championship
win over the Vikings, when Atlanta's line committed not a single
penalty while using a silent count inside the ear-ringing
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, 53, went to the Super Bowl with the Raiders two times
during his 15-year career as a player and coach. He has two rings
already. He wouldn't mind a third. He has more than made an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches teach you to zone block or drop back a step so
you can step back into your man. The thing coach (Shell) teaches is
to step right into your guy,'' Atlanta guard Calvin Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells you, `Take the ground of the guys standing right in
front of you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To take ground, though, someone or something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Shell believed his rise to head coach was the
start of a new era in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling my assistant coaches, `What we do here will
reflect on the rest of minorities. And people understand one thing:
success,' '' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Shell do? He racked up a 54-38 record in six seasons
with the Raiders. By anyone's math, that is a winning record. And
by anyone's estimation, winning in the NFL is the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   So how come unproven assistants who have never run a football
team get interviews instead?
</P>
<P>
   A decade after Shell broke the barrier, just three of the 31
head-coaching positions in the league are held by
African-Americans: Tony Dungy in Tampa Bay, Dennis Green in
Minnesota and Ray Rhodes, now with Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shell _ who may or may not be the best candidate not being
interviewed for the slew of openings over the past four years _ you
have to at least wonder what happened to the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Lewis, who has been impeccable in Green Bay, has to
wonder. Dungy had to wonder, since it took so long for the Bucs'
coach to get his call.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the calls are few and the numbers are skewed, there
will be reasonable doubt that owners and general managers are open
to all candidates, not just the ones whose names are tossed around
like pop chart singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Announcers say things all the time on TV. `Oh, this guy will
be a head coach one day.' And therefore some guy says, `OK, this
guy is going to be hot, so he's going to be hot.' I think it has a
lot to do with it,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed in the way it's gone. I'm disappointed
that there aren't more people in the interview process. I think
getting the chance to talk to somebody is a big step, because that
is where you get to feel a person out, get a good feel as to what
he's about. But if you're not involved in the interview process,
how can anybody know what you're about?''
</P>
<P>
   To try to fix this, the league started a program of supplying
videotaped interviews with minority candidates to owners and
general managers _ anything to make it easier to get the word out
and spur interest about the wide range of candidates for
head-coaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   If there was something distasteful about this process, even for
a guy who has a proven NFL head-coaching record, Shell said it is
still worth it. The tape might have helped Shell get an interview
in Cleveland last month with the Browns' new president, Carmen
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what it takes, it's worth being involved with it,''
said Shell, whose only other interview was with the Raiders again,
just before Davis hired Jon Gruden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through the process was good. I got to meet with a guy I
have a whole lot of respect for. I understand they felt they had to
go in a different direction, but I felt the interview went well.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance is all anyone can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   While Shell might be no different from any of the other dozens
of NFL assistants black, white, red or green who believe they
should be the next head coach at the next opening, what is
different is that the phone has been strangely silent for too long.
</P>
<P>
   What Shell was able to do on the football field, what lessons he
has been able to impart to his Super Bowl-contending Falcon
linemen, is not happening for himself and dozens of other minority
assistant coaches who believe they have positioned themselves to
take some ground.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: HIV diagnosis brings suit
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For six years, he lived with a diagnosis of HIV
infection, ingesting daily doses of the potent anti-viral drug AZT,
shunning new relationships and planning for his life's end.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mark Savage left Chicago and moved to Dayton in 1997,
he switched to a doctor here who told him he had never been
infected with the AIDS-causing virus.
</P>
<P>
   Now Savage has filed a malpractice lawsuit against a physician
and hospital in Chicago for allegedly misdiagnosing his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the damages are severe here, not only from the
tangible perspective of taking a potent drug for six years, but
particularly the emotional damage of being told that you have a
fatal disease,'' said Jim Bonebrake, an attorney in Chicago
representing Savage. ``This set him up to be isolated for years of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage, 43, filed his lawsuit this week in Cook County Circuit
Court against Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Triad Health
Practice and Dr. David Blatt, a specialist in internal medicine who
set up one of Chicago's first clinics for treating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt was traveling in Boston Thursday and could not be reached.
Savage did not return a phone message left Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Masonic officials said they had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment. However, hospital spokeswoman Carmen
Esposito called Blatt ``a very fine physician who has treated many
HIV patients in his career. He's a very compassionate man.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Savage was tested periodically for the HIV virus
and those test results were in his medical record.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, however, claims Blatt failed to test Savage before,
or after, diagnosing HIV positive in July 1990 and prescribing the
drug AZT. When Savage moved to Dayton, his new doctor continued the
treatments, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Savage showed no signs of AIDS, Dr. Robert L. Brandt
Jr. of Dayton ran new tests and told him in December 1997 that he
never had the virus, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A misdiagnosis of HIV in a male patient is very unusual, Brandt
said from his Dayton office Thursday. ``I've reversed the diagnoses
in four to six women in the last four or five years, but this is
the first man,'' he said. ``It could happen when someone jumps the
gun without complete information.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonebrake said Savage has suffered side effects by taking drugs
he never needed, including depression, tingling in his hands and
digestive and vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   Savage continues to be employed as a flight attendant in the
airline industry, Bonebrake said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Although the seeds that grew into the modern minivan
were initially planted at the Ford Motor Co., that auto maker has
usually lagged behind the Chrysler Corp. in the minivan race.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Ford engineer, Harold K. Sperlich, who in the 1970s
came up with the idea of a van big enough to haul a family but
small enough to fit in a standard garage. (Granted, vehicles like
the VW Microbus and Corvair Greenbrier had been there before.)
</P>
<P>
   Sperlich's boss, Lee A. Iacocca, took the proposal to top
management, but they dismissed it as too risky, given the cost it
would entail. When the two men wound up at Chrysler in the early
1980s, they resurrected the idea and the minivan was born. A
concept deemed too risky for Ford ended up saving Chrysler from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   While baby boomers packed their expanding families into
Chrysler's vans, Ford took a decade to come up with a true
competitor, the front-wheel-drive, V6-powered Windstar, which
reached the market in 1994. Though Ford leveled the playing field,
Chrysler soon raised the ante.
</P>
<P>
   When it remade its minivans for '96, Chrysler made a second
sliding door an option. The extra door proved so convenient that
many buyers came to view it as a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar was not due for a remake until '99 and Ford was
unable to add a door to the existing design, so it countered by
temporarily replacing the driver's door with an oversized
``superdoor.'' This allowed drivers to slide items behind the seat,
but was of little use in loading passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for 1999, a second sliding door remedies the Windstar's
most glaring deficiency. Ford has also added other clever features,
some of them exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   These changes have made the Windstar a real alternative to vans
from Chrysler and to new, improved vans from General Motors and
Toyota. But unfortunately for Ford, another player is now in the
game. For 1999, Honda has remade its Odyssey _ previously small,
quirky and underpowered _ into a first-rate contender. The new
Odyssey has a powerful engine, a quiet ride and ingenuous rear
seats that fold handily into the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of safety ratings, a big concern in this segment, the
Windstar has stood alone at the top. Even before the latest
redesign, the Windstar was the only minivan with a five-star safety
rating _ the highest grade _ from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The new Windstar received two five-star ratings, for both front
and side collisions; the agency says the driver and front passenger
are 50 percent less likely to suffer serious injuries in front or
side crashes than they would be in a vehicle with a four-star
rating _ the grade most minivans received. The agency has not yet
tested the Odyssey, but Honda engineers say they are confident its
rating will equal the Windstar's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Windstar offers optional side air bags for the
front occupants, as does GM. Side bags are not available on the
Honda or Chrysler vans.
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar also has a sonar reverse sensing system, unique
among mini-vans (but offered on some Mercedes-Benz and BMW models)
that detects objects _ including children _ up to six feet behind
the van when it is backing up. The system emits a beep that becomes
more insistent, eventually as a single tone, the closer the vehicle
gets to the object.
</P>
<P>
   All Windstars also come with anti-lock brakes and an anti-theft
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar's performance still stands out among minivans. The
base version, the Windstar L, comes with a 3-liter, 150-horsepower
V6, though Ford sells few of these models. More popular is the
optional 3.8-liter V6, which produces 200 horsepower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although this power plant is a strong performer, I was taken
back by the truck-like noise level of the engine immediately on
start-up _ a sharp contrast to the quiet Odyssey. And the Odyssey's
3.5-liter V6 not only makes less noise, it is more powerful, on
paper, with 210 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Windstar wins the torque race, with 240 foot-pounds
(vs. the Odyssey's 229) for quick stoplight getaways. Indeed, the
Windstar's acceleration is tops among minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Windstar engines are paired with a four-speed automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of all mini-vans has improved markedly, the crude
truck feel of vintage models giving way to car-like nimbleness. And
while the Windstar's handling has long been near the head of the
class, and remains so, the scale again tips slightly in favor of
the new Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar comes only with front-wheel drive. Buyers who
insist on all-wheel drive must choose among some versions of
Chrysler's vans, the Mazda MPV, the Chevy Astro and the GMC
Safari. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The design of the 1999 Windstar, with a few more creases in its
metal than before, is appropriately mainstream. Radical looks don't
play to the minivan masses, as evidenced by slow sales of General
Motors' wedge-shaped, previous-generation designs and the quirky
spaceship profile of the defunct Toyota Previa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tested van did, however, have a band of chrome along each
side, dividing the white body from lower panels of rich-looking
platinum. The chrome and platinum gave the van a classy look,
though some of my neighbors thought it a bit overdone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Available in only one size (unlike the Chrysler and GM vans),
the Windstar's wheelbase and length are virtually unchanged, but a
couple of inches have been added to its width. In any event, it can
accommodate up to seven passengers quite comfortably, along with
plenty of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Windstar's dual sliding doors can be ordered to operate
electronically. Double-click the door button on the optional key
fob, or push the button on the overhead console, and the doors
glide closed. Another button on the pillar between the front and
rear compartments is handy for independent children like mine who
want to close the doors themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A child safety lock can be activated for one or both doors to
prevent children from unlocking the doors from inside. Also,
sensors prevent the doors from closing if a child's hand is in the
way. The doors also glide open electronically if one tugs the
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, accommodations are roomy and comfortable, and there are
more cup holders than before. The Windstar comes as the base L,
volume-leading LX and fully loaded SE and SEL versions, each with
increasing amounts of features.
</P>
<P>
   A popular option carried over from the previous Windstar is an
audio system that allows those in the front to listen to different
music (radio stations, cassettes or CDs) from what rear passengers
can hear through headphones.
</P>
<P>
   The seats, my biggest complaint before, are much improved. The
second-row bench now slides sideways on a track so the seat can be
positioned to the left or the right. honda has taken a similar
tack, but one-ups the Windstar: Its captain's chairs move sideways
to create a bench or can be spread apart for more elbow room if the
children are battling over space.
</P>
<P>
   Both the second- and third-row seats are removable, a feat that
is possible but not easily accomplished. Still, I prefer the
magical fold-into-the-floor seats of the Odyssey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One complaint Ford did not address with the 1999 Windstar
makeover was the location of the parking brake. Positioned on the
floor to the right of the driver's seat, the driver can't avoid
scraping knuckles when she engages the brake. Ford product people
said the budget for the Windstar's redesign didn't provide for
relocation of the brake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the Windstar start at $20,800, but if you order the
side air bags, the power doors, leather upholstery and the more
powerful engine the price jumps above $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has carved out a neat niche for the Windstar, marketing it
as the safest van. It is a strategy bound to resonate with parents
_ after all, what's more important than safe passage of their most
precious cargo? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Family hauler for the safety conscious. &QL;

<P>
   With share prices inevitably soaring after the initial public
offerings of just about any business related to the Internet these
days, it is no surprise that a flood of upstart Internet companies
have joined the rush.
</P>
<P>
   Most are blank slates. But instead of repelling investors, a
lack of profits, past performance or history of any kind appears to
be an enticement these days, many befuddled longtime Wall Streeters
say. Even the recent volatility of Internet stocks and persistent
warnings of a bubble aching to burst have not stanched the flow of
new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the next crop of initial offerings is one that some
financial analysts say could provide a litmus test of just how
exuberant Internet investors are: Prodigy Communications.
Investment Bankers say the company hopes to raise as much as $120
million by going public at a price of $12 to $15 a share the week
of Feb. 8. The company and its underwriters declined to confirm the
details, citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock pops, as so many others have, it will not be
because there is much of a chance of substantial growth or profits
anytime soon, according to a wide array of Internet and financial
analysts. And unlike most of the other new offerings, which are
unencumbered by history, Prodigy has to overcome a bleak track
record, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that does not mean it won't fly when it hits Wall
Street. ``If the Prodigy IPO goes off, then it might tell you that
people will just pony up for Internet anything,'' said Peggy
O'Neill, an analyst at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. ``This is not
a company with a new technology or a new focus that's trying to
solve a new problem, which is what a lot of the other Internet
stocks are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy is, indeed, the antithesis of a nimble upstart start-up.
It has been around since 1984, far longer than most people have
owned PCs. It was a pioneer in the on-line business, going
nationwide in 1990 and reaching two million subscribers at its 1993
peak, luring them with a friendly realm _ a closed, proprietary
on-line service _ loaded with Prodigy chat groups, encyclopedias
and shopping services.
</P>
<P>
   Its original owners _ IBM, Sears, Roebuck and, early on, CBS _
poured more than $1 billion into the company before selling it in
1996 for a fourth of that amount. It has continued to lose money:
net losses ballooned from $3 million in 1995 to $129 million in
1997. For the first nine months of 1998, losses were $47.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Prodigy's prospectus, its subscriber base shrank to
just 633,000 paying customers last September, about 200,000 of whom
use its old on-line service, Prodigy Classic. It has been trying to
shift all of those users to its newer Internet service, begun in
1997, but has not had much success, and it stands to lose a lot of
them in October when it phases out Prodigy Classic, analysts say.
According to a Merrill Lynch research report, Prodigy needs 1.5
million customers just to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy plans to focus on expanding its role as an Internet
service provider, both for individuals and businesses. The company
plans to aim at the Hispanic market here and abroad, according to a
filing with the SEC. The focus on building a Spanish-language
market will be helped by Prodigy's links to its current owners, an
investment group dominated by Mexico's Carso Global Telecomno,
which controls Telefonos de Mexico SA and directly and indirectly
controls 86.1 percent of Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem is that there is not a lot of Spanish-language
content on the Internet _ at least compared with what is available
in English.
</P>
<P>
   One of Prodigy's strengths is its network, which covers more
than 600 cities in 50 states, allowing about 83 percent of the
population to get Prodigy's services with a local telephone call.
Its customers rarely get a busy signal, though this is partly
because of Prodigy's dwindling customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is its size. Even though Prodigy is tiny compared
with its giant rival America Online, it is one of only a few
Internet service providers with enough subscribers to lure
advertisers and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Although most members of Prodigy's new management team are
relatively unknown, its president and chief operating officer,
David C. Trachtenberg, gained a solid reputation as director of
on-line marketing at MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts who have studied the prospectus say there is
little in it that they found exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would fall off my chair if this has real pop,'' Gail
Bronson, a senior analyst in Palo Alto, Calif., for the research
firm IPO Monitor, said of Prodigy's offering. The field of Internet
service providers is already crowded, she said, and on-line
services are dominated by AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that you assure yourself success at this point in the
IPO calendar is to come out with an exciting story,'' she added
``That usually requires good branding and distinctive products: the
first Internet ad play of the year, the first women's content play
of the year, the voice recognition play of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, ``Prodigy is dragging a tin can along
behind it.''

TIME IS NOT THE ESSENCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES T. DETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was a principal in a consulting engineering firm for many
years before I retired. Everyone from the receptionist to the
bosses had to fill out a time record every week. Time is money, and
that's how we earned ours, by accounting for every hour so that
clients could be charged for the time we had spent working for
them.
</P>
<P>
   If you were smart, you filled it out every day; if you waited
until the end of the week, it usually amounted to an exercise in
creative writing.
</P>
<P>
   But even in my retirement, I'm still being challenged to account
for my time.
</P>
<P>
   I was speaking to a friend at my old firm recently, and he
asked, ``What are you doing now that you're retired?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   After what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, I added,
``Well, not exactly nothing.'' Then I proceeded to tick off some of
my activities. As I did, I realized that I was trying mentally to
fill in the old 40-hour time-record requirement, and it annoyed me.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary benefits of retirement, after all, is
supposed to be relief from having to fill out a time card or punch
a clock. So I cut off my recitation and assured my friend that I
was not vegetating, and let it go at that.
</P>
<P>
   My niece owns a bed-and-breakfast on Nantucket. She was talking
about selling it, and I thought I would make a scale model of the
place as a keepsake for her in the event that she went through with
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   I have made little houses for Christmas decorations, but this
was a greater challenge. As with the Christmas ornaments, I made
the model out of cardboard left over from the backs of yellow legal
pads. I have always saved the stuff for just such purposes.
</P>
<P>
   When she called to tell me how thrilled she was with my gift,
she asked me how long I had taken to build it. I thought a moment
before telling her that I wasn't really sure, though it probably
was about 30 or 40 hours. Afterward, I wondered why she'd asked. I
would gladly have spent twice the time for the pleasure I received
from making it and the pleasure it gave her and her family. I think
people feel a little guilty when you spend _ almost squander _ time
on them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also arises when I speak to my younger brother, who
lives in New Mexico. He always manages to ask what I do all day.
(He's only 17 months younger than I am, but I think he's worried
about the day he retires.) I get the feeling that he's mentally
filling out a time record for me, and it isn't adding up to 40
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Well too bad. But if it is just too bad, why am I stewing about
it?
</P>
<P>
   I find that the hardest thing about retirement is getting used
to doing nothing and not feeling guilty about it. I guess this is
the result of years of being really busy with work, family and
community activities, and managing to juggle the responsibilities
and conflicting demands.
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever does nothing, except maybe those poor souls we
read about who after umpteen years of work finally retire and then
die within months for no apparent cause. Much has been said about
this, including warnings that one must have hobbies and be prepared
to occupy oneself to avoid premature death.
</P>
<P>
   If I spend a hour picking through the daily newspapers after
breakfast _ including a review of the latest doings of Hi and Lois,
Doonesbury and Peppermint Patty _ is that doing nothing? If I spend
a little extra time checking the letters to the editor to see what
some old sorehead is complaining about (actually, I'm annoyed that
my letter hasn't been printed yet), is that doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   If I spend time gazing out the kitchen window at my backyard,
reflecting on the metamorphosis it has gone through in the 27 years
since we moved into our home _ from a playground with a tire swing
and a few tomato vines to what is now, I think, a work of art _ is
that doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   If I sit on the front steps and watch my young neighbors rushing
off to catch the bus and reflect on the years that I was caught in
the race, is that doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you think it is. But I think it's something _ and I'm not
going to keep a time record of it, either.  &QL;

BRODEUR, DEVILS SILENCE BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The All-Star break was sandwiched between two
lackluster efforts by the Bruins. Before it, they were run over by
Ottawa. In their first game back, they were embarrassed in New York
by the Islanders, and coach Pat Burns benched three forwards and a
defenseman in the third period in an effort to get his message
across.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the effort was there. The intensity was there.
But once again, the offense wasn't there as the Bruins were shut
down by the New Jersey Devils, 2-0, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have had Boston's number for some time. New Jersey is
7-0-2 against the Bruins in their last nine meetings. It has been 2
1/2 years since the Bruins beat them, the last win coming Oct. 29,
1996, in Boston by a 5-2 score.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference where every point counts, the Bruins can ill
afford to go into a prolonged slump. Burns reunited his first line
of Jason Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and Sergei Samsonov after
replacing Samsonov with Steve Heinze against the Islanders. In that
game, the coach sat Khristich, Heinze, and Allison, along with
defenseman Don Sweeney, in hopes of delivering a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the first line didn't play badly, but it didn't
do its job, which is to produce points. And it totaled only five
shots. Heinze played with center Joe Thornton and Rob DiMaio
(pulled off the top defensive line). That trio showed a great deal
of spark and grit, but that didn't translate into points, either.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason was New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur, who stopped
40 shots in posting his third shutout of the year and the 35th of
his career. Bruins captain Ray Bourque, who was on Brodeur's team
Sunday in the All-Star Game, said the goalie was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   That was true, and Burns said he, too, felt it necessary to give
the Devils their due.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play like this, sooner or later, things will turn,''
said Burns. ``We have nothing to show for it and it's disappointing
to talk about it, but I think the effort from everybody was there.
If we'd played like this the other night, we'd have won easily.
Jersey's a very good team. I tip my hat to them; they're an
excellent hockey club. They're a big, strong team. They threw us
around a little bit. There are a lot of players on that team who
won a Stanley Cup not too long ago, so they know what it's all
about. But I liked our effort. I liked our fight-back. That's the
way we have to play now until the end of the year. I thought we
played hard right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog days of winter have arrived. The Bruins have lost three
straight and are 4-5-1 in their last 10 games. That doesn't cut it
in the East, and the schedule only gets harder with Pittsburgh,
Carolina, Colorado, the Islanders, and Philadelphia on tap before
Boston takes on Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play well and you lose, you still have the same
feeling as when you played bad and lose,'' said center Tim Taylor.
``There's really no compensation because we played well. We took
strides in the right direction tonight; that's one thing. The other
thing is if anything comes out of it, some other teams in our
division lost, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal came at 9:53 of the first period on a
wraparound shot at the right post by center Bobby Holik.
</P>
<P>
   The other goal came at the 12-minute mark of the second on a jam
at the right post by right wing Jason Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   Two seconds later, Bruins enforcer Ken Belanger tried to spark
his teammates when he went toe to toe with Devils tough guy
Krzysztof Oliwa. Belanger won the fight and went to the penalty box
waving his arms in an effort to stir up the crowd. He was rewarded
with a standing ovation from the fans but no goals from his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it was a much better effort and if you play like
that on a nightly basis, sooner or later, it's going to turn
around,'' said Burns. ``If we play the way we played the other
night against the Islanders, if your good players play that way,
you're not going to stand much of a chance.''

<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ A year ago, Pepsi-Cola was marking its 100th
anniversary, but no amount of corporate merrymaking could conceal
the problems plaguing the brand. Bottlers attending a company
extravaganza in Hawaii spent much of their time fuming about Pepsi
ads, particularly one set to the Rolling Stones song ``Brown
Sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi was losing market share to its perennial rival, Coca-Cola
Classic. And it was going through an identity crisis. Just who was
supposed to be buying it _ teen-agers? Generation X'ers? Retirees?
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's been a changing of the guard within the
streamlined, art-covered walls of Pepsico headquarters here in
Purchase. Among the newcomers is Dawn Hudson, whose many tasks as
chief of marketing for Pepsi-Cola North America include overseeing
the creation of a new slogan for Pepsi _ one that will stake out
the elusive middle ground between uncool and too cool.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hudson has tackled the task with an old-fashioned
thoroughness that critics say had been sadly lacking at the
company: a lot of brainstorming, formal research, consumer testing
and revisiting everything to squeeze out every last drop of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very close to having something good that knits
the brand back together,'' said Ms. Hudson, 40, who even in
business attire exudes an outdoorsy manner. Until recently, she
added, ``Pepsi had a history of changing too frequently and getting
schizophrenic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new slogan remains top secret. It will be introduced to the
public in March, and will replace the two-year-old ``Generation
next,'' which is widely maligned for conveying a hip image that
alienated older Pepsi drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades in advertising, Ms. Hudson was hired in
1996 by Roger A. Enrico, Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, to
head up the marketing of Frito-Lay products. Last year, she was
named to her current job, replacing Brian R. Swette, who left after
Philip A. Marineau, the president of Pepsi-Cola North America, made
remarks suggesting that ``Generation next'' would soon be put out
to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Her quick ascent marks Ms. Hudson as a rising star within
Pepsico; she is whispered to be one of the few who might run it one
day. And it is no secret why the company took such a shine to her.
As an executive with DDB Needham, the advertising agency, she
developed a campaign for Frito-Lay's Rold Gold pretzels, including
television commercials starring the ``Seinfeld'' actor Jason
Alexander, that pumped up the company's market share from 11
percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really put it on the map,'' recalls Steven S. Reinemund,
chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay. ``She's a very smart and
pragmatic marketer who gets things done.''
</P>
<P>
   And she appears to manage that without losing her perspective or
sense of humor. During an interview late last month, her two
daughters, 8 and 1, arriving for a holiday party, ran in and out of
her office. Several assistants, some secretaries dressed in
sequined holiday garb and a job candidate who had arrived too early
for his interview also burst in.
</P>
<P>
   She remained calm throughout, smiling frequently as she
discussed Pepsi's marketing priorities, sometimes with both
children balanced on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   People at the company know, however, that beneath her tranquil
surface lurks a highly competitive player. Within Pepsi's Mountain
Dew division, she has earned the code name `Leopard.'
</P>
<P>
   In her spare time, Ms. Hudson reads, skis, plays tennis and
visits child-friendly places like the zoo. She is married to Bruce
Beach, the president of an executive-search firm. Her home in
Bronxville, N.Y., is just a short hop from Pepsico, and Ms. Hudson
is often home on weeknights, watching ``The Brady Bunch'' with
Morgan, the 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago she gave birth to Kendall, whose name, she likes to
point out, was not chosen to curry favor with Donald M. Kendall, a
co-founder and former chairman of Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Her whole career, she says, was something she just fell into.
After graduating from Dartmouth College as an English and economics
major, she took a job in the school's fund-raising office. Walking
across the campus one day, she ran into a friend who told her that
an advertising agency was interviewing prospects that afternoon.
With no appointment, and with a hastily typed resume, Ms. Hudson
waited on the doorstep until someone agreed to talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   She got the job, with Compton Advertising, since absorbed by
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. ``I tried it, and I loved it,'' she recalls. A
few years later she landed at DDB Needham, where she eventually
became a managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of three sisters growing up in Winchester, Mass., Ms.
Hudson early on felt a desire to prove herself in a way that would
be distinct from what her parents (in law and banking) had done.
``You want to chart your own course,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other marketers, she shuns jargon. And she is known
for sitting down with company reports and examining every page,
crossing out hackneyed adjectives and cringing, she says, over
``anything that reeks of hyperbole.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does like, though, is clever marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A summer '99 promotion for Pepsi, built around the latest
installment in the ``Star Wars,'' series has impressed her.
``What's critical is how we leverage it in a way that gets our
brands moving,'' she said. She plans to push hard to make Pepsi
available in places large and small, with the formation of a
``channel strategy group'' that examines where consumers shop and
what kinds of products, as well as package size and shape, they
prefer.
</P>
<P>
   And marketing to the 8- to-12-year-old set is a priority.
``We're absolutely going to look at preteens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hudson counsels her marketing team to ``work hard, play
hard,'' on the theory that if they don't have lives outside the
office, their performance at Pepsi will suffer. ``Part of being a
good marketer,'' she said, ``is just being a regular person.'' &QL;

MBA MAGIC IS A FICTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Ill., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
  Q. (italics)After deciding that the insurance industry was not
where I wanted to be, I took night classes for four years to
complete an MBA in market research. Alas, the degree seems to make
no difference to prospective employers, who focus instead on my
lack of experience and as a result are talking about salary levels
way below what I now earn. Is there any way to make this less
painful?(end italics) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. You may be older and wiser and have better credentials than
when you first entered the job force, but the fundamentals of the
job market remain the same: Experience is key. You may need to
fine-tune your job search _ and your attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``In market research more than some other industries, the
premium is on experience and knowing how to get the job done,''
said John Morton, senior vice president of the Total Research Corp.
in Princeton, N.J. ``Advanced degrees are looked at with a somewhat
jaundiced eye. They're no guarantee that you're going to be able to
come in and get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that going after your MBA was a waste of time.
``We would clearly consider people who do not have market research
experience,'' said Gary Newman, a human-resources manager at
Information Resources Inc. in Chicago. Someone with an MBA who has
business savvy and experience in other disciplines can be an asset,
he noted. ``In this labor market, you cannot just find the people
who have the exact experience you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Newman said, may be your expectations.
People who are moving into new disciplines ``are still going to
have to pay their dues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean newcomers have to accept low starting salaries,
particularly at small, highly competitive research firms. ``You
have to be able to prove that you can produce,'' said Morton. ``You
have to have a proven track record or be willing to come in at
perhaps an entry-level salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Once your foot is in the door, he added, you can show the
company what you're really worth. ``If you can do the job, your
salary can go up very quickly,'' he said. ``It's not unusual for
someone to double their salary in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy is to consider a job with the client side of
the industry _ the big companies that commission and buy the market
data from the research firms. These corporations tend to focus less
on your track record, said Kevin Waters, research director at
Cheskin Research in Redwood Shores, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize your appeal, Waters advised, ``focus on
research-related jobs within the insurance industry or related
fields _ finance, health care.'' This, he said, would let you
``leverage your degree and your previous work experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experience buying and managing research data for a
client firm, experts say, it should be easy to slide over into the
supply side of the business. After that, Morton said, ``there are
so many companies that are looking for good people that you can
hopscotch from one to the other and quickly move up the ladder.'' &QL;

MANN MOVIE THEATERS FOR SALE YEAR AFTER $165 MILLION BUYOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Mann Theaters chain, owner of the world's
most famous movie palace and 59 other theaters, has been put on the
block a year after being bought out for $165 million.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Warburg Pincus, which bankrolled last year's
buyout, confirmed Thursday that the Wall Street investment firm has
hired Bear Stearns to sell the chain, which operates nearly 400
screens in California and Colorado including the flagship Chinese
Theatre in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, which recently opened the Plant 16 complex at the former
General Motors auto factory in Van Nuys, had no comment about the
development. Daily Variety reported that Mann chief Jeff Lewine,
who headed the buyout, has been attempting to line up financing to
buy out Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Warburg to bail out of its investment in Mann
reflects the brutally competitive nature of the exhibition
industry. Aggressive players such as AMC, Edwards and Pacific have
been focusing on opening ``megaplexes'' -- with 20-plus screens,
stadium seating and massive snack bars -- because they deliver far
better financial performance than conventional theaters.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Warburg bought Encino-based Mann from a joint
venture of Warner Bros. and Paramount, it was already lagging
behind rivals in opening new theaters. During the past year, the
popularity of megaplexes has resulted in reduced cash flow for
Mann, according to Hank Lightstone, who heads a Denver investor
group that explored buying out the chain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to put in a ton of money to bring a lot of the Mann
theaters up to speed if you wanted to compete,'' he said. ``The
word has been out for a couple of weeks that Warburg feels it's
lost too much money and wanted to cash out. It's a scary time to be
in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Van Nuys, Mann has opened new theaters in
Glendale and Thousand Oaks in recent years and will add five
auditoriums at the Chinese site as part of the massive $385 million
TrizecHahn development.

AMGEN TOPS ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Biotechnology drug developer Amgen Inc. handily
beat analysts' estimates Thursday with a 33 percent gain in fourth
quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, which announced the results after the close of trading,
reported net income of 90 cents per share compared to 67 cents per
share in the fourth quarter a year ago. A consensus of 25 analysts
surveyed earlier this week by First Call Corp. had generated a mean
fourth-quarter earnings estimate of 84 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great quarter. What more can you say?'' said
AmeriCal Securities analyst Charles Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results were led by a 35 percent gain in quarterly
sales of its anti-anemia drug Epogen, which rose to $391 million
from $289 million in the same period a year ago. Sales of Amgen's
other main product, Neupogen, rose 10 percent, to $298 million.
Infergen, an Interferon-based hepatitis C treatment Amgen launched
in October 1997, generated $6 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Amgen's earnings rose 34 percent to $863 million,
or $3.27 per share, on sales of $2.51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its results, Amgen also said it will split its
stock two-for-one, a move analysts say should give the company's
market capitalization a boost. ``Bull markets like this just love
(splits),'' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors already have been hot for the stock. In mid-December,
a judge ruled in Amgen's favor in a dispute with Johnson &AMP; Johnson
over future distribution of a next-generation form of Epogen. The
ruling frees Amgen from an agreement that gave Johnson &AMP; Johnson
sales rights to Epogen for everything but kidney dialysis. If and
when the new form of Epogen is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, Amgen will be allowed to make all sales itself.
</P>
<P>
   That news started a run on Amgen stock that continued Thursday,
pushing the company's shares up $3.6875 to $119.5625, its second
consecutive all-time high.

UCLA BEATS WASHINGTON STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ The dateline may as well read CORVALLIS, Ore.
Somewhere on their journey to the Palouse _ and it was a journey _
the UCLA Bruins misplaced their progress and reverted to the bad
form responsible for their stunning loss at Oregon State three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins managed to avoid the same ignominy Thursday night
because of smothering defense down the stretch and because their
opponent, Washington State, was the same team that lost to
Alaska-Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Cougars were not good enough _ not even
average enough _ to take what the Bruins offered. The result was a
69-66 victory in front of 5,502 at Friel Court that assured UCLA of
a crucial weekend split.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Arizona's victory over Stanford, the win moved the
Bruins within one game of the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the sense of urgency you have to have,'' said
UCLA coach Steve Lavin, who was not surprised by his team's
lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys that you practice like you play, and we did
not have a good practice Tuesday. I could sense this coming.
(Tuesday) was one of the worst practices of the year. We're very,
very fortunate to get out of here with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's most effective players were center Dan Gadzuric, who
returned from a sprained ankle to score 16 points in 21 minutes,
and forward JaRon Rush, who made 1 of 9 shots but preserved the
victory by deflecting two passes in the final 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The first led directly to Ray Young's dunk and a 68-63 lead. The
second prevented Cougars sharpshooter Jan-Michael Thomas from
launching a game-tying shot in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always play defense,'' said Rush, clearly frustrated
by his slumping shooting.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (15-4, 6-2) began its roadtrip by violating Bruin Attitude
rule No.3: Be on time. Because of a late start from campus and
unexpected traffic they arrived at LAX 10 minutes before their
scheduled 5:55 departure and missed the flight.
</P>
<P>
   They sat for two hours, then flew to Seattle and Spokane, then
made the 90-minute bus ride to their hotel in Moscow, Idaho. They
arrived just before 3 a.m., and many players did not get to sleep
until well past 5.
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were big-time sluggish,'' said guard Baron Davis, who made
2 of 10 shots. ``I could see it in everybody's face, including
myself. You're looking for motivation, looking for motivation,
looking for things, but your body just doesn't come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Their spirits improved before tipoff, when Lavin entered Friel
Court and was greeted by 20 Washington State students intent on
mimicking his every move. They sat opposite UCLA's bench, wore
dress shirts and ties, and a few even greased their hair.
</P>
<P>
   The routine started last year, so Lavin was prepared. He bowed
to the students, then led them through a ``Simon Says'' routine
that included various jumps, claps and spins. It was good theatre,
with smiles all around, and eventually the Bruins kidded Lavin
about his Cougar clones.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin got serious for tipoff, and his mood quickly digressed.
UCLA's pressure defense befuddled Washington State, which went
eight minutes without a field goal, but the Bruins' 23-7 lead would
have been larger if not for a series of fast-break blunders and
silly fouls. The patience they used to defeat USC and Louisville
had disappeared _ perhaps in Tuesday's practice, perhaps on the
long trip to Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars switched to a zone defense, which slowed the Bruins,
and eventually found their composure, which did wonders for their
attack. They opened the second half with eight consecutive points,
rattling the Bruins. Thomas' 3-pointer from the Idaho border
brought the Cougars within four, and his free throws tied it with
13:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars led 56-53 when the Bruins finally found their legs.
They cut off Washington State's penetration and forced difficult
shots. Jerome Moiso's dunk and Young's short turnaround gave the
Bruins a 62-58 lead with 1:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   Davis missed two free throws in the final minute, giving the
Cougars life until Rush's deflections secured the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good, bad and ugly,'' Young said. ``It was all three _
good we got a win, but bad and ugly, too.''

FORD IS RIGHT MOVE FOR CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say you had a choice. You could dine at a fancy
restaurant at a former employer's expense or you could cover the
tab yourself by washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. If you let your former employer pick up the
check, you could have your family around the table. The other way,
you'd be resigned to dining alone.
</P>
<P>
   A no-brainer, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, Chris Ford thought so too.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you'll find him with a lot on his plate these days.
We're talking years of accumulated crud that will take a lot of
scouring to rinse free.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbfounding but true. Ford could be kicking back in Boston with
his family right now, subsisting on the paychecks that the
Milwaukee Bucks promised to keep sending him for the remaining year
on his contract after firing him this past August.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has rolled up his sleeves and tackled _ with relish,
we might add _ the thankless task of cleaning up the mess that is
the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Is he a glutton for punishment, or
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches love to coach,'' he said, shrugging, Thursday
afternoon following a practice at the Clippers' training facility
in Carson. ``I thought this was a good opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in life there are certain rules of thumb. If it's a
high-quality cut of meat you're after, you generally steer clear of
the bargain buffets. And if it's a prime-time team you're looking
for, you avoid the Clippers at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a team that is coming off a 17-65 season and
since has lost one of its leading scorers, Isaac Austin, to free
agency. This is a franchise that has had only one winning season
since 1979, has four playoff victories to show for the past 23
years and has gone through coaches the way diners go through
plastic knives at Steak 'n Shake.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 50, is the seventh head coach the Clippers have employed
since 1989. He replaced the deposed Bill Fitch, who coached a
Boston Celtics team that included an overachieving guard named
Chris Ford to the NBA title in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch served on the battlefield that is the Sports Arena for
four seasons, the last few months of which he spent barking orders
to a platoon that had grown deaf to his tone. Veteran guard Pooh
Richardson, for one, admits he was playing for a paycheck and not
much else until Ford came along and gave Richardson back his
passion.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is but a week old and already Clipperville is like
Pleasantville, with players feeling deeply and truly and positively
glowing on the court. Even dissatisfied center Lorenzen Wright, who
clamored for a trade at the start of camp, seems to have fallen
under Ford's spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Ford) has brought back a sense of pride in being in
the NBA,'' said Richardson, a 10-year veteran who is entering his
fifth season with the Clippers. ``That love of the game is coming
back. Guys are enjoying the game and one another more. You can see
the sincerity of guys coming out. It's fun to see.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see for yourself tonight at the Forum. The Clippers will
play the Lakers, who finished 44 games ahead of them in the Pacific
Division standings last season, in the first of back-to-back
exhibition games that are free to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Come to see the reborn Clippers, just don't expect to eyeball
their No.1 draft pick, Michael Olowokandi. Ford hasn't even laid
eyes on him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic red tape delayed for yet another day the Nigerian
center's return to L.A. from Europe and his brief fling with the
Italian pro league. It'll probably be Saturday before Ford meets
his franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   That's par for the course when you're at the helm of the
Clippers. Remember, this is a franchise that waited nine months to
name a new coach, then finally did so on the same day the NBA's
greatest player held a press conference to announce his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers' choice appears sound even if their timing
wasn't. Ford lets the players know who's boss without throwing it
in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   He's old enough to have played alongside Larry Bird, Robert
Parish and Kevin McHale but young enough to spice up practices with
a little trash talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he's a teammate,'' marveled Richardson.
``He's feeling the game with you. That's fun. It makes you look
forward to coming to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ford doesn't always look forward to going home at the end of
the day, it's understandable. For the first time in his married
life, he is living apart from wife Kathy and his kids. The couple
has four children, the youngest two of whom _ Michael, an
eighth-grader, and Anthony, a high-school junior _ stayed behind in
Boston with their mom because Ford didn't think it was wise to
uproot them just as they were settling in after their move back
from Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has always cleared time in his schedule, whenever possible,
to attend his children's sporting events. Coaching jobs, after all,
come and go but parenting is forever.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Katie plays Division III volleyball and basketball at
Williams (Mass.) College. Ford took advantage of the NBA lockout
(and his own unemployment) to follow her games religiously. He also
helped out with Michael's traveling basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clippers came calling, the family man wavered but, in
the end, the competitor won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches love challenges,'' he said. ``You have that
competitive fire in you that hopefully your presence will make (a
team) better.''

ADDITIONAL JOB CUTS HIT 2 ENTERTAINMENT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY _ Universal Music Group continued its massive
restructuring Thursday as 200 of the 600 people on its sales staff
were laid off, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the world's largest music company represents the
second phase of restructuring at UMG, which cut 500 jobs last week
at its A&AMP;M, Geffen, Mercury and Motown labels. As with the previous
layoffs, the affected employees were informed of their dismissals
when they arrived at work and were told to clean out their offices
by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated development, sources said The Walt Disney Co.
has laid off less than 100 employees in its feature animation
department but expects to rehire most of them later this year when
the workload is expected to increase. The company had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   UMG's revamping, triggered by last month's $10.4 billion buyout
of PolyGram, is expected to last through summer and could include
up to another 600 layoffs in the United States plus at least 800
job cuts overseas. Seagram Co., UMG's parent, is attempting to
generate $300 million in annual savings by eliminating duplicative
functions in its music operations.
</P>
<P>
   UMG did not officially confirm Thursday's layoffs. Instead, it
announced the structure of the merged Music &AMP; Video Distribution
operation with three regional divisions of four offices each.
</P>
<P>
   The sales staff will be split in two with one group handling new
``mainstream'' titles and everyone else working on catalog,
reissues and compilations. A new marketing group will be created to
handle special promotions for customers.
</P>
<P>
   UMG also announced it had started to combine its New York-based
Verve and GRP jazz labels into a single operation, with sources
saying 15 to 20 layoffs occurred Thursday.

 MacCULLOCH STUFFS USC  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Huskies discovered Thursday night that Elias Ayuso
is hard to spell, pronounce and defend. Fortunately for Washington,
he did not take the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Little Brandon Granville did, unwisely challenging Todd
MacCulloch and discovering what happens when you're 5-9 and take a
7-footer to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch rejected Granville's game-tying lay-in attempt,
preserving Washington's 85-83 Pac-10 victory over USC in front of
7,061 fans at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It never should have been this suspenseful, but Hec Ed turned
into a drama unit when Ayuso cut loose with an unstoppable 3-point
shooting display.
</P>
<P>
   From every angle, Ayuso knocked down three straight threes in a
two-minute stretch. Ayuso's final triple, over a lunging Senque
Carey and in front of his own celebrating bench, pulled
once-gasping USC within 84-83 with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A certain Husky victory appeared in jeopardy, particularly with
Washington suddenly looking fidgety, hoping to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Huskies had to rely on their rock, the player
who had parlayed his huge size advantage into 16 points on 8-for-9
shooting before settling into a sideline seat because of foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 minutes of the second half, MacCulloch watched from the
bench. His teammates were compensating nicely, building a 10-point
lead and seeming in control.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ayuso forced them to swerve. Fortunately, MacCulloch was
there, recording his first save of the season by producing the
game's most pivotal plays.
</P>
<P>
   With USC in possession and trailing 84-83, Adam Spanich came
around a screen and lofted an air ball that MacCulloch gathered in.
He was immediately fouled and went to the free-throw line with 6.6
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, MacCulloch thought about last year's game against
UCLA, the one he won with two free throws in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the closest I'd been to a situation like that,''
MacCulloch said. ``It helped me. I believed I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental imagery does not always work. Last year, two swishes.
Thursday night, a lucky roll on the first free throw and a clanker
on the second.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the final frenetic scenario, reminiscent of another
game last season. Remember when Stanford's Kris Weems weaved out of
backcourt and hit the game-winning three? Everyone flashed back to
that deflating afternoon when Granville took off on his dribble
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running back and I heard (Chris) Walcott say, `You've
got (Brian) Scalabrine,' '' MacCulloch said. ``I don't know if I
saw the play develop, but I knew what he (Granville) was going to
do.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch positioned himself under the hoop, the tall awaiting
the tiny, yielding a predictable result.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to try to use his speed and explode by me,''
MacCulloch said. ``I've had a lot of experience with guys blowing
past me. It's a little easier to block a smaller guy. There was no
way I was going to let him score a layup.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejection left USC with three-tenths of a second to come up
with a tip play. Appropriately, MacCulloch came up with the
in-bounds pass and ran downcourt with the ball as the horn sounded,
woofing all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Ayuso was not involved in either of the Trojans'
final two possessions. He finished with 19 points, 11 in the final
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if they're off-balance shots,'' Ayuso said.
``I can shoot them. I got into a rhythm and felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   As did most of the Huskies until the waning moments. Every
starter scored in double figures, topped by Carey. The freshman
point guard had 19 points, five assists and just one turnover in 37
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I play aggressively, I make good things happen,'' said
Carey, who originally committed to USC before changing his mind.
``I wanted to win that game a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Deon Luton ended his mini-slump with 18 points, going 4-for-6
from 3-point territory. MacCulloch provided 17 points and, more
significantly, four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Ayuso's theatrics, the Trojans had another perimeter
weapon in Spanich, who scored 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   USC's pair of heralded Washingtonians experienced an
unsuccessful homecoming. Using his superior quickness, Brian
Scalabrine caused MacCulloch to get in foul trouble. But the
Enumclaw High graduate had his own problems, going 3-for-9 and
scoring nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Wilder, the 1996 state high school player of the year
from Decatur, started at point guard and was greeted derisively by
Husky fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder originally committed to Washington out of high school but
failed to become academically eligible. The Dawg Pack remembered,
showering boos on Wilder when he was introduced.
</P>

VOTE COULD ALLOW SENATE TESTIMONY FROM LEWINSKY 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Impeachment proceedings against President Clinton
degenerated further into partisanship Thursday, with Republicans
rejecting a Democratic motion for a final vote, then pushing
through a plan that could allow Senate testimony from Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By 55-43, the Republicans killed a Democratic proposal to move
to final arguments and then vote up or down on whether to convict
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice and oust him. One
Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, voted with
Republicans on that motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then passed, 54-44, the GOP proposal that leaves open
possible testimony from Lewinsky on the Senate floor and the public
release of videotapes of her deposition next week before House
prosecutors and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had wanted the depositions of witnesses limited to
writing but lost that vote 54-44.
</P>
<P>
   The votes along party lines followed two days of contentious
negotiations in which senators failed to reach a bipartisan
agreement on procedural matters for taking the depositions and a
timetable for ending the first impeachment trial of a president in
131 years.
</P>
<P>
   The senators did agree, however, to begin taking depositions
Monday from Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center
of the presidential sex scandal, followed by presidential friend
Vernon Jordan and former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   She will be questioned by House prosecutors and White House
lawyers first, followed by Blumenthal on Tuesday and Jordan on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions are expected to last eight hours each and
conclude by Thursday, when the Senate is to reconvene its court of
impeachment to consider any motions that might be offered by House
prosecutors or Clinton's defense team.
</P>
<P>
   During the failed negotiations the Democrats objected primarily
to the insistence by Republicans that the witness depositions be
videotaped and presented publicly should the Senate vote to do so.
The Republicans also insisted that live testimony be taken on the
Senate floor if a majority of senators support it.
</P>
<P>
   In one concession, the two sides agreed that calling of further
witnesses in the case would need approval from both Republican and
Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said live testimony
and public airing of the videotapes would only serve to recreate
``the spectacle'' of the House impeachment proceedings, in which
the public reacted angrily to the release of salacious details of
Clinton's illicit affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What little dignity Monica Lewinsky has left we hope we can
protect,'' he said, adding that the ``dignity of the Senate'' is
also at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to have Monica Lewinsky or anyone else in the
well of the Senate talking about these matters,'' Daschle declared.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Democrats also opposed the Republican
procedural blueprint out of concern that it could extend the trial
indefinitely, depending on how the Senate votes on various motions
that lawmakers will be free to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, he said, wanted a certain end to the trial by
Feb. 12. That date is listed as the target deadline in the
Republican proposal, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., acknowledged that the trial could extend beyond that day
``depending on what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional responsibility here. We have a duty
to complete the process,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Democrats of ``overreacting'' to the GOP plan,
which would also allow Republicans to bring up a motion calling for
a vote on whether to find Clinton guilty of the impeachment
``facts'' alleged against him, but not remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't guarantee that there will be a motion on the
finding of fact. Neither does it prohibit it,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``finding of fact'' proposal would require 51 votes for
passage, while impeachment rules call for a two-thirds majority
vote in order to convict Clinton on the charges. If convicted of
either perjury or obstruction of justice, he would automatically be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fact'' proposal, being floated by Sen. Susan Collins,
R-Maine, was a major stumbling block for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe that this resolution for a finding of fact
may not be constitutional.'' Daschle told reporters, insisting that
impeachment rules do not allow the Senate to separate the votes on
conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart was more blunt. He said
the Collins proposal amounts to nothing more than an political
escape hatch for those Republicans who believe Clinton may have
committed impeachable offenses but are afraid to buck public
opinion by voting to oust him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Collins yesterday made an impassioned plea about how she
needs more facts in order to find the right way to the answer,''
Lockhart said. ``She then ... said we need this finding of facts
because we know he's guilty of obstruction of justice, we know he's
guilty of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to have it both ways. They can't. The Constitution
doesn't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is also held by a handful of Republicans, including
Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama. He agreed with Democrats on
Thursday in an interview with National Public Radio that the Senate
should not hold one vote on conviction and another on whether to
remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't believe that's going to fly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also accused the Republicans of trying to play
``power politics'' by muscling through their own blueprint for the
trial after promising it would be carried out in a fair and
bipartisan manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Republican) plan that was adopted is vague and it has no
certain end. It appears to contain trap doors that could
significantly extend this trial,'' Clinton spokesman James Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, however, countered by accusing the Democrats of
concocting a story to make it look like Republicans are trying to
``railroad'' Clinton out of office. ``This is not a deep dark plot
on the part of Republicans to slip anything over,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the vote of 54-44 _ with one Democrat and one
Republican absent _ on whether to move directly to closing
arguments was yet another signal that the House prosecution team
won't be able to muster the 67 votes _ a required two-thirds
majority _ it needs to convict Clinton on either of the two
articles of impeachment filed against him by the House last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans recognize that fact, but are still committed to
allowing House prosecutors ``the benefit of the doubt,'' as Shelby
put it, in making their case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear from the votes that there is at least a
solid bloc of senators who are not going to vote to convict,''
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby also agreed with Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania that, short of some new evidence in the depositions, a
majority of senators would vote against having Lewinsky actually
appear on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's not any explosive, dynamite evidence out of (the
depositions), I think we ought to go ahead and vote up or down on
the articles of impeachment,'' Shelby said. ``If it's more of the
same, I say move on.''

NEW SUBCULTURE OF GAYS COURT DEADLY PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABIN RUSSELL  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ In a Castro district apartment house, an $8
admission fee promises a night of communal gay sex. The only rules:
no clothes, no condoms, no discussion of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades into an epidemic that has taken the lives of nearly
18,000 San Franciscans, a new homosexual subculture is emerging:
Healthy men are seeking unprotected sex with HIV-infected men, for
the erotic thrill of communion with the deadly AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   For years, AIDS experts have been concerned about the growth of
a practice known as ``barebacking,'' where condoms are abandoned,
usually based on assumptions that partners are both HIV positive or
both negative.
</P>
<P>
   Now a fringe element, linked by the Internet, is taking it even
further. Web sites are offering lists of ``extreme sex'' party
sites where the prospect of becoming infected or of infecting
others is part of the erotic allure.
</P>
<P>
   At a ``Russian roulette party'' set for next month in Houston, a
posting seeks three healthy men to have sex with five other men.
Four of those must be HIV negative, but the fifth is already
infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of gay men are believed to frequent such
venues. Even so, many veteran AIDS activists, who championed the
``safer sex'' ethic that has checked the spread of the AIDS virus
since the mid-1980s, are disturbed by the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anger, I find it heartbreaking and tragic,'' said
Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action of Washington,
D.C., the nation's most powerful AIDS lobby.
</P>
<P>
   New research from San Francisco confirms that an increasing
number of gay men are having sex with multiple partners, and
without the protection of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported that among men who have anal sex with other men, the
portion of men who did so without condoms rose to 39 percent in
1997, from 30 percent in 1994. Rates of sex with more than one
partner also rose, and of those engaged in the riskiest practices,
68 percent did not know whether their partner was infected with the
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groups of men engaging in high-risk sex with multiple
partners, that is the kind of behavior that caused the epidemic to
explode,'' said Robert Perez of the Stop AIDS Project in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of barebacking has been fiercely debated in the gay
community for several years. But nothing is creating quite the stir
as the lastest issue of POZ, a glossy monthly magazine brimming
with ads for AIDS drugs, featuring a sympathetic portrayal of the
barebacking phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The cover features a handsome gay model, Tony Valenzuela,
resting naked atop a black stallion. While the story describes the
plight of Valenzuela as an outcast in the San Diego gay community
for publicly advocating barebacking, the photos and graphic images
portray a glamorous, sexy new icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cover photo definitely turns him into a sex object. I
understand people's criticisms,'' said POZ editor-in-chief Walter
Armstrong. ``We wanted to provoke people. We're willing to take the
heat for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS Action's Zingale finds this ``bareback chic''
appalling. ``Anything that glamorizes putting your own health at
risk is irresponsible and threatens to unravel all our progress,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   POZ, which has a modest national circulation of 130,000 is not
just trying to sell magazines, said Armstrong. ``It's not that we
wanted to defend barebacking,'' he said. ``We wanted to try to give
a fair, and considered, and nonjudgmental analysis of why this is
taking place. ... We want to see less condemnation of it as a
behavior, and more discussion about why gay men are wanting to stop
using condoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The subculture of barebacking is explored in depth in a second
POZ article ``A Ride on the Wild Side,'' by San Francisco
free-lance journalist Michael Scarce. It uncritically explores the
methods and motives of men who have rejected condoms and are having
unprotected sex in organized venues. It includes a visit to the
Castro ``Bareback House'' and an account of what goes on inside.
</P>
<P>
   Scarce, 28 years old and HIV-negative, describes a subculture of
gay men who eroticize risky sexual practices, and in some cases,
are embracing the prospect of becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
   Across a network of Web sites, gay men from Wichita to Rotterdam
advertise group sex parties for barebacking men. Using street
parlance, the Web sites describe the act of seeking HIV (``bug
chasing''), or seeking to infect willing partners with the virus
(``giving the gift'').
</P>
<P>
   Scarce, who has investigated the Internet phenomenon and is
writing a book about it, said he has interviewed numerous
``inoculation party'' participants. The parties, he said, are not
an Internet hoax or a fantasy played out only on screen.
</P>
<P>
   But he concedes, ``We are talking about a very small minority of
the barebacking subculture.''
</P>
<P>
   A former HIV prevention worker who now works at a resource
center for gays and lesbian students at the University of
California at San Francisco, Scarce said gay men need to recognize
the appeal of unprotected sex in order to come to terms with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop kidding ourselves that safer sex is hotter
sex. It's just not. There is a particular appeal to barebacking
because it is sexier. It is hotter,'' said Scarce in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes and impresses me that gay men value their sexuality,
and that they find such meaning in it that they are willing to take
certain kinds of risks,'' he said. ``That is an important and
beautiful thing, although it can have harmful and damaging
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   To Tom Coates, the director of the UCSF AIDS Research Institute,
the implications of such thinking are saddening. The POZ article,
he said, may ``legitimize barebacking'' and help break down the
behavior changes that have protected San Francisco's gay community
from the rampant spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at POZ not only for sensationalizing the
movement, but for not presenting a balanced view. Nowhere did I see
the word `responsibility.' As an HIV-infected man myself, I take
that responsibility very seriously,'' said Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Scarce dismisses the highly respected AIDS expert as part of an
``old guard'' whose vision of HIV prevention is grounded in the
experience of Baby Boomers devastated by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   This vision of a generation gap within the gay community
permeates much of the discussion of barebacking and the shift to
riskier sexual practices. Surveys show younger gay men are more
likely than their older peers to engage in unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   To younger gay men such as Scarce, AIDS has become interwoven as
part of gay identity. ``AIDS and gay culture are permanently
tethered to one another, and not necessarily in a bad way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, in the view of some veteran AIDS activists, dishonors
the dead, and makes not only for bad public health policy, but
disastrous gay politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sympathetic will be the public, which has coughed up a lot
of money for services and research, if we don't have
responsibility?'' said Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Durazzo, program director for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, said the POZ article provides a service in bringing
discussions about barebacking into the open. ``We have to be
challenged how to understand the complex nature of that issue,'' he
said. ``We need to give men opportunities to talk about it and make
their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The long history of AIDS in San Francisco, he suggested, shows
that the city's gay community has acted responsibly and will
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this city,'' Durazzo said, ``men have made good choices
around HIV and their sexual lives. They are making complex
decisions how to stay safe. If they were making bad choices, we
would see an enormously escalating epidemic.''

GIFT TO GRAND CANYON PARK RAISES COMMERCIALISM CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Arizona foundation's $2.5 million pledge kicked off an
international drive to raise $350 million for a light-rail train,
education campus, and new bike and walking paths at Grand Canyon
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Del E. Webb Foundation's donation Thursday to the Grand
Canyon National Park Foundation also marked a new age of reliance
by the National Park Service on the largesse of private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists and park advocates worry that the
nation's parks could become too commercialized, essentially turned
into giant corporate billboards.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Webb Foundation _ an independent philanthropic arm
of the Del Webb Corp. construction firm _ has been promised its
name on a large slab of Kaibab limestone at the entrance of the
park's Heritage Education Campus. The campus is a planned $55
million renovation of five historic buildings in the center of the
Grand Canyon Village.
</P>
<P>
   The stone slab, located near one of the planned light-rail
terminals, would be the first overt recognition of a corporate
entity inside the 1.2 million-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   David Simon of the National Park and Conservation Association,
the leading advocacy group for the nation's parks, wondered whether
Webb's slab would set a precedent for other donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean there will be 10 more rocks that (5 million
annual) visitors will have to dodge?'' he asked. ``I do applaud
their philanthropy. I just don't think it should be thrust in the
face of all visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon said parks should be safe havens from the incessant
bombardment of Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parks need the money. The sad part about this is that the
amount of corporate philanthropy, and the Park Service's eagerness
to solicit and accept corporate donations, is a sign that Congress
is not meeting the basic budget needs for the parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's donation is part of a burst of activity that could
drastically improve _ or, in some views, threaten _ the landscape
surrounding Arizona's most famous natural feature.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon officials also face decisions about whether to
allow cellular phone towers inside the park, and if selective
logging could be used to thin the park's forests to reduce fire
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The education campus likely will take several years to complete.
However, the light-rail system should be operating between Tusayan
and the planned Canyon View Information Plaza at Mather Point by
2002. Portions of the bike and walking trails _ which will connect
Hermit's Rest, Desert View, Mather Point and Tusayan _ also should
be completed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the park's master plan calls for: new housing for
park employees; new offices and maintenance centers for park
personnel; the relocation of many existing services such as mule
rides; and the elimination of most of the 1.5 million cars and
commercial buses that annually prowl the park's aging roadways.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Grand Canyon. And that emotion of standing on
the rim and gazing out at that magnificent hold is a very personal
experience,'' Grand Canyon Superintendent Rob Arnberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not to be encumbered by belching diesel buses sitting on
the rim, or boom boxes, or the difficulty of finding parking
places, or spending hours trying to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Park and foundation officials were all smiles at a downtown
Phoenix news conference, at which the Webb foundation delivered the
first of five $500,000 checks it plans to give the park foundation,
the fund-raising arm of Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton weighed in, too, calling the donation a
response to the Clinton administration's Save America's Treasurers
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to R.H. Johnson, president of the Webb Foundation,
the first lady called the donation ``a true catalyst'' in the move
to get Congress to supply matching funds to preserve and protect
America's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Polk, chairman of the park foundation, which was created in
1995, said that without the Webb gift, the foundation's plan of
generating up to $100 million over the next decade ``would probably
be impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   R.H. Johnson said the Webb Foundation relishes the ``leadership
role, and in doing do so it encourages others to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Webb, who passed away in 1974, was obsessed with
putting his name on everything his company built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is truly a major step toward developing a
national trend toward partnership with the private sector and the
National Park Service,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., said he believes that the
federal government has let the parks down and that more federal
dollars are needed to maintain ``the crown jewel of the national
park system,'' so entrance fees don't have to rise beyond the means
of average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the federal government is doing its job. I have
a problem . . . with the federal government not funding the
national parks,'' said Shadegg, who has supported higher park
spending and a recent doubling of Grand Canyon entrance fees.
</P>
<P>
   Arnberger, the park superintendent, said there is no decision
about how to handle recognition of future corporate donors, but he
pledged that there would be no overt advertising inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's policy, and our responsibility, to make it unobtrusive
and to find ways to give credit,'' Arnberger said, ``but not in
ways where credit overtakes the reason why the park is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is a public park. At the same time, there's an
exciting spectrum of opportunities to work with philanthropic
organizations and with private organizations to protect the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see `Brought to you by Coke or Pepsi' on the sides
of electric buses.'' &QL;

<P>
   No doubt you, too, were enthralled by the recent International
Plant and Animal Genome Comference in San Diego. This would have
been especially true if, unlike me, you actually made it to San
Diego for all the hoopla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, in truth, I did make it to San Diego, but seven months
before the Genome VII Conference, as it was known, was held. I was
there for the National Society of Newspaper Columnists' conference,
where we spoke hardly a word about genomes, though we did go to the
Wild Animal Park, where we rode around on the back of a flat-bed
truck as it bumped its way over rhino dung. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the recent Genome Conference took place without me. Which I
regret. I've been interested in genomes ever since Sen. Kit Bond of
Missouri came to my office months ago and claimed plant genome work
was the sleeper issue of our time. Bond was simply wild over genome
research, waxing eloquent over it as my colleagues and I sat there
wondering what the devil a plant genome is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've tried to research this matter since then, but with
darn little progress. Oh, I have discovered that the word genome
comes from the same root word as both genocide and genitalia, but
I'm not going to talk in this column about either Rwanda or the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, so let's move on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've also found out that genome means a complete haploid set of
chromosomes of an organism. But right there you see my problem in
learning about plant and animal genomes. I no sooner find out one
thing than it forces me to hunt up something else and then
something else and soon I've wandered down 16 bunny trails and have
lost my way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK. Haploid. My dictionary, which is only 20 years old, says it
means ``having the full number of chromosomes normally occurring in
the mature germ cell or half the number of the usual somatic
cell.'' I think somatic means asleep, but if I looked it up to be
sure I'd drift into learning about sleep disorders and never get
around to genomes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So from what I can tell, folks who fool around with plant and
animal genomes try to understand the genetic structure of whatever
they're studying so they can, if they want, breed better plants and
animals. Or at least plants and animals that taste better than ones
we're eating now. This is known, I think, as genetic engineering.
The word genetic, too, comes from the same root as genocide and
that other word I'm not going to use again, so don't ask. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists all over the globe are trying to create better plants
and animals by understanding and jiggling with (that's a technical
term meaning fooling with) genetic structure. Indeed, as you well
know if you attended the recent conference in San Diego, you could
have (and may well have) attended a ``Cattle &AMP; Sheep Workshop''
(both I and II), a ``Sugar Beet Workshop,'' a ``Rice Workshop,'' a
``Legumes Workshop'' and more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see a ``Strawberry Workshop'' on the list, but when I
first got interested in genome work, I began with strawberries
because, as a youngster in a 4-H club 1,250 years ago, I grew
blue-ribbon strawberries. But as I tried to read about strawberries
I kept running across odd and intriguing facts that had little to
do with genome work, so I consistently got sidetracked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, did you know George M. Darrow was (maybe is) one
of the world's great strawberry experts? Me, either. Do you know if
he was (or is) gentically related to famed attorney Clarence
Darrow? Me, either. Did you know, according to an introduction to
George Darrow's book, ``The Strawberry: History, Breeding and
Physiology'', that the ``ordinary wild wood strawberry of Europe,
the (ital)fraise des bois(end-ital) or (ital)vesca(end-ital), is
rarely tasted today except by epicures''? Me, either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, do you know a lot about plant and animal genomes now? Me,
either. &QL;
</P>

CITING CHAPTER AND VERSE ON FALWELL'S GAFFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give the Rev. Jerry Falwell this: He gets people talking about
religion, no matter how silly, arrogant or misleading he may be.
And often he's all three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most recently he stirred the waters by preaching a sermon in
which he said the Antichrist probably is a live today and is a male
Jew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Jews were outraged. One of the more articulate
responses to Falwell came from Rabbi James Rudin of the American
Jewish Committee: ``This is part of what I call millennial madness.
To single out any one man and particularly to identify him as
Jewish plays into some latent and historical anti-Semitism from the
past.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In later trying to explain himself, Falwell not only compounded
the affront to Judaism but also managed _ as is his occasional wont
_ to offend people of his own faith by distorting traditional
Christian doctrine. Falwell said the belief that the Antichrist
``will, by necessity, be a Jewish male'' is ``2,000 years old and
has no anti-Semitic roots. This is simply historic and prophetic
orthodox Christian doctrine that most theologians, Christian and
non-Christian, have understood for two millennia.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How was Falwell wrong? I hesitate to count the ways for fear of
losing track, but let me at least start to point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's problem is that he has pledged allegiance to but one
interpretation of the enigmatic idea of Antichrist and declared
that view the truth. Christian history, however, is replete with
many ideas on the subject. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That said, it is true that in one strain of Christian thinking _
represented by the 16th century Catholic prelate and scholar Robert
Bellarmine _ the Antichrist is a Jew who arises from the biblical
tribe of Dan. This notion is based on such Bible passages as
Genesis 49:17 and John 5:43. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to describe this thinking as orthodox Christian doctrine
understood by everyone for 2,000 years is simply to ignore huge
chunks of church history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One can draw legitimately different ideas of Antichrist by
looking at different passages of the Bible itself, from the book of
Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures to the New Testament books of John,
the letters of John, Revelation and II Thessalonians. Indeed, I
John 2:18, in the New Revised Standard Version, says ``many
antichrists'' already have come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the many questions end-times theologians must wrestle with
when they step into the Antichrist minefield are whether he (if one
can even assign sex to Antichrist) is one or many, whether
Antichrist is an individual or some kind of powerful institution
and whether he is a civil or a religious power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Falwell's certainty that Antichrist is a Jewish
male among us today, many of the 16th century leaders of the
Protestant Reformation declared the Roman Catholic papacy itself to
be Antichrist. (In most places, that offensiveness has yielded, and
it wasn't unusual to find public Protestant prayers for the pope's
recent visit to Mexico and St. Louis.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But listen to these brutal remarks expressing this view from
none other than John Calvin, father of the Reformed Tradition:
``Whoever will duly examine and weigh the whole form of
ecclesiastical government as now existing in the Papacy, will find
that there is no kind of spoliation (it means plunder) in which
robbers act more licentiously, without law or measure. . . We
maintain that their kingdom is the tyranny of Antichrist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in the 12th century, long before the Reformers, Joachim of
Flora, a medieval inventor of prophetic systems, also wrote that
Antichrist would arise from inside the church and hold high
office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, the list of people and institutions identified as
Antichrist candidates over the years is long and remarkable, and
includes the Emperor Nero, Napoleon, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Hitler,
Stalin, Henry Kissinger, Ronald Reagan, Sun Myung Moon, Saddam
Hussein, Yassir Arafat, Louis Farrakhan, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton
and Barney the Dinosaur. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, impossible in a few column inches of type to
do justice to centuries of serious biblical scholarship on the end
of the world, the Second Coming of Christ and the identity of
Antichrist. But it's possible at least to hint at the rich and
varied interpretations available and to say that many parts of
mainline Christianity, unlike Falwell, pay precious little
attention to any of this. They prefer, instead, to focus on the
call to share good news with the world now and to minister to
people in need. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Falwell still wants to say something useful about Jewish
males, he at least could apologize for Christianity's historic
anti-Semitism. &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Breadboard edge is affected by weather
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject of breadboard edges came up recently with a question
on the Internet concerning ways of setting them up without having
them self-destruct with seasonal changes.
</P>
<P>
   Far as I'm concerrned, breadboard edges are a nuisance. Just as
the Victorians were so prudish they covered up piano legs with
skirts, some old-time woodworkers were offended by the sight of end
grain. They invented breadboard edges to cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   I always try to remember that folks who read this may not know
all the terms us bearcats use amongst ourselves, so I'd better
explain. You see, breadboard ends typically on Early American
furniture. Let's say you're making a coffee table and the top will
be made up of four boards, each about four or five inches wide,
glued edge to edge. Breadbopard ends would be a narrow piece of
wood, perhaps two inches wide, run along the edges of the top,
across the grain of the top.
</P>
<P>
   The structural problem this raises is one central to all
woodworking, i.e., wood moves. It takes on moisture during the wet
season _ the summer _ and expels it during the dry season, the
winter. All the significant movement is across the grain.
</P>
<P>
   Thus your 16-inch-wide top, if made in the winter, may become a
16 1/4-inch top in the summer. The breadboard ends, being
cross-grain to the top, will not move with it. This movement is
inexorable; no amount of glue or screws or anything else will stop
it. It will crack or break apart joints in order to complete its
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much the avoidance of failure due to
seasonal changes, but the inevitable and obvious mismatching you
are going to get in the season opposite the one in which you
construct the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The best way _ the only way, in my opinion _ to join a
breadboard end to the tabletop or box lid or whatever it is you've
got is with a sliding dovetail. This assures that the thing is
going to stay together, regardless of what seasonal movement does.
If you make the joint well, you don't even need to glue it. If you
do use glue, then of course you should glue it only along a few
inches of the center of the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The joint is made on the router table. Remember not to waste all
of the wood at once with the dovetail bit; use a straight bit to
take out as much as you can before going to the dovetail bit for
the final pass.Net provides strange answer
</P>
<P>
   While there is a lot of great information for woodworkers on the
Internet, sometimes you run into really strange people.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, someone asked about alternative methods of
edge-jointing boards for gluing, and he got this bizarre answer,
quoted exactly as received:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some times I use my drill press to edge boards for gluing
together, beats the hell out of a finger cutting joiner. and yes
you can use a lect. hand plane but might as well use a broad ax.
which i also have a 12''er too but i have never put a left hand
handle in it. All these ole Tie Hacker know about the broad axes.
have fun while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now. The correspondent doesn't say what he uses in his
drill press to joint boards, but one assumes it is a router bit. I
don't know what kind of drill press he's got, but mine is fairly
standard and it doesn't run faster than 2,000 RPM. A router bit
needs to run a whole lot faster than that to cut cleanly. Also,
unless an absolutely flat base at least several feet long is
attached to the drill press, it isn't going to true the board
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I would prefer to use my wood-cutting jointer. I never had a
finger-cutting jointer; I believe they are obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   I would even prefer to use an electric hand planer rather than a
broad axe. You could also use a jointing plane. They do a fine job,
make no noise, and even provide a little exercise.

 &HT;    John Paul's plan: Tighten the reins, spread the wealth
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pope has money and morals on his
mind. President Clinton figures in both. But nothing explains why
they are one-two in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, the Roman Catholic vicar of Christ, and Bill
Clinton, the Southern Baptist president impeached for high crimes
and misdemeanors, are the two most popular men in America,
according to a recent Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist philanderer leads the list, squeaking past the
Polish bishop who is likely, one day, to be named a saint.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion evident in that moral schizophrenia may be one of
the reasons the pope paid a two-day visit to St. Louis this week.
</P>
<P>
   He came from Mexico, where he launched an initiative that may
radically influence the American Catholic Church and the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The wily and brilliant ambassador of Catholicism has a plan that
could address what he sees as the lax morality of North America and
the desperate poverty of Latin America and South America.
</P>
<P>
   His scheme could send hard currency to one, restore religious
obedience to the other and bestow more power on the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Father has long deplored the low morals and high jinks
of the present age, particularly in the more liberal United States.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of more than a billion Christians has often used the
world's most powerful bully pulpit to rail against social, economic
and political injustice throughout poorer countries in the south
and east.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lifts up the vision of a new world order in terms of the
dignity and value of the human person,'' said the Rev. Timothy
Lynch, pastor of Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church in West Palm
Beach. ``Structures of government are to serve the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope suggested in Mexico last week that the church in North
America and South America join forces in a common ministry. He
called for a Synod of America that would unify the plans and the
efforts of two very different churches in two radically different
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   He signed and presented to the church a statement in Mexico City
that, in six chapters, responded to a meeting of North and South
American bishops that took place in Rome in 1997. The introduction
expressed his will for the church in this hemisphere:
</P>
<P>
   ``As sisters and brothers to each other, the particular churches
of the continent will strengthen the bonds of cooperation and
solidarity in order that the saving work of Christ may
continue...''
</P>
<P>
   Working together might bring oceans of money, a hint of
democratic principles and a breath of religious tolerance to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Such a union could have other consequences the pope would
appreciate but might be less popular in the North American church.
</P>
<P>
   A shared ministry might influence the liberal northern church
with the more traditional values and obedience of the church in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   That would pay dividends to the pope on questions of sexual
ethics, birth control, abortion and, more critically, acceptance of
the pope's authority to speak on those and other questions in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic ideas, which have never been terribly popular in the
Vatican, religious pluralism and the independence of the northern
Catholic might be modestly blunted by influences from south of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a jewel in the crown of an enormously active and
successful pontificate for this pope who, at 78 and with
Parkinson's disease, is nearing the end of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   He has been tireless in defense of the poor, traditional
Catholic morality, the church and the authority of the pope to lead
it. His latest vision does no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a prophetic voice,'' Lynch said. ``I think he
follows the prophet, Amos. Amos was a pain in the ---. That's John
Paul. He will not be shy.''

 &HT;    Some holiday recipes are worth a breach in security
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Don and Betsy Leebern are about the last
people I'd expect to cause a commotion at the Atlanta airport. I
was surprised when Hal Northrop called from Pine Mountain to report
that he had seen them in custody of the Hartsfield police.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy, a former Miss Georgia who holds the record for most
appearances on the cover of the late and lamented
Journal-Constitution Sunday magazine, is a leader in University of
Georgia alumni affairs and community activities. She is also a
gourmet cook who has studied under the great chefs of Paris and
Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Don, having overcome his beginnings as a first-team lineman on
UGA's 1959 conference champion football team, is a courtly adviser
to governors and a distinguished member of the Board of Regents, a
former chairman, and head of search committees that brought in a
new chancellor and a new university president.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hal what the Leeberns had done to get in trouble with
the airport police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently they were trying to smuggle a suspicious substance
aboard a flight,'' he said. I decided to call the Leeberns for more
information. Basically, Hal's information was correct.
</P>
<P>
   While serving on the Board of Regents with Joel Cowan, the
Peachtree City prince of slopes introduced Don to snow skiing. Last
December, the day before New Year's, Don decided it would be nice
to spend the holiday at a ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go to Crested Butte,'' he said to Betsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't,'' she replied. ``I've got black-eyed peas and
collards on the stove.'' Culinary excursions to Paris and Lyon
haven't entirely ruined her Southern taste buds developed in her
mother's Atlanta kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can find some out there,'' Don said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how to cook black-eyed peas and collards in
Colorado,'' Betsy replied, ``and we certainly can't begin a new
year without them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we carry them with us?'' Don asked.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy froze the peas and collards in plastic containers, packed
them in a carry-on bag, and headed for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray eye apparently had never before encountered frozen
peas and collards in a carry-on bag. The security person in charge
of the machine asked the Leeberns to step aside. She watched
nervously while Betsy opened the bag for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The security person seemed to suspect some kind of a plastic
explosive, like terrorists use to blow up airplanes. Betsy tried to
explain about the peas and collards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's collards, where is the pepper sauce?'' demanded the
security person. She called her supervisor. The supervisor was on
the verge of calling the bomb squad when Betsy managed to engage
the security person in a conversation about cooking collards and
black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   The security person, who turned out to know a lot about what
some call soul food, soon realized she had apprehended a kindred
spirit. The peas and collards, in their plastic containers, went
back into the carry-on and the Leeberns were cleared for their
flight to Crested Butte.
</P>
<P>
   Don rushed to the escalator leading to the transportation
corridor and the train. When he looked around, Betsy wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   She was still standing beside the X-ray machine, exchanging
recipes with the security lady.
</P>
<P>
   I'm anxious to try her recipe for cooking collards, which might
get me past the Fat Control Officer who shares my bedroom. She
takes pork neck bones, or the end of a left-over Christmas ham, and
boils a broth the day before she plans to cook the collards. The
broth, seasoned with onion and vinegar, is placed in the
refrigerator overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after stemming and chopping the collard leaves,
the rime of fat is skimmed off before the broth is poured into the
pot. How long does she cook the collards?
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I can take a fork and dip out a sample that's real
soft,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy cooks dried black-eyed peas with hog jowl, onion and a pod
of red pepper ``until the peas are mushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has recipes from Paris and keeps Don at his UGA
playing weight, she's not entirely sold on the low-fat, no-fat
marketing flimflams that have nearly ruined authentic Southern
cooking and any number of marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more sensible just to eat less of what's good,''
she says. We agreed that you can make a pretty good biscuit with
olive oil, but not one to compare with the ones our mothers made
with lard.
</P>
<P>
   Real Southern cooking is an endangered species. The fat police
are still on the march, but I believe good will prevail over evil.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for hope when a former Miss Georgia emerges
fairly uncorrupted from the gourmet kitchens of Paris and Lyon, and
thinks enough of home-cooked New Year's black-eyed peas and
collards to risk smuggling them through the Atlanta airport in a
carry-on bag.

 &HT;    What happens when the world stops watching Jasper?
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ The whole world, or a darn good part of it, is
watching Jasper as the capital murder trial begins for the first
defendant in the dragging death of James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Spots have been assigned for the satellite television trucks to
do live programming. Reporters have been assigned to their seats.
The whole world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a guarantee: For the next several weeks or months,
Jasper is going to be a model of racial harmony. It has already
begun, in fact. The Rev. Kenneth Lyons says that change of heart is
visible in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it was a put-on,'' Lyons said in a story by
the Associated Press. At first? Not enough time has passed to get
beyond the ``at first'' part. Byrd died just seven months ago.
Change that matters simply
</P>
<P>
   does not come that fast.
</P>
<P>
   And, excuse me, but did not both black and white residents of
Jasper tell us _ just days after Byrd's brutal death _ that Jasper
had no racial problems? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, I had heard before. While editor at the Lufkin
Daily News, we'd sent a reporter to do a story about a black family
that had moved into a white neighborhood. The white neighbors
welcomed the black children by siccing their pit bulls on them.
Nice. In doing that story we were also told that Jasper had no
racial problems.
</P>
<P>
   But surely all of us knew that was a lie, anyway. Large and
small in communities across the United States there are racial
problems. Some communities are working on them while others ignore
them.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Jasper fit? Better question: Where does Marshall fit?
</P>
<P>
   It was just last week in Jasper that blacks and whites working
together tore down the fence in a cemetery that separated the black
and the white graves. One of the workers said that the fence of a
``symbol'' of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a fence is no symbol. It is the genuine article,
no less than signs over water fountains. Whether the torn-down
fence is a symbol will depend on what happens now. Does this mean
that white and black graves will be mixed now, or will someone just
remember where the symbolic line runs in the cemetery?
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonderful thing that blacks and whites worked together
on this project. That is certainly a beginning, but it is equally
telling that Jasper's first target to end racism is in a cemetery
where not a single living soul will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Why not tear down the fences (the symbolic ones) that divide the
living community first? Real walking, talking, breathing people
would be helped by doing such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   One would hope that it did not require much debate on whether
the fence in the cemetery should be torn down (if so, problems are
far worse than we thought).
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly it is much more difficult to tear down the imaginary
fences than the real ones. The tough fences are the ones you never
see until you run smack dab into them. They are the fences that
move with you and can change at any time. James Byrd got caught on
the wrong side of such a fence.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next few weeks, anyway, I'm relatively certain that
racial harmony will prevail in Jasper. We'll read story after story
about the wondrous diversity that is taking place in that little
East Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world will be watching. I just hope that everyone
remembers that what counts is what happens when the whole world has
tuned out.

 &HT;    Belly up to trough like lawmakers
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You Sixth Street sidewalk sommeliers who want a
free meal should crash these freebie parties being thrown all over
Austin for state representatives and senators.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me. The food is much tastier at these deals than what's
served at the Salvation Army, and often there's free beer. Besides,
it's only fair that you winos get in on this action, right? This is
America. Why should only elected officials be allowed to freeload
off the top shelf?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, not all of these free parties for lawmakers are created
equal. Austin's Tuesday night shindig at the Austin Music Hall _
dubbed the 1999 Great Austin Bash, designed to stop Austin-bashing
by the legislature _ wasn't all that spectacular. Food consisted of
a fajita bar _ WITH NO GUACAMOLE. That's a Mexican food felony.
Also, there was little local color _ some balloons and corporate
banners.
</P>
<P>
   What were organizers thinking? Being an Austin affair, they
should have released some bats, or had Mayor Watson working the
room in a salamander suit.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the way they had the tip jars at the Austin party
chained to the bar, so the lobbyists couldn't steal them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some parties for lawmakers that are worth
schmoozing your way into.
</P>
<P>
   Panhandlers in need of complimentary grub might want to check
out Chambers County Day Tuesday evening at the Saengerrunde Hall.
You'll notice most of this fare goes with Ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have fried oysters, fried alligator, sirloin
steak kabobs, barbecued ribs, gumbo, oyster stew, deep fried Cajun
stuffed quail _ whoo,'' said Lolita Ramos, administrative assistant
for Sen. David Bernsen, D-Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Another date the carpeting-deprived should mark on their
calendars is Tuesday, March 23 _ Brazoria County Day. I may even
bust into this one.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 p.m. at Fiesta Gardens on Town Lake, lawmakers will be
treated to ``the largest shrimp cocktail in the world,'' said Mike
Hogg, co-chairman of Brazoria County Day. ``How about 15,000 pounds
of shrimp?''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to attend this pigout, a legislative favorite
for the last 10 sessions. ``I remember one time that there were so
many people wanting to get in that the university students got
boats and tried to invade from the lake,'' said Sen. Buster Brown,
R-Lake Jackson. You gate crashers should climb in some inner tubes
and float up.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you street people are thinking. You're thinking,
``Kelso, how can I get into these legislative affairs? You usually
need a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   So? Tell the flunky working the door you're state Sen. or Rep.
Whoever's third cousin, twice removed. Think about it. How can they
tell you from the rest of the guests? You'll have your hand out,
just like the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows there are plenty of these free events you can hit. If
you play your cards right, you can eat and drink for nothing in
this town until you explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night (Tuesday night) was something else,'' said State
Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, a known grazer. He said on Tuesday
night he hit five different affairs and stuffed his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint, I think, had fajitas,'' Rep. Naishtat said. ``The
Motion Picture Association of America had chicken-fried chicken and
roast beef. Then I went over to the Farmers Insurance legislative
reception at the Marriott and they had a lot of different stuff.
They had some Chinese food; they had ham, beef, shrimp. Then I went
to the Texas Chiropractic Association reception at the Saengerrunde
Hall. They had catfish with all the side stuff.''

 &HT;    Cher's banner year: Back in limelight with a big hit, the singer
is kicking off the Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Few can forget Whitney Houston's soaring
rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner before Super Bowl XXV in
Tampa at the height of the Gulf War. Jets screamed overhead, fans
roared with approval and patriotism flowed like concession stand
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the versatile _ though often scantily clad _
Cher will leave her imprint on the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest single honor I've ever had,'' she said
Tuesday by telephone, also noting that she won't be wearing
gluteous-bearing spandex for the performance.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of her new big single, ``Believe,'' we asked Cher to
name 10 things she believes in and 10 she doesn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe in? Ten? Wow. That's hard. I don't know if I
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So we shortened it to five of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me see. I don't believe in Republicans.'' (Five second
pause)
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in possibilities.'' (Another extended pause)
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if people are given the option of being either
good or bad that they'll choose to be good.'' (Long pause)
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in freedom of speech. I don't believe in politics.''
(Extended pause. Darn near 10 seconds)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awful. It's too hard. I'm just trying to give you
stuff off the top of my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had more time I could give you things that are a lot more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cher gave rapid-fire answers when asked to suggest
activities for women who don't care about the Super Bowl. That was
tough too, she said, since she loves football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go clean out your closet. Go shopping. Go to the movies with a
friend. Hold a Super Bowl party for other women and talk about the
players and what great (backsides) they have.''

 &HT;    For the love of locks
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My dark-brown hair has been through a 20th
century black-hair experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was sizzle-fried by my Mama's hot comb. It was chemically
straightened by my third cousin Vivian and then by hipster hair
stylists in three states. It was braided down with synthetic hair
extensions by Mrs. Olivia.
</P>
<P>
   And finally it was locked up ... by me.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone back to the ancient African technique of hairlocking.
I'm not saying I'm revolutionary, or even cutting edge, because
more and more African Americans are choosing to lock their hair,
too, such as hip-hop music star Lauryn Hill, Nobel Prize winning
writer Toni Morrison, University of Texas football player Ricky
Williams and MSNBC on-camera technology correspondent Omar Wasow.
My locked hair is just part of the final march in the African
American natural hair movement.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about natty root dreadlocks of the Rastafarians
who are growing their hair organically as part of their religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locks'' is the accepted term for the hairstyle in books,
magazines and among people who wear it. Although ``dreadlocks'' are
associated with the Rastafarians of the Caribbean, the term was
originally meant to be derogatory and many people still consider it
to be so.
</P>
<P>
   My locked hair is about nappy-natural style. Some folks will
tell you I have African or Nubian cultivated locks, but whatever
name they give, the hairstyle makes a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It says I have learned some patience, honey.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up those marathon eight-hour, hair-braiding sessions at
Mrs. Olivia's place in the spring of 1997. Once upon a time, I
thought my braids were going to be a death-do-us-part hair thing,
but in my eighth year I declared ``enough!'' I wanted a hairstyle
that was permanent, natural and cost-effective, i.e. cheaper than
professional braiding.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, I had seen African Americans with beautiful
cultivated locks and I wanted to grow my own. I knew my decision
would be final because once your hair is locked _ that's it. You
only get rid of the locks if you cut off your hair. And I am too
vain to wear a short Afro.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day weekend I took down my braids, washed and
conditioned my hair, threw out my extra bags of synthetic weave,
sat on the floor with a mirror and started palm-rolling small
sections of my hair. It took about four hours to finish. And, a
minute later (or so it seemed), my hair unraveled. I palm-rolled it
again. And again. And on and on for days. Every time my hair
unraveled, I got more frustrated. I knew my hair wouldn't lock
overnight, but I didn't think starting the process would make me
wanna holler.
</P>
<P>
   Did I really have the commitment to grow locks? And what was
wrong with my hair? In the midst of my hairlocking angst, I had to
endure my disapproving relatives, especially my parents who think
I've lost my mind. (They didn't like the braids, either.)
</P>
<P>
   They reminded me of that group of Brooklyn, N.Y., parents who
got angry when a white, third-grade teacher read a children's book
called ``Nappy Hair'' in her classroom of mostly African American
and Latino children. The story by Carolivia Herron is supposed to
be a celebration a little black girl's naturally kinky hair.
</P>
<P>
   However, those New York parents and mine aren't into the nappy
naturally hair groove. Now, not everybody with locked hair
encounters parental critics. Some are supportive like
AustiniteSigele Nickerson-Adams' parents. Her mother started
locking her hair at 18 months, and now at age 8, her nearly
waist-length hair is much admired.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little late for my childhood days, but I could have
avoided much anguish if I had done what Cynthia Laws did _ made an
appointment with a ``locktician,'' a professional hair stylist who
specializes in African American natural hair care, especially
hairlocking.
</P>
<P>
   Laws, who lives in San Marcos, went to Greg Day at Shear Magic
on Brodie Lane for a microlocking technique called Sisterlocks
about a year ago. Day says that the trademarked technique he uses
works for those people who still have chemically straightened hair
because they don't have to cut off the permed hair to start locks _
the traditional requirement. This particular feature was attractive
to Laws who had a head full of shoulder-length permanently relaxed
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Sisterlocks was developed by JoAnne Cornwell who teaches at San
Diego State University. Now she markets her Sisterlocks, which
requires a specially designed tool, to professional hair stylists
such as Day, who become certified consultants. However, it cost
$450 to get the Sisterlocks put in and for the first lock
tightening session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an up-front cost, but the advantage of Sisterlocks is
you don't have to use anything on your hair to get the lock,'' said
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Another Austin locktician is Betty Spriggs at Jabito Beauty
Supply and Salon on Cameron Road. She works with many people who
are starting with short natural hair, such as Austinite Zell Miller
III, whom she is assisting through his second set of locks. Spriggs
uses palm-rolling, braiding or various twisting techniques and a
holding agent to get the locks going. The cost for the service
starts at $80.
</P>
<P>
   Since I didn't know any Austin lockticians when I started my
hairlocking journey, I tied up my hair and went to the bookstore
for help. I read the how-to books of several nationally known
lockticians and African American natural hair-care specialists.
Then I followed their advice.
</P>
<P>
   What I learned was my do-it-yourself palm-rolling was unsuitable
for my hair texture. I switched to two-strand twists and they
stayed put. I was thrilled. I covered my hair in various
African-print fabrics _ a la singer Erykah Badu _ and the waiting
began. And just when I thought I would never see a lock on my head,
one day there they were! It had only taken six months.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask me why I am locking my hair, I may paraphrase
the words of Miller, who is six months into his new set of locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps represent my culture without ever opening my mouth,''
said Miller. ``The locks remind me of all the roots we have. It's a
daily affirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   _ LOCK FACT AND FICTION
</P>
<P>
   People who have locks don't wash their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Locks require regular shampooing.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction: If you want to grow locks, don't groom your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Locks require regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction: It doesn't take long to grow locks.
</P>
<P>
   Fact:Hair can take up to a year to completely lock.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction: All locks are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Locks are unique to the individual.
</P>
<P>
   _ STAGES OF LOCKING
</P>
<P>
   Hairlocking takes patience, patience, patience. It can take up
to two years to get mature locks. Here are the stages of the
process:
</P>
<P>
   BABY: In this initial stage, the coiled hair will be
finger-twisted, palm-rolled, braided or two-strand twisted down to
the scalp.
</P>
<P>
   TEEN: The hair begins to lock and is somewhat unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ADULT: The locked hair will become dense as the hair coils
continue to wrap around themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ELDER: The locked hair becomes longer and more consistent in its
growing pattern. You lock mah-velous! A gallery of famous faces

<P>
   A matter of methods
</P>
<P>
   You think you're ready to lock your hair? Well, not so fast:
First you have to decide on a hairlocking method. You may want to
use a water-soluble holding agent, such as a gel or
lanolin-based-product, to help the hair lock but try to avoid using
beeswax. Palm-rolling. You need at least three inches of hair to do
this technique and it works best on hair that has a tight-curl
pattern. After you divide the hair into half-inch sections, apply
spray of water and a little bit of holding agent, gently roll the
hair strands between your palms. It's best to start at the neckline
and work forward. Finger-twisting. You follow the same directions
as for palm-rolling, only you use your fingertips to gently twist
the hair in clockwise or counterclockwise cylinders. Two-strand
twists. If your hair is longer than three inches, soft or has a
hair pattern between wavy and curly, this technique might work best
for you. Take a half-inch or an inch of hair, apply a spritz of
water, a bit of holding agent and then separate the hair into two
strands and twist them in a rope-like formation. The ends should
coil around themselves. It's best to start at the neckline and work
forward. Braiding. This three-hair strand technique can be used by
any coiled hair texture. Sisterlocks : This is a trademarked
``microlocking'' technique that must be done by a certified
consultant. The method allows people with chemically relaxed hair
to start the hairlocking process with just their new growth and no
holding agents are needed. How to maintain your new 'do
</P>
<P>
   Locked hair is not a maintenance-free hairstyle. Here are some
tips to maintain the 'do:
</P>
<P>
   If you're just starting to lock, your head is probably itching.
That's the dry scalp and hair talking back to you. The relief most
lockticians recommend is to apply an antiseptic to the scalp with a
cotton swab. It should be done on a regular basis. Try Dudley's
Scalp and Skin Antiseptic Conditioner ($5.49), witch hazel or
essential oils, such as rosemary, nettle, jojoba, avocado or sweet
almond. The antiseptic products are also good scalp cleansers
between shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Try to avoid petroleum-based products and beeswax because they
are very difficult to wash out, clog pores and the build-up can
result in white flaky residue in your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Locked hair is dense hair and every effort should be made to
keep the locks moisturized so they won't become dry, brittle and
break off. Properly moisturized locks will have a fine-suedelike
sheen. Several lockticians recommend Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer
($8.95), which can be applied daily to the locks. Also, you should
have regular hot oil and deep conditioning treatments; locked hair
loves these. And for those who want a more natural moisturizer, try
evening primrose oil or try this: a coconut milk rinse. It involves
mixing one part coconut milk with three parts water and letting it
sit in the hair for 20 minutes, then thoroughly washing it out.
</P>
<P>
   Since your hair will continue to grow, you can cultivate your
locks by applying a bit (small amounts) of gel or a lanolin-based
product, such as Princess Kayla's Natty Lock Maintenance Cream
($9.99), to the new hair growth and gently finger-twist or
palm-roll into the lock. Or you can use your fingers to backwardly
thread the new growth. This technique is done by moving the tip of
the lock through a very small section of new hair at a time until
you get down to the hair root.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor is false. Locked hair is regularly washed. Lockticians
have their personal favorite cleansing agents, among them are
clarifying shampoos, peppermint soap or tea tree shampoos. For
those with new locks that tend to become unraveled, try using a
nylon stocking cap to rinse your hair. For those with long locks,
it may be easier to wash your hair if you divide it in three or
four sections and concentrate cleaning a section at a time. You
must rinse thoroughly. If you don't, shampoo residue will leave
white flakes in your hair. After shampooing, you should use a
conditioner and a plant- or vegetable-based scalp oil to keep the
scalp lubricated and the locks supple.
</P>
<P>
   A final note: Hairlocking doesn't mean never seeing a hair-care
professional again. Every three months or so, you should make an
appointment with a locktician or another professional who
specializes in African American natural hair care. You're going for
a good professional shampoo, a deep conditioning (hot oil)
treatment, a hair and scalp check and maybe some professional lock
tightening. Alternative hairstyles
</P>
<P>
   Some people aren't sure if they want their hair locked, and if
you're in that group, here are your alternatives _ lock extensions.
These techniques should be done by hair-care professionals. Silky
Locks This is an American version of an African thread wrapping
method. Braided hair is wrapped with synthetic hair or a single-ply
yarn from the root to the tip and then the ends are burned to seal
them. If synthetic hair is used, the results will have a
distinctive shine. If yarn is used, the hairdo will have a matte
finish. Lock Fusion This involves attaching (with bond glue or wax)
Afro hair extensions directly to braided or twisted hair. The
extensions should be frizzed up before it is bonded to the real
hair. Sources

 &HT;    A building of a Skin-Art Empire
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 11 a.m. company meeting could be anywhere:
IBM, Tracor, H-E-B, Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of corporate protocol, batch numbers and of how to
handle computer inventory sheets. At the point usually reserved for
a customer service lecture, you realize this is nowhere close to a
high-tech firm and strides away from any retail sales meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't make no difference if you're the baddest tattoo
artist in town,'' a tough looking, multiple-pierced and tattooed
man is saying. This is Gary ``Jazz'' Hodges, corporate executive of
Carnival Productions and general manager of Capitol City Tattoo,
one of five tattoo parlors owned by the corporation. ``You have to
be good at business and handling the customer,'' he continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like rock stars,'' reasons Tom Keating, Carnival's
51-year-old corporate general manager. A tuft of gray hair sits on
his chin, daring you to make fun of it. He sports 21 tattoos and
nine piercings (``Three you can't see because there's one through
my tongue and then there's one through each of my nipples.'') ``If
you don't have a clientele of loyal customers, you don't have
anything. The customer brings you the money and you bringing in the
money keeps you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Carnival Productions' apprenticeship program: a
program designed to turn self-described overindulging, starving
artists into self-sustaining tattooists and master piercers. The
drug-free, alcohol-free program takes two years and promises to
teach each and every one of the students now sitting in their
chairs _ most tattooed, pierced and all looking somewhat ominous _
the way to do their trade well and make money while doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't charity. It's not some city-subsidized program,
nor is it a United Way initiative to get kids off the street. Quite
the contrary. These 27 men and women are paying $5,000 apiece to
learn a trade that offers $70,000 a year entry-level postitions.
The program is pure business and a small part of a mounting skin
art empire that Jazz, Tom and the rest of the folks involved in
Carnival Productions are hoping to ride to uncountable wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The company's business manifesto might read like this: If
Carnival Productions can train enough tattooists, open up a large
enough number of shops and, for marketing purposes, involve itself
in a number of related endeavors, including magazine and Internet
ventures, it can take over the tattoo industry. In the words of
Carnival Production's co-founder, Mike Burford, we'll ``clean it
up, sanitize and legitimize an industry once run by bikers, addicts
and fly-by-night `scratchers' (illegal tattooists).'' Once they
establish themselves, they plan to franchise. Blow it out
nationwide and create the new sparkling standard of the politically
correct tattoo parlor. The kind of shop anyone with a couple
hundred bucks in his hand would feel comfortable walking into.
</P>
<P>
   Their competitors don't have as rosy an outlook about what
Carnival is doing. They see Carnival as a hostile corporation
trying to tame an untamed industry. A company trying to suck the
art out of tattooing, leaving raw commercialism. They see Carnival
as a company with plans of taking a cookie-cutter to tattoo parlors
and stamping them out like mega-chain stores across America while
running their competition out of business. In their minds, Carnival
wants to commercialize and degrade the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, both Carnival and their detractors
agree on one thing: both see Carnival's ultimate goal as becoming
the McDonald's of tattoo shops, the Wal-Mart of piercing bazaars.
</P>
<P>
   Back in class, the customer service portion ends and the class
divides into two groups. The apprentice tattooists like Gayle
Austin, a tattoo of a knife dripping blood on the inside of her
arm, and David Voegeli, in a spiked black leather jacket, go with
the ``Notorious'' Ed Potter, a biker gang veteran, master tattoo
artist and class teacher. Potter immediately grabs a tattoo
machine, starts it buzzing and preaches in a deep South twang that
``losing a customer's confidence is like a snowball rolling down a
hill . . . to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the class goes with Chris Bowman, the master
piercist, to a small room with a dentist's chair and an assortment
of needles that would make a phlebotomist cringe. Bowman explains
the procedure, hands a needle to apprentice Charlie ``Socks''
Studer and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we're going to do eyebrows,'' says Chris.
</P>
<P>
   THE TATTOO TNDUSTRY'S DONALD AND IVANA
</P>
<P>
   While the apprenticeship program gives a glimpse at the ultimate
goals of Carnival Productions, to get the full view of their
planned global domination of the tattoo industry, you have to go to
Dripping Springs. There, in a small office in the back of a modest
ranch style home, resides Carnival Productions' corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced here are the two masterminds behind the company's
grandiose plans, Mike Burford and his wife Cindy. Dressed in black,
and handsome in a biker chic kind of way, they could be poster
children for a sequel to ``Easy Rider.'' Mike's glare is especially
intimidating, eliciting a fight-or-flight response from onlookers
that most often results in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the talk of marketing, profit margins and long-range
business plans, it's only the small cues that tell you where you
are, and the fact that these two people are running in a crowd
where business is better done from the back of a motorcycle than in
a boardroom. Some of the more obvious red flags are the two Harleys
in the garage, the copies of Outlaw Biker magazine lying on the
desk and the two rifles propped in the corner. For recreation, the
couple has a penchant for using the corporate headquarters as a
deer blind. This season, both Mike and Cindy have claimed two eight
pointers that meandered into their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we own Capitol City Tattoo, two Exotic Piercings
tattoo and piercing boutiques, Notorious Ed's Tattoo, Singapore
John's and a traveling semi, The Traveling Body Art Extravaganza,''
says Cindy. ``We also have 23 Web sites, are in the process of
acquiring three publications and opening a series of biker retail
outlets. Our plans are for all these things to work together. Right
now, tattooing and piercing is considered taboo and more people
than ever want to be `taboo,' so we've found a way to capitalize on
it. We will use all of this to market it in such a way to be
attractive to any and all consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy, with a degree in business administration from the
University of Tennessee, basically runs the marketing and retail
side of the business. As she speaks, Mike cocks his head to the
side like a curious cardinal and glows in admiration. It is the
only time he loses his threatening look.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we entered the tattoo business, it was totally closed, an
underground industry,'' Cindy continues. ``We were constantly
threatened. In fact, when we opened our first shop, our competitors
said `Get the hell out of town!', so we took it to mean `Welcome to
town!', so we opened another shop. When they said `We're going to
kill you!', we took it to mean `Killer!', so we opened another
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   This cycle of intimidation, which included receiving pictures of
dead animals, threatening phone calls and the smashing of windows
and light fixtures, continues, even though the corporation now owns
five stores and posted combined sales of more than $1.5 million.
Now they're threatening their competition _ not with vandalism but
by pummeling their rivals on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   With Cindy tending to the business side of things, Mike handles
the day-to-day operations, a job he's uniquely qualified for.
</P>
<P>
   Mike was raised in a carnival sideshow owned by his father. At
the age of 5, he stupefied audiences as Prince Michael the ``sword
swallowing wonder'' of the freak show. By the time he had reached
his teens, Mike was his father's ``enforcer,'' physically ejecting
carnival midway ne'er-do-wells.
</P>
<P>
   After a short stint in the army, he drifted into motorcycle
gangs and drug dealing. He earned multiple club affiliations,
including Hell's Angels and the Banditos, and during his wilder
days, was shot three times and stabbed twice.
</P>
<P>
   It was after meeting Cindy (she was 17, he was 30) and deciding
he couldn't deal with the constant violence of drug dealing, that
he decided to go straight. He accompanied Cindy to the University
of Tennessee as she got her degree, where he worked for the local
power company. They returned four years later, and opened their
first tattoo shop. Though Burford was not a tattoo artist, he felt
he knew enough about tattoos to open a shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, the business practices that made my father
successful in the carnival and made me successful at drug dealing
are the ones I still use in business everyday,'' Mike says. ``I've
just taken the legitimate, hard-working ideals and made them work
in a legitimate situation. I mean, it's all business.''
</P>
<P>
   BARBARIANS AT THE GATE
</P>
<P>
   `That's my first problem with Burford _ he's not even a tattoo
artist. He's a carnie,'' says Steve Sailors, owner of Tattoos From
the Soul. The shop is a rival parlor five blocks from Capitol City
Tattoo on Sixth. ``His attitude is like all the other carnies. They
have no respect for the industry. Like they all have this attitude
of `Let's get the money from these people and get the hell out of
Dodge.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's Saturday night and Sailors' shop is cranking. People, some
sober, most not, walk in and gaze at the wall of designs or sign up
to be pierced. Tattoo artists approach customers and negotiate
prices of anywhere from $50 for a flower to $175 for a buff Marine
Corps bulldog. In the chairs behind a partition, two men are being
tattooed. Buzzing machines paint the skin with lightning fast
needles. One man's tricep is the canvas for an image of the country
of Africa; another man's shoulder gets a ``Hook 'em Horns'' wrapped
around the image of a longhorn. The two try to hold their composure
as the semi-painful ritual continues.
</P>
<P>
   The place looks and feels like a novice would imagine a tattoo
parlor to look. Seedy, but clean. Fluorescent lights and cheap
vinyl couches for the tattoo and piercing victims to wait. Everyone
looks stylishly tired and strung out. The smell of ink and sweat
are heavy. Tattoos From the Soul could easily be the set for a
music video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burford has bastardized the industry, given it a black eye,''
Sailors continues. ``He's flooding the market with bad artists from
his apprentice program with the hopes of putting a tattoo shop on
every corner. To him, it's not about the art; it's about the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors doesn't doubt that Burford has been intimidated or
threatened. He reveals that Burford is hated in the tattoo
community because he doesn't tattoo, nor does he have a love or
respect for the industry. Burford, adds Sailors, isn't exactly the
shining knight to the tattoo industry he claims to be and carries
on intimidation tactics of his own. He says Burford repeatedly
calls the health department on other shops and has sent his people
to hand out Capitol City flyers in front of Tattoos from the Soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good,'' says Sailors. ``He's totally ruining the
tattoo industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You show me one of my people passing out flyers in front of
another store and I'll close down every one of my shops,'' retorts
Burford. ``As far as calling the health department, you bet I do.
If I got to play by the rules, everyone does. If I hear of a
scratcher, heck yeah, I'll call the health department. People think
I don't belong, people hate me because I don't tattoo. Because I
don't tattoo, do I not belong? I don't think so. I want to clean up
this industry. I give classes every week, I exercise the highest
standards. I want to see one shop step up to the plate like we
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I about the money?'' he continues, working himself into a
quaking frenzy. ``You bet I am! I'm about the money for my artists,
I'm about the money for my company. Sure I'm aggressive, but I'm
aggressive in a professional, legal way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tattooists agree with Sailors _ some fear Burford's wrath
and speak only off the record _ and find Burford to be a ``pock
mark'' on the industry. They claim he has broken the unwritten
tattoo code of pursuing art and camaraderie, and is instead
attempting to upend his competition and ruin the tattoo industry
for the sake of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Burford is a pock mark the same way as Bill Gates or Donald
Trump when they were getting started in their respective
industries. Burford and Carnival Productions have brought
competitive business practices to a place where they never existed.
Now, the tattoo industry is forced to deal with the same pressures
real estate and software competitors had to deal with when Trump
and Gates stormed onto the scene. It's a situation none of the
other tattoo artists have been in. A situation that has every
tattoo artist in town ready with an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me; I'll keep doing what I'm doing,'' says
Chris Trevino from his Perfection Tattoo shop. ``But the fact is,
Burford doesn't tattoo and he doesn't love tattoos.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Austin tattoo artists consider Trevino to be the top
tattooist in Austin; he's often listed as one of the best in the
world in tattoo publications. His opinion is widely respected _ by
Burford and the other tattoo artists alike.
</P>
<P>
   While Trevino's had no problems with Carnival Production, his
love for his art colors his view of Burford. ``Unfortunately, he's
looking for the money and that cheapens it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TATTOO GAP
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from Sailor's shop, in front of Capitol City
Tattoo, David Voegeli hands out flyers with fervor. Apparently,
part of the apprentice program is learning how to market through
the passing out of flyers. A group of girls takes one of the hot
pink pieces of paper and heads into the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Up a flight of stairs, above Ivory Cats on Sixth Street, Capitol
City Tattoo looks a lot like a Gap store might look if it sold
piercings and tattoos. The floor is black-and-white checked and art
lines the walls, organized by flora, fauna, etc. It is sparkling
clean and smells sterile. Price stickers are affixed by each image.
</P>
<P>
   As the girls with the flyer peruse the images, Jazz heads out to
the floor. He uses the same sales tactics as an Ann Taylor
salesgirl trying to persuade a customer to buy the more expensive
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flower looks good, but for $25 more you can get that
daisy,'' he says . ``The daisy is fine!''
</P>
<P>
   At the register, Chris is signing Jason Brunet up for an $88
scrotum piercing. He is a private first class at Fort Hood who
swears he has only had one shot of tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place,'' says Brunet before going into the room.
``There are good people here who talk to you, make you feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the store, the tattoo chairs sit behind the
register in a salon-like setting. There, apprentice Gayle Austin
readies Jazz's customer for her daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked this place because it was the cleanest,'' says Leslie
Leal, 20. ``At least it was the cleanest I've seen on Sixth
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you'll see why the competition is scared of us,'' says
Notorious Ed as he supervises Austin. ``It's our apprentices,
especially the talented ones like Gayle, who make this place the
best in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin sets the buzzing needle to Leal's ankle and goes to work.
</P>
<P>
   TATTOO OR PERISH
</P>
<P>
   Cindy says this is just the beginning. The beginning of a tattoo
and piercing empire that will stretch across both coasts, have a
presence on the Internet and continue onto newsstands worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   After their acquisition of the magazines, Carnival is planning
to open two more shops in Austin this year. Simultaneously, they
will concentrate on the electronic commerce end of their business.
Carnival has hired a full-time Web master who will consolidate and
configure their new site. Other plans include the opening of two
more shops in College Station and test marketing high-end Exotic
Piercing boutiques in malls.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy, Carnival expects 1999 sales to top $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping to do is to take this industry to the next
level,'' she says. ``We want to set a standard like Wal-Mart or
Toni and Guy. Clean, dependable and run by trained professionals.
Go ahead and tell our competitors, we're here to stay. We're not
going anywhere. Live up to our standards or go under.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MCDONALD'S OF SKIN ART
</P>
<P>
   Mike attends an apprentice class in late January to give yet
another lecture on salesmanship. A videocamera he placed in the
Capitol City store one Saturday to monitor employees has revealed
unsettling results _ ranging from overlooked shoplifting to missed
customers. He is not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something, this type of thing will not happen
here. This is over,'' he says sternly. ``You need to check
yourself, check your personality, because if we do this right, we
will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike knows his empire can't proceed without his troops in order.
He knows McDonald's didn't get as big as they did with a group of
lackadaisical employees who didn't hunger for success. He wants men
and women who want it as bad as he does. He wants people that, for
better or worse, will march to his drumbeat, help him take over and
bring about a new age in the tattoo industry. An age where there is
a tattoo on every bicep and a piece of jewelry dangling from every
ear lobe, navel and septum.
</P>
<P>
   After class, a tall skinny kid comes in off the street, art
portfolio in hand. He doesn't have the $5,000 for the apprentice
program, but says he wants to be a tattoo artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to let me show you how to make money? Because
I'm going to show you how to make money,'' Mike says, doing his
best Anthony Robbins as he sizes the kid up. ``No drugs, no
alcohol. I'm not dealing with any dopeheads. You work hard, treat
people with dignity and respect, and you'll never have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Burford sees something in the kid's eyes and decides to give him
a chance. Another soldier, another brick on the foundation. One
more step on the road to the building of an empire.

   WINTERBLUES _ When winter arrives, so do the blues. Many people
suffer from various degrees of Seasonal Affective Disorder,
depression caused by the shorter days and lack of sunshine during
winter months. We examine natural/alternative products and methods
to combat the problem. (Henry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FAMILYPLANNING _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ When Deya Stavinoha's husband
first suggested they use natural family planning as birth control,
she was very skeptical. It was soon after Stavinoha, who is
Presbyterian, had married her husband, Jerome, who is Catholic. He
finally persuaded her to attend a natural family planning class.

   SUPER-CHAPLAIN _ Former Dallas Cowboy Charles Collins, 52, is
the soul man of the Super Bowl-bound Atlanta Falcons. Since 1983,
Collins has been chaplain to the Falcons. He understands football
since he played at Campbell High School in Smyrna, Auburn
University, Dallas and two teams in the Canadian league before
coaching 7 years at McEachern High School. He attributes his own
faith to a Jesus freak brother-in-law and a locker room Bible study
in Saskatchewan. He's seen the Falcons through plenty of bad times.

   PROLIFE-FLAGS _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ Rex and Georgie Willcox have
taken a pro-life stand, and they're not afraid to let their
neighbors know it. Their Longview home bears a banner that simply
and unashamedly reads, ``I Choose Life.'' But what's unusual is
that the flag carries an original design drawn up by Rex. It shows
a baby in the womb, surrounded by heart-shaped concentric circles
of different colors that represent racial diversity, and a flag of
the United States. (Galiano, Longview News-Journal). WITH PHOTOS.

   JEWS-SABBATH _ From a distance, they look like ordinary utility
wires, but three Atlanta area synagogues now have ritual enclosures
that allow traditional Jews to carry items from their homes to the
synagogue on sabbaths and holidays. Strict sabbath observers may
not carry even a key or a package of Kleenex on the sabbath. But
the cord that is strung around the Toco Hill neighborhood Beth
Jacob synagogues makes a two-mile area symbolically part of the
synagogue. We look at why the synagogues go to the trouble and
expense _ about $10,000 a year _ of maintaining the cords and what
impact they have on the community. (GWhite, Atlanta

   CONDO-DWELLER _ Condo dwellers don't always have to move when
they want more space. Sometimes, it's just a matter of going up,
Herb Brito says. The Atlanta interior designer should know. He's
designed several two-story condo renovations for owners who want
the amenities of highrise living and the space of a two-story home
in the burbs. His own unit in Atlanta is a case in point. The
contemporary setting serves not only as his home and showcase for
art but also office space for his business which has its own
entance. The setup evolved from a lifestyle change Brito made
several years ago. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

   MAY-COLUMN _ You just never know where you'll find your next
gardening adventure _ as Gerrie McCue can tell you. In her letter
from Gwinnett County, she recounts how she turned a turnip into a
potted plant: ``In a long-delayed refrigerator cleaning, I found a
small white turnip that had retreated to a far corner of the
vegetable drawer. I looked at the growth it had been secretly
putting out. I could not throw it away because it was a living

(part Cherokee, ex-Green Beret) is a plant medicine man. At a time
when natural healing enjoys rising popularity tinged with
controversy over whether it's science or charlatanism,
Squierasserts that there's nothing elusive about a good supply of
healing plants: ``If you have a yard big enough to mow, you
probably have a dozen plants you could use for medicine, or food,
or both.'' (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

achievement, it swung the national spotlight onto this troupe and
its sprawling parent arts complex that sells a million tickets a
year in a city of 2 million and is credited for revitalizing
downtown. The secret: a seemingly bottomless endowment from the

Southern Women, Donald Seawell, the aristocratic 86-year-old

Rocky Mountain regioon would be culturally poorer for it. (Hulbert,

 &HT;    Been to the zoo lately? You might recognize primate behavior at
sports events
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Miami University professor William McGrew
settles in to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, he'll notice
something vaguely familiar in the chest-thumping, pummeling and
embracing that teammates engage in during moments of great joy and
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   McGrew, a native of Scotland who has written or edited five
books and published 200 articles about primates, sees almost
identical forms of physical contact among the chimpanzees he
studies in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's striking,'' McGrew said of the similar behaviors between
chimpanzees in the wild _ where winning bands of chimps can seize
territory from losing bands _ and humans playing football, soccer,
rugby and other contact team sports that hinge on sudden,
emotion-charged events such as touchdowns or goals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the exuberance both species display when
celebrating a territorial victory or touchdown, McGrew said both
chimpanzees and humans react similarly to failure or sorrow _such
as when a quarterback overthrows a wide-open receiver in the end
zone, then retreats to the far end of the bench to hold his head in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see his teammates coming by, and sometimes all they do is
touch him. It's a consolation thing, and it's very chimpy,'' McGrew
said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrew, professor of anthropology and zoology, has worked since
1972 in tropical Africa studying monkeys and apes, particularly
chimpanzees. His work recently earned him a $10,000 prize from the
Belgium-based Jean-Marie Delwart Foundation, which provides money
for the study of animal behavior, communication and culture.
</P>
<P>
   McGrew and many of his colleagues in anthropology and zoology
believe that by studying primates, humans can gain insights about
our own behavior _ both on an off the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying humans are chimps or apes are us,'' McGrew
said. But the striking similarities in behaviors strongly suggest
that human and chimps ``had a common ancestor from whom those
behaviors may have originated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Place, head football coach at Chaminade-Julienne High
School, said football coaches do, to some extent, encourage players
to ``revert to their basic instincts'' while they're on the
football field. But the players must be able to turn off their
aggression as soon as the whistle blows and when the game ends,
Place said.

<P>
   Jim Place, head football coach at Chaminade-Julienne High
School, said football coaches do, to some extent, encourage players
to ``revert to their basic instincts'' while they're on the
football field. But the players must be able to turn off their
aggression as soon as the whistle blows and when the game ends,
Place said.

 &HT;    The professor and his remembrance of things past
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A visit with Artine Artinian begins with
a question, the first of many he will ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you allergic to heads?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sly, old professor's way. He catches you off balance
and keeps you that way.
</P>
<P>
   Heads?
</P>
<P>
   The path traced by his pipe stem clears up the mystery as he
leads the way into his sunny Palm Beach penthouse. Heads are
everywhere along the walls, paintings wonderful and weird. Famous
people, beautiful people, ugly people.
</P>
<P>
   The pipe stem picks one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 20 when he painted this self-portrait to pay the rent.
He was Jewish, and he had to leave France before the Germans got
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no time for a guess before the professor is across the
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he is in costume as the world's most famous mime. You
recognize him? Marcel Marceau, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   No time to nod. The tour is at full pace, the questions at full
force. It may be coincidence, or a sense of theatrics sharpened by
so many years at the lectern, but Artinian turns and pauses with
his back to the picture window so that he is fully framed. The
light glows through his white, gravity-defying hair. His green
pants are flecked with pipe burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe I just turned 91?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time to respond that his voice and grip are too
strong, his ideas and wit too sharp. He immediately supplies his
own answer: ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't wonder where the years went. He knows, and he is
eager to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Artine Artinian's life waits only for the strike of
another match; the pipe bowl may be the engine of his remarkable
memory, refired with each episode.
</P>
<P>
   The first of many surprises is that English was the sixth of his
seven languages. He was born in 1907 to a family of Armenians in
Bulgaria, where Turkish was the most common tongue. He also studied
in French and Hebrew schools before his father, Peter, decided the
family should follow relatives to Attleboro, Mass., in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor guy was 50 at the time, and he had no skills to
apply,'' Artinian says. ``He worked at a fruit stand. He did odd
jobs. Mostly, he worried about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Artine had no choice but to work. He became a bootblack at
one of the two shoeshine parlors in Attleboro. His brother worked
at the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked 40 to 45 hours a week, after school, all day
Saturday, half a day Sunday,'' Artinian says. It was hard, dirty,
thrilling work, an immigrant boy's chance to absorb the language
and stories of a new place. He recalls not a single unkind or
discouraging word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood out as foreigners in that town, but we were
accepted,'' he says. ``That set the pattern for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, he was president of his high school class.
In four more, he was off to Bowdoin College in Maine thanks to a
scholarship and help from some good people in Attleboro, including
the mayor. He followed college with a year in France on a graduate
fellowship, earning a diploma from the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he discovered his life's passion and field of
honors: French literature. That passion propelled him him through a
master's degree at Harvard and a Ph.D. at Columbia, where he found
his other great love.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was studying Flaubert and I was studying Maupassant, so we
were a natural pair,'' he says. Artine Artinian and Margaret
Willard Woodbridge met in the school library. They were married
June 27, 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still around, still putting up with me after 62 years,''
he says, calling out the name everyone knows her by. ``Teddy?
Teddy?''
</P>
<P>
   He finds her resting in another room, but she graciously agrees
to spend a few minutes sorting through their years together: three
children, so many trips abroad, so many wonderful and brilliant
companions.
</P>
<P>
   She is a serene beauty of 88, with short, schoolgirl's hair and
a soft, cultured voice. ``Teddy's from an old New England family,''
her husband says. ``I wanted to marry a WASP to improve my
English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonsense,'' she says. ``His English was already perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been correcting me for years,'' he goes on. ``I expect
to be a widower one day and marry a much younger woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to surprise him,'' she insists. ``I'll outlive
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Teddy excuses herself and leaves the professor to continue. He
explains that they settled into teaching careers at Bard College,
then an affiliate of Columbia just up the Hudson River that
attracted many of the prominent writers.
</P>
<P>
   Among his colleagues and friends over the years were Mary
McCarthy, Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison. Gore Vidal lived and wrote
within walking distance of their door.
</P>
<P>
   Although the atmosphere in New York was stimulating, Artine was
determined to explore more of France each summer and during
sabbaticals. He took temporary teaching jobs, applied for grants
and won fellowships, including a Fulbright. Everywhere he went, he
searched for manuscripts and drawings or paintings by French
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know many people, especially dealers,'' he says. ``I
found out I was a good trader.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadily, he amassed an extraordinary collection. Occasionally,
he found something so important he had to announce it to the world.
The professor reaches into a brown-leather case that he keeps
ever-near and produces a clipping with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ```First Proust Manuscript Discovered','' reads the
Herald-Tribune headline, datelined Paris, Aug. 13, 1960. The story
details the discovery by Dr. Artine Artinian, chairman of the
languages and literature department at Bard College, of Marcel
Proust's first attempt to become published.
</P>
<P>
   The story does not explain that the manuscript was acquired
through one of Artinian's cagier trades. The dealer didn't realize
the significance of the unknown Proust work when he exchanged it
for a less-valuable manuscript by another writer.
</P>
<P>
   Artinian proved himself to be much more than a clever pack rat.
His collections contributed greatly to the five books he wrote or
edited about the works of short-story master Guy de Maupassant.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most important achievements, Artinian discovered that
the standard edition of the author's works was incomplete, missing
102 stories while mistakenly including dozens written by other
authors. Artinian's ``The Complete Short Stories of Guy de
Maupassant'' was published in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Artinian retired in 1964 after confirming his most important
discovery, that his collections were worth a bundle. He sold his
Maupassant manuscripts, others by such writers as Victor Hugo, plus
350 paintings by French writers to the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight, I went from poor teacher to capitalist,'' he says.
``Not bad, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   The sale hardly left him literature- or art-poor. Every room,
wall, corner, and closet of the apartment the Artinians settled
into 27 years ago is crowded with the rest. With another strike of
the match, the professor resumes the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my workroom,'' he says of a study almost evenly
divided between books and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The art represents one of the several categories Artinian may
have been the first to find interesting: portraits signed by both
the painter and the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found this in New York in 1943 and I was fascinated by the
double signature,'' he says, pointing out a dour painting of German
writer Thomas Mann. ``I couldn't help looking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   He has found 119 over the years. Faces along the wall include
pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski, Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore.
</P>
<P>
   Another wall and tall stack represent yet another Artinian
subspecialty: self-portraits by famous people. He quickly produces
Jules Verne and then, more startling, Tojo, the Japanese dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sketched this in prison just before he was executed,''
Artinian explains.
</P>
<P>
   How did he get it? ``It was given to me by a curator, who is a
friend,'' he explains. He is hard-pressed to think of anyone who
isn't. He has been making friends out of strangers since his days
at the Attleboro shoeshine parlor, jumping into conversations,
never afraid to suggest a trade.
</P>
<P>
   One offer he makes to artists famous and unknown alike is a
sketch from his collection by French writers in exchange for a
self-portrait. He figures 900 artists have taken him up so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has donated 350 by artists from this state to Florida
Atlantic University over the years, and an equal number by North
Carolina artists to Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C.,
which has displaced Paris as the Artinians' favorite summer haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the book half of the room, Artinian gestures toward a
stack that reaches the ceiling. ``Pick out any book,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradigms Lost'' by John Simon seems one of the less
challenging to dislodge. ``To Artine,'' an inscription begins, as,
it turns out, do inscriptions in most of the others. Every book in
the stack of about 1,100 is signed by the author, and most
acknowledge the owner.
</P>
<P>
   The professor is most eager to show off ``The Best Man'' by his
old neighbor, Vidal: ``For Artine Artinian, who may well
(unknowingly) have been father to Dr. Artinian in these pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the play's cast of characters includes a
psychiatrist named Dr. Artinian. Such allusion, perhaps even
homage, turns out to be a common occurrence among the writers and
artists he has known.
</P>
<P>
   His own visage through the years is displayed once along the
walls, and on a pedestal. He recalls that Mary McCarthy disguised
him only mildly in ``The Groves of Academe.'' And just last year,
the mail brought an adventure novel by a German writer he'd met one
afternoon while having coffee at The Breakers. For years, the hotel
has been the professor's favorite spot for afternoon coffee, an
evening cigar and impromptu conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm featured on 12 pages,'' Artinian exclaims as he offers a
copy of Null Uhr Managua.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't speak German, but a passage in English describes a
character in Palm Beach named Antonios Apostolakis, a retired
professor with a doctorate from Harvard who lives in a penthouse.
He even has Artinian's address and apartment number.
</P>
<P>
   What do writers and artists find so engaging about this very
modestly dressed man with a cane that he hardly seems to need and
thick-rimmed glasses that he certainly does?
</P>
<P>
   The professor who has kept his guest off balance for so long
suddenly finds the roles reversed. He steps back, striking
furiously at several matches before getting his pipe going again.
Then he laughs loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your question bewilders me,'' he says. It also sets him to
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be the name,'' he says. ``Something about the
repetition of sounds. Maybe the initials.''
</P>
<P>
   He puffs and considers the meaning of ``Artine,'' a variation on
the Armenian word for resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, A.A. is really not appropriate because I've never
been able to drink,'' he says. ``Perhaps I should be an archbishop.
Archbishop Artine Artinian. Then I'll be A.A.A.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs again, then dashes into the hallway. The archbishop of
arts and letters resumes the tour, his smoldering censer pointing
the way.

BANISHING THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year has barely begun and yet I'm ready to scream if I hear
the word ``millennium'' one more time.
</P>
<P>
   This portends a lot of screaming, needless to say, accompanied
by a great wailing and gnashing of teeth every time I hear or read
the acronym ``Y2K'' between now and the start of the next
thousand-year cycle, the name for which escapes me at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   While there is not, to my knowledge, any (legal) way to rid the
language of annoying words, terms, acronyms or phrases, the good
folks at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
are doing what they can. Every year since 1976 they have compiled
Word Banishment Lists, which, taken together, form the List of
Words Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and
General Uselessness.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as you might guess, quite a long list.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to see that this year's list includes ``Y2K,'' which
John Charles Robbins, a columnist for the Petoskey (Mich.) News
Review, suggested be banished until Y3K, if not later.
</P>
<P>
   (I was rather surprised that ``millennium'' did not make the
list. Perhaps the soporific effects of the word have hypnotized the
list-makers into a thousand-year trance or perhaps they were just
snowed in and couldn't make it to the office.)
</P>
<P>
   Another acronym that's not popular at Lake Superior State
University is ``SUV,'' which is short for sport utility vehicle,
though if you've ever been tailgated or cut off by one of these
hulking gas-guzzlers, you probably know them by a different name.
</P>
<P>
   They are also campaigning at LSSU to rid the language of the
``-gate'' construction, as in ``Monica-gate,'' ``Zipper-gate,''
``It Depends on What Your Definition of Is Is-gate,'' etc. This is
a noble cause, and I support it, though I worry about the job
security of late-night comedians if this construction were ever
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have no qualms about doing away with the term
``courtesy call.'' As Al Schut of Muskegon, Mich., points out:
Since when did an unsolicited call become a courtesy call? You want
to be really courteous? Then don't call!
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper business, there are lots of words and terms
that should be banished, but it's probably not worth trying because
they'll just be replaced by something even more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   An example that comes immediately to mind is ``a sense of
urgency.'' This phrase is usually trotted out by newsroom managers
to prod the troops into working harder and faster (for the same
pay, of course, and without accruing any overtime). There has never
been an instance, to my knowledge, where a newsroom manager berated
a person or group for having too much of a sense of urgency; it is
always for failing to have enough. The effect this phrase has on
staffers, of course, is to make them want to flee the meeting as
urgently as possible. Which is OK, because the newsroom manager can
report to his superior that he instilled a sense of urgency in the
troops and not, technically, be lying.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoying phrase that is more common in the world of
sports than in newsrooms (we're too busy urgently sensing) is
``giving 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A player who merely gives 100 percent comes off looking pretty
bad when compared to a player who gives 110 percent or, better yet,
120 percent. Players who give more than 100 percent undoubtedly
have a highly refined sense of urgency, which could account for
their success.
</P>
<P>
   Some other words that made it on the LSSU banishment list:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``armed gunman'' - Does that mean there's such a thing as an
unarmed gunman?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``close proximity'' - I suppose that makes more sense than
distant proximity, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``end result'' - As opposed to beginning results. Or
something.
</P>
<P>

Fla.)

   IVANGOROD, Russia _ The grass wasn't always greener on the other
side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is, and with Russia's economy in peril many residents
of this depressed border town dream of seceding to become part of
the neighboring Baltic republic of Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Ivangorod look across the border -- the Narva
River -- with envy at Narva in Estonia, a sister city that was an
equal when the Soviet empire encompassed them both.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, they shared water, sewer and public transit
systems. Moreover, they endured the common monotony and meagerness
of life under the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   Now eight years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the
economy of independent Estonia is blossoming and Narva with it,
while Russia and Ivangorod are in the throes of yet another
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Those fortunate enough to reside in Narva in 1991 received
Estonian passports and over the years became the haves. The
residents of Ivangorod on the Russian side are the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an instant I'd give up my Russian citizenship with
pleasure,'' said Valery Fyodorov, 48, who earns 950 rubles a month
as a construction worker -- the equivalent of about US$42 since the
ruble collapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister lives in Narva and I know life is better there. The
city is more prosperous. It is cleaner. There are jobs. It is
apparent that the people live like Westerners,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivangorod last year, local activist Yuri Gordeyev circulated
a petition calling on the town and its 12,000 inhabitants to secede
from Russia and join tiny but successful Estonia. Russian officials
ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   It was, he concedes, a futile effort pursued more as a moral
protest than a realistic mission. He gathered 502 signatures and
suspects more would join him now since Ivangorod is suffering
winter's sub-zero temperatures with no hot water and periodically
no cold water either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the mayor that if conditions here don't improve 99
percent of the population of Ivangorod would be willing to give up
citizenship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Ivangorod is 35 percent, and those who do work
seldom are paid on time. Nearly half the town's population are
pensioners, each of whom collect the equivalent of only about US$20
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river in Narva (population 74,000), the unemployment
rate is 7 percent, salaries are rising and pensions are 10 times
higher than in Russia. Refurbished office buildings, cafes, shops
-- even a recently opened McDonald's -- attest to the relative
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Ivangorod's story is not unusual as Russia has struggled
to convert to a market economy. The collapse of the Soviet system
and the end of state subsidies hit thousands of small towns and
villages particularly hard. Factories folded, eliminating jobs.
Aging water and heating systems faltered, leaving residents to cope
with insufficient help from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-Estonian border was drawn in 1991 based on the lines
on the map of the Soviet administrative districts. Ivangorod was
part of a district ruled from Leningrad, renamed St. Petersburg.
Narva was part of the Estonian district, ruled from the capital of
Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet era, the water and sewer works for the two towns
were built in Narva. After the Soviet Union dissolved, an
arrangement was made for the Estonian town to sell the services to
Ivangorod.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was supposed to be temporary. But after eight
years, the Russians showed no signs of constructing their own
utilities and Ivangorod racked up a $1.5 million debt to Narva in
unpaid water bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonians late last year issued an ultimatum and on Jan. 2
turned off the pipes, leaving Ivangorod without drinking water and
flushing its raw sewage directly into the icy Narva River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a market economy. No store will give you things
unless you pay for them,'' said the acting mayor of Narva, Ants
Liimets(CQ). ``We're ready to give them water. We're ready to clean
their sewage. But they must pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Russian officials are rushing to build a water plant. They
have some pumps running, though water service stops at night and is
intermittent during the day. There is no hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Ivangorod's humiliation is the constant reminder that
their economy is second class.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic meltdown last August, when the ruble
began a slide that reduced it in value by two-thirds, more
residents of Narva do their shopping in Ivangorod. They take
advantage of the power of their national currency, the Estonian
kroon, and buy Russian produce and goods.
</P>
<P>
   About 96 percent of Narva's residents are ethnic Russians and
many families have branches that stretch across both towns. A
Russian-Estonian agreement allows residents of Ivangorod and Narva
to pass with ease through border checkpoints and over the bridge
that crosses the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices are so much cheaper here. So we come over to
'steal' from our neighbors in Russia,'' said Claudia Skorikova, a
pensioner from Narva, who trekked across the river to do her
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a whole series of problems -- the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the collapse of the economy, the lack of public
services. The pressure has been great,'' says Antonina Kostitsina,
Ivangorod's deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Kostitsina dismisses any talk of secession as the aim of a
disgruntled few, however.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes that Russia and Estonia will enter into a border pact
that would allow Ivangorod and Narva to cooperate in areas of
social services, public transit and education. The towns have
matching, centuries-old Teutonic forts that could draw mutually
beneficial tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the Russian government nor Estonia's is eager to
consider the border question. For Russia, it is a matter of pride
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   For Estonia, which has an arguable claim to Ivangorod based on
the border between the two countries drawn at the end of World War
I, it is a matter of pragmatic diplomacy. Estonia is seeking
membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; adding a border dispute would only complicate
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ivangorod looks with envy at its neighbors across the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy mayor, Kostitsina, laments: ``We're a small city held
hostage by political events.''

<P>
   PING YU, China _ Life looks simple and tradition-bound in this
misty mountain hamlet, but even here couples have access to a piece
of modern technology that is mutating the face of China.
</P>
<P>
   The ultrasound scanner that reveals the sex of a fetus has led
to the purging from China's population of between 500,000 and
750,000 unborn girls every year, recent statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery that identifies birth defects also allows
sex-selective abortions, which have become commonplace in the
countryside where sons are in highest demand.
</P>
<P>
   China has outlawed sex screening for a decade, yet it remains as
accepted here as the rickety mini-truck delivering big green
cabbages, as unremarkable as the older women who monopolize the
central village yard every Sunday with folk dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a girl is the first baby, they won't have an abortion. If
it's the second, they will,'' explained Jin Heyin, 49, one of the
women waiting on a recent Sunday for the drum and cymbal players to
begin rolling out the rhythm for their weekly dance routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many people who do this,'' she said. ``Medically, it's
very safe now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ping Yu, as in most of rural China, birth control regulators
have tried to assuage the peasants' ire over the 1979 ``one child''
regulations by adopting an unstated ``one son'' policy instead.
</P>
<P>
   A couple giving birth to a son is allowed one child. But a rural
family that has a girl first is permitted a second baby.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often will keep the first girl, then repeatedly abort
subsequent pregnancies until an ultrasound shows the requisite male
heir.
</P>
<P>
   Other Ping Yu dancers, dressed in pink satin trousers and tunics
tied with a green sash, agreed with Jin that the process is simple.
They don't even need to travel the 100 miles northeast to Beijing,
but can simply go down the winding road to the town of Shi Du, less
than a half hour bus ride away.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there are reputed to be willing and able to scan a
woman's stomach and tell her what is in her womb. Similar
ultrasound machines are used in more than 200,000 local clinics and
private doctors' offices across China.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage of science and tradition -- the Chinese
traditional hunger for sons -- has bloated to 1.04 million a year
the estimated number of ``missing girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Selective abortion isn't the only explanation, though it is the
biggest factor. For centuries unwanted girls have fallen victim to
infanticide, abandonment and neglect. Others are ``missing''
because their parents never reported their births.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mortality rates show girls aged 0-4 dying at the high
rate of 37 per 1,000, compared to 28 per 1,000 for boys. In few
other countries do young girls die at a greater rate than boys.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese investigation into irregular girl mortality rates
found rural boys getting more milk, better food, better and faster
medical care, according to last summer's report in the Chinese
academic journal ``Population and Economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-boy tradition at least has been a boon to foreign
couples seeking to adopt babies. Chinese orphanages are filled with
abandoned, healthy little girls, and Americans took home nearly
4,000 of them in the year ending last September.
</P>
<P>
   But now modern medicine has made it vastly easier to dispense
with girls in advance. China's 20-year experiment in social
engineering, rigidly limiting families to one or sometimes two
children, has made it compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of boy versus girl babies nationwide has steadily
risen since the ``one child, one family'' policy took effect in
1979. The natural ratio of 106:100 climbed to 108:100 by the 1982
census. Once ultra-sound machines were introduced in the mid-1980s,
the pace quickened. Surveys in 1992 and 1995 found that the sex
ratio had reached 118:100.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the newspaper Shanghai Express said a recent
government survey put the ratio at 120:100, but there has been no
official confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from population sampling and sex ratios in the
mid-1990s, for every 1,000 babies that were born in China, another
51 female babies should have been born but are not accounted for.
These comprise the ``missing'' girls -- more than one million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have contended that parents do not register all
daughters' births, keeping them hidden in order to dodge the
restrictive reproduction policy and have another child.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 study by the State Statistical Bureau concluded that
underreporting was only a lesser cause of the skewed sex ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic reason is the selective abortion before birth,'' the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   China -- with nearly five times America's population -- has
about the same per capita abortion rate. In 1992, China reported
5,564,000 abortions for ``birth control purposes,'' compared to
America's 1.3 million abortions in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   How many sex-selection abortions were there in China? Using a
methodology developed in the U.S. Census Bureau, it appears from
Chinese birth data that there were at least 500,000 and possibly as
many as 750,000 sex-selective abortions last year.
</P>
<P>
   Consequences of sex-selective abortions include health
complications women may suffer from late-term and repeated
abortions. The low-tech, two-dimensional ultrasound machines
typically available to private physicians or grassroots clinics
cannot determine the sex of a fetus until the fourth or fifth month
of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead lies the problem of matrimony. Who will these excess boys
marry when they come of age? Already cases of kidnapping and
selling women for brides have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decade of regulations against use of the ultrasound
for sex screening, doctors and women alike keep taking what
apparently is a minimal legal risk to produce Chinese sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious problem,'' acknowledged Chen Shengli,
chief spokesman for the State Family Planning Commission. ``A
majority of the people still think a boy child is superior to a
girl child.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen believes other provincial governments soon will follow the
lead of Shandong Province, which in January began enforcing a
strict new law that prohibits private doctors from even possessing
ultrasound scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow them to have ultrasound machines, and also they
cannot do operations to stop pregnancy,'' said Sun Ailing, deputy
director of the family planning commission in coastal Shandong
Province, where the sex ratio in some places stands at 125:100.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the province's public medical clinics, ultrasound must
be administered by two doctors, both of whom must swear in writing
that the test was given for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way we can protect women's health,'' said Sun, citing
cases of women forced into abortion by a husband or in-laws until
they produce a son. ``Some abortions are very painful and cause
permanent sterility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun expressed concern over women who act without medical advice
by walking into a pharmacy and buying the Chinese equivalent of
RU-486, known as the ``morning after'' pill. In larger doses it
will cause a miscarriage even if a woman is well into pregnancy.
Danger exists if some fetal material is not expelled and flares
into a uterine infection.
</P>
<P>
   Why do women take these risks?
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, where the ``one child'' policy is more strictly
enforced, many fewer do. Among more educated Chinese, daughters
have gained almost equal status with sons and the urban sex ratio
is about normal.
</P>
<P>
   It is still the countryside, where more than two-thirds of
China's 1.2 billion people live, that boys are so prized.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Heyin, the folk dancer in Ping Yu, had the luck to birth a
son in the days before ultrasound scanning was available. She
understands the anguish of those who ``want very badly to have a
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of feudal traditional thoughts, they think if they
have a boy he can keep the family line going,'' she said. A son
also is a guarantee of care in old age, especially important in a
country lacking solid pensions or reliable social services for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The other operative aspect of Chinese tradition means that care
or money spent rearing a girl, at least in the countryside, is
virtually wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she is married,'' Jin said, ``a girl will leave the
family.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON An American company that helped launch medical
ultrasound machines in China two decades ago says it cannot control
now whether Chinese doctors use them for sex-selection abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be nothing we could really do if the machines are
being used for that purpose,'' said Jane Hedberg, spokeswoman with
ATL Ultrasound, headquartered in a suburb of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hedberg said the ultrasound systems her company sells in China
are used for treating heart, vascular and skeletal problems as well
as fetal monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machines are designed to provide as much information as
possible about the fetus, detecting such things as spina bifida.
So, of course, they will be able to see the sex of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   ATL Ultrasound is one of at least three American medical
equipment companies whose ultrasound technology is now in
widespread use at Chinese hospitals and clinics. Others include
General Electric and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hewlett-Packard Medical Products Group in Andover, Mass.,
spokesman Diane Prendible said her company's machines are ``very
high-end and very expensive'' and designed mainly for cardiac
patients. Although they are capable of monitoring fetal
development, she said the company does not recommend this use to
Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a pencil, you can write a bomb threat or a love
letter with it,'' Prendible said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I know that sounds funny, but there are some
companies that sell ultrasound machines that have cheaper systems
for this purpose; that is, for fetal monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   All three companies stand to lose future business possibilities
if China's local governments follow the lead of Shandong Province,
which this month banned private practitioners from using ultrasound
machines. Shandong officials vowed to restrict the use of
ultrasound machines in order to stem the deliberate abortions of
female fetuses.

   ATL Ultrasound says it entered the Chinese ultrasound market in
1978 through an alliance with a Hong Kong businessman and became
``the first company to introduce Doppler ultrasound technology
training and education in China.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, ATL Ultrasound's scanners were sold in China
through the Squibb Medical Products Group, which then owned ATL
Ultrasound. In 1996, ATL sold China's largest ultrasound machine
manufacturer the rights to use ATL's Apogee800 Plus technology to
manufacture about 400 ultrasound machines a year for the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
   ATL Ultrasound, which has annual worldwide revenues of more than
$465 million, was taken over in mid-1998 by the Dutch consumer
electronics group Philips in an $800 million cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot control at all, or have anything to do with how
physicians decide to use the machines,'' said spokeswoman Hedberg.
``The standards for the practice of medicine are dealt with by the
medical community.''

   HAVANA _ An imposing structure from the outside, the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital is Havana's premier healthcare facility and one
of the few high-rise buildings positioned along this city's famed
seaside boulevard, the Malecon.
</P>
<P>
   But, inside, the facility is much-less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The lights are off in the spacious, but darkened, lobby, and the
air-conditioning isn't working in most parts of the building. In
operating rooms, surgical gloves are generally reused. Everywhere,
antibiotics are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are so underpaid that some are contemplating leaving
their fields altogether to work instead in the tourism industry,
where they can earn more from foreigners in daily tips than they
can from the government in monthly incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there's even a running joke about a woman who frets to a
psychiatrist that her husband suffers from delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps claiming to be a waiter, when everybody knows he's
only a brain surgeon,'' she worries.
</P>
<P>
   The average yearly salary for a doctor in Cuba is about $240.
</P>
<P>
   The ails of the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital are a microcosm of
the ails afflicting this island's once world-renowned healthcare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shining jewel of President Fidel Castro's revolution,
Cubans have seen their benefits flit away like leaves on an autumn
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many shortages that people try to avoid going to
the hospitals in Cuba at all costs because of all the problems that
exist in them,'' said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the
University of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   At many of Cuba's 273 hospitals, surgeons use acupuncture
instead of anesthesia during operations. Patients supply their own
food and bed sheets. Aspirin is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans blame deficiencies on the U.S. economic embargo, which
has made it increasingly hard -- and expensive -- to import
desperately needed medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent takeovers of non-American pharmaceutical and other
medical companies by U.S.-based ones have made it even more
difficult to import medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Existing U.S. embargo regulations permit only the licensed sale
and donation of medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs three times as much to buy medicines from other
sources than it would if we could buy them from the United States,
so we can't afford them,'' said Dr. Bartolome Arce Hidalgo, vice
director at the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faced a lot of difficulties due to the blockade,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy toward Cuba, such as Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., argue that U.S. licensing regulations are
prohibitive, and they want the embargo on medical sales lifted
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Dodd plans to revise and
re-introduce legislation that failed to win approval last year
allowing for unencumbered medical-related sales to this communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we hope to have even more than the 29 co-sponsors
we had before,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   But many Clinton administration officials blame Cuba's
foundering healthcare system not on the stifling U.S. embargo, but
on Cuba's foundering socialist economy, which they say is in worse
shape today than it was in 1959, when Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
   They retort that Cuba simply doesn't have the hard currency it
needs to make major purchases of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba lost 85 percent
of its export market, forcing it to cut spending on healthcare by
between 70 and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a step some Cuba experts saw as ground-breaking under the
existing embargo, the Clinton administration late last year gave a
small Denver-based medical company permission to test a new product
in Cuba. Cuban officials are currently conducting a three-month
test of a needle-free vaccine injector developed by Genesis Medical
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first U.S. company that's been allowed to go in and
make our presence known in such a way,'' said Robert Jones, the
company's president. ``It's been good for us because preliminary
reports show the Cubans are impressed with the inoculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Cuba's healthcare system still functions as well as it
does in the face of massive budget cuts is testament to how strong
its foundation was in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been known for impressive strides in public
health. Its 63,000 doctors have eradicated most common infectious
diseases, such as measles and tuberculosis, and the average life
expectancy here is 75 years, same as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most medicines and treatments -- even plastic surgery -- are
made free of charge to Cuba's 12 million or so people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still has more doctors per capita -- one for every 185
citizens -- than any country in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba even exports some of its doctors, with 1,000 physicians now
working abroad, including more than 400 in South Africa's grossly
under-serviced rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly for Cuba's esteem is that the state-run
biotechnology industry is still breaking new ground. Recently,
Cuban scientists expressed hope that this will find vaccines for
AIDS and some types of cancer within the next seven years or so.
Health Minister Carlos Dotres has been even more optimistic, saying
in December that an AIDS vaccine would be ready within two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotechnology industry is still a very gung-ho industry,
and Cuba seems to have an army of engineers and scientists at work
in this area,'' said Florentino Chacon Puig, who works here for the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists already have developed a vaccine for
meningitis C, one of the last childhood killers, and are working on
a vaccine to fight cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite Cuba's shortages, doctors at the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital have performed 94 heart transplants over the last
10 years, as well as cornea, kidney, and bone marrow transplants,
advanced procedures unavailable in many other developing countries.
In the hospital's basement, doctors use four hyperbaric chambers --
that are worth $45,000 a piece -- to treat patients with all sorts
of common and acute conditions using concentrated levels of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hospital room is equipped with a television and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital still needs sutures, anesthetics, and drugs
such as the cancer-fighting Tamoxifin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Tamoxifin from China, so you can imagine how
expensive it is,'' said pharmacist Robin Garcia, referring to high
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The dire need for foreign exchange in recent years has led many
of Cuba's better hospitals to market some of their beds to foreign
patients, who now pay $20 million a year in hard currency for
various treatments, according to Cuban government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban government officials say no more than 5 percent of
hospital beds is set aside for foreigners so that there's still
plenty of space for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1,000-bed Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, only 50 beds are
reserved for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that's collected is devoted entirely to keeping the
rest of the health-care system alive,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro critics blast Cuban hospitals for treating
foreigners with ample supplies of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that foreigners are treated with the best care and
the best drugs when the average Cuban must suffer from extreme
shortages?'' asked an angry Frank Calzon, director of the
non-profit Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Armas said hospitals must provide foreigners with good care
because their money is the glue that holds the entire health-care
system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our hospitals, the material conditions have deteriorated --
the beds are old and the paint is peeling,'' he said. ``But every
bed and every hospital is still open and the equipment still works,
and that's saying something.''

 &HT;    ILL KING HUSSEIN SUSPECTS BROTHER AND 'PARASITES' IN THE PALACE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Time was catching up with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by cancer that wouldn't go away, the monarch with 47
years on the throne sought this week to take on what may be his
last achievement -- insuring the survival of his cherished
Hashemite dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   He returned Jan. 19 from six months of cancer treatment in the
United States to the cheers of hundreds of thousands of his adoring
subjects. But the trip was ill-fated, and the feverish and hobbled
monarch would rush back for chemotherapy a week later.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the loyal brother, who for 33 years was heir to
the throne, would be cast aside under suspicion of betrayal. The
jovial, dark horse son would be the new heir. And, the favorite
son, would be left to wait his turn, just too young for Hussein's
nervous little kingdom to count on.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites are the direct descendants of the Muslim Prophet
Mohammed. In better days they ruled part of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
Now, 44 generations since Mohammed, they have survived
assassination, war and displacement.
</P>
<P>
   On Hussein's final night in Jordan Monday, he tried to
straighten out the latest Hashemite crisis in a handwritten,
14-page letter assailing the ``parasites'' and ``climbers'' in the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was rushed for a reading on Jordanian television
after 1 a.m. Tuesday. Hours later, Hussein was on a plane back to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where doctors would confirm
that his lymphoma had returned.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein is still king, but by Thursday afternoon thousands of
Jordanian tribe leaders came to congratulate the new heir,
36-year-old Crown Prince Abdullah. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright also stopped in to show support for the moderate
country that the west sees as pivotal to maintaining peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Change-resistant Jordanians were adjusting slowly. But, details
were emerging of the remarkable week. In Amman's cliquish and
formal elite, few wanted to be quoted talking about the royal
family, but one former confidant of the king described it as a
classic Shakespearian tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy centered on the rift between the wise and
charismatic king and his reliable, if bookish brother, Prince
Hassan. With the king sick and pondering his mortality, Hassan was
making moves to reform the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clash between the rational and the sentimental,'' the
old friend said. ``The younger brother saw it as a national
responsibility (to take actions) and the sick man saw it as a
conspiracy against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agreed that, in the end, the drama was just of a king
wanting a son to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The key players:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ailing King Hussein, 63, who became king at the age of 17.
He survived coups, invasions and assassination attempts to build
Jordan from the desert sands.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Crown Prince Hassan, 51, the policy wonk Hussein appointed
heir in 1965, when the King had no adult sons to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prince Abdullah, the 36-year-old army general who was never in
contention for the top job but is athletic and comfortable with
both royalty and army grunts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prince Hamzeh, 18, the object of Hussein's affection. The
king, the line goes, sees himself when he looks at the articulate,
serious prince.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Queen Noor, Hussein's glamorous American fourth wife, who was
long rumored to be trying to push her son Hamzeh in line in front
of Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Princess Sarvath, Hassan's Pakistani wife, rumored to be
pushing her husband to the throne too quickly and spreading gossip
about Hussein and Noor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And, there is the Jordanian people. A country of just about
4.2 million, subjects can brush up against royalty in restaurants.
But, it is a traditional, poor and jittery country, sandwiched
between a defensive Israel, rogue Iraq and cagey Syria. For 47
years, the only constant they have known has been King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Many think that Hussein came back to Jordan intending to make
Hamzeh the heir to his throne.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, Hussein piloted his own jet and then waved to
the crowds through the sun roof of his Mercedes. But, it was a
rainy, cold day. Many devotees winced as they watched the ill man
drench himself as he soaked up his country's love.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, there were signs that Hassan's long rising star was now
crashing to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The King called Hassan his ``deputy,'' a lowly title for a
royal. The king speaks in codes, many say, and he was signaling
that Hassan's star was fading.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts turned to Hamzeh, but Jordanians did not know that just
two days after his arrival, Hussein's health was failing. The blood
counts were dropping and the fevers rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``His illness accelerated the decision,'' said former Jordanian
Prime Minister Ahmad Obeidat.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Crown Prince Hassan sent his older brother a
letter. Like many Jordanians, he considers the King a father
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, my father, brother, friend and my magnificent King, after
serving as your crown prince since the start of my youth until this
day,'' he wrote, ``I find myself in a situation where I submit to
your will and obey your sublime and kind command.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hussein's answer, he complained Hassan had refused several
proposals about who should be king after him and Hassan. Most
assume the king wanted Hassan to fill in, then turn it over to
Hamzeh. The king, and particularly Noor, according to observers,
feared that Hassan would pass the crown to his own son instead.
</P>
<P>
   The letter listed other offenses: Hassan tried to change the
military leadership and wanted to move a general from the house
Hussein gave him.
</P>
<P>
   To Hassan, such a move was good policy -- the house came from
the government and should be public. To Hussein, the gift was the
old-school way that loyalty is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein and Hassan share brotherly love and many achievements --
most notably a peace treaty with Israel, winning the support of the
West. But where Hussein is charming, Hassan is cerebral. Where
Hussein is bold, Hassan cautious. They are different, in fact, to
the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein noted that two other siblings donated bone marrow for
his cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also volunteered to donate marrow,'' he wrote to Hassan.
``Except thatyours did not match mine.''
</P>
<P>
   With his health failing again, there was no time to turn to the
young Hamzeh.
</P>
<P>
   He is too unseasoned. Worse, he is not the King's eldest son.
Making him heir would require a constitutional amendment. People
could say the king was just doing it for Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein turned to Abdullah. Born to Hussein's second wife, from
Great Britain, Abdullah is his first son. It's traditional and,
with such a sick king, practical.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was quickly sworn in as heir to the throne at the
airport Tuesday morning, where Hussein, now leaning on a cane, was
departing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hussein is still king, but the Jordanians are digesting
the jolting images: A King's triumphant return, the snubbing of a
faithful figure, the elevation of a new leader, and the sad hugs
that rivals Queen Noor and Princess Sarvath exchanged at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most wished the change did not have to be so ugly. As a start to
recovery, Hassan has pledged loyalty to Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   One observer predicted the Hashemites will pull through: ``It's
a family, after all.''

 &HT;    BACK TO BEIRUT: AMERICANS TRICKLING INTO ONE-TIME HAVEN FOR
HOSTAGE-TAKERS
 &HT;    With Photos in the International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Jan. 30 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Like other college freshmen, American Cara
MacAdam goes to class, gets visits from her mother, and relaxes at
local pubs after a day full of classes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, during the country's 15-year civil war, her
school was targeted for kidnappings and assassinations. In those
days, the American University in Beirut was no place for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam is one of just a couple hundred Americans who, after the
lifting of a U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon, choose to live in the
war-scarred country.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam, 18, was here as a toddler when her father was on the
AUB faculty. By the time she left in 1984, Lebanon's civil war had
turned against Americans and AUB took a lot of losses.
</P>
<P>
   One president of the university, David Dodge, was kidnapped and
another, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated. An engineering professor
and hospital administrator were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Radical groups pulled Americans and other foreigners off the
streets, including reporter Terry Anderson, Rev. Benjamin Weir and
hostage negotiator Terry Waite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the U.S. State Department outlawed travel to Lebanon by
Americans. During the ban, thousands of Americans managed to go
anyway, careful to keep Lebanese border stamps out of the their
passports. Mostly, though, they were Lebanese-Americans or people
married to Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the university, once with a majority-American student
body, lost its American students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 1997(CQ), the state department lifted the ban, citing
progress in ``restoring order.'' A travel advisory still warns
Americans not to go to Lebanon without ``compelling reasons'' and
notes that someone fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the
embassy grounds in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are trickling back in. There are scores there now,
though probably less than 200.
</P>
<P>
   There's the manager at the TGIFridays, some business executives,
the occasional journalist and a small group at the at the
136-year-old university _ nine students among the 5,000 enrolled
and about five faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The campus of green lawns and giant Banyan trees is an enclave
of quiet in the traffic-jammed Beirut downtown. From its hilltop,
it overlooks the Mediterranean and it has its own beach. While
Beirut still has entire blocks of bombed-out buildings, the damage
at AUB has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a part of my past that I don't even know,'' says
MacAdam, who was too young to remember Beirut when she left.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends in Princeton, N.J., wondered why she did not go to
school in the United States, but she was bored there. She said her
Lebanese peers wonder, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely an element of, 'What are you doing here,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a heavy military presence. On the streets of
Beirut, one sees propaganda from the radical Hezbollah, troops from
the Lebanese army and machine gun-toting secret service from Syria,
which exercises control over Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is occupied
by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of gotten used to Israeli jets breaking the sound
barrier. Initially, it was very disturbing,'' says student Kevin
DeJesus, from Providence, R.I., referring to a recent string of
Israeli fly-overs that created window-shaking sonic booms.
</P>
<P>
   But, the kidnappings stopped long ago and there is almost no
common street crime in Beirut. Bars and restaurants are popping up
in the rebuilt-downtown.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is probably the most liberal Arab capital. DeJesus, 28,
enjoys a disco called ``Acid.'' But, he says the two earrings he
wears -- both in one ear -- are still a ``source of discontent to
many.''
</P>
<P>
   History professor John Miloy(CQ), from California, said any
danger he might face is nothing compared to what Lebanese faced
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who decided every day whether to send their
kids to school or whether to cancel a lecture because a shell
landed nearby,'' says Miloy, 39.
</P>
<P>
   American Monte Palmer, 64, heads the school's Center for Arab
and Middle Eastern Studies. He was in Beirut in the 1970s, and
returned last year from Florida State University in Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He's irked to see some of the changes, including a McDonald's
now downtown. He is careful about where he travels, but does not
fear for his safety and he recently talked to former hostage
Anderson about bringing a group of American journalism students to
the school this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, though fragile, seems to be getting back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think Beirut is the best kept secret in the
world,'' he says. ``My assessment was that if things are going to
break down, there will be ample time to leave.''

   MILESTONES OF POPULATION CONTROL IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Early 1950s - Chairman Mao Tse-tung, fearing nuclear war,
encourages rapid population growth. China's population explodes
from 540 million in 1950 to 850 million in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   1958-1960 - Famine kills millions, shocking the ruling
communists to worry whether their crowded land could feed an
ever-expanding population.
</P>
<P>
   1973 - China adopts limited population control, calling on
citizens to have ``late-spaced-few'' children.
</P>
<P>
   1970 - China's fertility rate drops rapidly. Chinese women bore
an average of 5.8 children each in 1970, but by the end of the
decade this was down to 2.2 children each.
</P>
<P>
   1979 - China intensifies population policy, introducing
mandatory ``One Child, One Family'' policy that led in the early
1980s to compulsory sterilizations and abortions after unplanned
second pregnancies. The fertility rate drops further.
</P>
<P>
   1984 - China loosens ``One Child'' policy, allowing some rural
families to have a second child, especially if the first was a
daughter. Forced abortions and sterilizations are officially
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   1989 - Realizing that ultrasound machines are being used for
sex-selection abortions, the Chinese Health Ministry issues an
urgent notice ``strictly forbidding'' use of medical technology to
determine sex of fetuses. However, this and follow-up rules
throughout the 1990s are evaded or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   1990 - China exceeds 1.1 billion population.
</P>
<P>
   1995 - Fertility rate continues dropping. Now, Chinese women
have only 1.8 children each -- comparable to the rate in Western
Europe, and lower than the rate in the United States. ``One Child''
policy is still in effect in the cities, two-child families in farm
areas is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   2000 - China's population is expected to reach 1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: These bits of history could be super-imposed on Chart 2.

<P>
   HAVANA _ An imposing structure from the outside, the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital is Havana's premier healthcare facility and one
of the few high-rise buildings positioned along this city's famed
seaside boulevard, the Malecon.
</P>
<P>
   But, inside, the facility is much-less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The lights are off in the spacious, but darkened, lobby, and the
air-conditioning isn't working in most parts of the building. In
operating rooms, surgical gloves are generally reused. Everywhere,
antibiotics are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are so underpaid that some are contemplating leaving
their fields altogether to work instead in the tourism industry,
where they can earn more from foreigners in daily tips than they
can from the government in monthly incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there's even a running joke about a woman who frets to a
psychiatrist that her husband suffers from delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps claiming to be a waiter, when everybody knows he's
only a brain surgeon,'' she worries.
</P>
<P>
   The average yearly salary for a doctor in Cuba is about $240.
</P>
<P>
   The ails of the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital are a microcosm of
the ails afflicting this island's once world-renowned healthcare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shining jewel of President Fidel Castro's revolution,
Cubans have seen their benefits flit away like leaves on an autumn
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many shortages that people try to avoid going to
the hospitals in Cuba at all costs because of all the problems that
exist in them,'' said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the
University of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   At many of Cuba's 273 hospitals, surgeons use acupuncture
instead of anesthesia during operations. Patients supply their own
food and bed sheets. Aspirin is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans blame deficiencies on the U.S. economic embargo, which
has made it increasingly hard -- and expensive -- to import
desperately needed medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent takeovers of non-American pharmaceutical and other
medical companies by U.S.-based ones have made it even more
difficult to import medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Existing U.S. embargo regulations permit only the licensed sale
and donation of medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs three times as much to buy medicines from other
sources than it would if we could buy them from the United States,
so we can't afford them,'' said Dr. Bartolome Arce Hidalgo, vice
director at the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faced a lot of difficulties due to the blockade,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy toward Cuba, such as Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., argue that U.S. licensing regulations are
prohibitive, and they want the embargo on medical sales lifted
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Dodd plans to revise and
re-introduce legislation that failed to win approval last year
allowing for unencumbered medical-related sales to this communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we hope to have even more than the 29 co-sponsors
we had before,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   But many Clinton administration officials blame Cuba's
foundering healthcare system not on the stifling U.S. embargo, but
on Cuba's foundering socialist economy, which they say is in worse
shape today than it was in 1959, when Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
   They retort that Cuba simply doesn't have the hard currency it
needs to make major purchases of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba lost 85 percent
of its export market, forcing it to cut spending on healthcare by
between 70 and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a step some Cuba experts saw as ground-breaking under the
existing embargo, the Clinton administration late last year gave a
small Denver-based medical company permission to test a new product
in Cuba. Cuban officials are currently conducting a three-month
test of a needle-free vaccine injector developed by Genesis Medical
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first U.S. company that's been allowed to go in and
make our presence known in such a way,'' said Robert Jones, the
company's president. ``It's been good for us because preliminary
reports show the Cubans are impressed with the inoculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Cuba's healthcare system still functions as well as it
does in the face of massive budget cuts is testament to how strong
its foundation was in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been known for impressive strides in public
health. Its 63,000 doctors have eradicated most common infectious
diseases, such as measles and tuberculosis, and the average life
expectancy here is 75 years, same as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most medicines and treatments -- even plastic surgery -- are
made free of charge to Cuba's 12 million or so people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still has more doctors per capita -- one for every 185
citizens -- than any country in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba even exports some of its doctors, with 1,000 physicians now
working abroad, including more than 400 in South Africa's grossly
under-serviced rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly for Cuba's esteem is that the state-run
biotechnology industry is still breaking new ground. Recently,
Cuban scientists expressed hope that this will find vaccines for
AIDS and some types of cancer within the next seven years or so.
Health Minister Carlos Dotres has been even more optimistic, saying
in December that an AIDS vaccine would be ready within two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotechnology industry is still a very gung-ho industry,
and Cuba seems to have an army of engineers and scientists at work
in this area,'' said Florentino Chacon Puig, who works here for the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists already have developed a vaccine for
meningitis C, one of the last childhood killers, and are working on
a vaccine to fight cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite Cuba's shortages, doctors at the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital have performed 94 heart transplants over the last
10 years, as well as cornea, kidney, and bone marrow transplants,
advanced procedures unavailable in many other developing countries.
In the hospital's basement, doctors use four hyperbaric chambers --
that are worth $45,000 a piece -- to treat patients with all sorts
of common and acute conditions using concentrated levels of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hospital room is equipped with a television and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital still needs sutures, anesthetics, and drugs
such as the cancer-fighting Tamoxifin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Tamoxifin from China, so you can imagine how
expensive it is,'' said pharmacist Robin Garcia, referring to high
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The dire need for foreign exchange in recent years has led many
of Cuba's better hospitals to market some of their beds to foreign
patients, who now pay $20 million a year in hard currency for
various treatments, according to Cuban government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban government officials say no more than 5 percent of
hospital beds is set aside for foreigners so that there's still
plenty of space for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1,000-bed Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, only 50 beds are
reserved for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that's collected is devoted entirely to keeping the
rest of the health-care system alive,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro critics blast Cuban hospitals for treating
foreigners with ample supplies of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that foreigners are treated with the best care and
the best drugs when the average Cuban must suffer from extreme
shortages?'' asked an angry Frank Calzon, director of the
non-profit Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Armas said hospitals must provide foreigners with good care
because their money is the glue that holds the entire health-care
system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our hospitals, the material conditions have deteriorated --
the beds are old and the paint is peeling,'' he said. ``But every
bed and every hospital is still open and the equipment still works,
and that's saying something.''

 Color slide and black and white photo of actress Julia Stiles in a
scene from the NBC miniseries ``The Sixties.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The '60s are back.
 &HT;    But you can relax. It's only on TV.
 &HT;    It was probably inevitable: The baby boom generation are now
running the country. They're also producing its movies and
television, and the '60s for them was the best of times.
 &HT;    Says Lynda Obst, producer of ``The Sixties,'' the four-hour
miniseries airing Feb. 7 and 8 on NBC: ``The music that gave tempo
to that (decade), the community that was forged at that time, the
values that were stirred up at that time still live with us, and
inside of all of us.''
 &HT;    She's not alone. Two other '60s projects are already established
in the TV season or coming up.
 &HT;    On Lifetime the much praised ``Any Day Now'' goes into its
second season with Annie Potts and Lorraine Toussaint as childhood
friends from the segregated South of the '60s reunited in a much
different America of the '90s. Child actors Mae Middleton and Shari
Dyon Perry co-star as the childhood friends as the action veers
between the black-and-white past and the full color present.
 &HT;    On TNT, ``Passing Glory'' airs Feb. 21 starring Andre Braugher
as a Catholic priest in a Southern town trying to get his high
school basketball team a game against the town's all-white
champions.
 &HT;    Also taking up the issue of race, Obst follows two American
families, one black and one white, through the travails of the
Vietnam War the civil rights movement, and brings them out more or
less intact on the other side.
 &HT;    ``I loved making this miniseries more than I've loved doing
almost anything in my entire career, '' she confesses. ``I was
going to say, in my entire life, but I think living the '60s was
more fun than actually making them again.''
 &HT;    At the Paramount Ranch in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, she
re-created the pivotal moment of her favorite decade when she
presided over the new Woodstock. Obst attended the real thing back
in 1969 _ ``I remember driving my car in reverse for about 12 miles
to get out of the mud'' _ so she insisted that every detail be true
to life.
 &HT;    As an army of studio workers unleashed a rain storm, some 300
extras milled around with long bleached hair, tie dyed shirts,
headbands, bodies draped in U.S. flags _ and that was just the men!
 &HT;    The women with flowers in their hair were in ankle-length
dresses and bell bottoms. Psychedelically painted buses stood
nearby, the ``bummer tent'' lay open for kids having bad trips, and
incense burned throughout. The odor of pot was missing, of course,
to keep everything legal.
 &HT;    Defying the adage about the '60s _ ``If you can remember it, you
weren't there'' _ Obst can recall those years in obsessive detail.
 &HT;    ``In many ways I've wanted to find a way to tackle the '60s for
all of my career,'' she says. ``I did a book on it (`The Rolling
Stone History of the Sixties') but TV is the right medium because
we received the '60s through television, from the Kennedy-Nixon
debates, where we got to see what beauty and charisma meant on
television....to the pictures from Vietnam, and the kids we saw
getting beaten up by cops on TV. ''
 &HT;    Obst's working class white family, the Herlihys, lose their
daughter when she gets pregnant by a rock musician and ends up in a
commune in Haight Ashbury. One son goes off to Vietnam. The other
becomes a peace activist.
 &HT;    The other family is no less split. Rev. Willie Taylor is burned
out of his home in Greenwood, Miss. and moves to California where
his son is recruited by the Black Panthers. The son becomes a
bodyguard and narrowly avoids being killed at the 1968 Democratic
Convention in Chicago.
 &HT;    Real-life Black Panther David Hilliard was an adviser to the
production and the cast includes a mixture of new and familiar
faces: Charles Dutton, Cliff Gorman, (as Father Daniel Berrigan)
Julia Stiles and David Alan Grier.
 &HT;    While Obst says she tried not to romanticize the decade, she
insists there is an enduring positive legacy from the controversial
decade.
 &HT;    ``I think there's great beauty in trying to re-imagine what it
felt like to be engaged in the world without apathy, and I want
more than anything for this series to be an invitation from my
generation to my son's generation.... to see what it's like to be
involved in speaking up, and finding out that your voice does make
a difference.''

   Japanese grandparents who live great distances from their
grandchildren are consoling themselves with a curious techno doll.
Send a photo of your baby to Another One Co. of Meguro, Tokyo, and
in six weeks they'll make you a look-alike doll. Only it doesn't
end there: A digital microchip recorder inside the doll records the
baby's early gurgles, so it even sounds like your baby. Simply hold
the doll's hand and it will play back the baby's voice _ or
whatever else you record.

   According to The Nikkei Weekly, the $400 doll is mostly ordered
by grandparents who rarely see their offspring's offspring. &QL;

IT'S AN ICE TIME OF YEAR FOR SOME OUTDOOR FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   When Chris St. George was a child, her parents built a temporary
ice-skating rink in the back yard of their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of six kids and that rink provided a safe place for
my family and friends to play during the cold weather months,'' St.
George said from her home in Lynn, Mass. ``There was always the
peace of mind of not falling through the ice. Now that I'm a
parent, I wanted to give my own children their own memories of a
backyard rink.''
</P>
<P>
   A backyard skating rink in winter is the equivalent of a
swimming pool in summer _ a place for exercise and have family
get-togethers, a place for neighborhood play.
</P>
<P>
   A homemade rink can be made anywhere in the back yard where the
ground is relatively level, said St. George, who has written a
small booklet (for $5.95) on how to make one.
</P>
<P>
   An unused lot or an outdoor tennis or basketball court would
make an ideal place to start, because the flatter the ground, the
easier it will be to build and flood.
</P>
<P>
   Start by removing any big rocks and spreading wood chips, dirt
or sand to fill in any low spots to even out the ground. A
50-by-100-foot rink may be ideal, but a 30-by-40-foot rink is an
excellent size for learning to skate and playing games. A National
Hockey League-size hockey rink is 80-by-200-feet and an Olympic
size figure skating rink is 100-by-200-feet.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-foot-high wall of packed snow will do for the siding, but
snow can melt. Therefore, pound wooden stakes into the ground and
attach 2-by-4s to them with strong brackets and screws. Or you can
fasten 2-foot-high sections of plywood, which also provide
something to hold onto for beginners. Roll out a large roll of
industrial plastic, purchased from a building supply store, for the
liner, covering the entire bottom of the rink. Use a heavy-duty
staple gun to secure the plastic to the sides, allowing enough
overhang to prevent the weight of the water from pulling it away.
Fold corners like a bed sheet before stapling for a stronger hold.
</P>
<P>
   Flood the rink with a garden hose to a depth of 2 inches, which
when frozen will hold a person weighing up to 300 pounds. It may
take 12 to 24 hours to fill the rink. At 30 degrees Fahrenheit, it
will take the water approximately five days to freeze solid; at 0,
it should take two days.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a smooth surface, flood the rink once a day in the
evening, if it is not windy. Shovel any snow from the ice before
reflooding. Store your hose inside at night after using.
</P>
<P>
   Light with a wide angle, all-weather floodlight, for night
skating, or white Christmas tree lights.
</P>
<P>
   Make up a set of safety rules for children to play and skate,
and post the list by the rink, where you may also wish to place a
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the liner after the spring thaw so it won't kill the
grass. Some companies sell kits for about $250, St. George writes,
while a homemade rink should cost a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   Her booklet is available from C.A.N. Publishing, Box 937, Lynn,
MA 01903.

A TOUCH OF PARISIAN STYLE CAN ENLIVEN ANY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union

<P>
   You've traveled to far-off places where romance and intrigue
abound, or perhaps you've read about such destinations and
fantasized about living there.
</P>
<P>
   Why wait longingly for the next jet plane? You can create the
same ambience in your own home or apartment, and keep it close for
as long as you like. You would not be the first to import a classic
decor, or to approximate one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with Paris when I worked there as an au pair,''
said Claudia Strasser, author of ``The Paris Apartment'' (1997
Harper Collins, $25), and owner of The Paris Apartment furnishings
store in SoHo. ``When I returned to the states, I wanted to
re-create the luxurious feeling of Paris. However, I could only do
this on a shoestring budget. So I began scouring flea markets,
rummage sales, cast-offs along the sidewalk and the Salvation Army,
where I could afford to indulge my fantasy and create an apartment
with the feeling and sensuality of a bygone era.''
</P>
<P>
   The international interior designer Mario Buatta said that when
you think of a Paris apartment, ``wonderful colors, high ceilings
and French doors should pop into mind and looking out on the Rue de
la ... whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The apartment should be pleasing to the eye,'' Buatta said.
``For instance, you might enter into a sunny yellow hall with
several mirrors, or instead of silvered mirrors, they could be
French blue mirrors and blue toile fabric or wallpaper on the
walls. Then on to a blue sitting room and a red and white toile
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you re-create those amenities when you live in
another part of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any space can fulfill your fantasy, so don't feel confined by
the layout or architecture of your home or apartment,'' Strasser
said. ``You start by surrounding yourself, like I did, with rich
colors, sumptuous fabrics and vintage furnishings, while
incorporating or camouflaging the present realities of televisions,
radiators, window grates and microwave ovens, to create a sense of
style and charm.''
</P>
<P>
   In Parisian decorating, you break all the rules, according to
interior designer George Orton of Lee, Mass., and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much the idea that counts,'' Orton said. ``The late
interior designer Billy Baldwin said that there are only three
things you need to create any really successful room: a comfortable
place to sit, a surface to put something down on and something
wonderful to look at. And I always completely agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to remember when creating a themed room
is to decorate with things you really love, things that are not
faddish, added Orton. Just stick to objects and furnishings that
are of real beauty to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a Franklin stove,'' Orton said. ``Things like that
give a room its personality. To create any room, try to start with
a few good things and don't try to do the whole room that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton suggested that when creating a Parisian room, one should
always start with fabrics, as ``Paris is the land of fabrics.'' It
also helps you to establish your color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris and Italy are where beautiful fabrics originated,''
Orton said. ``When I think Paris, wonderful rich stripes and
brocades come to mind. Look for old fabrics or a very simple
solid-colored fabric and one-striped, which is very French.''
</P>
<P>
   Strasser said that almost any fabric can work as drapery, such
as inexpensive cheesecloth, which makes excellent sheers under
curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Paris, you see simple draperies at the window, but
layered,'' Buatta said. ``There would be an apricot sheer, blue
satin and a striped drapery for a lush, simple window treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil K. Pollen, an interior designer and owner of Tassels in
Lenox, Mass., noted that fabric is also perfect for the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric stretched in panels can conceal various structural
flaws in walls, such as cracked or bulging plaster,'' Pollen said.
``The French very often used paisley-patterned shawls from
Indochina as throws for a piano, chair, table or bench. You can
also buy beautiful hand-screened fabric remnants and frame them
behind glass as works of art for your wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because color and decoration are instrumental to a Paris
apartment, you should banish barren white walls and lifeless beige
carpeting from your domain, Strasser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 18th-century Paris, they mixed colors in bold combinations:
yellow with violet, pink with gold, azure with lime, emerald with
crimson,'' Strasser said. ``This Parisian palette reflected a
belief that beauty is a necessity and that a room doesn't work if
it fails to give pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare decorating a room to getting dressed. The walls are
your makeup and the lighting adds sparkle, like your jewelry. I
personally like to start with the bedroom, where you spend the
majority of your time. I fill that room with the colors I love the
most. Sometimes I start with the sheets and select the rest of the
colors from there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strasser said that silver gives a more feminine feeling to a
room, gold a more masculine feeling. A typically feminine room
might use silver, white, celadon and blue or rinceau-treated
(vertical and horizontal panels, like empty picture frames on
walls, except the strips have scroll-and-leaf ornamentation) topped
by a yellow ceiling and furnished with silver and gray satins.
</P>
<P>
   A more masculine space might have pumpkin walls, gold trim and a
navy ceiling accessorized with navy, burgundy and gold satins.
</P>
<P>
   Small inexpensive things can create immediate ambience of a
foreign place, decorative focal points such as bowls that are flea
market finds, Pollen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cracked bowls always sell for less,'' said Pollen. ``Look for
8-inch- to 12-inch-diameter bowls. They make great display
containers for potpourri, plants, things you collect or ornaments
at holiday time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spill that same feeling onto the walls,'' Pollen said. ``Group
a number of inexpensive black frames with photos from old magazines
from the 1930s, '40s or '50s of Parisian scenes or fashions. You
can do the same thing by hanging a grouping of chipped or cracked
souvenir plates. This can be a lot more interesting than one large
expensive painting.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to furnishing, look at the possessions that you
already have that you love, and which simply take up space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pieces may fit into your plans perfectly, and others may
work once they have been repainted or repaired,'' Strasser said.
``Painted furniture is a staple of the Paris apartment. But a quick
sanding and coat of stain can also rejuvenate quite a few things.
But anything hopeless should go.''

PAPAL VISIT, PRESIDENTIAL BULL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pope John Paul II met with Bill Clinton and
didn't whack the president's hand with a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   That's the take most news organizations had on Tuesday's meeting
of the world leader of Catholicism and the world's most famous
sinner.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't surprise me, because the pope is concerned with
higher moral issues than those that concern hypocritical
home-wrecker Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me was the stark political contrast between these
two world leaders. On all but one very important issue, the
Democratic president is the conservative, and the pope is the
progressive.
</P>
<P>
   In every way but one, the pope has the same political program as
the Nation magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In every way but one, not counting his own impeachment, Clinton
is a Republican fellow-traveler.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is against the death penalty. The president is in favor
of it. He's even used lethal injection as a tool for election.
</P>
<P>
   While he was running for president in 1992, then-Gov. Clinton
denied clemency for a brain-damaged cop-killer named Rickey Ray
Rector, and even left the campaign trail to go back to Arkansas for
the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is against the bombing of Iraq. The president is
ordering the bombings, which have had excellent political timing,
but sometimes poor accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   This week 11 civilians were killed by errant bombs. The Clinton
administration said it was Iraq's fault. At least they didn't try
to redefine ``killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope backed the worldwide treaty banning land mines, signed
by 122 countries. The president refused the sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The pope wants the United States to lift sanctions against Cuba.
The president won't.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has lectured against the evils of ``exploitative
capitalism.'' The president has fought for big business and a
global economy that sends jobs across borders to the cheapest
labor.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has fought against ``every form of violence,''
including ``the violence of poverty and hunger.'' The president
threw the poor off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has spoken out against ``the culture of selfishness.''
The president is the poster boy for selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton risked his family and the Democratic Party for a few
goatish moments with a nubile intern, and then convinced his
Cabinet members to repeat his untrue denials to save his hide.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and Clinton do agree on a few things. Like the pope,
Clinton and his wife have called on young people to use abstinence
as a mainstay against unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself has another method of preventing pregnancy, but
however you define it, it's not abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the one big issue that gets the pope defined
as a conservative, and Clinton defined as a liberal: abortion.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the issue that has kept Clinton from being forced to
walk the gangplank onto Marine One and fly away to his place in
history and continuing prosecution by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in favor of women's right to abortion, so we
liberals, leftists, feminists, civil-libertarians and suckers can't
allow the anti-abortion fanatics on the right to drive him out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we have the sight of feminists defending a president who
cheated on St. Hillary by messing around with a 21-year-old intern
in the Oval Office. Thus the cognitive dissonance among all us
liberal Clinton dislikers.
</P>
<P>
   We know he's a sleaze in many ways, and now we have to defend
him even though he had sleazy sex with a subordinate almost as
young as his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He did it while Starr was trying to find any reason to nail the
pasty presidential skin to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   We have to defend Clinton because his enemies are bigger jerks
than he is. They want to chain women to the Hotpoint, put gays in
religious re-education camps and teach social Darwinism, but not
Darwinism.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they'd do right after they finish wrecking our
political system, and outraging our sense of fairness, just to ruin
a president who represents everything they don't like.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Clinton represents the '60s. For me, Clinton simply
represents old-fashioned amoral electoral politics, the kind we
repudiated in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans won't be able to nail him because he's better at
that game than they are.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone represents the '60s, it's his fanatical opponents.
They're like the Weather Underground, willing to blow up anything
to make a symbolic point, even if they destroy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a Catholic or a Clintonite, but I find much to admire in
both the pope and the president _ yes, the president.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who can survive what Clinton has been through for the
last six years has the kind of moxie it takes to be a president in
bad times. Too bad the Republicans had to invent bad times for him,
and for us.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice that Clinton and the pope got together in these times,
but here's what really ticks me off. Clinton actually used sin to
promote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still need to hear your message that all are God's
children, all have fallen short of His glory,'' he told the pope.
</P>
<P>
   This is a president who once outraged the Vatican by taking Holy
Communion even though he's not a Catholic. Maybe he should try the
confessional too.
</P>
<P>
   How many Hail Marys do you have to say for using God's name for
shameless self-promotion?
</P>

`FAMILY GUY' OFFERS A RAY OF HOPE FOR FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Fox did a reality-based program on its current season, its
title would be ``When New Shows Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's been a nightmare. All but one of the new Fox fall
shows have died quick deaths (``That '70s Show'' being the lone
survivor), ``King of the Hill'' has been shredded in the ratings by
its move from Sundays to Tuesdays, and ``The X-Files'' will likely
be gone after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for ``The Simpsons,'' the animated franchise. And Fox
is going back to the well of dysfunctional cartoon families with
``Family Guy,'' premiering Sunday after the Super Bowl and
returning sometime in March on a to-be-determined day and time.
(``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening will also launch the animated
``Futurama'' on Fox that same month).
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy'' comes from the mind of 25-year-old Seth
McFarlane. It is a somewhat skewed look at a normal family, or a
normal look at a skewed family, or ... well, it's pretty funny,
with the potential to get better.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffins of Rhode Island make the Simpsons of Springfield
look mainstream. Dad is a lovable buffoon in the Ralph Kramden/Fred
Flinstone tradition. His wife, Lois, is the moral center, as is the
pet dog, Brian. It is up to the talking canine to hit Peter Griffin
with a rolled up newspaper and a reinforcing ``No ... no ...'' when
dad gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Looks-conscious daughter Meg wants collagen lip implants, while
burnout-in-the-making son Chris is just shy of puberty. Infant
Stewie has a clipped English accent and a drive to take over the
world. If only his parents could understand what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you contemptible harpie, I will end your oppressive reign
of matriarchal tyranny,'' he shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy'' is ambitious in its first episode, with riffs on:
``The Brady Bunch,'' ``Jemima's'' Witnesses, collagen, Hitler,
dads' control of thermostats, ``Philadelphia,'' ``Casablanca,''
accountants, Fox News, ``The Sound of Music,'' Tiananmen Square
(``Screw this,'' Peter said the day he darted away from standing in
front of a phalanx of tanks. ``I just came over to buy some
fireworks''), welfare fraud, a drunk Bill Clinton, Jerry Seinfeld,
the Kennedys, Super Bowl XXXIII, John Madden and Pat Summerall, Fox
marketing, ``Joannie Loves Chachi,'' ``Bloopers'' and the greatest
takeoff of all time on 1970s Kool-Aid commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It is fast, and some of the jokes fail. But wait a few seconds:
You'll probably like the next one.

THE WILD WEST TO RETURN TO FORT WORTH'S MAIN STREET WITH LONGHORNS
DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ How many cow ponies does it take to drive 15
longhorn steers from the Fort Worth Convention Center up North Main
Street to the historic Stockyards?
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 horses, if it's for ``The Last Great Trail Drive of
the Century,'' organizers of the June 12 event say.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the 23rd annual Chisholm Trail Round-Up have been
folded into Fort Worth's 150th anniversary celebrations and the
scheduled debut of the taxpayer-funded Fort Worth Herd. The 15
longhorns represent one steer for every decade since Fort Worth was
founded in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys from across Texas and as far away as Canfield, Ohio,
have already inquired about securing spots in the parade, said
Chisholm Trail President Robert McKibben. About 150 slots for
horses and their riders already have been sold for $100 apiece, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't hold it down because of safety factors, we'd have
2,000 horses easy,'' McKibben said. ``This is really going to be
living history on four legs.''
</P>
<P>
   McKibben said he suspects that a recent article in USA Today has
bucked up interest in the June longhorn drive. And, he said,
mentioning the herd on the Internet may have helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy sent me a check a year ago to support Chisholm Trail and
the herd,'' said McKibben, owner of an office machine supply
company. ``This guy was from Houston, Texas, but grew up in the
Riverside area'' of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Steve M. King, a western history buff who presides over
Tarrant County Probate Court No. 1, said the popularity of the city
cattle herd isn't surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of this popular idea of what the West was is
really the history of Fort Worth _ cattle drives, buffaloes,
shootouts in the streets, the saloons, Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid,'' said King, who heads an auxiliary group called the
Outriders to support the Fort Worth Herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cattle drives are just a closed part of our history. It's
over. It's not going to happen again in reality, except for on a
few of the big ranches,'' King said. ``This is something mythical.
It really captures the essence of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the drive captured the attention of William K. Gibson,
owner of Willow Green Farm &AMP; Stables in Canfield, Ohio. Gibson saw
the USA Today report and called Fort Worth to say that he wanted to
bring six cowboys to Fort Worth for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview Thursday, Gibson asked how many
cattle the cowboys will be driving.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, phooey!'' he hollered. ``Sounds like city slickers to me.
I thought we were going to hit the old Chisholm Trail and be gone
for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. In fact, the typical Chisholm Trail route from Camp
Carter or the West Fork Ranch _ both just west of the city _ along
the banks of the Trinity River to the Stockyards has been scrapped
this year in favor of a more urban trail, McKibben said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, the trail drive has attracted about
700 riders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, riders will off-load their horses at the convention
center about 6 a.m. and drive their trailers to the Billy Bob's
Texas parking lot north of the Stockyards. Busses will shuttle
riders downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The 3 1/2-mile parade will mosey up Main Street, pausing to
collect the longhorns at the Chisholm Trail mural parking lot in
Sundance Square downtown, and then head to Paddock Park north of
the old Tarrant County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   There, rancher Anne Windfohr Marion and Ben Tahmahkera will
commemorate business negotiations between their ancestors, rancher
Burk Burnett and Comanche Chief Quanah Parker, McKibben said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, who befriended the Comanche leader in the late 1800s,
was eventually allowed to graze cattle on Comanche territory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the cattle will be driven to the Stockyards, where
they will be permanently installed in cattle pens north of East
Exchange Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chisholm Trail riders paid entry fees of $45 per
horse, McKibben said. This year's stiffer $100 fee for 800 slots
will raise money to support Chisholm Trail Round-Up and the herd,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,000 spots available, drive organizers have reserved 100
for officials. An additional 100 VIP slots near the front of the
drive are being sold for $1,000 each. Some wagons will be provided,
McKibben said, because ``Kay Granger wants to ride in a wagon.''
Granger, formerly mayor of Fort Worth, is a Republican congressman
whose district includes the city.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for entries is March 31, but space is limited. Call
the Chisholm Trail Round-Up ofice at (817) 625-7005 for more
information.

`NINE BELOW ZERO' SIZZLES WITH FINE PROSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (``Nine Below Zero,'' by Kevin Canty, Doubleday, 400 pages,
$23.95.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is quite right for Marvin Deernose or Justine Gallego in
``Nine Below Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main characters in this novel are not quite sure of
themselves, nor is either at peace with the past. It is inevitable,
then, that when Marvin and Justine meet and come together, and look
to one another for answers, the results are not totally satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Justine is in her late 30s and still trying to make peace with
the tragic death of her 5-year-old son, who was fatally injured in
an auto accident while riding with her husband, the boy's father.
Her son's death has torn gaping holes in Justine's sense of
herself, and it has made her numb to her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   When her grandfather, a one-time U.S. senator, is crippled and
loses his sight after his car rolls over near his home in rural
Montana, Justine feels compelled to be with him and try to help him
heal. Without regret and without looking back, she leaves her
husband in Oregon and drives over the mountains. Return dates
aren't discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin came upon the senator shortly after that wreck. A Native
American who feels like an outsider in the community, even though
he was raised here before joining the military and fighting drug
and alcohol abuse in Arizona and California, Marvin is able to call
for help in time to prevent the senator from dying.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin and Justine are indeed drawn together, but the mix is
more toxic than therapeutic. Friction wreaks havoc with their
passion, as seen in the following excerpt: He looked at her, and
she found herself under the lens again, the examinee.
</P>
<P>
   She found herself judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment is the enemy of love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that mean?'' ``It means (expletive) you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight like married people and we don't even know each
other. I mean, I don't know what I'm doing and it's true, I don't.
But I'll find something. I'm not some basket case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say you were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just it,'' she said. ``That's just like a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at his body and her anger dissipated all at once like
the air leaking from a balloon and in its place came sadness; she's
managed to wreck this thing too. It wasn't Marvin's fault. She had
been born broken.
</P>
<P>
   While Marvin and Justine are traveling over broken glass, unable
to avoid the pain they encounter, for the reader unfamiliar with
author Kevin Canty, the journey is unadulterated pleasure. He
embraces his characters without attempting to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no false finish to conclude ``Nine Below Zero.'' In
Canty's sure, fluid voice, such an ending would be unwelcome, a
forced chord that would have had no place here.
</P>
<P>
   This, Canty's second novel, offers fine, fine prose from a
writer who is already drawing comparisons to Raymond Carver and
Richard Ford, two of the most impressive and distinct voices in
American fiction during the past quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher at the University of Montana, Canty is just beginning
to enjoy the fruits of big-league success. His first work, a
collection of short stories titled ``A Stranger in This World,''
was published three years ago. His first novel, ``Into the Great
Wide Open,'' made its debut in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any justice in the publishing world, surely Kevin
Canty will not be an unknown writer for long.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Roadhouse in the bulldozers' path
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Some newspaper colleagues from the big
city were in town last week, and naturally I wanted to impress
them.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I took them to the Lost in the '50s Roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon and Larry, the owners, were nice enough to set up a large
table in the back corner, that way the ghost wouldn't bother us.
</P>
<P>
   Most everybody ordered chicken-fried steak and onion rings,
specialities of the house, along with the hamburgers. It's country
cooking at its best, stuck out here in the country where the woods
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The food's fine, but I like the roadhouse for itself, its pine
paneling and old-style wooden booths, and the walls decorated with
photos from the 1950s: Stars and cars, from Elvis Presley and James
Dean to 1957 Thunderbirds and Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is the jukebox, 12 plays for a dollar, most every
selection a collector's item _ vintage rock 'n' roll, big band
songs from the '40s, classic country and western.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me. Did I mention the ghost?
</P>
<P>
   That's George. Nobody knows exactly where he came from, but when
he died he went to hamburger heaven. He's the only jukebox ghost
I'm familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose he's around all of the time, but you are reminded of
his presence whenever the jukebox cranks up on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the legend. George the ghost plays the jukebox, and
indeed there's a message in his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know about the ghost is that he doesn't like me,'' one
waitress said. ``Whenever I'm working he's always playing 'Slow
Poke.'''
</P>
<P>
   I hate to be the one to break the bad news to George, but
``Detour, There's a Muddy Road Ahead'' might soon be more
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   What with construction of the new Interstate 69 superhighway all
but assured, the Lost in the '50s Roadhouse may end up little more
than a greasy spot in the road.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's worrying some of the Roadhouse gang, that the path
of the new highway is heading our way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other progress has been put on hold. Sharon and Larry
have been planning to add a dance floor. Now it's been postponed,
while we wait to see what the future brings.
</P>
<P>
   The owners declare they'll relocate if necessary, but exactly
where, they're not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just so long as it's somewhere in the country?'' Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' the waitress added. ``You have to be snooty to have a
cafe in town, like I-HOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost in unison, everybody cringed _ George, too, I imagine.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I knew George's plans, whether to move or stay. I guess
he's waiting to see what eternity brings.
</P>
<P>
   But we can always hope for the best. Maybe the highway will make
a big curve, right at the last minute, and, glory be, miss the
roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Dead Man's Curve. George would be honored.

CLASSICAL DISCORD: `HILARY AND JACKIE' HITS A SOUR NOTE WITH SOME
FANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over e in du Pre) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Controversy has brought unexpected attention to the highly
regarded film ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the film had its London premiere Jan. 20, there have been
complaints by friends of famed cellist Jacqueline du Pre that the
movie misrepresents her personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' shows du Pre, who died from multiple
sclerosis in 1987, becoming extremely difficult and demanding as
illness affected her body and career.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre, who is married, asks for and gets permission to have
sexual relations with her sister's husband. And that seems to
offend fans most.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints are aimed at the filmmakers _ the movie was
directed by Anand Tucker and scripted by Frank Cottrell Boyce
(``Welcome to Sarajevo'') _ as well as Hilary and Piers du Pre,
Jacqueline's sister and brother, who wrote the book on which the
film is based, ``A Genius in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the anger has taken in the film's star, Emily
Watson, whose portrayal of Jackie du Pre earned her a Golden Globe
nomination and has put her among the contenders for an Oscar
nomination. Watson felt compelled to come to her own defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get upset when people imply that I don't have a huge amount
of love and respect for Jacqueline du Pre, because I do,'' she said
after the film's London premiere. ``The film is very obviously
about subjective points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the discord should come as no surprise. There is a
tradition of biopics about musicians causing controversy: ``The
Music Lovers'' (Tchaikovsky); ``The Doors'' (Jim Morrison);
``What's Love Got to Do With It'' (Tina and Ike Turner); ``Shine''
(David Helfgott); and, of course, ``Amadeus'' (Mozart and Antonio
Salieri). All have caused debate or outrage at the way the film was
made or the accuracy of how the musician was portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre was born in 1945 in Oxford, and was an acclaimed child
cellist. She made her Carnegie Hall debut at age 20. At 22, she
married conductor Daniel Barenboim in what looked like a storybook
union.
</P>
<P>
   The film portrays her musical career beautifully with exciting,
extravagant camera and editing work.
</P>
<P>
   But at 26, du Pre began showing signs of multiple sclerosis. The
disease soon ended her career. She was paralyzed by age 30 and dead
at 42.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre was close to her sister, Hilary, a closeness movingly
shown in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like telepathy,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie goes back and forth in time and in points of view,
sometimes showing things as Hilary sees them, sometimes as Jackie
might.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, with her illness already affecting her, and her
marriage in trouble, Jackie goes to live with Hilary and her
husband, Christopher ``Kiffer'' Finzi. Jackie begs and demands that
Hilary share Kiffer with her, which Hilary does.
</P>
<P>
   A number of musicians, including Itzhak Perlman, cellist Julian
Lloyd Webber and violinist Yehudi Menuhin, have spoken out angrily,
doubting the truth of the portrayal and in some cases accusing the
writers of exploiting du Pre.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising condemnation came from Clare Finzi, the
daughter of Hilary and Kiffer Finzi, who accuses her mother of
distorting the truth in order to make more money.
</P>
<P>
   Others have come to the defense of the movie and writers,
claiming it does not condemn du Pre, but merely shows an imperfect
human as the public never saw her, in the throes of a devastating
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The (London) Sunday Telegraph published an interview with Hilary
and Kiffer Finzi, about the triangular romance. Finzi said the
agreement between the sisters and him grew as a ``natural
progression,'' and while sex was an ``important part of it,'' it
was not the most important part.
</P>
<P>
   And was he pushed into sleeping with his wife's sister, or did
he go eagerly?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of both,'' Finzi told the Telegraph. ``I was
partly pushed, partly jumped myself and partly pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Watson was first approached to play du Pre, she
was not interested, thinking it would be rather dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Yeah, well, OK, she was a great musician and died
of MS.' There's a biopic in there. Where's the drama?'' said
Watson, Oscar-nominated last year for her role in ``Breaking the
Waves.'' ``Little did I know.''
</P>
<P>
   When she learned about the approach the filmmakers planned, she
changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pitched me the story of how the movie was going to be
from Hilary's point of view and then Jackie's point of view. And
all about their relationship and the thing with Kiffer and then the
illness and Jackie's sense of loneliness and isolation. It was just
an incredibly complex field of emotional range as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away shaking with excitement, and said, `This is the
one; I want to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   She knew the work would be tough, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical challenge of it was terrifying. Learning to play
the cello and learning to do MS. But she is wonderful. She's larger
than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really (study up on her) for this, because
particularly in England, she's so well-known. Her style of playing
is distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also I think you owe it to the person when it's their
story. To study as much as you can and read all there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There did come a point when I had to throw all that away and
make this my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson will next be seen in the film version of the best seller
``Angela's Ashes,'' her seventh movie in three years.
</P>
<P>
   She's not the first actress to find that audiences often do not
look with sympathy on troubled or assertive women characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``An audience desires women to be beautiful and loved and
loving,'' Watson said. ``Ugliness is not very acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   If du Pre's admirers are unhappy about the way the cellist is
portrayed in the movie, they should be more pleased with Watson's
attempts to portray her art correctly. The film has a number of
performance scenes, and Watson did not want to have to fake them or
use hand-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied the cello for about three months before we started,
and very specifically worked on those pieces I had to play,'' she
said. ``I learned the exact, precise pieces. They said `OK, it will
be bar 1-14, or bar 3-20.' Each bar would be about two hours' work
to learn the exact fingering (of the strings).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really read music, so I had to devise a system whereby
I could just learn it by ear, and write down the fingering, and
then learn the bowing. It was a long, laborious process. I didn't
learn anything I wasn't going to play.
</P>

UN-PC LANGUAGE? NIP IT IN THE BUD

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Do you get the heebie-jeebies, or feel waspish,
when a niggardly opponent in straight pool welshes on a bet,
getting off scot-free after complaining about too much English on
the ball? What a gyp.
</P>
<P>
   Does it get your Irish up? Does it put you in a black mood or
make you feel disoriented? Does it cheese your cracker? Do you feel
you have chinks in your armor? Do you feel queer, or strangely gay?
Do you get paranoid as Woody Allen did in ``Annie Hall'' when the
words ``Do you'' are run together?
</P>
<P>
   Well, do you, punk? Don't call the Anti-Defamation League, the
NAACP, the Welsh Liberation Front or the word police at the
Columbia Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   This is an educational exercise. Find the words above that have
gotten me in Dutch with editors or readers. Then explain why
they've been banned from the more sensitive quarters of so-called
liberal society.
</P>
<P>
   Try to explain why Mayor Anthony Williams of Washington, D.C.,
accepted an aide's resignation because the poor guy showed off his
vocabulary by using the word ``niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds bad, but means stingy and comes from ancient
Scandinavian, not the old South.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor of Washington and some of his constituents got
waspish about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waspish'' means ``quick to resent a trifling affront,'' not
``wears pants with whales on them and drinks Bloody Marys through
lockjaw small talk.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time I've ever used ``niggardly'' or
``waspish.'' They sound musty. And ``niggardly'' does sound bad.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP, said the black mayor's
response to his white aide's use of the word ``niggardly'' just
showed how sensitive Americans are to issues of race. ``We have a
hair-trigger mentality and I think that is particularly true of
racial minorities,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Racial minorities can be excused for having that hair-trigger
mentality, given the slurs they've suffered over the years. And
``niggardly'' isn't a common word, although just about everyone has
heard of it now.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's no excuse for a Harvard-educated mayor to pull
the hair trigger. I'm not going to speculate on why Williams had
his aide resign, but the phrase ``political pandering'' may apply.
That's not a slur on the pandas at the Washington zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the find-the-slurs contest. They're all ``lingua non
grata'' because they might set off the alarms of the
hypersensitive.
</P>
<P>
   To welsh on a bet may or may not come from ``Welsh,'' the
people, so we can't use it. Never mind that, according to the
Welsh, English bookies in Wales were the ones who didn't pay off
bets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. I love the Welsh, and I don't gamble. I miss ``gyp,''
though. We used it all the time as kids. But someone says it comes
from ``gypsies.'' The last thing you want is angry gypsies on your
tail.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if I learned anything in my wasted graduate studies
in linguistics at Stanford University, I learned that it's very
hard to figure out the etymologies of words, slang in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the authority, ``Yankee'' comes from the Dutch for
``John Cheese,'' the French ``Anglais'' or the Indian word
``Yengees,'' for English. All I know is, I'm half Yankee in my
native New England and all Yankee in the South, where it's a slur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cracker'' can be a slur, but Florida Crackers use the word
with pride and a capital letter.
</P>
<P>
   Word meaning depends on context and audience. More important,
words mean what they mean now. They don't mean what they used to
mean.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise we could have gay old times, and think that people are
queer or straight without reference to sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we can't risk offending. Yes, someone once called to
complain about the phrase ``chink in the armor,'' which is a lousy
phrase not because it's a slur but because it's a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once complained about my use of ``heebie-jeebies.'' He
thought it came from a truly nasty word derived from ``Hebrew.'' I
looked up ``heebie-jeebies,'' and it was coined by W.B. DeBeck,
creator of the old ``Barney Google'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, until today's Tourette-like attack of un-PC language,
I've avoided most of the words that offend the hypersensitive. I
try never to use words that are truly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord only knows, if you try too hard not to offend, you risk
not communicating at all.
</P>
<P>
   While liberals worry about fashioning a lexicon that offends no
one, the real language of oppression hides its offensiveness in
pretentious and meaningless words.
</P>
<P>
   Take the impeachment trial. It's an echo chamber of the kind of
language George Orwell described in his essay ``Politics and the
English Language.'' All we hear are high-flown words to cover
brute-force politics and lies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is beyond Orwell, of course. He demolished the
basic verb ``is'' the way physicists smashed the atom.
</P>
<P>
   The ugliest stilted phrase in the impeachment is ``the rule of
law.'' It's used by pols who can't figure out the rules or the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of these proceedings'' is truly Orwellian. Just as
Big Brother said ``War is peace,'' our senators say sleaze is
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exit strategy'' is what you look for when you had no strategy
at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closure'' is what politicians seek in a proceeding that should
never have been opened.
</P>
<P>
   We are lulled to sleep. Our politicians give us a niggardly
amount of truth. Yet plain words get our Irish up.
</P>
<P>
   I can half-say that because I'm half Irish.
</P>

THIS SHOW HASN'T ENDED BECAUSE ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People keep saying that they can't wait for the presidential
impeachment drama to end. The public says it's tired of hearing
about it. The media say they're tired of covering it. The
politicians say they're tired of participating in it.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds reasonable. President Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal and
the legal/political firestorm it ignited have been under way for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. In the sound-bite '90s, in the MTV era of
instant gratification and societal memory loss, the typical scandal
has a life span of one news cycle _ or maybe two cycles, if the
scandal is really sexy and involves Julia Roberts or Leonardo
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   But this Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky business goes on day after
day, week after week, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors in the president's Senate impeachment trial
demanded a meeting with Lewinsky last weekend, the media hordes
descended upon the former White House intern as if it were January
1998 and her recreational activities in and around the Oval Office
were still hot-off-the-Web-site news. Lewinsky was probably
wondering why they had to shove all those cameras in her face;
couldn't they have used the pictures they shot last January?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, everybody's tired of it. We're tired of Lewinsky and her
tedious gift exchanges with the president and his secretary. We're
tired of Vernon Jordan and his tedious search for a job for Monica.
We're tired of the ``House managers,'' as the prosecutors are
officially called, and their tedious harangues lecturing us about
the rule of law and the terrible precedent that will be established
if Clinton doesn't get the boot.
</P>
<P>
   If these guys truly cared about the rule of law, they wouldn't
be trying to unseat a duly elected president of the United States
who commands unwavering _ if confounding _ support among the
American people. Rather than upholding the rule of law, the
managers have turned the rule of law on its head by subverting the
Constitution in the service of a political vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that they don't have a right to do it. If
the Republicans want to fritter away their congressional majority
by unseating the president in defiance of the public will, it's
certainly their prerogative to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us would have preferred to see Republicans use their
hard-won political clout to address crucial issues that were too
long ignored by a Congress that was too long ruled by Democrats.
But that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   The issue on the table is this matter of just about everyone
having had it up to here with the never-ending process of
impeachment. Even some of the Clinton-haters want to know why it
has to take so long: Why can't they just convict the bum, bounce
him out of the White House and swear in Al Gore as the new
president?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question, of course, is that they probably
can't convict Clinton at all _ not today, not next week, not next
month. The chances that enough Democrats will abandon the president
to provide a two-thirds Senate vote for conviction range somewhere
between none and less than none.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason that Republicans want to extend the trial is to
prolong the embarrassment to Clinton _ assuming he is capable of
suffering embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe there's one other reason. It's the ugly little
secret about our alleged desperation to conclude the saga of Monica
and Bill: We really don't want it to end.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have become addicted to the scandal and to everything
that goes with it. Entire TV networks depend on the scandal as the
centerpiece of their programming. Radio talkmeisters and newspaper
columnists count on the scandal to fuel their commentary on even
the slowest news day. Insomniacs turn to late-night dissections of
the day's impeachment proceedings to induce much-needed slumber.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is that the scandal has woven itself into the
fabric of daily life in this country. We don't want it to end
because we're afraid we'll discover that we can't live without it.

ALTAVISTA'S SEARCH FOR A NEW IDENTITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What does an Internet search engine do when it shows up late
at the portal party and wants to grab attention?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bring a flashy friend with lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the latecomer is AltaVista, the high-powered
search engine created and only marginally nurtured by Digital
Equipment Corp. at www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled amigo is Compaq Computer Corp., which swallowed
Digital _ and thus got its mitts on AltaVista _ in a $9 billion
acquisition last year.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Compaq announced this week that it was creating a
new subsidiary to turn the search engine into a full-blown Internet
portal _ or ``destination site,'' in the current industry jargon.
The AltaVista Co. will be run by one of Compaq's shiniest golden
boys, Rod Schrock. He's the man largely responsible for making
Compaq's Presarios the best-selling brand of consumer PCs.
Eventually, AltaVista will be spun off into a separate public
company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PLAYING CATCH-UP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has a lot of catching up to do. While it is arguably
the best search engine on the Internet, that's all it is. In the
past few months, Compaq has redesigned the site so it offers some
of the features you'd expect to find at an Internet portal, but
they lack the punch and depth of what you'd find at Lycos, Excite
and certainly Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   If that's all Compaq did with AltaVista, it'd be pretty
pathetic. But Compaq also beefed up what made AltaVista great in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   When AltaVista made its debut in late 1995, it was welcomed as
breakthrough technology. Compared to existing search engines at the
time _ primarily Lycos, WebCrawler and Excite _ it was far more
thorough and much, much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Serious computer geeks loved AltaVista. The search engine often
returned tens or hundreds of thousands of pages in a response to a
query. If you made use of somewhat arcane commands, you could
narrow your search. Novices were overwhelmed, but techno-veterans
were ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   When Compaq became the proud owner of AltaVista, the company
immediately set out to make the site friendlier, and to make
searches easier and yield better results. Several cool features
were added, including technology from a company called Ask Jeeves
that lets you phrase your search as a question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of searching for vegetarian spaghetti recipes by typing
``spaghetti + recipes and vegetarian,'' you can just ask: ``Where
can I find recipes for vegetarian spaghetti?'' For the most part,
this works fairly well _ the query does indeed lead to some mighty
tasty eatin' _ but it also can yield some unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
YOUR RESULTS MAY VARY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the day that Compaq announced it was spinning
off AltaVista, the site used, ``What's the biggest news on the
Internet today?'' as an example of a question-based search. Next to
the question was the word ``Answer'' as a clickable link. Click on
it, and you saw a search results page with the ``Compaq to spin off
AltaVista today'' news release as the lead item.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, they'd call this playing with loaded dice and
someone would be arrested. On the commercialized Internet, it's
called ``marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you manually typed ``What's the biggest news on the
Internet today?'' into the AltaVista query field and didn't use the
canned search, then the first item on the list, and supposedly the
most relevant, was something called ``100 Stupidest Sites:
Archives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the technology has a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that different search engines are better than
others, depending on what kind of information you're after. The
original AltaVista was great if you knew an exact string of words
on a Web page _ just put them between quotes in the search field,
and you'd find the page almost instantly. The new AltaVista still
has that capability, but with this question-based feature, it's now
also good at finding specific items and topics.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo at www.yahoo.com remains the best search site if you are
after topic-based information. Want to find great sites devoted to,
say, ``The X-Files''? Yahoo has 'em in its directory structure,
which is compiled by real humans. Humans are smarter than computers
_ well, most of them _ and that means a search with a capital X in
it won't also get you X-rated sites at Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital's HotBot at www.hotbot.com is best at finding
people. It has a drop-down box that lets you search in different
ways _ all the words in a query, any of the words or an exact
phrase. But the most useful one is ``the person,'' so you can
quickly find an individual's name if it appears on a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sites have wrapped themselves in the glitzy
trappings of an Internet portal, complete with chat rooms, message
boards, news digests and site reviews. Searching has become almost
secondary in the scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has a great opportunity to develop into a portal
that's not just warm and fuzzy and always trying to sell you
something, but is actually useful, too. Although it has great
potential as a moneymaker, it will thrive best _ and best serve the
Internet as a whole _ if its new owners don't forget its roots.

COMPUTERS: WHAT'S ONLINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Mystery of love: Do you remember your first serious,
adolescent kiss? Chances are it was clumsy, but you got it right
through _ ahem _ dogged trial and error. Imagine having had a
resource such as Adolescent Adulthood at
www.adolescentadulthood.com/ at your disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a guide to ``flirting, dating and dumping,'' it's a
sensitive but plain-spoken look at teen romance. Begin with the
initial guide on kissing, which really deals more with strategy and
head placement than the actual lip-locking.
</P>
<P>
   For actual kissing, you can move on to advanced techniques. The
site is written in the voice of a teen, such as this paragraph on
how much movement should happen in a kiss: ``Men that just clamp
their lips on their girlfriends when kissing and never move their
lips or alter the angle of the kiss, lose out on the whole rhythm
and motion of a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   It should be something dynamic and explorative, ever-changing,
but not explorative in the way that some people stuff their tongues
in your mouth as though they were searching for buried treasure or
something!'' Other sections include tips on the art of flirting and
how to gently disengage from a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobile century: Although the automobile was invented in the
19th century, it didn't come into its own until the 20th. The
auto's impact on society is profound _ the design of our modern
cities is built around automobile access, for example. But which
single automobile deserves the title of Car of the Century? You can
vote for this honor at a site by that name at www.cotc.com.
</P>
<P>
   In order to vote, you will have to register and get a password
to enter the site, but it's free. Once inside the site, you can
browse through a list of 100 different cars of all types and from
different countries. Among them: the original Volkswagen Beetle,
the Toyota Corolla, the Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, the Ford Mustang,
the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, the Chrysler Airflow, the BMW 328,
the Cadillac El Dorado, the Ford Model T. There are some noticeably
missing from the list, including the Ford Thunderbird and the
Volkswagen Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   You get to pick 10 _ no more, no less _ and you're then
presented with pictures of the 10 to make sure you picked the ones
you meant. You can then use your password to change your vote
later. The winning car will be named in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ Questionable content: Picking which films to let young kids
see is not easy. A film that might be rated PG may have material
that you wouldn't want your 8-year-old to see, but some PG-13 films
may be just fine. Kids-in-Mind at www.kids-in-mind.com rates films
solely by the type of content _ those things to which some parents
might object. The site does not try to review movies based on
artistry or political value _ it's strictly whether there's sex,
violence or profanity in them. Each film gets a three-number rating
_ the first number for sex, the second for violence and the third
for language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the film ``At First Sight,'' with Val Kilmer and
Mira Sorvino, gets a 5.1.3. It's got some sex and nudity, a tiny
amount of violence and a little rough language. (The motion picture
ratings board rates it PG-13.) The site, which began on America
Online in 1992, features ratings of both new movies and videos,
making it an excellent resource.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stranger than science: What so-called paranormal phenomena are
worthy of scientific study? The Journal of Scientific Exploration
seeks to answer that question through scientific approaches to
normally extra-scientific topics. The online edition of the
Journal, at www.jse.com/JSEHome.html, features sample articles from
the publication on everything from dowsing _ looking for water
using a Y-shaped stick _ to phobias in children who claim to
remember past lives.
</P>
<P>
   These are not a bunch of crackpots, but rather serious
scientists _ the editorial board includes representatives from the
Sorbonne in Paris, Harvard Medical School and the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be fooled: Nearly 99.9 percent of all the dire warnings
about viruses that pass between clueless Internet newcomers are
bogus. In most cases, they are rehashings of old hoaxes that were
supposedly laid to rest long ago. If you get one of these
panic-inducing e-mails, how can you find out if it's real or not?
Try the Stiller Research Virus Hoax News page at
www.stiller.com/hoaxes.htm for information on hoax warnings, both
old and new.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shade-Web mechanic: Yahoo has introduced a new feature that
uses its unique, hierarchical way of organizing information to
create a troubleshooting tool for diagnosing car problems. Yahoo
Autos at autos.yahoo.com/repair/tree/0.html begins by asking you to
choose a symptom _ something you hear, see, smell or feel about the
car. Then, as you click through the steps, you can find suggestions
for what it might be. Hearing a buzzing noise coming from the
transmission? It might be that your fluid and filter need changing.

DAILY SHUTDOWN DOES DESKTOP PC GOOD

<P>
   Q: On the shutdown screen in Windows 98, I see several choices
besides just shutting down the computer. One of them is Standby,
which seems to be a kind of go-to-sleep mode. I can also go into
standby by pushing a button on my computer's keyboard. Should I use
this? Or should I shut down the computer completely?
</P>
<P>
   A: The standby feature is indeed a way to put the computer to
sleep, letting you power it down and start it up without going
through the lengthy boot-up and shutdown process.
</P>
<P>
   It was first found on notebook computers, where it makes a lot
of sense. With a portable system, you may need to move from one
place to another and yet you wouldn't want to wait for start-up or
shutdown to happen. It's also good for power management _ if you go
away from a running notebook for a while, it will go to sleep to
save battery life.
</P>
<P>
   In a desktop PC, the standby mode has two functions: energy
savings and convenience. When it's asleep, the computer is still
drawing power, but not nearly as much as when it's up and running.
And the standby feature simulates instant-on and instant-off.
</P>
<P>
   There's a problem here, though, and it has to do with some of
the limitations inherent in Windows 95/98.
</P>
<P>
   As you work with Windows throughout the day, little things go
wrong under the hood that you can't see. Poorly written programs
claim memory space and system resources, then don't give them back.
Other programs step on each other's memory areas, but not quite
enough to generate a program crash. Buggy programs do things they
shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a session, your operating system isn't quite as
robust as it should be. The best way to fix this is to reboot your
system. But if you use standby mode at the end of the day, then
awaken the PC the next morning, the system still has the flaws left
over from the previous day's work. Eventually, you'll start having
problems.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's best to use a full power-down at the end of the
day. Save standby mode for when you need to be away from the PC for
a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   However, help may be on the way. In the next year or so, you'll
start to see personal computers with a feature called OnNow.
Windows 98 already supports it, and now it's the hardware-makers'
turn. Supposedly, it will greatly shorten the boot-up process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to use scanned images of photographs as
wallpaper and screen savers in Windows 95?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   For photos, save them as you scan them in Bitmap format _ with a
.BMP extension _ and put them in the Windows folder. Then, when you
choose your background (right-click on the desktop, Properties,
then Background), you'll see the file there. Choose it and click
Apply to save it as your background wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   For screen savers, it's a bit trickier, depending on what you
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a newer version of Windows 95 (B or later), or
Windows 98, there is a screen saver called 3D Flying Objects that
can display .BMP files as a flag that floats around onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Again, right-click on the desktop and choose Properties. From
the Settings button in the Screen Saver tab, choose Textured Flag.
You can then select the image you want the flag to hold.
</P>
<P>
   There also are some commercial and shareware screensaver
programs that will rotate selected images. Check
www.screensavers.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am going to be spending some time in Toronto. How can I
access America Online there?
</P>
<P>
   A: America Online has an area devoted just to providing phone
numbers for international travelers. Do a keyword International
Access to get to this area, where you can search for phone numbers
in specific cities. You may have to pay extra fees to use the
numbers, however.

`THIN RED LINE' PRODUCER INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A producer of the critically acclaimed movie ``The
Thin Red Line'' has been indicted on charges that he illegally
obtained more than $28,000 worth of airline tickets from a San
Antonio travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Michael Geisler was indicted Wednesday by a Bexar County
grand jury on one count of theft of $20,000 to $100,000, a
third-degree felony that carries a penalty of two to 10 years in
prison, and/or a fine of up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Geisler stopped payment on a check
issued last Sept. 3 from his New York company, Stage Fright LLC, to
purchase $28,480.10 worth of airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets, provided by Herff Travel Inc. of San Antonio, were
to be used for flights to London, Venice, Paris and other
destinations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio bank advised Herff that the New York company had
stopped payment on the check five days after it was issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, he had bought them to attend the Venice Film
Festival,'' said Cliff Herberg, chief of the white-collar crime
division of the Bexar County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Herberg said his office confirmed the airline tickets had been
used by several associates of Geisler. A warrant for Geisler's
arrest was issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line,'' released nationwide Jan. 15, was the
fourth- highest grossing film over the past weekend with box office
receipts of nearly $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel by James Jones, the film chronicles the lives
of several members of an Army infantry company during the World War
II battle of Guadalcanal.

ADVERTISERS HOPE TO CREATE A BUZZ WITH THEIR EXPENSIVE SUPER BOWL
SPOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDRA BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Super Bowl Sunday is almost here. That can mean only one thing:
It's time to sit back with a beer and a burger and watch the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the National Football League's title game has
become a forum for advertisers and creative directors at ad
agencies to show off. And why not? It's anticipated that this
year's game, between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons, will
draw as many as 120 million U.S. viewers. Super Bowl ads are
rehashed just about as much as the play-by-play next to the office
water cooler Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the Super Bowl is big,'' said Pat D'Amato, a
spokeswoman with candy-maker M&AMP;M Mars, a perennial Super Bowl
advertiser. ``It's the biggest event of the year. It has the
biggest number of viewers. The stakes are big, and so are the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network, which is broadcasting Sunday's game, said it
has sold its inventory of 58 ad slots during the game to more than
30 advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are paying a record premium for their rights to show
off _ reportedly between $1.6 million and $2 million for a
30-second spot this year. That is more than the record average $1.3
million NBC garnered last year.
</P>
<P>
   The expense of these spots has become so great that advertisers
are increasingly using their Super Bowl ads as part of larger
campaigns, diminishing the risk of a multimillion-dollar game spot
that doesn't register with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's list of advertisers includes American Express, Apple
Computer, Oldsmobile, Victoria's Secret and Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is returning to the game for the first time since 1985.
Its spot reportedly will feature Hal 9000, the computer from the
film ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Anheuser-Busch, which has been the
Super Bowl's lone beer advertiser, will again be in this year's
game. National news media speculation has it that Busch will kill
off one of the lizard characters _ possibly Louie _ that appear in
its current advertising.
</P>
<P>
   E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the title character in the 1982
blockbuster movie, will return to Earth for this year's Super Bowl
advertising extravaganza as a spokescreature for Progressive
Insurance, the nation's fifth-largest auto insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, E.T.'s experience this time is different than his
last. After this visit, he returns to his spaceship, talks of life
on Earth and laments that people rush around in cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beeee goooood and beeee progressive,'' E.T. says in a
60-second spot that will appear just before the
Progressive-sponsored halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are ready to fall in love with E.T. all over
again,'' said Bill McMillan, consumer marketing director for
Progressive, which is based in Cleveland. ``It should be very
exciting to see. It's very, very engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Progressive, which is appearing in its first Super Bowl, and
other advertisers hope for as much from their spots.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 game, advertisers spent $78 million, up 97
percent from expenditures for the 1990 game, according to New
York-based Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers have good reason to believe that people pay
attention. A survey of 1,000 adults last weekend by the research
firm Eisner &AMP; Associates indicated that 7 percent of the audience
tunes in just to see the advertisements and more than one-third
expect to discuss them Monday morning, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better avenue than the Super Bowl,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   American Express began teasing consumers with a series of four
15-second ads during the National Football League's divisional
playoff games. The launching will culminate during the Super Bowl
with the debut of a 60-second ad featuring comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   The teaser ads featured Seinfeld on the set of his old TV
situation comedy and made references to several episodes of the
show. American Express is not revealing details of the final
commercial, but another celebrity will appear, said John Hayes, the
company's executive vice president of global advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial tells a story with a surprise ending, a tale
with a twist,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, which in 1995 brought viewers the high-tech campaign that
saw a youngster suck himself into a Pepsi bottle, will advertise
for a 14th consecutive year, spokesman John Harris said. Spots will
appear during the pregame programming and the first half. Pepsi was
the Super Bowl's No. 2 advertiser last year, spending $9.1 million,
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Pepsi spots will advertise Mountain Dew and the new
Pepsi One. Actor and Pepsi One pitch man Cuba Gooding Jr. will
appear in the Pepsi One spot, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating it now in Los Angeles,'' Harris said. ``We're
making it the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;M Mars, which introduced a female M&AMP;M character during the
Super Bowl in 1997, will again use the game to launch its campaign
for the new Crispy M&AMP;M. M&AMP;M has purchased seven spots before and
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Halle Berry, Deidrich Bader and Patrick Warburton will
appear in the commercials. The concept behind the ads focuses on
how introducing ``Crispy'' during all the Super Bowl hoopla might
not be such a good idea, said D'Amato, the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize Crispy is extremely nervous about crowd control;
however, we're counting on the support of Yellow, Blue, Green and
especially Red, to help calm his stage fright,'' she said.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Can you get a virus by just reading your
e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Hot Zone
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ZONE: Hey! My computer's not working anymore! And all I did
was read your lousy little letter. Why, I oughta. ...
</P>
<P>
   Whoops! The keyboard was unplugged again. Although nobody can
ensure you'll never, ever get some nasty killer virus by reading an
e-mail, it's pretty unlikely. Sure, there are legions of
pimply-faced losers out there working on a sure-fire way to do just
that, but it's only because they couldn't get dates for the ``Star
Trek'' convention and they have nothing better to do. Hmmm. Do you
think if I started a date-a-geek service, we wouldn't have to worry
about viruses ever again?
</P>
<P>
   Until I can find some women desperate enough to wear ``I Grok
Spock'' buttons, though, you'll have to protect yourself. Just last
summer, security problems were discovered in Microsoft Outlook and
Outlook Express and a few other e-mail programs. If a message had
an attachment with a really long file name, the programs would
freeze. It was even possible that a really dateless doofus could
embed system-killer code into the file name.
</P>
<P>
   Your defense is simple: Always use the latest versions of all
Internet software. Netscape and Microsoft are very responsive when
security problems pop up. Patches or new versions show up on their
Web sites within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of attachments, a virus is much more likely to show up
there than in the body of the letter, which is nothing but text. An
attachment is a program file or a graphic or a word-processing
document or a dancing-baby video or a killer virus that hitches a
ride with the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Never open an attachment unless you're absolutely sure about
what it is. If I were one of those pathetic, lonely nerds sitting
at home on prom night, that's exactly where I'd put a virus,
especially if Mindy had laughed at me when I asked her to go with
me. Tramp. Your mail program has an option to save the attachment
to a disk. If it'll fit on a floppy, that's the place for it. Once
it's saved, run a virus check on it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you see Mindy, tell her that I only stay home Saturday
nights because I don't want to miss ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' and
that I hope she's happy living there in the trailer park with
Steve. I wonder if he ever found a job.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Several Web sites have links that require Adobe
Acrobat Reader, which was preinstalled in my Performa. I have tried
in vain to make this work. I just received a solicitation for the
latest Acrobat upgrade, but why the heck would I want to buy it
when I can't make their earlier version operate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Righteously Indignant
</P>
<P>
   DEAR RIGHT: You shouldn't have to buy it at all: Acrobat Reader
is a freebie. Acrobat, the program that makes files out of all
sorts of word-processing and desktop-publishing documents, costs.
</P>
<P>
   Using Acrobat is a common way to distribute manuals, government
forms and love letters to Mindy, but your old version of Reader may
not work with newer files. Get a fresh Reader from www.adobe.com
and let it install itself. Your browser will do the rest.
</P>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Do you act with bold directness?
</P>
<P>
   Are you someone who gets it done and makes no excuses? Do you
refuse to agonize over which style is ``in'' today?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you probably want your life to be simple and
straightforward. A good personal motto could be ``I'll Decide.''
</P>
<P>
   You might be a caveman.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that. A Houston-area
company wants you to be proud of being a caveman _ so proud you'll
be willing to wear their line of Caveman shirts, shorts, boxers and
caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the caveman deserves respect,'' said Bob Yrshus,
co-founder of Cavewear. ``If you think about it, the caveman was
incredibly successful. He didn't have anything to work with, just
his bare hands, but he survived. We are all here, aren't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Like the primitive creature that inspired them, Caveman clothes
started out with little to work with. But to the astonishment of
the founders, they have survived, evolved and now show signs of
being able to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. It's different, and the shirts feel great,'' said
Richard Adler, a customer who also happens to be president of the
Houston Aeros, a minor-league hockey team. ``Our staff wore the
shirts at the IHL (International Hockey League) All-Star game, and
all sorts of people from the other teams were coming up to us and
asking, `Where did you get that stuff?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cavewear started out as nothing more than an office joke shared
among three Houston stockbrokers who work together at the brokerage
firm D.E. Wine Investments. During long sessions mapping out
investment strategies, Yrshus noticed that partner Randy Miller
never pulled his punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is blunt in business meetings. If something needs to be
said, he says it without hesitation, regardless of who is
insulted,'' Yrshus said. ``One day I just looked at him and said,
`You are a caveman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Miller wasn't flattered by the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kinda got insulted by it,'' Yrshus said. ``He thought I was
calling him a knucklehead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller thought it over, and his new nickname started to grow
on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After awhile, I started liking it,'' Miller said. ``Pretty
soon, we were all calling each other caveman.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke probably would have ended there if the partners had not
also shared a common loathing of a certain type of fashion
advertising that appears on the pages of Men's Journal, Men's
Health and other magazines they like to read in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising seems to say, `You can be a guy or a girl. You
can decide later,''' Miller said. ``It really got to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The final straw was a Tommy Hilfiger ad that showed a bunch of
men prancing around in tartan skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought about going into the clothing business, but
the tartan skirt thing pushed us over the edge,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They forced our hand,'' Yrshus said grimly.
</P>
<P>
   The partners _ Yrshus, Miller and Duncan Wine _ decided to make
themselves a batch of golf shirts with a caveman theme. They hired
a local graphic designer to come up with a logo, and then had the
custom-made caveman stitched on about 10 golf shirts that they wore
around the office and golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys would see the shirts, and they just loved the Caveman,''
Yrshus said. ``They asked us for a shirt, so we made some more of
them and gave them away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the requests kept coming, the stockbrokers realized they
had a business opportunity on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically capitalists at heart,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The trio spent a year researching how to get a trademark and
securing all the rights they would ultimately need to protect their
Caveman logo. They also decided what kind of clothes they would
come up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of T-shirts out there. But if you look at
them, most of them are junk,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   If Cavewear clothes weren't tough, no one would buy into the
logo or its message of hard-working simplicity. It would have to be
able to stand up to the punishment of cave living _ not to mention
offer colors dark enough to hide pizza and salsa stains.
</P>
<P>
   So Cavewear decided to make its T-shirts out of heavier
material, and gave them a fuller cut, with a bigger neck and longer
sleeves. This past summer, Cavewear started commercially selling
its clothes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The company opened a kiosk in a mall in northwest Houston and
started selling its wares online at www.cavewear.com.
</P>
<P>
   During the Christmas season, it opened temporary kiosks at two
other Houston-area malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales were good, so now we are looking to take the company to
the next level,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   During its three or four months of business last year, the
company pulled in sales of about $250,000. Miller figures Cavewear
can hit sales of a ``couple million'' this year. The company is
negotiating a deal that could get displays in a local sporting
goods chain. Cavewear also opened its first free-standing store _ a
little shop on the waterfront in Kemah, a fishing community of
1,500 people about 30 miles southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To help boost sales, Cavewear is marketing its clothing through
sponsorship of the Houston Aeros. The Caveman logo now decorates a
spot near the Aeros' home ice. Pretty soon, the Caveman will take a
more permanent position by the visitors' penalty box, which will be
known as The Cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put the logo up in the visitors' penalty box,'' said the
Aeros' Adler.
</P>
<P>
   The Caveman will feature some primitive-looking sandal-skates.
His traditional club will be refashioned into a rough hockey stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he is an animated figure, there is a lot you can do
with him,'' Adler said. ``I think that gives the Caveman a lot of
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the success or failure of the Caveman will rest in
the response he evokes from men who are turned off by unisex styles
and clothing companies that are slavishly devoted to chasing the
next hip fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That market is trendy. We aren't trendy. We are
anti-fashion,'' Yrshus said. ``We aim our stuff at guys like us,
who are 30 years old or older. They aren't glamourpusses. They have
figured out who they are and they are comfortable with that. ... I
think we can put one of these shirts on the back of every
middle-aged guy in America.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Caveman may be strong and sure of himself, it
helps a bunch if the Cavewear shirts don't make his wife boiling
mad. So far, that doesn't seem to be a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who are buying our stuff are women. They
are buying it for their cavemen,'' Yrshus said. ``The caveman is
not a brute. He doesn't just sit on the couch, drinking beer and
watching football. He is a successful and uncomplicated guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women consider their guys to be cavemen,'' he added,
``and they like it that way.''

BATTLE LINES DRAWN BETWEEN REEVES AND SHANAHAN AND ELWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The air conditioner was switched on a few days ago. It
is a reflex move in south Florida. Automatic. Feel the heat. Flip
on the switch that brings in the cooling air.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Dan Reeves was sweaty, Mike Shanahan was sweaty,
John Elway was sweaty, and Pat Bowlen was sweaty. Uncomfortable,
all of them, in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Miami heat. They weren't sweaty because of the 80
degrees on the thermometer day after day, or the humidity wafting
in from the tropics, but uncomfortable because of their self-made
heat, heat from their own words, heat from their anger. And that
heat was a lot hotter than Miami's January norm.
</P>
<P>
   So they all wiped the sweat from their brows one last time and
reached for the air conditioner switch at the same instant. Dan
Reeves said he would not talk of The Feud anymore. Mike Shanahan
said the same. So did John Elway, but not before one last shot at
Reeves _ that Elway felt he had been a better quarterback ``in the
last six years.'' Precisely the period since Reeves departed as
Broncos coach and Shanahan replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question I've been better off since Mike's been
here,'' Elway said. ``And I think the numbers back that up rather
convincingly (158 touchdown passes and 157 interceptions in 10
years under Reeves, 142 TDs and 69 interceptions in six years under
Shanahan, whose tenure also has been punctuated by the emergence of
Terrell Davis). I've bene playing better the last six years than I
did the previous 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last blast of heat before the air conditioner
hummed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, all those friends were great friends of mine,''
said Reeves, now coaching the Falcons and preparing to face the
Broncos in the Super Bowl Sunday. ``I'd like to get back to as
close to that as can be. And it's not going to happen with me
trying to tell my side of the story and (Shanahan) telling his side
of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much has been said about The Feud, Shanahan said upon
arriving in Miami. ``The emphasis should be on the players and the
teams, and as far as I'm concerned, it's over with,'' said the
Denver coach, ``There were a lot of positives from my years working
with Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Bowlen not only reached for the air conditioner
switch but flipped it on ``high,'' searching for the most frigid
air to cool the heat. Bowlen said that once Reeves is retired from
coaching, he just might deserve to be included in Denver's Ring of
Honor, the list of names of Bronco greats on the facade of Mile
High Stadium. Cooling words.
</P>
<P>
   But the cool breezes from air conditioning are not natural.
They're artificial, man-made. Turn off the air conditioning or step
outside and the blast of heat returns.
</P>
<P>
   Same here. The heat from The Feud does not go away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one basic law of professional football that kindled
this feud. Players come and players go. Coaches come and coaches
go. Assistant coaches come and assistant coaches go. But owners do
not go.
</P>
<P>
   And an amendment to this law is that owners often are much
closer and more loyal to a star quarterback than to a coach. Smart
quarterbacks sometimes build closer relationships with their owner
than with their coach. That's because football owners almost
invariably make the same decision when a dispute between their
coach and their star quarterback threatens the team _ they jettison
the coach and keep their QB happy.
</P>
<P>
   So all pretense was gone when Reeves ignored Elway's pleas after
the 1992 season that the Broncos desperately needed a wide
receiver; the coach not only wouldn't select Tennesssee receiver
Carl Pickens with his first-round draft pick but went out of his
way to choose a quarterback, and the eminently mediocre Tommy
Maddox from UCLA at that. Any remnant of trust between the Broncos'
coach and the Broncos' QB was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   That trust never had been particularly strong from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years earlier, midway through a 5-11 season in 1990,
Elway had told the Denver media that the players considered Reeves
aloof, autocratic, and inflexible. ``This year has been the
worst,'' Elway told a Denver Post columnist. ``We hardly talk to
each other unless it's game time. I don't care if you use the part
about the friction between me and Dan. If he wants to confront me
about it, it's probably better, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was stunned by Elway's comments. ``I was totally
blindsided,'' the coach said at the time. ``I didn't see anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the point.
</P>
<P>
   According to Denver lore, Reeves had marched into the office of
a certain offensive coordinator and shouted, ``How did this get in
the paper?'' The coordinator, Shanahn, supposedly said, ``Why are
you yelling at me? I had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the tensions mounted when Elway's agent confirmed
that Reeves and Washington coach Joe Gibbs had discussed a possible
trade of the QB to the Redskins. Reeves said Gibbs had initiated
the talks, but that made no difference to Elway, who said he
learned of them when talking with former Washington running back
Earnest Byner.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elway, Byner told him, QB, `` `I thought you were
going to be a Redskin.' I said, 'What are you talking about?' So I
got him to tell me the whole story. When I heard about it, it
didn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen, meanwhile, had put the kibosh on the talks. The owner
told the Denver media he had become aware of them, but ``I just
said, `There's no way we're going to do the deal. Forget it.' So it
never got off the talking-on-the-telephone stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The first law of professional football. The owner stands with
his star QB. That hint in 1991 would become a reality soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   There had been an earlier hint, a hint way back in 1983, that
this relationship between Elway, then a hotheaded rookie from
Stanford, and Reeves would not be smooth. Reeves had benched Elway
that rookie season, and the two had gotten into a shouting match,
the coach telling his young QB, among other things, ``We're bad for
each other,'' and ``We're both impatient.'' The two, though,
promised to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Which they tried to do for the next decade. But it all ended
after the 1992 season when Reeves was fired by Bowlen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years have been hell,'' Elway told Sports
Illustrated after the firing. ``I know that I would not have been
back here if Dan Reeves had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reeves, ``Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me,
either. One of these days, I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature
sometime.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 MIAMI: ... mature sometime.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When this all started, Mike Shanahan was coaching at the
University of Florida, where he was assistant head coach and
offensive coordinator. In 1984, Reeves brought Shanahan to the
Broncos as receivers coach, and in 1985, Reeves elevated Shanahan
to offensive coordinator of the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Shanahan and Elway became very close, as most
offensive coordinators and star quarterbacks do. But their
relationship went beyond that as the two became close friends.
</P>
<P>
   They played golf together, spent time in each other's homes,
schmoozed, dissected film, analyzed opponents' defenses, and during
the offseason when Elway couldn't find any Denver wide receivers
with whom practice his passing, Shanahan would put on his cleats
and play catch with him in a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as the distance grew between Elway and Reeves,
Elway and Shanahan only grew tighter. ``There's a bond there, a
trust there,'' said Shanahan. ``There's a belief in one another.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which was there between Elway and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos went to Super Bowls XXI and XXII with Reeves as head
coach and Shanahan as coordinator, and then, in 1988, Shanahan was
hired as head coach by Al Davis's Raiders. Shanahan was a green
coach then and tried to impose some strict rules on the Raiders,
traditionally vagabonds. The styles of Shanahan and the Raiders
couldn't have been further apart. He was fired early in his second
season by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan returned to Denver as receivers coach midway through
that 1989 season and the next year became offensive coordinator, a
move that was brought about more by Bowlen than Reeves. According
to sources, Reeves did not want Shanahan back a second time as
offensive coordinator but Bowlen knew from Elway how close the two
had been during his first five years in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, though, said it was his idea to bring back Shanahan to
Denver. ``As soon as Mike was let go by the Raiders, I was the
first one to go to Pat and say, `This would be great if we could
get him back,' '' said Reeves. ``So I had tremendous respect for
Mike. He's as good a football coach as I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, though, the relationship between Reeves and
Shanahan became as strained as the one between Reeves and Elway. It
was a football triangle, a football soap opera, and in the end, a
football divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The path to many divorces is fueled by suspicion, and suspicion
abounded in this triangle. Elway felt Reeves was too conservative,
Shanahan felt Reeves's offense was helter-skelter, and Elway would
commiserate with Shanahan, his guru. Reeves finally would suspect
that Shanahan and Elway were sabotaging Denver's game plans when
Elway purposely freelanced and ignored the play called, all with
Shanahan's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John Elway had come out of his rookie season with the type
of players and the system we have now,'' Shanahan told the Denver
media, taking a double shot at Reeves's personnel decisions and
coaching ability, ``I think he'd have a number of Super Bowls under
his belt. When I was with the Broncos for three Super Bowls, I'd
come back at the end of the season and try to put tapes together
and take them to clinics. I tried to explain what we were trying to
do on offense, but most of the plays were John just freewheeling
and making something happen when things broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway was even more critical of Reeves, both during the bitter
days of 1990-92 and in retrospect. When Elway's pictorial
autobiography came out last year in the euphoria of the Broncos'
Super Bowl win over Green Bay, the quarterback wrote this: ``I
thought (Reeves) didn't take full advantage of my passing skills .
. . Even though Dan and I didn't have a good relationship, and even
though we didn't have the ideal system, we won a lot of great
football games . . . Just not enough of them. There's a reason why
I was always making those come-from-behind victories; we were
always behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides were drawn: Elway and Shanahan vs. their head coach,
Reeves. And Reeves's suspicions grew, the head coach believing that
Shanahan had been insubordinate by leaking back to Elway criticisms
Reeves had uttered about the quarterback in candid coaches'
meetings. So before the 1992 season, Reeves fired Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my team back,'' Bowlen said at the time. And the first
law of pro football mandates that when the guru and close friend of
your star quarterback is fired by your head coach, an owner has
only one recourse: Pat Bowlen fired Dan Reeves after the 1992
season.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the sordid mess was unhappy and bitter. Mike
Shanahan had been fired, Dan Reeves had been fired, John Elway had
lost his guru and friend, and Pat Bowlen had ``lost'' his team.
Divorces can do that to a family.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years passed as the football gods plotted their ultimate in
ironies. Shanahan and Reeves did not talk to each other, Reeves and
Elway did not talk to each other, and it would not be until six
years later that words would pass between Reeves and his
antagonists, each time at a golf course. Reeves and Shanahan played
golf at an owners meeting last year, and Reeves and Elway met last
year at Augusta National Golf Club, where they chatted for several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The hurt, though, had not passed for Reeves. He had given
Shanahan his first job in pro football and felt he had been
betrayed. ``There's still a lot of hurt that won't go away,'' said
Reeves. He also had heard the words and whispers and rumors from
Denver for years about Elway's disdain for him. As he said while
coaching the Giants, the breakup in Denver ``changed my life, and I
don't know that I've fully recovered from it.''
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   And the football gods reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos won the AFC title and the Atlanta Falcons won
the NFC title. Mike Shanahan coaches the Broncos. Such an irony.
Dan Reeves coaches the Falcons. Such an exquisite irony. Dan Reeves
must now plot to stop John Elway, and John Elway must now scheme to
defeat Dan Reeves. Such a delicious irony.
</P>
<P>
   And the football gods' final twist of Fate? The backup
quarterback for the Falcons is Steve DeBerg, whom Elway replaced as
Denver's starter in Elway's first exhibition season 15 years ago.
And when Reeves benched Elway in that first season, it was DeBerg
who took Elway's place.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Georgia, a reporter from Denver asked Reeves a
simple question about all this, all these protagonists and
antagonists being tossed together in Super Bowl XXXIII. It was as
if a dam had burst.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves repeated his suspicions about Shanahan's disloyalty. He
said he would talk to those people in Denver, but ``I won't go out
to eat with them or go socially to a function with them.'' And,
said Reeves, ``There's still a lot of hurt that won't go away. You
never will forget those things.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Shanahan said from Denver that Dan Reeves has no proof
of disloyalty and he's tired of Reeves repeating these accusations.
</P>
<P>
   And so they all flew to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And flicked on the air conditioner.

DUBLIN LOCKS PUB DOORS TO BRITISH STAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ English stag parties have become endangered species
here.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, they were ubiquitous on Saturday nights
in Temple Bar, Dublin's left bank section of pubs, galleries, and
restaurants: strolling, often staggering, prospective grooms or
brides and their wedding parties staging stag or ``hen'' parties in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Dublin initially welcomed them. And attracted by a good exchange
rate, cheap airfare and hotel packages, and an environment where
drinking to excess was more tolerated than back in their provincial
English cities and towns, the gaggles of young men and women came
in droves.
</P>
<P>
   But after proving that the stags and hens were actually driving
away far more business than they brought, Ireland's formidable
tourism industry has pulled the welcome mat. It is now virtually
impossible to find a hotel in Dublin that will knowingly accept
reservations for stag or hen parties.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent time in Dublin knows what the problem was:
young people so drunk they treated one of the most quaint sections
of Dublin like an open sewer. Sometimes the bride or groom were
stripped and tied to a lamppost. And while the men tended to be
more violent than the women, the latter were just as likely to
throw up and relieve themselves, oblivious to passersby. It got so
bad that fewer and fewer natives would venture into Temple Bar on
Friday or Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   While their profits were comfortable, pub and hotel owners in
Temple Bar were not. They commissioned a survey that found that
while stag and hen parties account for only 1 percent of the
tourism business in Dublin, 13 percent of overseas visitors said
they were sufficiently disturbed by the behavior of stags and hens
that they would not come back to Dublin. That amounts to an
estimated annual loss of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 93 percent of stag and hen visitors
were from the United Kingdom, 71 percent on their first visit to
Ireland. More than 90 percent of them never left Dublin during
their visit, and they spent nearly all their money on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Stag and hen parties began flocking here shortly after the Irish
Republican Army called a cease-fire in 1994. Even though violence
related to the conflict in Northern Ireland rarely surfaced in
Dublin, it presented a huge psychological barrier to British people
visiting here. Simply by word-of-mouth, Dublin in general and
Temple Bar in particular became a popular destination for
prospective brides and grooms from London and other English cities
and towns.
</P>
<P>
   As one drunken English reveler candidly put it last year, while
swaying back and forth in a pub called The Temple Bar, holding a
sloshing pint of Guinness: ``I could never do this in Leeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials are sensitive to suggestions that there is
something anti-British in the official move to discourage the
parties. John Lahiffe, a spokesman for the Irish Tourist Board,
said the new policy has nothing to do with national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not welcome rowdies, whoever they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lahiffe said, the number of British tourists in Ireland
is increasing every year, including high-end visitors who stay at
expensive hotels like the Shelbourne and the Clarence and dine at
upscale restaurants like Thornton's and Peacock Alley.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people taking British weekend breaks is
``skyrocketing,'' Lahiffe said, saying the ban on hen and stag
parties can only help. ``I see this as a positive, not a negative.
It's saying, everybody's welcome, but if you are unruly, you are
ruining the experience for everyone else, so you're not welcome. I
don't think anybody will have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who were making a short-term profit from the stag and
hen parties agree. Martin Keane, who owns the Oliver St. John
Gogarty pub, which sits smack dab in the middle of Temple Bar, said
bar owners are more concerned about the long-term viability of
their businesses than cashing in on rowdies who spend loads of
money on drink.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who own businesses in Temple Bar want it to be
marketed more as a cultural mecca than a drinking and eating
emporium. As Keane put it, someone who spends some time in one of
the surrounding art galleries won't drink as many pints as the
stags and hens, ``but they'll be better customers, and they'll be
back.''

 &HT;    MASS HIGHLIGHTED POPE JOHN PAUL II'S VISIT TO ST. LOUIS
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A papal Mass in a super sports arena can be a
beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Eucharist that Pope John Paul II celebrated here Wednesday
with 110,000 faithful at the TWA Trans World Dome is believed to be
the largest indoor Mass ever. It shone public light on the
century's old Roman Catholic ritual of communion.
</P>
<P>
   This sacred celebration of Jesus Christ's Last Supper is the
heart of Catholic worship.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Dome in 1:30 a.m. darkness, a procession of school
buses dropped off worshippers by the thousands. Some sang hymns in
joyous anticipation. One by one, they passed through heavy security
and metal detectors and ushers who managed to pack them all in on
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the faithful took their seats inside, a procession of 1,000
priests in cream and gold vestments, and nuns in pink and caramel
habits filed in. Next came bishops from the United States,
including Cincinnati Daniel Pilarczyk, decked in miters _ their
pointed hats. Four cardinals from Rome and 11 American cardinals in
red caps and black cassocks followed.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant was framed by bright-yellow bunting that masked
alcohol and other advertisements in the 70,000-seat Dome. In
neighboring Cervantes Convention Center, about 40,000 watched via a
video screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the Dome assembly was a makeshift sacristy
framed by a 45-foot replica of the famed St. Louis Gateway Arch.
Above the altar, suspended from the rafters, was a 48-foot wooden
cross. To one side, the papal throne made of oak awaited John
Paul's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of St. Louis' nonprofit Papal Visit 1999
corporation paid for the Mass and other events. It was funded by
about $5 million in local corporate and private donations, said
Steve Mamanella, archdiocese spokesman. ``The archdiocese expects
to have no debt from the visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Popemobile, the pontiff circled the arena floor to joyous
roars and fireworks of camera flashes. Aa the service began in
earnest, he knelt to kiss the altar. In a call-and-response rite,
the entire assembly acknowledged their sins and asked for God's
mercy and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, the pope charged the church to ``a new
evangelism. It must include a special emphasis no the family and
the renewal of Christian marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech slightly slurred, he admonished against abortion,
euthanasia, assisted suicide, the death penalty and racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?
</P>
<P>
   ``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Splendidly orchestrated logistics and prayerful implementation
were on display. A maze-like formation of priests distributed,
level by level, Communion wafers to anyone who wished to partake.
As a 200-voice adult choir sang alternately with the cantors' call,
the Mass was celebrated with mesmerizing synchronicity. The
assembly sang out ``Alleluia, Alleluia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone, especially my age, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience. I think the idea of all these people coming together to
praise God is a really important thing,'' said Mary Fran Weir, 64,
of Peoria, Ill. ``The pope is important. But all these people
making so much effort _ it's a hopeful sign in a world that
sometimes seems so negative.'' No speed limits Some found that,
despite his ailments, the pope was moving pretty fast. ``Hey, slow
down,'' shouted Francie Harding, 34, of Kansas City, Mo., as the
Mercedes-Benz powered Popemobile zipped past her on Olive Street
Tuesday night. The pope sped by faster than Harding could flash her
disposable camera to capture his face.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, gathered four and five people deep, appeared to
disperse just as swiftly. After a moment's glance, they turned and
moved quickly toward parking lots, hotels and MetroLink stops. The
numbers game St. Louis city officials said early on that up to 1
million people were expected to converge on this Midwestern city to
be in the pope's light. But by midday Tuesday, near-empty streets
adjacent to the Papal Plaza on Tucker Boulevard told otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds thickened for John Paul's evening motorcade through
downtown streets. But Wednesday morning crowds were slim as the
pope made his way to the Dome for Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be an estimate by the police department or any
city agency,'' said Brooke Bascom, a city spokeswoman. ``I think we
did expect more people. But from the city's standpoint, this has
been a huge success in terms of our abilities to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated the cost of the pope's visit in city
employee overtime and other expenditures at about $1 million. They
had estimated that it would bring in at least $25 million in
revenue to area businesses. Souvenirs snubbed
</P>
<P>
   The pope's followers were apparently a frugal lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's buying,'' said William Grimm as he pushed a dolly of
papal pennants, badges, T-shirts, posters and soda. The
smaller-than- expected crowd didn't help. ``I thought it would be
so swarmed I wouldn't be able to push my dolly around. I talked to
older guys who did this for a living and they told me this was a
real poor turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the Day's Inn Tuesday, Grimm said he had made about $250,
not the $1,500 he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Cab drivers apparently suffered, too. ``Business was so slow out
here on Wednesday that I went home and watched the pope on TV,''
said Donnell Woods, a taxi driver

HAS THE JUDGE BEEN JUDGED TOO HARSHLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the space of just a few days, I saw the movie and read the
book ``A Civil Action.'' I was transported. Both accounts of the
poisoning of East Woburn's water supply and the subsequent marathon
legal death match deserve all the praise they have received. I have
only one question: Where does retired judge Walter J. Skinner go to
get his reputation back?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the main characters in Jonathan Harr's book, and
especially in Steven Zaillian's movie, Judge Skinner comes off the
worst. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann, is a charismatic,
flawed crusader. The wily corporate lawyers defending the accused
polluters are, well, wily corporate lawyers. But in Harr's book,
Skinner is often depicted through the eyes of the author's prime
source, Schlichtmann, who developed a paranoiac hatred of the judge
during the trial. The movie is worse. John Lithgow's over-the-top
performance portrays Skinner as an intemperate, white-shoe toady
overtly biased in favor of the corporate defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The unmistakable message of the movie and, to a lesser extent,
the book is this: Big corporations poured poison into the drinking
water of a tiny, woe-begotten Massachusetts town, killed children,
and caused additional, untold health damage. Then they got away
with it because of a biased federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what happened. Everyone familiar with the Woburn
trial knows that Schlichtmann had a terribly weak case, further
weakened not only by his shortcomings as a lawyer, but also by the
formidable opposition he faced from Hale &AMP; Dorr and Foley, Hoag &AMP;
Eliot. The case was complicated and frustrating, and Schlichtmann
vented many of his frustrations on Skinner (``The judge is going to
(expletive) me'' becomes his ugly mantra toward the end of the
book). Skinner occasionally vented back. ``It's true that my
patience (with Schlichtmann) ran out,'' he told an interviewer for
the cable TV program ``American Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that people felt Skinner was the villain of this
piece, I was pretty distressed,'' says Harr. ``He's a good judge
and a smart man, and he's a credit to federal judges. I regret not
being able to get inside his mind.'' Skinner, alone among the major
Woburn protagonists, refused to discuss the case with Harr (or with
me). Skinner's eminently defensible position is that he addressed
every aspect of the case during the trial, and that after a trial
is over the judge should shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting revisionism concerning Skinner's role is
brewing within the legal fraternity. ``A Civil Action'' is now used
as a teaching material in over 50 law schools, and Marilyn Berger,
a Seattle University law professor, persuaded Skinner to contribute
about three hours of videotape for curriculum use.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's comments, which will be seen by law teachers for the
first time this weekend at a ``Lessons from Woburn'' conference at
Harvard Law School's Berkman Center, have changed at least one mind
_ Berger's. For instance, she saw his controversial decision to
split the case in two in a new light after hearing his side of the
story. ``He took this case very seriously,'' she says. ``Ultimately
he was driving for fairness. . . . I think he's been treated very
unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the conference is available on the Web at
www.acivilaction.org.
</P>
<P>
   This just in
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in a row, David Mamet will be premiering a
play at the American Repertory Theatre &UR;  &LR; in Boston. It's all very
hush-hush, but I gather the play will be called ``Boston Marriage''
and treat the subject matter relevant to those curious and
distinctive 19th-century female-female relationships (cf. Amy
Lowell and Ada Dwyer Russell, Alice James and Katharine Loring,
etc.) featured in Henry James's ``The Bostonians'' and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like John Updike, Mamet is deemed (not by me) to have a
``problem'' portraying women, and my spies tell me this play goes a
long way toward resolving said concern. The work in progress is
``hysterically funny,'' according to one reader. Look for this at
the ART in late spring or early summer.

CELLUCCI'S `ROAD MAP' TAKES MOTHERS OUT OF SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Jhirad gushed about the blossoming lives of the women who
rose from welfare to a community college degree, remembering them
in an unending stream and with the force of water roaring in canyon
rapids. She knows them as an English professor at North Shore
Community College. In a more fair world, they would be her best
weapons when she is lobbying on Beacon Hill as cochair of the
Welfare Education and Training Access Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one woman who was living in a homeless shelter,''
Jhirad said. ``She was a single mother who got into our honors
program. She got 4.0 GPA and a full scholarship to Wellesley. The
last I heard, she was going for her PhD for engineering. She is so
amazing; she worked on a summer project at MIT for NASA. She found
a mistake in NASA calculations, and NASA flew her down to
Washington to go over it with her.''
</P>
<P>
   There were honors students who went to Smith and other four-year
colleges in New England. Another woman on welfare wrote for the
school newspaper and went into journalism. There was a woman who,
despite being abandoned by her crack-addicted husband and left with
five children and a cleaned-out bank account, graduated and became
a secretary at Suffolk University.
</P>
<P>
   ``She pulled herself up by her feet,'' Jhirad said. ``Many of
these women are making $30,000 and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories flowed from Jhirad as much out of anger as of pride,
because they now come in a trickle instead of a gush. This week
Governor Cellucci proposed new welfare cuts that would force 11,000
women with children between 2 and 5 years old to seek 30 hours of
work a week regardless of training or lose their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest boast about his antiwelfare program, Cellucci
said, ``We're not just cutting people off without providing help,
we're providing a road map in how you should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The map leads to Dry Gulch, driving women off America's main
road to success and onto impassable trails of boulders and choking
dust. The rules of ``reform'' are so severe that the number of
welfare recipients at North Shore has dropped from 825 in 1994 to
about 280 today. The number at community colleges statewide has
dropped from 7,125 in 1994 to 3,657 by 1998. The state has no solid
numbers in four-year colleges, but welfare advocates say anecdotes
point to a drop from 2,000 to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing laws this harsh, Cellucci and former Governor William
Weld have manipulated the worst of stereotypes to the brink of
lying. When advocates like Jhirad sought an exemption in 1995 from
time limits for women in college, Weld insinuated that they were
campus queens _ welfare campus queens, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you could spend 10 years going to school part-time,
maybe taking one course a semester at nighttime working toward a
degree in basket weavingand still demand taxpayer support full time
all the way,'' Weld said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence for such an assumption. To the contrary, a
survey of recipients in the Commonwealth's community colleges found
that two out of every three were enrolled in full-time programs.
The programs could not have been basket weaving. Studies indicate
that the vast majority of former recipients who earned degrees are
now out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   According to US Census data, the annual median income for a
woman with a two-year degree is $20,460, compared with $8,544 for a
female high school dropout. With the evidence mounting that most
former recipients under ``workfare'' and ``reform'' remain mired in
poverty, it is criminal to use welfare rules to lock the college
doors to motivated recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartless,'' said Jhirad, who has seen several women drop
out one semester away from nursing and legal aide degrees. ``There
is a woman who has a severely disabled child. She had been beaten
by the father while she was pregnant. She came to North Shore in a
program for women in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the welfare office told her, `Your child is 5; you must
work.' She was really excited about psychology. But they told her
to quit school. Like a lot of battered women, she didn't fight. She
tried to work at Boston Market for 20 hours a week. But she had to
keep going to her school to pick up her disabled son when there
were problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Market tried to be nice, but they had to let her go
because she couldn't meet the 20-hour requirement. The last I
heard, she was quilting and growing vegetables. She gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst part. I've recently gotten calls from six
women, all crying, saying, basically: `I don't know why they're
doing this to me. All I to do was make something of myself.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellucci wants to makes you think these women are sitting
around basket weaving. But a lot of these women have to get good
grades to maintain grants. Cellucci says lots of people work and go
to college, too. But that's often in two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   ``To force single women to work 30 hours at poverty wages, raise
children, and still go to college? That is an impossible equation.
Punishment, that's all it is.''

SILVER CHARM STILL THE TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silver Charm is without question the top horse in the handicap
division, but that's not stopping his opponents from lining up to
take a shot at the big gray. The field for Saturday's Donn Handicap
at Gulfstream attracted a strong field of 12, including surprise
California invader Puerto Madero, who ran second to Skip Away in
last year's Massachusetts Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked (Saturday) at Santa Anita, going seven-eighths in
1:27 4/5,'' said Richard Mandella, who trains Puerto Madero for
Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard. ``It was an easy work. We
didn't want to blow his tires off before the big race. Silver Charm
worked at Santa Anita Sunday, going seven panels in 1:25 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, who will carry highweight of 126 pounds in the
9-furlong affair, will have to break from the outside post (No. 12)
and will give away 6-16 pounds. Puerto Madero, who won the Native
Diver at Hollywood in December, and Sir Bear, who won the Broward
County, the prep for the Donn, will each carry 120 pounds, followed
by Frisk Me Now (117), Crypto Star (114), Behrens (113), Unruled
and Early Warning (both at 112), Truluck (111), and Hanarsaan
(110).

   `Groom' is ready
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Nick Zito continues to drill Rick Pitino's The Groom is
Red at Gulfstream, with the son of Runaway Grrom going 6 furlongs
in 1:14 Saturday, a serious move. The Groom is Red, who won the
Champagne Stakes at Belmont last fall, will likely make his
3-year-old bow in the Fountain of Youth at 1 1/16th miles Feb. 20.
The Fountain of Youth, which has been elevated to Grade I status
this year, is the steppingstone to the $750,000 Florida Derby, at 1
1/8 miles, March 13 . . . Last Thursday, owner Roger King, head of
King World Productions, took 10 horses away from trainer Sonny
Hine, the co-owner and conditioner of Skip Away. ``Two were sold to
(former Suffolk Downs trainer) Vinnie Blengs and the other eight
went to Steve Young, who took them to Hialeah,'' said a stunned
Hine. ``I didn't even see it coming. I guess he was unhappy.'' The
move leaves Hine, who turned 68 Jan. 9, with just a handful of
horses to train, most owned by his wife, Carolyn.

   Jockey Joe Hampshire, who was shaken up after falling from his
mount in the second race at Suffolk Sunday, was back in action
Monday. Hampshire rode four horses and finished second with Mr.
Auditor in the featured eighth race. Meanwhile, the Suffolk
stewards handed rider Al Howarth a 10-day suspension, Jan. 28
through Feb. 6, ``for not making a sufficient effort to control his
horse when leaving the gate, causing interference and impeding
another horse, causing the fall of another rider, resulting in the
disqualification of his horse from third to ninth position during
the running of the second race on Sunday.'' Howarth was aboard Miss
Country Pine, who broke from post No. 6, while Hampshsire was on
Finally Kissed, who broke from No. 7. The incident occurred a
couple of strides out of the gate . . . Jockey Edwin Molinari
captured Monday's first race at Suffolk aboard Monteverdi Girl
($12.40 to win), a Maryland invader trained by Ron Perez. It marked
the fifth victory in just six mounts for Molinari since the Suffolk
winter meet began Jan. 1. ``I've been lucky,'' said Molinari. ``The
trainers that I run for have all had their horses ready to go. I
just have to show up and do what I do, and they've all responded. I
don't have an agent right now and I've been working for just a few
trainers. It helps when they've been winning. I hope maybe to get
some more mounts. I'm riding good. I'm feeling good.'' . . .
Representatives of the fledgling New Hampshire Thoroughbred
Breeders' Association will speak in favor of video lottery
terminals at Rockingham Park in front of the Finance Commission in
Cocord, N.H., Friday. The grouop will then meet Monday night in the
Belmont Room at Rock to discuss the results of the hearing and
develop further strategies . . . Timely Broad, a 5-year-old mare
trained by Mike Petro and ridden by his brother Nick, who used to
be fixtures on the New England circuit, won the $75,000 Sabin
Handicap at Gulfstream Sunday. Timely Broad, a superior mud horse,
caught a sloppy track and got up in the final stride to prevail by
a nose in the Grade III route race at 16-1 ($34 to win) . . .
Baytown, a top sprinter on the local scene last year, finished
second in the $100,000 Maxxam Gold Cup at Sam Houston Saturday
night. Off at 3-1, Baytown was beaten a length by Western Trader,
owned by John Franks, in the 9-furlong contest. Baytown, a
5-year-old, has turned into a distance horse and a serious player
since leaving the area and came into the Maxxam off a victory in
the Bradley Handicap at Fair Grounds Jan. 2.

THAT OLD DEVIL JAPANESE BAMBOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How can I get rid of Japanese bamboo, short of a nuclear
strike? I have a big clump, 20 by 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN NASH, Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The only way you can get rid of it is physical; root it out.
Herbicides may help, but they are too dangerous to use. Saturating
the plants and roots with salt will also work, but the earth would
be contaminated for some time, and salt can get into underground
water.
</P>
<P>
   It is Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum). Unrelated to
bamboo, it comes up in the spring in red spikes, grows to six feet,
with big, floppy, and ugly green leaves. In fall it defoliates,
leaving you with a whole bunch of bamboolike stems. Amazingly
enough, it was imported into this country around the turn of the
century as an ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   To root it out, you have to dig down one to two feet to get at
the huge, clumpy and tenacious roots. The roots travel underground
to spread the plant. If you miss any roots, you will see a few
shoots again in spring, but you can handle those with relative
ease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My dryer duct goes from my electric dryer in the basement and
vents out through the foundation. The accordian type duct runs 15
feet, has three turns, and sags in the horizontal run. Shouldn't
that horizontal run be straight for the best efficiency?
</P>
<P>
   SANDY CIANCARELLI, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Get rid of the sag; it is not only reducing the efficiency of
the dryer but could be a hazard; if water condenses in the duct and
collects in the sag, it will sag further, causing a possible
blockage; a blockage is a fire hazard, especially if there is a lot
of lint in it.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-foot run also reduces the drying efficiency; eight feet
is considered maximum, but the 15-foot length will work if you
replace the accordian duct with PVC pipe or steel of the same size.
The smooth ducts will collect less lint and make it easier for you
to clean the duct; cleaning should be done regularly, say once a
month, especially if the run is long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Creegan of Somersworth, N.H. asked if he could use
trisodium phosphate (TSP) to keep his flue clear of creosote, since
the main ingredient of his powdered-type chimney cleaner cleaner
was TSP. The latter is less epxensive, so why not, he asked. He
uses a wood-burning stove regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman answered, why not indeed. Even if it doesn't work,
no harm done.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, said W. Troy Couch, vice president of
Combustion Improvers Co. of Newport, N.H., manufacturers of
Anti-Creo-Soot, a creosote control for wood stoves, pellet stoves,
coal stoves and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``TSP is derived from phosphoric acid, and is therefore storngly
alkaline and potentially corrosive to some surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of 100 percent TSP would probably introduce far more
of the chemical than the chimney cleaner, with more drastic
results, but possibly more deleterious side effcts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long range effect of TSP-based treatments on . . . metal
chimneys is not known, but the corrosive aspects are commonly
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powdered-type cleaners and other `old time' remedies are the
dinosaurs of the wood-burning scene, still available because they
are cheap. . . . Most of these products are, happily, only
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch recommended wood-burners use Anti-Creo-Soot, a spray
product introduced by his company in 1982. ``It is water-based,
safe, non-toxic, non-flammable, non-corrosive. It can help extend
the life of metal and masonry chimneys by dispersing acidic
creosote and soot formations.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch added that Anti-Creo-Soot does not claim to eliminate the
need for chimney sweeping and inspection. Chimneys should be swept
regularly, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Couch also mentioned a relatively new product, Anti-Carbon
Spray, a carbon and soot remover for gas logs.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Roy Couch.
</P>
<P>
   So, the handyman suggests that Mike Creegan use a product other
than TSP as a chimney cleaner. Short-time use of TSP probably will
cause no harm, but as Couch points out, long-range use could be bad
for any kind of chimney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Here we go again with the birds on my roof: pigeons and
starlings a tone of droppings. Any sure ways to keep them away?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK LICATA, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a continuing, continuous, continual, ongoing battle.
P.T. of Saugus, Mass. said a good spray of water from a garden hose
clears his roof. But of coure, this has to be done regularly and
often; otherwise the birds, much more persistent than any humans,
will be back.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent cure, but an expensive one, is to install
needle-boards on the roof and wherever else they are. The
needle-like protrusions on the boards area sure detererents. Call
Nixalite of East Moline, Ill., 800-624-1189, or Ecopic of
Birmingham, Mich., 313-647-0505.

SOLID TACKLING HIS HALLMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Until Sunday evening, you very likely never will have
heard of Travis Hall, and by Monday morning, you may well have
forgotten him, but for three hours Sunday night, he will be as
important to the Atlanta Falcons as anyone playing in Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is a defensive tackle who makes tackles. A lot of tackles.
In fact, if you were paying attention, you might know that over the
past three seasons, no defensive tackle in the National Football
League has made more tackles than Hall's 279.
</P>
<P>
   Not Bryant Young, the San Francisco 49ers' Pro Bowl tackle. Not
Eric Swann, the Arizona Cardinals' Pro Bowl tackle. Not John
Randle, the Minnesota Vikings' Pro Bowl tackle. Not Wayne Martin,
the New Orleans Saints' Pro Bowl tackle. No one playing defensive
tackle for pay has thrown more men to the ground over the last
three years than this native of Kenai, Alaska, who claims to have
grown up eating moose meat and chopping firewood in snow often up
to his hips.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in a 20 percent exaggeration factor, that's a
pretty good story, but it's one that has seldom been told outside
Atlanta and Anchorage until this week, when Hall and the rest of
the Falcons arrived in Miami as unexpected guests at the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were not supposed to be here, of course. Their spot
was supposed to have been occupied by the mighty Minnesota Vikings,
but the Vikings forgot to beat the Falcons in the NFC Championship
Game, so they will watch the Falcons try to do what few teams have
managed this season _ stop Denver's colossus of a running back,
Terrell Davis. If they are successful, one reason will have to be a
defensive tackle whom no one expected to be here, either.
</P>
<P>
   Hall grew up in Alaska, where football takes a back seat to sled
dog racing, but after his parents divorced, a deal was struck
between mother and father that the son would benefit, rather than
suffer, from their pain.
</P>
<P>
   So when it seemed productive that he and his brother stay in
Alaska with their father, they did. And when it came time for
things like high school football, they moved down to Utah with
their mother, which eventually led Hall to first Brigham Young,
then the Falcons, and finally the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a unique situation,'' Hall said. ``My parents split up,
but my mom and dad had a pretty good arrangement. They didn't try
to hold me and my brother back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They allowed us to go back and forth (between Alaska and
Utah). I grew up in Alaska and played my sophomore year there, but
then I went back and forth between Alaska and Utah. I would go to
Utah to play football. Then I would go back and live with my dad
and play hockey and wrestle in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like three months in Utah and nine months in Alaska. It
was supposed to be six and six, but it kind of went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things have for Hall, who has seen his high school jersey
in Jordan, Utah, retired and his special pass-rushing move dubbed
``The Mormon Maneuver'' by his fans in Utah. That doesn't sound
quite as imposing as the head slap Deacon Jones made famous, but as
far as Hall is concerned, it will do for now.
</P>
<P>
   Most anything would, considering the odds he has overcome just
to make an NFL team. A sixth-round draft choice in 1995 when he
still thought he was a defensive end, Hall played exactly three
plays his first season, a workload that convinced him there was
only one way to make a sudden impact in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a throw-you-a-bone deal,'' he said. ``I only
dressed for two games.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to change that, Hall hit the weight room like a
maniac that offseason, gaining 15 pounds of muscle and the
attention of his coaches. The next year, he was shifted to tackle
and started 15 games, finishing second on the club in tackles and
making a place for himself that he has held for three years,
quietly playing with enough skill to persuade coach Dan Reeves to
renegotiate his contract a year ago, signing him to a five-year,
$6.55 million extension.
</P>
<P>
   No more moose meat for Travis Hall, but plenty of tackles. He
rewarded Reeves's generosity last year with 10 1/2 sacks and this
year with 111 tackles. On Sunday, he will be looking to add to that
total, knowing that if he does not, it will make it extremely
difficult for the underdog Falcons to hold off Davis's runs and the
Broncos' offense.
</P>
<P>
   But if he and his teammates come through, the kid from Kenai
understands what it can mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question reputations can be made in the Super
Bowl,'' Hall said. ``You have an unbelievable opportunity because
of the exposure to make a name for yourself. If you have a big game
in the Super Bowl, people remember that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the viewers are out there, but I know that
there are a lot of media from all over the world here. When you
have that kind of exposure, you can do almost anything. People are
going to start to realize or recognize the type of player you are
if you have a big game in a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And just what type of player is the kid from Kenai who likes his
snow thigh-high?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the best players in the NFL at the
defensive tackle position, I think his name has to be in that
group,'' said Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   If he's ready to tackle his job Sunday _ a job titled Terrell
Davis _ Travis Hall's name just might be by Monday morning.

SHARPE TONGUE BECOMES MAJOR ATTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It came right at the end, just when the 1,000 or so
media members were being shooed off the Pro Player Stadium field,
their intimate, personal, and incisive interviews all over. John
Elway was talked out, and even the hordes gathered around Denver
coach Mike Shanahan were listened out. Only stragglers were left
around Elway and Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   But not so around the podium where Shannon Sharpe had talked
nonstop for 45 minutes, perhaps catching a breath every fifth
minute or so, trashing some, humoring many, and speaking his mind
at all times. The media were still five, six, or seven deep around
Sharpe when the question came.
</P>
<P>
   Right at the end.
</P>
<P>
   How did all this talking start?
</P>
<P>
   And when?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in elementary school _ yeah, elementary school, that was
the beginning of it right there,'' recalled the Broncos' Pro Bowl
tight end. ``I was in a speech class, and you know how a student
has trouble with a word, the teacher always says, `Now, students,
don't you jump in. Let me help him. You know, don't sound the words
out for him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was vintage Sharpe. Detail flowed upon detail, the image
vivid, an unfortunate boy standing in front of a class, book in
hand, not knowing the word he was trying to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the teacher was up there, the teacher saying, `OK, Johnny,
it sounds like . . . Johnny, it sounds like . . . it sounds like .
. .' '' Sharpe wove the tale. ``So I says to the class, `It sounds
like Johnny can't read.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This was in a long-gone era before political correctness. Even
so, Sharpe recalled, ``The teacher hears me say this and she says
to me, `Now, Shannon Sharpe, will you get out of the class? Just
get out of the class.' She put me right out of that class. That's
when it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sharpe hasn't stopped talking since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you have this gift or you don't,'' said Sharpe. ``And I
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, as he himself will tell you, is a pretty good tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I'm one of the best,'' Sharpe said, ever so
modestly. ``If you look at Ozzie Newsome and Kellen Winslow, none
of those guys ever played in a Super Bowl. Here I am in my second
one. Now if those guys never played in a Super Bowl, they never won
one, right? And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is his mouth, that incessant talking, that makes friends
laugh and foes want to strangle him. That sets Sharpe apart from
all other tight ends. Sharpe can win because he can block and catch
passes, but just as much because his needle gets under so many
skins on the opposite side of the ball. As Sharpe put it, ``Nobody
is going to beat me in a talking match.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Kansas City's Derrick Thomas, who was (a) thrown out of
a game and (b) suspended for a game by his own coach for trying to
throttle Sharpe late this season. It was words from Sharpe, of
course, that caused such a violent reaction. In addition,
linebacker Wayne Simmons was cut by the Chiefs after that Denver
game, in which he also erupted and went after Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharpe sees it _ ever so modestly, of course _ he has had a
good year. He and his Broncos are back in the Super Bowl, and his
needle mouth has left victims from Kansas City to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now just think about what I've done this year,'' Sharpe said.
``I got a guy suspended, I got one guy cut, one coach resigned
(Kansas City's Marty Schottenheimer), and another coach thought of
resigning (Miami's Jimmy Johnson). I'm pretty good. I'm thinking I
should go into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a memorable exchange between Sharpe and the Dolphins
two weeks ago. Miami had beaten Denver earlier in the regular
season, ending the Broncos' bid for an unbeaten record, and now was
heading to Denver for a rematch in the playoffs. Sharpe said, among
other things, that the Dolphins had no chance and the Broncos were
two touchdowns better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember a couple of weeks ago when I said it was us, and
not the Dolphins, who were going to be using the Dolphins' facility
(to practice for the Super Bowl), and Mike was going to be sitting
in Jimmy's office, and Mike's going to break down film with the
Dolphins' machines?'' said Sharpe. ``Now didn't that all come
true?''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' Terrell Buckley had answered with a few good words
of his own, but now that Denver is using Miami's practice facility,
Sharpe ever so modestly pointed out, ``I'm using Terrell Buckley's
locker. I wanted Terrell's locker.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the Falcons' Ray Buchanan guaranteeing a win over
Denver?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Ray Buchanan got to lose, anyway?'' said Sharpe. ``Ray
Buchanan's getting the best of both worlds. Nobody's picking them
to win, and so if they lose, nobody's going to remember it. Now I
say that and we lose, people'll say, `What an idiot Shannon looks
like,' if we were to lose. Besides, tell me this: When Ray was in
Indy (with the Colts), did anybody ever hear of Ray Buchanan before
he got to Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to lie,'' said Sharpe, ``or you want me to tell
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the best trash-talker in the game. As Terrell Davis is the
best player in the game, I'm the best trash-talker. We have the two
best.''

THE HYPE IS STILL HIP

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago Joe Namath told anyone who would listen that
his underdog New York Jets would beat the mighty Baltimore Colts in
Super Bowl III. He made good on his guarantee, and forever altered
the dynamics of pro football.
</P>
<P>
   The American Football League was no longer dominated by the
National Football League and the Super Bowl was no longer just a
title game. It became much bigger than that. It became filled with
drama, stories about players who had to overcome seemingly
insurmountable personal obstacles by using sports as a ticket to
the land of milk and honey.
</P>
<P>
   But The Game also became The Hype, providing millions of viewers
with sports entertainment and a healthy dose of the great American
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   And that formula, which worked well for a long time, has spun
way out of control. So much so that one 30-second spot during Super
Bowl XXXIII costs $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that, Namath, the man who arguably started The Hype,
is selling NFL merchandise for QVC throughout Super Bowl weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Joe? QVC? Hawking baseball caps?
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't the dough, Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Natick's Doug Flutie will join Namath in Miami on QVC, a
television retailer of home furnishings, fashion and beauty
products, electronics, and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   If Broadway Joe has taken The Hype to the marketplace, you can
quess how far the folks at Fox Sports will take it.
</P>
<P>
   Try a seven-hour pregame show!
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk at the highest levels of Fox Sports to have
pregame shows start at 9 a.m. with a Super Bowl excercise show
followed by a Super Bowl cooking show, featuring recipes from John
Madden and mothers of Super Bowl players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rule it out,'' said Fox Sports president David Hill,
laughing. ``You might see it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has heard the criticisms of excessiveness before and
doesn't make any apologies for his network's participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty simple matter,'' Hill said. ``When we started a
few years ago with a one-hour pregame show, we were met with
unbridled criticism. The critics thought we would be unable to find
enough material. Two years ago, when we had a four hour pregame
shop, we were met with more unbridled criticism. People asked, `How
could we make four hours interesting?' We did and had a great bit
of success doing it. So I guess the answer to the critics is yes,
we are masochists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is right. The Super Bowl attracts more than the diehard
football fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is the greatest single sporting event in the
world,'' Hill said. ``The World Cup is huge but it occurs once
every four years. The Olympics are great, but they are stretched
over three weeks. The Super Bowl is the single largest shared
community event in this country, and we want to honor it and help
people share the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Fox plans to use a Super Bowl-record 31 cameras, 25
replay machines, six slow-motion machines, and a blimp.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's telecast will be beamed to more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. Not that many people are going to watch Namath
on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALL-STAR COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel and Phil Simms will host CBS's ``NFL All-Star Comedy
Blitz,'' a one-hour special at 8 p.m. Saturday that celebrates the
NFL's 25-year affiliation with the United Way.

FULLBACKS BLOCK OUT GLAMOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If you're old enough, you remember when fullback was a
ballcarrying position.
</P>
<P>
   Bronko Nagurski? Fullback. Marion Motley? Fullback. Joe ``The
Jet'' Perry? Fullback. Jim Nance? Fullback. Jim Taylor? Fullback.
Even the hallowed Jim Brown. He sure wasn't a scatback. Ever hear
of Bobby Mitchell? Put ol' No. 32 down as a fullback with a little
extra giddy-up.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, fullback is football's answer to a witness protection
program. If you crave anonymity, ask the coach to make you a
fullback. Guards get more ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever find my name in the papers,'' shrugs Denver
fullback Howard Griffith. ``So I stopped buying them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, naturally, beg to differ. ``Fullback?'' inquires Mike
Shanahan. ``As far as I'm concerned, that's a marquee position.
You're not going anywhere without a good fullback.''
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Nagurski, Motley, Perry, Nance, and Taylor are from pro
football's Pleistocene Era. In their time, you had either two or
three running backs. We now live in a one-back world. A fullback's
job _ assuming he's even called a fullback _ is to block and keep
his mouth shut. It is pure grunt work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'd like to carry the ball more and catch 40 or 50
passes a year,'' says Griffith, a 31-year-old workhorse who is with
his fifth NFL organization. ``But you have to go out with a team
attitude. You have to know your role.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Denver scheme of things, his role is clear and
unambiguous: His job is to block for league MVP Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart in Sunday's Super Bowl is engaged in high-level
on-the-job training. Atlanta's Brian Kozlowski is a tight end by
trade. But when starter Bob Christian sustained a season-ending
knee injury against New Orleans Dec. 13, Kozlowski was asked to
make the transition to fullback. Let's just say the Falcons are
satisfied with his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest,'' says 1,846-yard rusher Jamal Anderson. ``I
know Brian had been an H-back when he was in New York, but I wasn't
expecting him to be this successful this fast. I mean, I rushed for
150 yards the first game he was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that these gentlemen have more in common with
offensive linemen than they do with the guys who play the so-called
``skill positions.'' Griffith was even accorded one of Denver's
highest honors Tuesday night. He was invited to dine with the
Broncos' offensive line. That's like being invited to spend the
night in the Lincoln Bedroom without having to make a campaign
donation.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, these guys get to touch the football.
There are even fullbacks who are featured parts of a team's offense
(Arizona's Larry Centers annually catches 60-90 passes), but that's
not the case with either of these teams. Griffith, Christian, and
Kozlowski combined have accounted for 679 yards all season,
playoffs included.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a lot of public credit,'' reflects Christian.
``The satisfaction comes in seeing Jamal get big yardage and in
having your teammates and coaches appreciate what you do. A
fullback has got to be content with being a role player and a team
player. He has to be willing to let the other guys get the glory.
Every once in a while, you get to do something with the football,
and then you can relish it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you examine Griffith's college resume, you'd have to say he
has had an admirable metamorphosis into the role player he is
today. This guy might as well have constructed a condo in the end
zone as an undergraduate. He holds Illinois records for touchdowns
in a game (8), season (15), and career (33). Yes, that's correct _
8. Southern Illinois may not be Ohio State, but Howard Griffith
didn't make out the schedule. They lined him up against the Salukis
and he took the ball into the promised land eight times in one
afternoon to establish an NCAA record. He caught the ball, too (39
times for 287 yards as a junior).
</P>
<P>
   Now he _ well, let him say it. ``I spend my whole day running
into people.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian wasn't bred to be a blocking back, either. ``When I
was in college, I carried the ball 25 or 30 times a game,'' he
explains. But he was made aware pretty early in his pro career that
his value to a team at this level would lie in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   There is thinking involved, as Christian points out. ``The
offensive line, tight end, and fullback work together to open up
holes,'' he explains. ``Many times there are area blocks you must
coordinate with the linemen. There are decisions to make.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the basis of the job is to act like an 18-wheeler
crashing through a police barrier. There is only so much subtlety
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically like having a car accident on every play,''
explains Kozlowski, who played his college ball for Tom Jackson at
the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   There was understandable apprehension in the Atlanta camp when
Christian went down because the 230-pound Northwestern product had
developed into one of the league's finest at the position. However
similar the assignments are between tight end and fullback, they're
not exactly the same. ``I've tried to do as much as I can to help
Brian, particularly on learning the reads,'' says Christian. ``But
we're not the same people. He is bigger than I am. I really need to
employ proper blocking technique. Brian can just level people.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: good fullback talk. Perhaps someone will
be kind enough to send this along to Howard Griffith.
</P>

NEXT UP _ THE CITY VS. AUTOS &AMP; ALCOHOL INC.?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automakers and distillers ought to be plenty worried if the
recent spate of lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers get
anywhere. After all, their pockets are a lot deeper than the
sprinkling of companies that make firearms, and when in the wrong
hands, their products can be just as deadly as any gun.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, Conn., and unified Miami-Dade County are the latest
municipal areas to join Chicago and New Orleans in filing
multimillion-dollar suits against firearms manufacturers in an
attempt to recover what they call ``the cost of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport's foray into this litigious lunacy holds a twisted
irony. Here's a city that couldn't protect 8-year-old Leroy Brown
Jr., the only witness to a violent crime whose testimony the
district attorney's office needed to put a criminal gun user behind
bars. Bridgeport handed over the boy's name and address to the
attorneys for the accused. The child and his mother are now dead,
shot by the same gun that was used in the crime that B.J.
witnessed. And Bridgeport is suing the gun industry for negligence?
</P>
<P>
   If a city's expenditures on public-safety costs related to guns
are now the measuring stick for lawsuits, legal attacks against
autos and alcohol can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   How much money is spent every year for investigations into
automobile accidents that involve excessive speed or excessive
alcohol consumption? How many domestic violence cases are a result
of excessive use of alcohol? How much emergency room time and
insurance money goes to the battered and broken victims of
automobile and alcohol misuse?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what officials in these cities contend _ that the
lawsuits are patterned after successful challenges to the tobacco
industry _ there are glaring disparities in the cases. When used as
designed and manufactured, tobacco is a dangerous product. There is
no safe way to use it. Smoke a cigarette, chew tobacco or dip
snuff, and the user risks lung disease, coronary problems or
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The same doesn't hold for firearms, automobiles and alcohol.
They are not, by design, dangerous products unless the user
``misuses'' them.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Alameda County, Calif., recognized that distinction
last fall, when it dismissed a lawsuit filed against firearms
manufacturer Beretta U.S.A. Corp. The suit, sponsored in part by
Handgun Control Inc., was brought by the parents of 14-year-old
Kenzo Dix, killed when a 15-year-old friend took an unlocked and
loaded handgun from an open camera bag in his father's closet,
disengaged the safety, pointed it at Kenzo and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The understandably distraught parents sued Beretta, contending
that the firearm should have had a device that warned that the
firing chamber was loaded and should have had a built-in lock so
that only an authorized person could use the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Beretta successfully defended against the suit by proving that
the gun in question ``did'' have a mechanism to warn that it was
loaded and that the child knew how to use it, and that the shooter
and his father failed to follow basic safety instructions included
with the pistol. And the shooting market is awash with trigger
locks and lockable gun cases that the gun owner chose not to use.
</P>
<P>
   None of this can bring back those grieving parents' child, but
it is not the design of the gun that led to the death of Kenzo Dix.
It was carelessness on the part of the gun's user and owner.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that, according to the National
Institute of Justice, the firearm fatal accident rate in the United
States is at its lowest point since 1903 and has declined 36
percent in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration felt by the victims of gun violence mirrors the
frustration that exists in lawful gun owners who are watching
repeated assaults against their right to own firearms. Yes, this
nation has a problem with gun violence, but it is a result of
people who deliberately misuse firearms.
</P>
<P>
   We also have a problem with people who deliberately drink too
much and drive too fast. Where are the product liability suits
against those industries? Where are the lawyers eager to contend
that automakers and distillers are flooding the market with more
Blazers and booze than legitimate consumers can handle?
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits aren't being filed because they are as baseless and
ridiculous as they sound. We can only hope that juries in Chicago,
New Orleans, Bridgeport and Miami show as much common sense as the
one in Alameda County did.

FALCONS SUCCESS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The reflex action was evident.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Tommy Nobis was about to mention Falcons founder Rankin
Smith, he would tilt his head to look skyward while finishing his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame that he did not live to see this and experience
what is going on here,'' said Tommy Nobis, who was the Falcons'
first draft choice ever, in 1966, and went on to be the franchise's
first great player.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the remaining family of Smith, who died during the
1997 season, Nobis is the most prominent continuing link to the
Falcons' beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could never seem to work out right for us until this
season,'' said Nobis, referring to the franchise's unspectacular
history. ``In some years we had an offense. In others we had a
defense. But this is the first time the right combination has ever
come together for us. Offense, defense, special teams, coaching.
All of it is here now. It never was before.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise that seemed off course from its earliest
days. As a result, the Smith family became the whipping boys of the
Atlanta media. ``We all made mistakes _ ownership, coaches,
players,'' said Nobis. ``A lot of bad things were said and written
about Rankin and his family. They took to calling them the Clampets
in the media. It wasn't very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobis chuckles when he recounts how it all started in Atlanta a
little more than three decades ago. ``We were an expansion team,
but it wasn't like it was with Carolina and Jacksonville. The
players they had to pick from a few years ago were much better than
we had 32 years ago,'' he said. ``There was no free agency then.
The first training camp was in the mountains in North Carolina. It
was makeshift. Norb Hecker (who had been with Vince Lombardi's
Packer dynasty) was the head coach. We were ready to go on our
first road trip to a preseason game. He told the team he wanted all
of the players in shirts and ties. Three buses came to camp to take
us to the airport. One of them did not have a roof on it. He put
the rookies (including Nobis) on that bus. By the time we got to
the airport, with the heat and the dust, we were all covered with
dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won three games that year, the first coming, after
an 0-9 start, at Yankee Stadium against the New York Giants. ``For
the first four years,'' recalled Nobis, ``we had great support in
Atlanta. Georgia is great football country. People love the game.
But we couldn't win, and then all of that excitement and enthusiasm
started to slip a little. We have always had a hard core of about
30,000 fans, even through the bad times. And there were a lot of
bad times.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches were fired on a regular basis. Hecker lasted just three
games into his third season, replaced by the legendary Norm Van
Brocklin. Van Brocklin had been a great player, a Hall of Fame
quarterback, but as a coach he became best known for his temper.
</P>
<P>
   One memorable Van Brocklin story involved one of his favorite
targets, running back Harmon Wages. Van Brocklin's criticism got
under Wages's skin, but he simply took it _ until one night when he
happened to meet Van Brocklin in the men's room of a restaurant.
Van Brocklin reportedly started to give Wages a hard time, and the
running back, deciding he had had enough, decked his coach with one
punch.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have a checkered history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started in that first training camp,'' said Al Thomy, a
retired sportswriter who covered the team from its first day. ``It
was an old YMCA camp in Black Mountain. The place was run down. The
screens were falling out of the windows. The mosquitos were eating
the players alive. That was close to being the first strike in NFL
history, the players were so upset. The food was terrible. You
could have bounced the hamburgers off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norb was a good guy but not a great coach. We almost had Vince
Lombardi as the first coach. He wanted to come to Atlanta, but he
wanted to own a piece of the team, and Rankin wouldn't give it to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch (Van Brocklin) was a character. Him and Wages never did
like each other. But Dutch always wanted to fight someone. One time
he challenged all of the sportswriters to a fight. This was just
before he got fired. The week before, Miami had beaten them badly.
Nobis made something like 26 tackles in the game, but I don't think
some of the other players tried their hardest. We asked Dutch in a
press conference the next week if he still thought he could coach
in the NFL. He got angry and said: `If there's anyone here who
thinks I can't coach, step forward. We'll stack up the chairs (and
fight).' No one took him on.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Campbell, who had started his coaching career in Boston
as a Patriots assistant under Mike Holovak, replaced Van Brocklin
in the middle of the 1974 season. Campbell, a native of Georgia,
was so respected by Rankin Smith that, even after his coaching
stint had ended, the owner brought him back in the late '80s to
again be the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion was coaching the team and Rankin brought in Pat Peppler
from Miami to be the general manager,'' recalled Thomy. ``Peppler
was always backstabbing Campbell, telling everyone behind his back
that he couldn't coach. So he meets with Rankin one day when the
team was losing, and Rankin fires Campbell and tells Peppler,
`You're the next coach. You've been telling me how Marion couldn't
coach; let's see how you do.' Peppler nearly died, because he
couldn't coach. He won a couple of games, but near the end of the
season we went into Los Angeles and got beat, 59-0, by the Rams.
And they fired him after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have made some odd personnel moves over the years.
They drafted Deion Sanders in 1989 and Brett Favre in 1991, and let
them get away. Both are ticketed for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always too many people making decisions there,''
said former player pesonnel director Ken Herock, who brought in
Favre, Sanders, and a lot of players on the present team before
leaving for Oakland two years ago when Dan Reeves took over the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything by committee,'' said Herock, ``and too many
times emotion or personalities got in the way. The difference now
is for the first time, they have given the football decisions to
just one man. Dan Reeves. That's the first time in the history of
the team. Taylor Smith (Rankin's son, now the owner) just stepped
aside and let Dan make the football decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And since that happened, Atlanta has been marching toward the
Super Bowl.

BODY PIERCING IS CAUSING ALLERGIES

<P>
   Is that stud in your navel giving you trouble? Can you no longer
wear earrings? That would not be surprising, say scientists in
Finland, who have shown that body piercing is probably causing a
steep rise in allergies to nickel across the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   Nickel is already the most common cause of contact allergy in
several European countries. And exposure to the metal can cause
lifelong sensitivity. Sensitized individuals find many belt
buckles, wristwatches, glasses frames and jewelry impossible to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   European Union guidelines _ in some countries enshrined into law
_ say that earrings are supposed to contain less than 0.05 percent
nickel by weight and should not release more than 0.5 micrograms of
the metal per square centimeter of their surface area per week. But
in reality, they often exceed these limits _ even some billed as
``gold'' or ``surgical steel,'' say Antti PsnkS and Asta Ekman of
the Helsinki City Centre for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used several methods to test the nickel content
of 66 ear studs and earring backs imported into Finland from
Germany, Sweden, Britain and the United States _ all of which were
said to contain amounts of nickel well below the EU limits. The
first test they carried out was one used by most government
authorities, which involves swabbing an earring with a solution
containing ammonia and dimethylglyocime. This should produce a red
color if the metal contains any nickel. None of the earrings tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the researchers performed a variation of this
test, in which the earrings are exposed to artificial sweat for up
to a week, nine of the 66 pieces of jewelry tested positive. And
when they used a different method, atomic absorption spectrometry,
25 were found to exceed EU limits (The Science of the Total
Environment, vol. 224, p. 161). PsnkS says that the swab test for
nickel has been giving misleading results. ``It's useless,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies, yet to be published, have shown that other
types of jewelry, intended for pierced tongues, cheeks and
genitals, are even worse, according to PsnkS. Eleven of 12 items
tested exceeded EU safety limits.
</P>
<P>
   The EU directive was drawn up in 1994 but will not come into
force in all the member states until agreed tests are officially
published _ something everyone hopes will happen this year, says
David Jarvis at the Sheffield Assay Office, which carries out
Britain's emissions testing on nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to nickel content and emissions limits will not always
be easy, however. ``There's such a wide range of jewelry _ it's
quite a difficult problem for importers to ensure they meet those
requirements,'' says Stephen Carter, who works for LGC, an
independent laboratory in south London. ``The best way to solve it
is for people not to use nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   PsnkS warns that skin allergies triggered by nickel earrings and
studs can lead to further health problems. ``If you are allergic to
one thing, you're more prone to get another allergy,'' he says.
``The threshold is lower.'' He urges governments to introduce more
stringent tests. &QL;

<P>
   Is that stud in your navel giving you trouble? Can you no longer
wear earrings? That would not be surprising, say scientists in
Finland, who have shown that body piercing is probably causing a
steep rise in allergies to nickel across the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   Nickel is already the most common cause of contact allergy in
several European countries. And exposure to the metal can cause
lifelong sensitivity. Sensitized individuals find many belt
buckles, wristwatches, glasses frames and jewelry impossible to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   European Union guidelines _ in some countries enshrined into law
_ say that earrings are supposed to contain less than 0.05 percent
nickel by weight and should not release more than 0.5 micrograms of
the metal per square centimeter of their surface area per week. But
in reality, they often exceed these limits _ even some billed as
``gold'' or ``surgical steel,'' say Antti PsnkS and Asta Ekman of
the Helsinki City Centre for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used several methods to test the nickel content
of 66 ear studs and earring backs imported into Finland from
Germany, Sweden, Britain and the United States _ all of which were
said to contain amounts of nickel well below the EU limits. The
first test they carried out was one used by most government
authorities, which involves swabbing an earring with a solution
containing ammonia and dimethylglyocime. This should produce a red
color if the metal contains any nickel. None of the earrings tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the researchers performed a variation of this
test, in which the earrings are exposed to artificial sweat for up
to a week, nine of the 66 pieces of jewelry tested positive. And
when they used a different method, atomic absorption spectrometry,
25 were found to exceed EU limits (The Science of the Total
Environment, vol. 224, p. 161). PsnkS says that the swab test for
nickel has been giving misleading results. ``It's useless,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies, yet to be published, have shown that other
types of jewelry, intended for pierced tongues, cheeks and
genitals, are even worse, according to PsnkS. Eleven of 12 items
tested exceeded EU safety limits.
</P>
<P>
   The EU directive was drawn up in 1994 but will not come into
force in all the member states until agreed tests are officially
published _ something everyone hopes will happen this year, says
David Jarvis at the Sheffield Assay Office, which carries out
Britain's emissions testing on nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to nickel content and emissions limits will not always
be easy, however. ``There's such a wide range of jewelry _ it's
quite a difficult problem for importers to ensure they meet those
requirements,'' says Stephen Carter, who works for LGC, an
independent laboratory in south London. ``The best way to solve it
is for people not to use nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   PsnkS warns that skin allergies triggered by nickel earrings and
studs can lead to further health problems. ``If you are allergic to
one thing, you're more prone to get another allergy,'' he says.
``The threshold is lower.'' He urges governments to introduce more
stringent tests. &QL;

SCANDAL REKINDLES OLD GRIEVANCES ON AFRICAN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MBABANE, Swaziland _ The Olympic rings represent the linking of
continents as equal partners in sport, but that ideal obscures the
belief among some Africans that their ring doesn't shine as
brightly as the others.
</P>
<P>
   It has long rankled African sports boosters that their continent
is the only one never to host the Olympic Games. But never has the
underlying bitterness of second-class status been more on display
than in recent weeks, as the unfolding corruption scandal has
touched Africa far more painfully than other continents.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the nine International Olympic Commitee members who have
either resigned or face expulsion come from Africa, and a seventh
African IOC representative remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   African Olympic officials have begun complaining that they are
easy targets, being used to deflect criticism from both the IOC and
the influence-seeking cities accused of bribing committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the givers and the takers, and there are many
takers,'' said Sam Ramsamy, president of the National Olympic
Committee of South Africa and an IOC member. ``They look at it as
the Africans are the only ones accepting bribes, and I think that's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ramsamy acknowledged that representatives of poorer
countries might be more vulnerable to temptation: ``Yes, I would
say someone from Rwanda or Burundi is more susceptible to offers
like this.'' The African countries actually involved are Swaziland,
Kenya, Libya, Mali, Sudan, the Republic of Congo, and the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In his first statement as acting president of the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee, Robert Magagula on Wednesday lashed out
at what he called suggestions that Africans were somehow
predisposed to bribery or vote-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened, it had nothing to do with being African,
nothing to do with our culture,'' said Magagula, named to replace
IOC member David Sibandze, who resigned after acknowledging that
his son received scholarships and living expenses from the Salt
Lake Olympic Committee during its successful bid for the 2002
winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Added IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal: ``This behavior
is not typical of a country or a continent. This is behavior that
appears everywhere. Those who are most in need are most fragile,
most open to offers _ offers that sometimes can be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sibandze said he believed he was ``singled out'' in a
conspiracy because he represents a ``small, insignificant
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Africa and the Olympics has always been
a complicated one.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre De Coubertin, in 1923
tried to launch All-Africa Games, which ultimately were canceled by
the colonial powers that controlled the continent. African nations
in general came late to the Games, and many did not begin
participating until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Africans have risen in number and prestige on the IOC during the
18-year reign of president Juan Antonio Samaranch, but it was not
clear whether he would seek to replace the African members caught
in the scandal with other Africans. Until the recent resignations,
Africans made up a bloc of 21 votes among the 106 current IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, a disproportionate number of
African nations are financially dependent on the IOC, which
provides what are called Olympic Solidarity payments that fund
everything from tennis rackets to the entire budgets of some
national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   African nations also have dined on the scraps of the
multmillion-dollar sponsorship deals between the IOC and major
corporations. The Swaziland Olympic committee, for instance, is in
line to receive a passenger van, its first vehicle, as an outgrowth
of a new partnership between the IOC and Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   To help improve conditions and Olympic results among Africans,
the IOC provided 110 scholarships to young African athletes between
1993 and 1996, the latest years for which figures were available.
Unlike the scholarships that helped to trigger the current crisis,
the IOC scholarships were not given surreptitiously and there are
supposed to be no benefits to anyone but the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attempts to put Africa on a par with the rest of
the world, it is difficult to escape the fact that as long as the
Olympics remain a moneymaking enterprise, some nations will be in
better shape than others. Perhaps the easiest way to keep track of
status is through a seemingly obscure measure, but one closely
tracked by Olympic officials: television viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of television viewers for the 1996 Atlanta Games
were from Africa, where TV sets in homes remain rare, compared with
45 percent from Asia, 31 percent from the Americas and 21 percent
from Europe, according to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials are eager to tap into the African market, but the
best opportunity might not come until at least 2008, when several
African cities hope to host the games.

IOC MEMBER'S RISE IS CUT SHORT

<P>
   MBABANE, Swaziland _ As a boy, David Sibandze was taught that if
a man violated the burial ground of kings on the summit of nearby
Mt. Mdzimba, their angered spirits would never let him return to
the emerald valley below.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sibandze left this lush but impoverished land to climb
the summit of Mt. Olympus as a member of the International Olympic
Committee, he ignored the fable's lessons about respecting limits
and following rules.
</P>
<P>
   That hubris caught up with Sibandze last weekend, forcing his
resignation from the IOC under threat of expulsion. He followed
that move Wednesday by resigning as president of the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee, the final humiliation for an
international sportsman who allegedly used his position to win
bribes and favors. The IOC said he received more than $100,000 from
Salt Lake City, site of the 2002 Winter Olympics, primarily in
scholarships for one of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a gift? What is corruption?'' Sibandze said in his
first extensive interview since the allegations broke. ``It was
never made clear.''
</P>
<P>
   As federal, state and Olympic investigators scour the records of
Salt Lake City and other Olympic hosts and also-rans, Sibandze's
story in remote Swaziland offers a window into what went wrong. It
begins with an ambitious, if misguided, 66-year-old businessman
with two wives, nine children, and a pack of dogs, living in an
African country not quite in any century but its own.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sibandze represents a microcosm of the scandal _
raising issues of culture and character, greed and gumption _ a
primer on the hazy symbiotic relationship between IOC members and
the cities that woo them.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze is one of the rare ``haves'' in a small country of
nearly 1 million have-nots, landlocked between South Africa and
Mozambique. He drives a Mercedes and lives in an affluent suburb of
Swaziland's business center, Manzini, a five-hour drive from
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of two small fast-food restaurants, Sibandze has the
resources to take advantage of local customs allowing polygamy,
having paid the required dowry to take a second wife. Still, he
remains far behind Swaziland's 31-year-old King Mswati III,
Africa's last ruling monarch, who has seven wives.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting outside his plantation-style home, behind a high
concrete wall and an iron gate, Sibandze wore a white polo shirt
with the Olympic rings and Buenos Aires' emblem for its failed bid
for the 2004 Games. It was a gift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a two-hour interview, his dogs playing at his feet,
Sibandze offered detailed but sometimes contradictory explanations
for his actions in the Salt Lake affair, his calm giving way to
bitterness, pointed humor, and anger at those who accused him. He
acknowledged the essential truth of the allegations while
maintaining that he was innocent of vote-selling. He said he was
perplexed by his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never tempted to do anything against the (Olympic)
charter,'' he said repeatedly. He said his resignation after 14
years on the IOC was not an admission of wrongdoing, but an
acknowledgement that the IOC executive board had already judged him
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son got a college scholarship. I didn't trade a scholarship
for my vote,'' Sibandze said. Then, in one of the illogical
crisscrosses that characterized his comments, he said he placed
great value on his son Sib usiso's education, but insisted he
personally received no benefit from the scholarships that enabled
the young man to obtain bachelor's and master's degrees from the
University of Utah from 1991 to 1996. The scholarships came from
the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, just as it was successfully
bidding for the 2002 games, and winning Sibandze's vote in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze said he only learned the true source of the
scholarships three weeks ago, when the IOC made its bribe
allegations; he claimed that until then, he thought Sibusiso had
merely tapped into a general scholarship fund for Swazi children
studying in the United States. He held to that position despite
acknowledging that his son was encouraged to apply to the school in
1991 during an Olympic-related, father-and-son visit to Salt Lake
City, followed by close, ongoing interest by Salt Lake bid
officials in his son's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Sibusiso Sibanze, 36, now executive
director of the Swaziland Chamber of Commerce, said he knew all
along that his tuition checks, as well as funds for his living
expenses and airline tickets, bore the imprint of the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee. He said he never discussed the scholarships or
other money with his father, and insisted they were not bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reported these things on their financial statements,''
said Sibusiso Sibandze. ``Why, if you want to bribe somebody, would
you have it on your books?'' His University of Utah diplomas hang
in his Mbabane office.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Sibandze admitted that he had enlisted the help of a
top Australian National Olympic Committee official to further the
schooling of another child, his daughter Nomsa. In 1993, shortly
before the vote that gave Sydney the 2000 Games, she enrolled on
scholarship at a Sydney catering school. Sibandze supported Sydney
in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   That scholarship and other allegations against him were not part
of the IOC official charges, which were limited to actions at Salt
Lake City. In his defense, Sibandze said it was a minor matter
because three months after Nomsa began school, she married an
Australian. And so, under his reasoning, she was no longer Swazi
and the scholarship no longer benefited him.
</P>
<P>
   He denied most of the other allegations that have surfaced
against him _ from other scholarships to reported solicitations of
airplane tickets, cars, luxury items, and prostitutes, a suggestion
he called ``absolute madness,'' then dismissed with wry humor: ``I
have two wives. I enjoy my sleep, my TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, acknowledge receiving four days of free medical
care in Atlanta when he arrived there before the vote on that
city's successful bid for the 1996 Olympics. Sibandze said he
collapsed upon his arrival from Puerto Rico, then underwent a heart
catheterization at an Atlanta hospital. He said he presented an IOC
insurance card, but never saw a bill and did not know who paid for
his stay. He reacted angrily to questions about the stay.

 MBABANE, Swaziland: ... the stay.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is now the wish of the IOC that members die
if they are ill on a site visit, but if that is the case, I am
happy I am no longer a member,'' Sibandze said. At the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee offices, in Mbabane, hangs a gift from
Atlanta: a limited-edition quilt displaying Georgia peaches,
peanuts, pecans and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first revelations surfaced two months ago, the most
pointed criticism has been aimed not at Sibandze and the dozen
other implicated IOC members, but at the would-be Olympic hosts
accused of plying their IOC guests with scholarships and surgery,
jobs and jellybeans, cash and cognac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of desperation, some of these cities make all kinds of
offers, and sometimes if a member is relatively weak, or yes, even
corrupt, he succumbs to these offers,'' said Sam Ramsamy, president
of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa, an IOC member
who has not been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the focus on cities ignores at least some
evidence, reinforced by some of Sibandze's comments, that bidders
for the Games reluctantly concluded that winning required jumping
through Olympic-size hoops erected by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, including investigators and IOC members not
implicated in the scandal, have quietly suggested that the
attention on Salt Lake City and other bid cities is desirable
because focusing on Sibandze and other individuals would set loose
cries of racism: six of the nine IOC members who have resigned or
face expulsion are from Africa. A seventh African is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsamy cautioned strongly against lumping all African members
together as corrupt. But others said a tendency to downplay the
involved IOC members' culpability is arguably even more racist,
since it treats the offenders like children, unable to control
themselves in the candy store of cities bidding to hold Olympics,
or as ethically blind as a result of living in cultures where
bribes are routine. That, for instance, is not the case in
Swaziland, local businessmen and journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sibandze did should only reflect on him, not on
Swaziland,'' said Sammy Were, an editor and columnist at the Times
of Swaziland. ``The conclusion most people are making is that his
interest all along in the Olympic Movement was to benefit
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reviewing the IOC members' alleged deeds, using
Sibandze as a case in point, a picture emerges not of wide-eyed
Third World rubes but of calculating, if clumsy, opportunists,
eager or at least willing to cash in on the power they had been
granted via their votes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, whose take
was estimated by the IOC at $226,000 in cash, gifts, medical and
travel expenses. He also reportedly made money through questionable
land deals in Utah, and when Cape Town was bidding for the 2004
Games, he allegedly asked for spare parts for his Land Rover. Then
there was Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, of Libya, who resigned after
allegedly accepting tuition and $700 monthly in expenses for a son
attending Brigham Young University and other Utah colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused in the scandal are from Kenya, Mali, Sudan, Ivory
Coast, Ecuador, Chile, Russia, South Korea, Finland and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the committee members' alleged lapses also reflect
upon their chief benefactor, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch,
whose much-praised dedication to reducing the dominance of white
male Europeans within the IOC during his nearly two-decade tenure
was matched only by his well-documented devotion to lavish living
on someone else's tab. But while the Spanish marquis stayed in
$4,000-a-night hotel suites and encouraged others to equip a
monument to his leadership in the form of an Olympic museum in
Lausanne, Switzerland, the implicated Third World IOC members
sought to fulfill less-grandiose desires.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sibandze's reported solicitations reveals what might be
called small-potato pettiness. He asked the head of the 1990
Olympic bid committee from Manchester, England, about finding a
cheaper source of potatoes for the French fries he sells at the two
fast-food outlets he owns, according to Prince Frederic von
Saxe-Lauenberg, a member of the International Pierre De Coubertin
Committee, an Olympic boosting organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Sibandze denied the charge. His businesses use no more than
10 small bags of locally bought potatoes each day, far too few to
justify importing them, he said. Employing an old Swazi saying, he
added: ``When a cow is dying, every nearby cow puts his horn in
there to make it die quickly. That is what they are doing. Everyone
wants to say, `I killed it, I must be praised,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sibandze's home city of Manzini, it isn't hard to find his
businesses: Like their owner, they have benefited from placement in
lucrative positions. One is near the teeming bus terminal and the
other is across the street from a post office, where scores of
Swazis line up to use metered pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze said the two restaurants, called ``The Captain'' and
``Captain Dorago,'' are his entire source of income, enough to make
him comfortable but not wealthy. Still, it is a long way from his
past as a dirt-poor child, wearing native attire until he turned
18, then working his way up from digging holes to running the
country's soccer program.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1970, he heard about the Olympics, and two years later
he was founder and unpaid head of the country's Olympic program.
Its $125,000 annual budget is funded almost entirely by the IOC's
Solidarity program for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the five Olympics Swaziland has attended since 1972 _ it
boycotted Olympics in 1976 and 1980 _ the country has sent 33
athletes, said Muriel Hofer, the committee's secretary general. It
has never won a medal, and the most notable performance was in
1996, when a Swazi boxer briefly floored a Cuban before being
eliminated in the first round of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sibandze's seat on the IOC was a job that made him
Swaziland's biggest sports figure and a man able to obtain
scholarships for his children, as well as favors for himself.
Though claiming to be mystified by what has befallen him, he said
he has reluctantly come to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you suggest? For me to keep shouting, `I didn't do it,
I didn't do it'? '' Sibandze said. ``I have wasted half my life to
sports. I want to call it a day.''

SCANDAL REKINDLES OLD GRIEVANCES ON AFRICAN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MBABANE, Swaziland _ The Olympic rings represent the linking of
continents as equal partners in sport, but that ideal obscures the
belief among some Africans that their ring doesn't shine as
brightly as the others.
</P>
<P>
   It has long rankled African sports boosters that their continent
is the only one never to host the Olympic Games. But never has the
underlying bitterness of second-class status been more on display
than in recent weeks, as the unfolding corruption scandal has
touched Africa far more painfully than other continents.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the nine International Olympic Commitee members who have
either resigned or face expulsion come from Africa, and a seventh
African IOC representative remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   African Olympic officials have begun complaining that they are
easy targets, being used to deflect criticism from both the IOC and
the influence-seeking cities accused of bribing committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the givers and the takers, and there are many
takers,'' said Sam Ramsamy, president of the National Olympic
Committee of South Africa and an IOC member. ``They look at it as
the Africans are the only ones accepting bribes, and I think that's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ramsamy acknowledged that representatives of poorer
countries might be more vulnerable to temptation: ``Yes, I would
say someone from Rwanda or Burundi is more susceptible to offers
like this.'' The African countries actually involved are Swaziland,
Kenya, Libya, Mali, Sudan, the Republic of Congo, and the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In his first statement as acting president of the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee, Robert Magagula on Wednesday lashed out
at what he called suggestions that Africans were somehow
predisposed to bribery or vote-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened, it had nothing to do with being African,
nothing to do with our culture,'' said Magagula, named to replace
IOC member David Sibandze, who resigned after acknowledging that
his son received scholarships and living expenses from the Salt
Lake Olympic Committee during its successful bid for the 2002
winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Added IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal: ``This behavior
is not typical of a country or a continent. This is behavior that
appears everywhere. Those who are most in need are most fragile,
most open to offers _ offers that sometimes can be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sibandze said he believed he was ``singled out'' in a
conspiracy because he represents a ``small, insignificant
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Africa and the Olympics has always been
a complicated one.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre De Coubertin, in 1923
tried to launch All-Africa Games, which ultimately were canceled by
the colonial powers that controlled the continent. African nations
in general came late to the Games, and many did not begin
participating until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Africans have risen in number and prestige on the IOC during the
18-year reign of president Juan Antonio Samaranch, but it was not
clear whether he would seek to replace the African members caught
in the scandal with other Africans. Until the recent resignations,
Africans made up a bloc of 21 votes among the 106 current IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, a disproportionate number of
African nations are financially dependent on the IOC, which
provides what are called Olympic Solidarity payments that fund
everything from tennis rackets to the entire budgets of some
national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   African nations also have dined on the scraps of the
multmillion-dollar sponsorship deals between the IOC and major
corporations. The Swaziland Olympic committee, for instance, is in
line to receive a passenger van, its first vehicle, as an outgrowth
of a new partnership between the IOC and Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   To help improve conditions and Olympic results among Africans,
the IOC provided 110 scholarships to young African athletes between
1993 and 1996, the latest years for which figures were available.
Unlike the scholarships that helped to trigger the current crisis,
the IOC scholarships were not given surreptitiously and there are
supposed to be no benefits to anyone but the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attempts to put Africa on a par with the rest of
the world, it is difficult to escape the fact that as long as the
Olympics remain a moneymaking enterprise, some nations will be in
better shape than others. Perhaps the easiest way to keep track of
status is through a seemingly obscure measure, but one closely
tracked by Olympic officials: television viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of television viewers for the 1996 Atlanta Games
were from Africa, where TV sets in homes remain rare, compared with
45 percent from Asia, 31 percent from the Americas and 21 percent
from Europe, according to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials are eager to tap into the African market, but the
best opportunity might not come until at least 2008, when several
African cities hope to host the games.

 MBABANE, Swaziland: ... the stay.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is now the wish of the IOC that members die
if they are ill on a site visit, but if that is the case, I am
happy I am no longer a member,'' Sibandze said. At the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee offices, in Mbabane, hangs a gift from
Atlanta: a limited-edition quilt displaying Georgia peaches,
peanuts, pecans and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first revelations surfaced two months ago, the most
pointed criticism has been aimed not at Sibandze and the dozen
other implicated IOC members, but at the would-be Olympic hosts
accused of plying their IOC guests with scholarships and surgery,
jobs and jellybeans, cash and cognac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of desperation, some of these cities make all kinds of
offers, and sometimes if a member is relatively weak, or yes, even
corrupt, he succumbs to these offers,'' said Sam Ramsamy, president
of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa, an IOC member
who has not been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the focus on cities ignores at least some
evidence, reinforced by some of Sibandze's comments, that bidders
for the Games reluctantly concluded that winning required jumping
through Olympic-size hoops erected by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, including investigators and IOC members not
implicated in the scandal, have quietly suggested that the
attention on Salt Lake City and other bid cities is desirable
because focusing on Sibandze and other individuals would set loose
cries of racism: six of the nine IOC members who have resigned or
face expulsion are from Africa. A seventh African is under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsamy cautioned strongly against lumping all African members
together as corrupt. But others said a tendency to downplay the
involved IOC members' culpability is arguably even more racist,
since it treats the offenders like children, unable to control
themselves in the candy store of cities bidding to hold Olympics,
or as ethically blind as a result of living in cultures where
bribes are routine. That, for instance, is not the case in
Swaziland, local businessmen and journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sibandze did should only reflect on him, not on
Swaziland,'' said Sammy Were, an editor and columnist at the Times
of Swaziland. ``The conclusion most people are making is that his
interest all along in the Olympic Movement was to benefit
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reviewing the IOC members' alleged deeds, using
Sibandze as a case in point, a picture emerges not of wide-eyed
Third World rubes but of calculating, if clumsy, opportunists,
eager or at least willing to cash in on the power they had been
granted via their votes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, whose take
was estimated by the IOC at $226,000 in cash, gifts, medical and
travel expenses. He also reportedly made money through questionable
land deals in Utah, and when Cape Town was bidding for the 2004
Games, he allegedly asked for spare parts for his Land Rover. Then
there was Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, of Libya, who resigned after
allegedly accepting tuition and $700 monthly in expenses for a son
attending Brigham Young University and other Utah colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused in the scandal are from Kenya, Mali, Sudan, Ivory
Coast, Ecuador, Chile, Russia, South Korea, Finland and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the committee members' alleged lapses also reflect
upon their chief benefactor, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch,
whose much-praised dedication to reducing the dominance of white
male Europeans within the IOC during his nearly two-decade tenure
was matched only by his well-documented devotion to lavish living
on someone else's tab. But while the Spanish marquis stayed in
$4,000-a-night hotel suites and encouraged others to equip a
monument to his leadership in the form of an Olympic museum in
Lausanne, Switzerland, the implicated Third World IOC members
sought to fulfill less-grandiose desires.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sibandze's reported solicitations reveals what might be
called small-potato pettiness. He asked the head of the 1990
Olympic bid committee from Manchester, England, about finding a
cheaper source of potatoes for the French fries he sells at the two
fast-food outlets he owns, according to Prince Frederic von
Saxe-Lauenberg, a member of the International Pierre De Coubertin
Committee, an Olympic boosting organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Sibandze denied the charge. His businesses use no more than
10 small bags of locally bought potatoes each day, far too few to
justify importing them, he said. Employing an old Swazi saying, he
added: ``When a cow is dying, every nearby cow puts his horn in
there to make it die quickly. That is what they are doing. Everyone
wants to say, `I killed it, I must be praised,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sibandze's home city of Manzini, it isn't hard to find his
businesses: Like their owner, they have benefited from placement in
lucrative positions. One is near the teeming bus terminal and the
other is across the street from a post office, where scores of
Swazis line up to use metered pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze said the two restaurants, called ``The Captain'' and
``Captain Dorago,'' are his entire source of income, enough to make
him comfortable but not wealthy. Still, it is a long way from his
past as a dirt-poor child, wearing native attire until he turned
18, then working his way up from digging holes to running the
country's soccer program.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1970, he heard about the Olympics, and two years later
he was founder and unpaid head of the country's Olympic program.
Its $125,000 annual budget is funded almost entirely by the IOC's
Solidarity program for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the five Olympics Swaziland has attended since 1972 _ it
boycotted Olympics in 1976 and 1980 _ the country has sent 33
athletes, said Muriel Hofer, the committee's secretary general. It
has never won a medal, and the most notable performance was in
1996, when a Swazi boxer briefly floored a Cuban before being
eliminated in the first round of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sibandze's seat on the IOC was a job that made him
Swaziland's biggest sports figure and a man able to obtain
scholarships for his children, as well as favors for himself.
Though claiming to be mystified by what has befallen him, he said
he has reluctantly come to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you suggest? For me to keep shouting, `I didn't do it,
I didn't do it'? '' Sibandze said. ``I have wasted half my life to
sports. I want to call it a day.''

IOC MEMBER'S RISE IS CUT SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MBABANE, Swaziland _ As a boy, David Sibandze was taught that if
a man violated the burial ground of kings on the summit of nearby
Mt. Mdzimba, their angered spirits would never let him return to
the emerald valley below.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sibandze left this lush but impoverished land to climb
the summit of Mt. Olympus as a member of the International Olympic
Committee, he ignored the fable's lessons about respecting limits
and following rules.
</P>
<P>
   That hubris caught up with Sibandze last weekend, forcing his
resignation from the IOC under threat of expulsion. He followed
that move Wednesday by resigning as president of the Swaziland
National Olympic Committee, the final humiliation for an
international sportsman who allegedly used his position to win
bribes and favors. The IOC said he received more than $100,000 from
Salt Lake City, site of the 2002 Winter Olympics, primarily in
scholarships for one of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a gift? What is corruption?'' Sibandze said in his
first extensive interview since the allegations broke. ``It was
never made clear.''
</P>
<P>
   As federal, state and Olympic investigators scour the records of
Salt Lake City and other Olympic hosts and also-rans, Sibandze's
story in remote Swaziland offers a window into what went wrong. It
begins with an ambitious, if misguided, 66-year-old businessman
with two wives, nine children, and a pack of dogs, living in an
African country not quite in any century but its own.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sibandze represents a microcosm of the scandal _
raising issues of culture and character, greed and gumption _ a
primer on the hazy symbiotic relationship between IOC members and
the cities that woo them.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze is one of the rare ``haves'' in a small country of
nearly 1 million have-nots, landlocked between South Africa and
Mozambique. He drives a Mercedes and lives in an affluent suburb of
Swaziland's business center, Manzini, a five-hour drive from
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of two small fast-food restaurants, Sibandze has the
resources to take advantage of local customs allowing polygamy,
having paid the required dowry to take a second wife. Still, he
remains far behind Swaziland's 31-year-old King Mswati III,
Africa's last ruling monarch, who has seven wives.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting outside his plantation-style home, behind a high
concrete wall and an iron gate, Sibandze wore a white polo shirt
with the Olympic rings and Buenos Aires' emblem for its failed bid
for the 2004 Games. It was a gift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a two-hour interview, his dogs playing at his feet,
Sibandze offered detailed but sometimes contradictory explanations
for his actions in the Salt Lake affair, his calm giving way to
bitterness, pointed humor, and anger at those who accused him. He
acknowledged the essential truth of the allegations while
maintaining that he was innocent of vote-selling. He said he was
perplexed by his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never tempted to do anything against the (Olympic)
charter,'' he said repeatedly. He said his resignation after 14
years on the IOC was not an admission of wrongdoing, but an
acknowledgement that the IOC executive board had already judged him
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son got a college scholarship. I didn't trade a scholarship
for my vote,'' Sibandze said. Then, in one of the illogical
crisscrosses that characterized his comments, he said he placed
great value on his son Sib usiso's education, but insisted he
personally received no benefit from the scholarships that enabled
the young man to obtain bachelor's and master's degrees from the
University of Utah from 1991 to 1996. The scholarships came from
the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, just as it was successfully
bidding for the 2002 games, and winning Sibandze's vote in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze said he only learned the true source of the
scholarships three weeks ago, when the IOC made its bribe
allegations; he claimed that until then, he thought Sibusiso had
merely tapped into a general scholarship fund for Swazi children
studying in the United States. He held to that position despite
acknowledging that his son was encouraged to apply to the school in
1991 during an Olympic-related, father-and-son visit to Salt Lake
City, followed by close, ongoing interest by Salt Lake bid
officials in his son's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Sibusiso Sibanze, 36, now executive
director of the Swaziland Chamber of Commerce, said he knew all
along that his tuition checks, as well as funds for his living
expenses and airline tickets, bore the imprint of the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee. He said he never discussed the scholarships or
other money with his father, and insisted they were not bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reported these things on their financial statements,''
said Sibusiso Sibandze. ``Why, if you want to bribe somebody, would
you have it on your books?'' His University of Utah diplomas hang
in his Mbabane office.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Sibandze admitted that he had enlisted the help of a
top Australian National Olympic Committee official to further the
schooling of another child, his daughter Nomsa. In 1993, shortly
before the vote that gave Sydney the 2000 Games, she enrolled on
scholarship at a Sydney catering school. Sibandze supported Sydney
in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   That scholarship and other allegations against him were not part
of the IOC official charges, which were limited to actions at Salt
Lake City. In his defense, Sibandze said it was a minor matter
because three months after Nomsa began school, she married an
Australian. And so, under his reasoning, she was no longer Swazi
and the scholarship no longer benefited him.
</P>
<P>
   He denied most of the other allegations that have surfaced
against him _ from other scholarships to reported solicitations of
airplane tickets, cars, luxury items, and prostitutes, a suggestion
he called ``absolute madness,'' then dismissed with wry humor: ``I
have two wives. I enjoy my sleep, my TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, acknowledge receiving four days of free medical
care in Atlanta when he arrived there before the vote on that
city's successful bid for the 1996 Olympics. Sibandze said he
collapsed upon his arrival from Puerto Rico, then underwent a heart
catheterization at an Atlanta hospital. He said he presented an IOC
insurance card, but never saw a bill and did not know who paid for
his stay. He reacted angrily to questions about the stay.

NEW, OLD SOUTH DIFFER ON FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURFREESBORO, Tenn. _ Surrounded by tractor parts and bags of
feed, the cattle ranchers in bib overalls and sales clerks in green
smocks divided themselves into Old South and New.
</P>
<P>
   Old South is staunchly Democratic, they explained, inclined to
be in Bill Clinton's corner no matter what his transgressions. New
South tends toward Republican and impeachment. In both worlds, sin
and redemption go hand in hand. But even in the nation's Bible
Belt, forgiveness varies by degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see him knocked out of office for the country's
sake, because I'm more worried about the country than I am about
him,'' said Gayle Porter, 45, who sells gardening products and
knickknacks at the Co-Op beside the railroad tracks when she isn't
driving a school bus. ``But I'll tell you the truth: I think
something should be done. But you should ask Frances. She's more
forgiving than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Corley, a lifelong Democrat who is still working the
sales floor at age 72, said she forgave Clinton almost the moment
he apologized on national television. Of course she disapproved of
his dalliance with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
What churchgoing woman wouldn't? The sexual details in the Starr
report mortified her. But the sinner is not exclusively his sins,
she stressed, and Clinton has been good for the country, good for
Rutherford County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never should have done what he did in the first place
because he knows better or he ought to,'' said Corley, who twice
voted for Clinton but wasn't sure she would again. ``But I say if
the Lord can forgive him, some of the people can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Holder, 56, wandered over to offer his endorsement of
Clinton during a lull in selling lawn tractors and chainsaws. ``I
don't respect what he did, but the country is better than it ever
has been in my time,'' he said. ``I don't have a choice. I have to
forgive him. My country is at stake. And we're supposed to be
forgiving. This is the Bible Belt after all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Murfreesboro, about 30 miles southeast of Nashville in the
heart of walking-horse and dairy-cattle country, even the people
who want to keep Clinton in office can judge him harshly. He is one
of them, after all, both a Baptist and a southerner. That has made
them proud at times and ashamed at others, regardless of their
political feelings.
</P>
<P>
   One older farmer, too mistrustful of East Coast news media to
give his name and equally unsure of smooth-talking Washington
politicians, said he won't believe Clinton obstructed justice until
he hears it from Monica Lewinsky herself. ``Anyway, he ain't done
anything that someone else ain't done,'' he said. ``Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hassel ``Trey'' Smith III, a 28-year-old independent who
voted for Bob Dole in the last election, insisted the error of
other people's ways should be irrelevant. They aren't president of
the United States, after all. An entire nation is not depending on
them. So they can be held to a more human standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the young lady out of it,'' said Smith, a clerk
at the half of the Co-op that handles agricultural supplies and
equipmment. ``The point is, I can't trust him any more. I can
forgive him, but trusting him is a whole other matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another farmer, who also declined to be identified by
name: ``Hell, I'm a good ol' Methodist. Religion is beside the
point. Being southern is beside the point. The only point is he
broke the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-op's manager, Douglas Adcock, said law or no law,
Clinton's behavior during the affair and after do not rise to the
level of high crimes and misdeameanors. He wants the Senate trial
stopped now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of what he did; I'm ashamed of it,'' said
Adcock, who left the presidential box unchecked in the 1996
election because he couldn't stomach either candidate. ``But he
didn't put the country in danger. That's my opinion. That and a
nickel will get you a cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Clark, who had stopped at the store to pick up 20 pounds
of dog food for his Rottweiler and nine new puppies, jumped in to
say he was doubly opposed both to impeachment in the House and
conviction in the Senate. As someone who was raised in the church,
he was taught that forgiveness is available to anyone. As a black
man raised in Murfreesboro's tiny black community, he said he also
came to understand firsthand how essential it is to move past other
people's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably more forgiving of Clinton in the black
community,'' said Clark, 26, a barber who is also a criminal
justice major in college. ``We've been in his corner since day one
and I'd have to say we're still there. He's done more for us than
just about any other president, maybe any president.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Porter, the Republican sales clerk who categorized
herself as New South, the issue is more complicated than forgive
and let live. For her, it is OK to forgive and still punish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can ask for forgiveness and get it. I think he's
gotten it,'' Porter said. ``But then we have to deal with his
morals. A lot of us around here believe in that too.''

   IMPEACH-TRIPP (Undated) _ As the impeachment trial progresses,
historians, pundits and senators are trying to cast President
Clinton and his actions in historical context. No one is doing the
same for Linda Tripp, but perhaps they should. Ms. Tripp has a
historical lineage of her own: the citizen denouncer. From the
Salem witch trials to the McCarthy hearings, from the McMartin

City police corruption, American history and the American present

   BEAUVOIR-PARIS (Paris) This is where Simone de Beauvoir lived

scholars to gather to start celebrating the 50th anniversary of her
seminal feminist book, ``The Second Sex.'' For four days here last
week, they debated Beauvoir with a mixture of joy and reverence,
and at the end, their unsurprising conclusion was that ``The Second
Sex'' was as topical and worthy of study as ever. A perhaps more
pressing reason to raise Beauvoir's voice here was that 13 years

THE UPSCALE SCENE OF THE CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were on our turf, not theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, the scene of the crime _ not the crime
itself _ was shocking, even to a savvy arbiter of street violence
like the Reverend Eugene F. Rivers III.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, a shot rang out in a crowded public walkway at
upscale Copley Place in Boston. Warfare between two South End gangs
erupted, right near the Gourmet Bean coffee counter and Truffles
Fine Confections. One teenager was wounded, just a few second's
lope up the escalator to Tiffany &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unspoken rule of the terms of engagement has been
broken,'' proclaimed a shaken Rivers, who was at the mall to help
his nine-year-old daughter celebrate her birthday at the Copley
Place cinema. ``There is general understanding that
neighborhood-based violence is contained, although unaccepted, but
contained and you don't bring violence and mayhem in neutral
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that: Foisting upon Copley Place mall-goers the
possibility of witnessing violent crime at the same time they are
savoring a cappuccino and a spectacular buy from Neiman Marcus!
</P>
<P>
   And yet: Isn't that exactly what it takes to make the
comfortable uncomfortable enough to pay attention to the sad,
sickening cycle of kids maiming and killing kids?
</P>
<P>
   Rivers is an undisputed expert on such matters. He's an ex-gang
member who went to Harvard and was lionized last June in a Newsweek
cover story. To fight the culture of street violence he founded the
Ella J. Baker House, a recreation center and parish in Dorchester
that exists to help kids. But in this matter, he sounds as uptight
as any white suburban matron, appalled by the notion that a trip to
check out the latest resort wear from Ralph Lauren could end in a
blast of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   As Rivers knows better than most, those blasts don't come as
quite a shock in other parts of this city. But most of us never
hear them nor see the blood and broken bodies they leave behind.
Shouldn't he want us, for once, to see them and to care?
</P>
<P>
   Complacency is the order of the day. These are prosperous times.
We have easy access to cash, or at the very least, to credit cards.
And we have reason to feel relatively safe.
</P>
<P>
   The US crime rate, including the rate of violent crime, is down,
according to recent FBI and Justice Department reports.
</P>
<P>
   However, as in years past, the National Crime Victimization
Survey shows men and younger people are still more likely to be
victims of violent crime than women and older people. And blacks
are victimized by crime at a higher rate than other racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, overall crime rates for 1998 are due out soon. Last
summer, Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced a decrease in crime;
violent crime overall for the first six months of 1998 was at a
27-year low. At the half-year point, homicide plummeted to its
lowest level in almost four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the city is safe for everyone, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Copley Place is safe. A shooting there is an isolated incident.
But why should we be so surprised that all types of neighbors would
spill into a neighborhood mall?
</P>
<P>
   The shopping complex is not the fortress opponents feared when
they tried to block it years ago. The stores are high-end and some
of the browsers are definitely hip-hop. The diversity is refreshing
and not the norm at shopping centers like the Burlington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony is, of course, good. Violence is, of course, bad. And
shoppers on Blue Hill Avenue shouldn't have to tolerate violence
any more than shoppers at Copley Place.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to dwell on the Copley Place shooting incident,
but perhaps there is something to take from it _ the fear and
outrage such violence should provoke everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine feeling anxious every time we walked past Kenneth Cole,
Brookstone, Coach, and Bally. Imagine worrying for even an instant
that a gunblast could cut us down, or worse, cut down our child.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a nightmare, one that might explain Rivers's angry
reaction. He thought he was in a safe place and suddenly he was
not. His instinct, like ours, was to focus on the shock of where
the shooting happened _ not on the 15-year-old victim, Christopher
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's injuries were not life-threatening. But let's be
honest. To most of us, he is just another black gang member whose
war intruded on our world.
</P>
<P>
   How terribly inconvenient.

BIG DIG SHOWS SIGNS IT MAY BE WORTH THE FUSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Dig is Big, the bill heavy, the wait long. But
we're halfway home.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be positive till this month's bills come in. When you
burn through $3 million a day, it takes time to double-check. But
at midday Tuesday, Big Dig spokesman Jack Quinlan clicked off his
red laser pointer, shut down his slide show, and allowed as ``I
think we just passed the 50 percent mark'' on the nation's largest,
priciest construction job. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen it from a thousand angles, and it's a mess. But I
walked under it, over it, around it, and through it, and if you
left town now and came back in, say, three years, you'd think the
city transformed. The Boston Harbor Hotel's magnificent waterfront
access arch is suddenly the gateway to the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven acres of parkland give us the equivalent of the
Commonwealth Avenue Mall, Boston's grandest thoroughfare, in place
of what is now the 40-year-old green monstrosity of elevated
Distressway. Property values go through the roof: Southie, Eastie,
the Waterfront, the North End. People want to live, work, and play
here, and the all-time joy killer of living in Boston _ the traffic
dragon _ is finally slain.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for Quinlan's hyperbole _ ``We do think we have
solved the traffic problem forever'' _ you cannot help but be
encouraged by this claim: ``We'll have the prettiest city of its
size on the planet.'' From around the world come engineers to
marvel. Recently a crowd from Hanoi came to learn about traffic
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the cost for a moment. I know NBC just did a
drive-by hit as part of its ``The Fleecing of America'' attempt to
convince viewers of its journalistic gravitas. For the facts and
figures, check out the Globe's Tom Palmer and his relentless
reporting. Take heart from this: the noise, dirt, disruption, cost,
inconvenience, and enormously expensive police details ($70 million
for the coppers at upwards of $26 per detail hour) may all be worth
it. They've done it right _ only one man has been killed by
accident on a fiendishly complex and dangerous job _ and the Big
Dig could be the best thing to happen to Boston since they found
codfish offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig required Big Dough _ most of it from taxpayers
who'll never see it, from other states. It will wind up costing
between $12 billion and $15 billion, under 109 separate contracts,
with 5,000-odd people at work, moving one cubic yard of dirt 13
million times, using enough steel to wrap a one-inch bar around the
earth and enough concrete to build a 12-foot-wide path to San
Francisco. In only 7.8 miles of length, there's 161 miles of
traffic lanes, half underground, with 27 on- or offramps reduced to
14.
</P>
<P>
   I heard the ultimate tribute when I toured the job site with a
crew from Lockwood Construction of Brookline. One of them, a
Honduran construction worker, Onan Benedith, nodded satisfactorily:
When this is all built, he told colleagues matter-of-factly, I will
drive my car in downtown Boston. The toughest driving city in
America will suddenly become driver-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The old town will look better, breathe better, drive better.
Carbon monoxide levels will drop 12 percent thanks to enhanced
traffic flow _ and what Quinlan brags will be ``the largest
ventilation system on the planet.'' More than half of what peaked
at 175,000 vehicles per day moving north-south never wanted to stop
in town, was just trying to get through the city.
</P>
<P>
   And 150 years of water, sewer, gas, electric, and phone cables
have been ripped out of the 120-foot-deep trench that will speed
eight lanes through downtown, replaced by streamlined, accessible
utility corridors that will give the Hub of the Universe what
Quinlan boasts is ``the most modern communications grid in any city
in the country.'' Go, Internet!
</P>
<P>
   In February, the boss engineer on the two Charles River
crossings, Al McPhail, will nod to the crew, and a 270-foot-long
bolted box girder weighing some 650 tons will be slowly jacked, a
fraction of an inch at a time, into postion between two bridge
supports 40 feet above the water. The most spectacularly beautiful
piece of urban architecture will be the as-yet unnamed cable-stayed
bridge McPhail is erecting over the river connecting Storrow Drive
and Leverett Circle, binding 1,820 miles of wire into cables
suspended from two Y-shaped towers sculpted to look like the Bunker
Hill Monument.
</P>
<P>
   This is, for my money, the signature symbol of the largest civic
works project in the nation, an artifact of phenomenal grace and
power. I don't know how it will eventually be named, but this
singular honor should go to the man whose honor, decency, and humor
charmed the US Congress into sending us the money for the Big Dig:
Tip O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   If someone in the Legislature gets the ball rolling with a bill
to name this remarkable $26 million bridge for the late speaker,
I'm for it. And there will be thousands with me. Ted Williams has a
tunnel. Storrow a drive. Callahan a tunnel. Tobin a bridge. I know
Tip O'Neill has an office building. But I also know that this
bridge would not be going up today, and Al McPhail's crew would not
be jacking up box-beams, if Tip O'Neill had not been the man he was
and the politician he was.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear the traffic reporter of 2002: ``Clear sailing on the
Artery and the O'Neill Bridge.'' Tipster, it's all thanks to you.
We owe you.

SUPER SUNDAY FOR GAMBLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday jan. 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With America at relative peace since the Vietnam War, it may be
time to amend the saying from ``There are no atheists in foxholes''
to ``There are no atheists at blackjack tables'' _ or roulette
tables, or any other place where gamblers gather.
</P>
<P>
   Today is of course one of the most sacred of days for those who
worship at the church that the late bookmaker Jimmy the Greek built
_ Super Sunday, the day in which many sports fans believe that it
matters not whether they win or lose, but how they cover the point
spread. Congregationalists will assemble at living rooms all over
America believing that they are in tune with some cosmic force that
will deliver unto them a super payoff if the Falcons are triumphant
or if the Broncos win big.
</P>
<P>
   History and culture have drained away much of humanity's belief
in a God who participates in our daily affairs; how such a God
could allow the Holocaust is only one of the questions left
unanswered. And the culture itself has become so materialistic and
despiritualized that when we do hear someone talking about the
living presence of God, it's usually a fathead football player, a
Gantryesque evangelist, or a reformed rapper or drug addict.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of prayer to an activist deity does live on, though,
wherever people congregate to gamble _ casinos, racetracks, and in
the living rooms of those who bet big money on athletic events.
Gambling is the one activity where most gamblers feel a connection,
not necessarily to God but to some kind of godhead that orders the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should gamble every chance you get,'' an astrologer friend
of mine told me decades ago. ``With your Venus-Jupiter conjunction
in Sagittarius it's a sure thing.'' And the truth was, I did seem
to win more than my share at poker, makeshift blackjack games, and
betting on sports events.
</P>
<P>
   So sometime in the late 1970s, I packed up my karma and headed
for Mecca, a.k.a. Las Vegas. Once you get past the tackiness of the
place there are signs of devotion everywhere you look. The lack of
clocks speaks to the timelessness of casinos. There is no day, no
night, only the sights and sounds of ritualized, if not religious,
behavior _ the poker player shuffling his cards five times before
looking at them; the transfixed woman at the slot machine with her
quarters lined up like a sacrifice; the roulette player who plays
the date of his birth. They all think their behavior blesses and
sanctifies them to their mysterious benefactor, whoever or whatever
it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Poker was my game, and I sat down at a seven-card-stud table.
Sure enough, I won hand after hand, barely having time to stack the
chips before the next pot rolled in. ``Don't you ever fold?''
scolded one of the table elders. I just smiled as if to say, ``You
don't fold when God's on your side.'' But by 2 a.m. I had lost it
all, plus the $100 limit I had set for myself.
</P>
<P>
   A few deals earlier, though, the guy across from me had said
something I should have listened to more closely. As he folded
after looking at his first three cards, he declared, ``You got
nothin' goin' in, you get nothin' goin' out.'' Hmmm, there seemed
to be a system here: Maybe something other than one's aura and
common sense determined who won and who lost.
</P>
<P>
   The more time I spent at poker tables in Vegas or Foxwoods over
the years, the more apparent it became that the ones who believed
they were divinely touched _ the guy who shuffled five times or all
the others with their idiosyncratic superstitions _ were invariably
the losers. The winners rarely said a word, looked like extras from
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' and went home with more money
than they came in with.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when I was covering David Letterman doing his NBC
 &UR;  &LR; late-night show from Las Vegas and spending my off hours at
Bally's poker table, I noticed this dour retiree who would fold
most hands, but win almost every one he played before waddling off
into the night. It turned out that he would leave every day after
winning $100. Without fail. The more I watched him the more
apparent it became that he had devised a mathematical, though not
quite foolproof, formula for winning at poker. And he had the
discipline to limit himself to winning $100 a day, rather than risk
losing it all.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the epiphany to end all gambling epiphanies! This
joyless little man could win $100 a night because every one at the
table but him believed in some kind of divine intervention. He only
believed in math _ he only played those hands in which the odds,
after three cards were dealt, gave him a good chance of winning.
And he was a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The corollary to that epiphany explains why a casino is a
license to print money. Everybody believes he or she can beat the
odds, but the casino owners, atheists every one, know that's
impossible on a regular basis. They've erected false temples; the
divinely touched are merely touched. Successful gamblers don't
gamble, they play the odds. (The reason that our dour friend could
win his $100 is that poker players aren't playing against the
house, they're playing against each other with the house taking a
percentage.)
</P>
<P>
   The more I played mathematically, the more I won. The more I
trusted in my stars, the more I lost. Unfortunately, poker played
by the system is a rote, thoroughly boring way of passing the time
because the system mandates folding almost every hand immediately.
Nevertheless, my competitive spirit dictated that I would become an
agnostic gambler, since it was the only way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to football. There was a year in my life
when I flirted with gambling on pro football games.  &UR;  &LR; After a
season in which I was breaking about even I bet $500 on the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1980 Super Bowl, sure that they would
cover the 11-point spread against the lowly Los Angeles Rams. It
turned out, though, to be a surprisingly close game and the wager
came down to a third-and-goal from the one-yard line with
Pittsburgh ahead by five points. If Franco Harris scored on the
next play I would win; if he didn't, the Steelers would kick a
field goal that would put them up by eight late in the game,
thereby ensuring a victory. But an eight-point win wouln't cover
the spread. And I would lose 500 smackers.
</P>
<P>
   I looked heavenward and silently said, ``If You let Pittsburgh
score on the next play, I'll never bet on another football game.''
Pittsburgh did score, and I never placed another football bet. I
may be an agnostic, and the odds are that if I placed an affordable
wager nothing terrible would happen. But on this one I'm not taking
any chances. Besides, when it comes to sacred vows, a bet's a bet.

 &HT;    GORE CALLS FOR LOWER FARM TARIFFS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ The Clinton administration will call for
``broad and steep'' cuts in world farm tariffs, Vice President Al
Gore said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Vice President announced the new trade move at the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum, which is heavily laden with
European politicians and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agricultural subsidies cost the average European family about
$1,500 a year,'' Gore noted. ``We will call for outright
elimination of agricultural export subsidies, which are found in no
other sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement here follows on the heels of a recent White
House initiative to hold a new round of global trade negotiations
later this year _ one that would also cover such areas as financial
services and manufacturing. Although other nations have yet to
formally respond, U.S. diplomats who have joined in the conference
are already optimistically referring to proposed new trade talks as
``the Clinton Round.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at this Alpine ski resort by train from Geneva
after nearly all of Switzerland was socked by a two-day blizzard.
For a time, the driving snow closed Zurich airport, blocking Air
Force Two from landing.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the assembled 2,500 forum participants, the
vice president drove through the fresh mounds of new snow to meet
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov at the Russian's nearby rented
villa.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute speech, Gore also called for ``significant new
U.S. funding for debt relief for poor, highly indebted nations.''
Unlike his remarks on farm tariffs, the proposed help for the
world's poorest nations won wide applause.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal 2000 budget, to be released Monday, will include
the debt relief proposal, Gore said. In the past, the
Republican-run Congress has resisted such foreign aid moves.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by a questioner, Gore declined to use the occasion to
announce his presidential candidacy, ``much as I am tempted to do
this in Davos.'' When the audience laughed, Gore said ``I knew that
would please this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton impeachment trial, also raised during the brief
question period, was dealt with in an elliptical fashion. After
initially declining to comment, Gore cited James Madison's writings
in the Federalist Papers, in which. he said, ``Madison had warned
us against extreme partisanship, which he called 'factions.' '
</P>
<P>
   Some historians have interpreted Madison's writings as raising
the danger to the new republic of forming any political parties
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``if I read the tea leaves, (the trial) is going to
end soon,'' Gore said.

   DAVOS, Switzerland _ The Clinton administration will call for
``broad and steep'' cuts in world farm tariffs, Vice President Al
Gore said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Vice President announced the new trade move at the annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum, which is heavily laden with
European politicians and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agricultural subsidies cost the average European family about
$1,500 a year,'' Gore noted. ``We will call for outright
elimination of agricultural export subsidies, which are found in no
other sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement here follows on the heels of a recent White
House initiative to hold a new round of global trade negotiations
later this year _ one that would also cover such areas as financial
services and manufacturing. Although other nations have yet to
formally respond, U.S. diplomats who have joined in the conference
are already optimistically referring to proposed new trade talks as
``the Clinton Round.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at this Alpine ski resort by train from Geneva
after nearly all of Switzerland was socked by a two-day blizzard.
For a time, the driving snow closed Zurich airport, blocking Air
Force Two from landing.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the assembled 2,500 forum participants, the
vice president drove through the fresh mounds of new snow to meet
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov at the Russian's nearby rented
villa.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute speech, Gore also called for ``significant new
U.S. funding for debt relief for poor, highly indebted nations.''
Unlike his remarks on farm tariffs, the proposed help for the
world's poorest nations won wide applause.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal 2000 budget, to be released Monday, will include
the debt relief proposal, Gore said. In the past, the
Republican-run Congress has resisted such foreign aid moves.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by a questioner, Gore declined to use the occasion to
announce his presidential candidacy, ``much as I am tempted to do
this in Davos.'' When the audience laughed, Gore said ``I knew that
would please this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton impeachment trial, also raised during the brief
question period, was dealt with in an elliptical fashion. After
initially declining to comment, Gore cited James Madison's writings
in the Federalist Papers, in which. he said, ``Madison had warned
us against extreme partisanship, which he called 'factions.' '
</P>
<P>
   Some historians have interpreted Madison's writings as raising
the danger to the new republic of forming any political parties
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``if I read the tea leaves, (the trial) is going to
end soon,'' Gore said.

ROTH IRA PLANS WOULD HELP COUPLE FIGHT INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER

<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 40. I am a municipal worker and my wife is
a medical records coder. Combined we earn about $80,000 a year. I
contribute $8,000 a year _ the maximum allowed _ into a deferred
compensation plan, with 35 percent of my contributions going into
Fidelity Growth and Income, the same amount to Vanguard
Institutional Index, 20 percent to AIM Constellation, and 10
percent to Templeton Foreign funds. Entering this year, I had about
$21,000 in the account. We also have $35,000 invested in
PaineWebber Growth and Income, which is earmarked for the education
of our two children, who are aged 10 and 6. My wife also has
$10,000 in a mutual fund account to which we don't make
contributions. Will we be able to retire at age 62 and still live
comfortably? I expect a pension of about $38,000 a year when I
retire; I'm not sure about my wife's retirement. Are we diversified
enough with our choice of funds?
</P>
<P>
   T.C., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. At first blush, the numbers look pretty good. But when you
adjust them for a likely rate of inflation, the skies darken. If
you keep adding $8,000 a year to your deferred compensation plan
and if you achieve average 10 percent investment returns over the
next 22 years, the investment pool (including that $10,000 your
wife has in an unspecified mutual fund) would grow to $849,857 _ a
tidy enough figure. But if you presume an average 3.5 percent
inflation rate during the next 22 years, that's the equivalent of
$398,710 in today's dollars. Such a sum, fairly conservatively
invested to produce an income stream, might bring you the buying
power of $25,916 in today's money, a calculation based upon a
projected 6.5 percent yield. Your $38,000 pension income in the
year 2021 would be worth $17,829 in today's dollars. taking you to
a total of $43,745 in year '99 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   One formula for projecting retirement needs is to calculate that
people should be able to fare reasonably well in retirement with 60
percent of their preretirement income. Since the numbers we have
worked out so far take you within $4,255 of that level, it's
reasonable to assume that whatever pension your wife might earn,
plus any Social Security either of you may be entitled to, plus
additional accumulation you might expect from future raises (which
in theory would allow you to add more to the deferred compensation
plan) would make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a far from comfortable situation. When you retire
fairly early, you should have some capital on hand beyond what you
need to produce an income stream; this is necessary to provide a
financial pool to protect you against the ravages of inflation
during the later years of your retirement. Since the chances are
that you will just about produce the capital necessary to produce a
reasonable income stream, you need to start a supplemental savings
program to give you that inflation hedge. Since a great deal of
your savings will be in that tax-deferred account, it would be nice
if you could balance that with some tax-free savings, which
suggests Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   If both of you could make the maximum $2,000-a-year
contributions allowed for Roth IRAs in each of the next 22 years,
it should produce a combined pool of $297,562, again based upon an
expectation of 10 percent average annual investment returns. That
should do the trick. I realize that `save more' isn't the answer
anybody wants to hear, but unless you can count on a lot more than
I've estimated from your wife's pension and/or Social Security, I
can't see any attractive way around it.
</P>
<P>
   Your funds are all solid enough, but there's an overlarge
concentration in large-cap stocks, which dominate the portfolios of
both Fidelity Growth and Income and Vanguard Institutional Index
(as well as PaineWebber Growth and Income, for that matter). If
your wife's unidentified mutual fund account is also in a large-cap
stock fund, so much the worse. I'd be happier if you were to divert
10 percent to 15 percent of your deferred compensation
contributions from the large-cap funds to a small-cap fund, if
there's one available. And if I were in your situation, I'd put any
additional money you might set aside in a good health care sector
fund, such as Fidelity Select Health Care or Vanguard Specialized
Health Care, building the position until it reaches about 15
percent of your total retirement portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I suggest you calculate what percentage of the money
you have saved for your children's education is earmarked for each
child. Once you've done that, I would begin right now to moderate
the risk level for the money that your elder child will be calling
on in about seven years _ perhaps moving 20 percent from the growth
and income fund and putting it in a balanced fund this year, and
making a similar move for each of the next five years. In
subsequent years, you might reduce risk even further, gradually
moving funds from the balanced fund to a short-term bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a widowed sister who will inherit a sum of money
estimated between $70,000 and $90,000. She basically lives on
Social Security plus a small stipend from her son. She is 75 years
old with no savings. I would like to recommend to her that she put
the money into Vanguard GNMA and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond
funds, from which she could make deposits to her bank account to
pay small bills; Vanguard checks must be $250 or more. Can you
suggest a rate of withdrawal from these funds, allowing a slight
reserve for growth?
</P>
<P>
   H.J., Boxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If we assume an $80,000 investment pool and investment of 75
percent in the GNMA fund and the balance in the Short-Term
Corporate Bond fund, she would realize an annual income stream of
$4,856, based on the funds' yield levels as this is written _ 5.75
percent for Short-Term Corporate and 6.26 percent for GNMA. My
suggestion is that rather than using the check-writing option, she
ask Vanguard to send her a monthly check for a fixed amount. If
$290 were withdrawn monthly from the GNMA fund and $85 from
Short-Term Corporate Bond, the result would be that about $350 a
year would be reinvested in the accounts _ filling your very
sensible suggestion of leaving a small percentage of the yield to
generate a small level of principal growth in the account.

HARDLY CHARITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't, as they say, want to put BankBoston's Ira Jackson
next to Alan Friedberg, retired chairman of Loews Theatres, at your
next dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   While the two had the usual seconds (the lawyers), Jackson and
Friedberg were the principals in what over the past few months
became an ugly and personal duel over investments gone bad and
which Boston institutions would get what in the way of BankBoston
charitable donations.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? I'll tell the story; you make the call.
</P>
<P>
   At 66 silver-haired Friedberg is a longtime Boston figure who
started as a $100-a-week assistant theater manager 41 years ago and
stayed around to run the Loews chain, which operated in 14 states
when he retired in 1992. Over the years Friedberg and his socialite
wife, Nikki, came to be lauded in some quarters and reviled in
others because as the late, great Globe columnist John Robinson
once put it: Friedberg bites back.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1986. It was then that the bank's private
bank group, which caters to the wealthy, pitched Friedberg on
managing the millions he was getting in the buyout of the theater
chain. Friedberg listened over lunch, and agreed to let the bank
manage $5 million, what he calls ``my nest egg.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, Friedberg says the bank promised one thing, did
another, and eventually cost him a bundle. Instead of investing the
money conservatively in individual municipal bonds as he had
instructed, the bank put more than $4 million into its own bond
mutual fund, the suit says. When bonds got crushed in 1994,
Friedberg says he was socked with a ``double whammy'': falling
values of his portfolio and a huge capital gains bill.
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg says he had no intention of personally profiting from
the suit: He says any recovery above his costs would go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where things really get fun.
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg wanted the bank to commit to providing money to six of
his favorite charities: the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Museum
of Fine Arts, the American Repertory Theater, Harvard School of
Public Health, the New England Aquarium, and the Institute of
Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg's attorney, Richard Yurko, says the bank objected to
making the donations in Friedberg's name, but in late September
agreed to a deal that would provide $25,000 to each of the six
charities for two consecutive years, or $300,000 total. In addition
the bank agreed to pay Friedberg $115,000, he says.
</P>
<P>
   A draft agreement from the bank's attorney, Doug Moxham, shows a
much softer accord. In it the bank names the six charities and
notes that they received more than $220,000 from the bank in 1997
and 1998. ``BankBoston expects that in 1999, it will continue its
generous contributions to the arts, culture, and humanities,'' it
says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Friedberg thought he had a deal _ until the bank's lawyer
called back and said no way. Jackson, who oversees charitable
giving in the bank, had objected, Yurko says. Friedberg's view:
``The bank welshed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later Friedberg was playing tennis with his pal
Nicholas Zervas, head of neurology at Massachusetts General
Hospital and BSO president. Zervas asked about the BankBoston suit;
Friedberg filled him in. Zervas offered to call his pal Ira at the
bank; Friedberg suggested that if Zervas could free up the
$300,000, all of it could go to the BSO.
</P>
<P>
   Zervas called; the bank exploded. Settlement talks over. ``How
could they have the unbelievable audacity to accuse me (of talking)
under the circumstances just blows my mind!'' says Friedberg.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did nothing wrong, he says. Its handling of Friedberg's
account saved him money, not cost him. He says Friedberg had no
case and no agreement. Friedberg's attempt to dictate the bank's
charitable giving was a nonstarter, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a grossly inappropriate demand,'' Jackson says. The
bank, he notes, is about to be honored nationally as corporate
philathropist of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg and the bank recently settled. Friedberg got $110,000,
period. And one more thing: no gag order. Unlike the first deal,
the final one lets either side talk if the media calls. ``We
negotiated hard for that,'' says Yurko.

BANKERS WRESTLE WITH WORRIES OF CUSTOMER Y2K PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Robert Caruso has always considered small banks a world of
certainty and predictability, even during the savings and loan
crisis of the 1980s. At Lowell Five Cent Savings Bank, where Caruso
is president, the steady faith of loyal customers blends seamlessly
into the quotidian business of deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Caruso is less at ease. Bank customers
everywhere are awash in apocalyptic forecasts that widespread
computer failure as the clocks tick past midnight on Dec. 31
endangers not just banks but civilization itself. The most fateful
advice, usually from the Internet, urges people to empty their
accounts, hoard food and medicine, and head for the hills to wait
out the ensuing year 2000 chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Such fringe thinking has hardly gained currency. But disquiet
among bankers over the millennium computer problem is increasingly
palpable. As a safeguard, Caruso's bank and nine other Lowell,
Mass. banks, all solid and insured, are considering pooling
reserves later this year. Should one bank see withdrawals from
panicky customers, the others could backstop with extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   With their precautions, the bankers in this former textile mill
city are not alone. Financial institutions have largely solved the
technological problem of Y2K. Now they are grappling with something
far less tractable: its psychological aspect. Amid uncertainty over
how much Y2K could disrupt operations and how consumers could
react, banks are quietly debating at what point their prudent
safeguards become overreactions with alarming repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Deposits are not in danger of permanently vanishing into the
technological ether when 1999 rolls over to the new year. Extra
money in the banking system, insurance, and contingency plans, on
top of banks' strong progress in readying their computers, largely
protect against that. But in a financial world where perception can
shape reality and consumer confidence is as important as cash, no
one wants to risk complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is very concerned about issues of public
confidence,'' said Frank Hartigan, Y2K project director at the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which supervises state-chartered
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Recent interviews with a dozen senior bank regulators, bank
executives, and trade group officials reveal an industry torn
between a longing to educate the public and a fear of inadvertently
fueling worry. In a system in which one man's deposit is another's
loan, and only 10 percent of the $4.5 trillion in US bank accounts
is available in cash at any given moment, no one wants to take any
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 issue involves reprogramming the world's computers
to get rid of old technology that could mistake 2000 for 1900,
causing problems ranging from innocuous to catastrophic. That,
bankers say, is the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering if the lights will come on as the calendar turns
cannot cause bulbs to dim. But vague public worry about whether
banks will operate as usual _ regardless of whether their computers
are functioning normally _ could lead some customers to scramble
for their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the industry or anybody knows what's going to be
yanked out,'' said Paul Connolly, vice president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all bank officials dismiss doomsday talk of Y2K-induced
bank runs. There have not been panicked queues outside US banks
since the Great Depression in 1929, and not even the thrift crisis
last decade sparked a mass rush.
</P>
<P>
   But as officials acknowledge computer glitches are inevitable
and that no one can say with certainty how big the hiccups will be,
many banks are preparing for worst-case scenarios. At the same
time, the industry is in a Catch-22: Fears of litigation over
Y2K-related failures make it tough for banks to trumpet their
readiness, while a steady doomsday narrative from professional
consultants, splashed across newspapers and television, makes it
imperative they do so.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are by many measures well prepared for Y2K. Nearly 97
percent of the nation's more than 11,000 insured banks and savings
and loans, the Lowell banks included, have spent $80 billion
readying their computers and are in good shape. An equal number of
credit unions, representing far fewer deposits, are also passing
the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the public's thinking on Y2K, however, is trickier. To
get a handle on the popular mood, the American Bankers Association
and the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, plan to conduct
separate polls. One item to pinpoint: whether older customers with
large sums who remember the Depression are more likely to feel
skittish than nickel-and-dime depositors.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of Y2K executives from the nation's top 40
banks, officials concluded that tackling ordinary consumers'
concerns was now the industry's top issue, since banks had spent
the past year reassuring corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mode has been to say nothing or `don't worry, be happy,'
'' Connolly said. ``But extreme points of view thrive in a
vacuum,'' he continued. ``If you have a steady drum beat of
messages about catastrophic consequences, after a while, the
messages can start to resonate.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering information and soothing words, rather than all-is-fine
guarantees or silence, is a new step for the traditionally
tight-lipped banking industry. But openness about Y2K carries a
price.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys, aware there will be problems at even the best
prepared companies, caution banks against describing their
preparations or contingency plans. Should a computer fail to
calculate a mortgage rate adjustment or post a deposit, a customer
could sue. Under federal law, banks cannot even discuss the Y2K
readiness ratings regulators assign them. And there are plenty of
factors beyond banks' control, like power and telephone outages,
for which banks could be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a welter of legal obstacles, the FDIC is now urging
financial institutions to remind customers that individual deposits
at FDIC member banks are insured to $100,000. The agency is also
pushing banks to tell the public that an army of regulators is
inspecting bank computer systems, and that contingency plans,
ranging from standy-by power generators to old-fashioned ledgers,
abound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fed, banks are exhorted to be more forthcoming. ``Our
intent is to try to get enough information into the public's hands
that will quell fears, not fan them,'' said Cathy E. Minehan,
president of the Boston Fed. Minehan heads a policy-making group on
Y2K matters for the Federal Reserve, which supervises large banks.
</P>
<P>
   On matters such as funds availability on New Year's Day, the Fed
is nudging banks to make not iron-clad promises but sobering
reassurances _ if only, Minehan said, so that vulnerable depositors
do not fall prey to scams or become theft targets by taking out
money and hiding it at home.
</P>
<P>
   And the Massachusetts Bankers Assocation suggests banks contact
big depositors to reassure them, as well as hold open houses and
even school seminars, since ``parents pick up a great deal from
their children,'' the Massachusetts Banker quarterly says in its
forthcoming issue. The occasional informational statement stuffer,
the publication says, will not do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the quarterly notes, now is ``a good time to remember
the Depression-era bank president who, facing an incipient run, had
his tellers stock bundles of cash in plain sight'' _ a move that
reassured depositors. The same article advises banks not to tell
anxious customers to refrain from taking out lots of money before
the date change, since doing so could foster the image of a bank
under a cash strain.
</P>
<P>
   Some bankers say things will likely be no worse than short-lived
cash-machine closures or delays in accessing account information.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely. Probably. Maybe. The industry is loath to give
specific guarantees and quick to urge customers to save statements
and receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how thorough things are, there will be hiccups,''
David Iacino, BankBoston's Y2K chief, told a recent industry
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   There are other sticky issues. Banks that stockpile cash will
ultimately lower their profits, since cash in a vault isn't earning
interest. Banks cannot just hoard extra money without buying more
insurance _ also a costly matter. And security risks abound. The
Lowell bankers are allying with the local police so that power
outages do not render their vaults a theft target.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating increased demand for cash, the Fed will have an
extra $50 billion in reserves to bolster the $200 billion or so
used daily in the United States. It will also extend credit to
banks that feel a pinch, Minehan said. Toward December, banks will
monitor withdrawals, providing a heads-up to any leakages. And
banks are required to have paper trails documenting customer
accounts the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   A wise move, some seasoned observers say. Professor Charles P.
Kindleberger, a retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology
economist and expert on financial panics, said the popular mood
would not unduly pressure banks. ``There will be no panics,''
Kindleberger said. ``But there may be some slow leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso knows he cannot tally up customer faith in his
institution like so much spare change. He, too, is anticipating a
need for anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent more cash, and will
consider selling investment assets if even more is needed. Still,
Caruso has a nightmare: ``That the bank is shrunk in asset size,''
he said, ``and we lose customer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned but confident, the regulators who make the wheels of
the nation's banking system turn are braced for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do whatever it takes,'' Connolly said. ``There will be
no panics.''

public television network.
</P>
<P>
   Pas'ko helped the Japanese news media expose Russian dumping of
high-level liquid radioactive material in the Sea of Japan in 1993,
sparking an international furor.
</P>
<P>
   The trial before a panel of naval judges began last week.
</P>
<P>
   The international organization Human Rights Watch and the
International Press Institute have denounced the charges against
Pas'ko as a political attempt to stifle legitimate reporting on the
serious environmental threat posed by the decaying Soviet-era
nuclear submarine fleet. Amnesty International recently proclaimed
the 37-year-old officer as a ``prisoner of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the outcry on behalf of the jailed officer this week was
retired Adm. Charles Larson, who led the first U.S. Navy visit to
Vladivostok in 1990 when he was commander of the U.S. Pacific
Fleet, and where Pas'ko served as a press escort for American
journalists. Larson subsequently commanded all U.S. forces in the
Asia-Pacific theater and since his retirement last year has worked
on a National Academy of Sciences committee on military nuclear
waste problems in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned when I read about the arrest,'' Larson
said about the Pas'ko case. ``If we are going to have a true
democracy in Russia, we need a free press there.''
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Russian military has been struggling for more
than a decade to effectively dispose of high-level radioactive
material, including the spent reactor fuel from decommissioned
submarines and surface warships, said Joshua Handler, a former
Greenpeace research director for naval nuclear issues who has
studied the crisis in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 250 nuclear-powered warships built by the Soviet and
Russian navy, 160 have been retired, but only 50 have had the fuel
removed for disposal, Handler said. About 100 of the retired subs
are still moored in harbor with their radioactive materials still
aboard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Handler said he is ``mystified'' by the belated effort by
Russian security services to prosecute Pas'ko, given the opening of
the region to foreign reporters and an open dialogue between
Russian military officials and local environmental groups over the
nuclear waste issue in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the lower-level (security) bureaus are
no longer getting messages from on high that human rights and
freedom of the press are a good thing,'' Handler said yesterday.
``The local-level guys are free to resume doing what they did in
the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said the Pas'ko case may have implications extending far
beyond the single issue of a free press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is kind of scary to me is where is the central
control (over the nuclear waste disposal)?'' Larson asked. ``Who
has control and accountability for this, and who is responsible for
keeping it safely in an interim storage?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has earmarked $70 million in aid for the naval
nuclear waste cleanup in the past two years under the Cooperative
Threat Reduction agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pas'ko is the second naval officer to be charged for assisting
Western organizations in monitoring the nuclear waste situation.
Former Capt. Alexander Nitikin was tried on espionage charges last
year in St. Petersburg after he helped the Norwegian environmental
group Bellona gather information on Soviet-era nuclear pollution
above the Arctic Circle. His case will be heard by the Russian
Supreme Court next month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pas'ko remains in prison. The charge carries a
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

IN CONNECTICUT, A COSTLY RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Rules are rules. Let that thought echo through your mind as
you think of 26-year-old Clarence Jackson scrubbing the floors of a
Connecticut supermarket on the same overnight shift he has worked
since he was 17, when he took over the family cleaning company from
his sick father.
</P>
<P>
   Rules are rules. You wouldn't know it from looking at him, or
from the nocturnal hours he keeps, but Jackson won the Connecticut
lottery 2 1/2 years ago, or at least he held the winning ticket. He
matched all six numbers in a Lotto drawing with a $5.8 million
prize _ enough to give him $212,000 a year, after taxes, for the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But rules are rules. Jackson was at work on a Sunday night,
cleaning, when his sister called and told him to get home, quick.
As the television news blared word of the one-year deadline
expiring at midnight on an unclaimed $5.8 million Lotto ticket, she
found a pile of lottery slips tucked away in their ailing father's
bureau _ tickets that Jackson routinely bought and left with his
old man. Jackson rushed back to the family's Hamden house and they
realized they had a match.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Jackson logically figured he had to bring the
ticket to lottery headquarters, which was closed on Sunday night.
The next day being Columbus Day, the lottery office was closed
again. By Tuesday, all the local papers and television stations
were saying it was too late for the would-be winner. On Wednesday,
when an understandably anxious Jackson showed up at lottery
headquarters with the ticket, he was unceremoniously told he was
too late. Rules are rules.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, in Connecticut, ``Rules are rules'' is not just an
old saw, but a way of life, a variation of ``Live free or die'' for
the actuarial set. It's a state filled with bureaucrats who cross
T's and dot I's for a living, who like to think in triplicate to be
able to save their thoughts on file, who get a little quiver up
their spine when they think of the benefits of whole-term life
insurance in the dark of the night.
</P>
<P>
   This is what young Clarence Jackson came up against as he tried
to persuade a state, its lottery officials, and ultimately its
Legislature that sometimes it's all right to break the rules, to
take a walk on the wild side, to spot a lottery winner three extra
days in claiming a jackpot. In response, Connecticut offered him a
look of collective shock, amazed that someone would stray from the
fine print. In one poll, 65 percent said Jackson shouldn't get the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson pleaded his case to lottery executives, who rejected
him. The courts rejected him. He brought his argument to the
General Assembly in 1997. By 2-to-1, it voted to pay the money. But
when the bill was sent to the Senate, one man, Senator Alvin Penn,
blocked the measure from a full floor vote. Rules are rules.
</P>
<P>
   Penn is black, as is Jackson, and that seems to be a curious
factor. In an apparent case of reverse discrimination, Penn once
justified his position to a reporter by saying, ``If I compromise
myself based on my feelings, people would say, `He did it because
(Jackson is) black or because he's poor.' '' So if Jackson were
white, Penn would break the rules?
</P>
<P>
   The case has brought discontent to the legislative ranks.
Republican Representative Chris DePino has vowed to file new
legislation every year until Jackson wins the case, and did so last
week. ``Give the kid his money,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson watched from the gallery when the Senate killed his
bill. He left with a wan smile on his face after shaking Penn's
hand. He continues on the night shift, still living at home with
his mother and sisters. Lesser men would crumble at what should
have been. Radio disc jockeys call his house and laugh. Onetime
friends mock his plight.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jackson indulges himself in occasional fiscal fantasy,
saying he'd go to college with the money, adding, ``I would
probably get my own apartment and my mother her own town house.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains both hopeful and philosophical about life and money
and how the two intertwine. ``If I turned the ticket in, I might
not have spent enough time with my father before he passed away,
and he was my best friend. Sometimes money can really change
people. Would it change me? Who knows. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe you do. And in Jackson's case, it seems a safe bet.
Novel as this may sound, Connecticut, sometimes rules are made to
be broken.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Connecticut waived the rules for Patriots owner Bob
Kraft, handing him a payout potentially worth hundreds of millions
of dollars. And Kraft didn't even have to buy a ticket.

CARAVAGGIO MAGNIFICO 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometime in the late 1700s, the paper trail of a 1602
Caravaggio masterpiece went cold. As there are roughly only 50
paintings that experts accept as Caravaggios, this was a matter of
importance to the art world, especially after the 20th century
rediscovered the artist, who'd fallen out of fashion in the 18th
and 19th. The hunt for the lost masterwork resulted in contenders,
but none won the scholarly seal of approval. All were eventually
pronounced copies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Jesuits living in a handsome Georgian house on
Dublin's Lower Leeson Street were having some redecorating done,
and their superior, the Rev. Noel Barber, thought it was time to
ask the folks at the nearby National Gallery of Ireland to consider
cleaning the paintings the order owned as well. Some were in sad
shape _ especially a big, dark, dirty picture by Gerard Honthorst.
</P>
<P>
   Which turned out to be the missing Caravaggio, ``The Taking of
Christ.'' It's now hanging in Boston College's McMullen Museum of
Art in ``Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a
show opening to the public on Monday after a weekend of
high-profile festivities. ``The Taking of Christ'' is an exclusive
Jesuit-to-Jesuit loan _ and one of the most sublimely beautiful
paintings you'll ever lay eyes on. Its rediscovery is also an
engrossing detective story (extensively detailed by Jonathan Harr
in a 1994 New York Times Magazine story.) Barber fairly twinkles as
he recalls his order being let in on the secret once it was
suspected but before it was proved: ``We imposed on ourselves a vow
of Trappist silence. We Jesuits talk too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the news came out, in 1993, Barber promptly parked the
painting in the National Gallery on indefinite loan, acknowledging
it as part of Ireland's patrimony as well as the Jesuits'.
``Otherwise, I fear it would have gone to the Getty Museum,'' he
says with a slight shudder. The Getty is the world's only museum
that could comfortably afford a price likely to exceed $30 million.
But Barber is keen on keeping the painting in Dublin, allowing it
to travel only on the rarest occasions.
</P>
<P>
   A series of coincidences brought the Caravaggio to the Jesuits.
It's another coincidence that the painter's naturalistic, earthy
style harmonizes with the teachings of the founder of the Jesuit
order, St. Ignatius Loyola, who ``emphasized you don't just read
scripture, you imagine yourself in it,'' Barber says. Caravaggio
literally put himself in the Dublin picture: The face at the right
edge of ``The Taking of Christ'' is his.
</P>
<P>
   The rediscovered masterpiece is just one painting _ albeit the
climactic one _ in a show of 30. A visually and intellectually rich
exhibition, it delves into such matters as how legends accrue
around saints, partly through pop culture pamphlets called
``chapbooks,'' and why martyrdom is more of a turn-on in Italian
Baroque painting than actual sex. Consider the martyred protagonist
in Daniel Seiter's ``St. Sebastian Healed by St. Irene.'' Sebastian
stretches languidly, raising one arm and throwing his head back,
the better to expose a luscious body covered only in a loosely tied
loincloth that threatens to slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baroque artists knew that to get the attention of their
viewers, they had to delight them,'' says Boston College faculty
member the Rev. Franco Mormando, who has worked on the Caravaggio
project for over three years with McMullen director Nancy Netzer
and a team of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures in the show come from many collections, public and
private. The two owned by BC are among the weakest, with BC's
Sassoferrato the sappiest of all, an eye-rolling Madonna surrounded
by Hallmark-worthy cherubs. BC's is a small and mostly
undistinguished collection, which makes the Caravaggio show all the
more a coup, as the university doesn't have anything major to lend
other museums in return.
</P>
<P>
   As these still-persuasive pictures attest, Caravaggio's
naturalism and humanism were weapons in the Catholic Church's
counterattack against Protestantism. Painting was a propaganda
tool. ``Catholicism,'' says Mormando, ``knew long before Madison
Avenue did that a direct route to the heart is through the eyes.''
Take that, Martin Luther.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1602, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio painted three
masterpieces for a noble Roman family called Mattei: ``The Supper
at Emmaus,'' now in London's National Gallery; a ``St. John the
Baptist'' in the Capitoline Museum in Rome; and ``The Taking of
Christ,'' which descended through generations of the Mattei clan.
In 1802, after the family fortunes fell, the Matteis sold ``The
Taking of Christ'' to William Nisbet, a wealthy Scot who thought he
was buying a Honthorst. The error may have been merely clerical,
and at that point, it didn't much matter whether a painting was a
Honthorst or a Caravaggio: The latter's reputation had fallen
further than the Mattei fortune.
</P>
<P>
   By 1921, the Nisbets' fortune had also fallen, and the
``Honthorst'' was put up for auction in Edinburgh, where records
indicate it didn't meet its reserve price _ $50. The auction house
and most of its other records subsequently burned, leaving no
account of what happened to the painting next.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sergio Benedetti, an Italian restorer in the employ of
the Dublin museum and the man charged with cleaning ``The Taking of
Christ,'' who identified the painting. Thunderstruck when he saw
the ``Honthorst'' in the priests' house, Benedetti was determined
to prove it a Caravaggio, and as he cleaned its surface, inch by
inch, a process that took over two years, he became more and more
sure. He uncovered clues including pentimenti, evidence that
Caravaggio had changed the painting along the way: Someone merely
copying the composition wouldn't have altered it.

`FAMILY GUY' IS HARDLY KID STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FAMILY GUY 
Starring the voices of: Seth MacFarlane, Seth Green 
On: Fox 
Time: Premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. (after Super Bowl); begins a
regular run in March 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Stewie Griffin, demon infant. A pint-sized Peter Lorre
dressed in Baby Gap, he stalks his sweet-natured mother around the
kitchen, wielding brutal military weaponry and cursing her reign of
matriarchal tyranny. ``Damn you, vile woman,'' he sneers at her.
``You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched
womb.'' With his rabid paranoia, reverse Oedipal fixation, and his
veddy British accent, the existence of little Stewie flies in the
face of American suburban coziness and baby worship. He is at the
wonderfully black heart of ``Family Guy,'' a new animated series
about a Rhode Island household that makes ``King of the Hill'' look
a little like ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Satire on the American family is nothing new to TV, of course,
and nearly every family sitcom magnifies and upends a few domestic
secrets and absurdities. But ``Family Guy'' takes it all a step
further, combining familiar Dad-goes-to-a-stag-party high jinks
with the sort of raunchy, politically incorrect gags made famous by
Comedy Central's ``South Park.'' For every conventional comic bit
involving father Peter Griffin's thickheaded bumbling, there is a
blunt cultural lampoon bound to offend some viewers. Peter works at
the Happy-Go-Lucky toy factory, for instance, and we see that the
company makes a military action figure called GI Jew that whines,
``You call these bagels?'' As mom Lois talks to daughter Meg about
self-image, the scene cuts to ``Das Gym,'' where a weakling Adolf
Hitler is being laughed at by a burly fellow wearing a Star of
David. Meanwhile, a group called Jemima's Witnesses is seen
traveling around the Griffins' neighborhood, asking, ``You folks
want some pancakes?''
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Mostly, but only if you can handle what is now
commonly called ``edge'' _ and I don't just mean ethnic humor.
``Family Guy,'' which premieres after Sunday's Super Bowl at 10
p.m., is a cousin to ``The Simpsons,'' but it's a cousin that has
just spent a night on the town with Howard Stern. True to its home,
the Fox network, the show contains a goodly number of bathroom and
penis jokes, including a dismembered statue of David; it's not
exactly a cartoon made for kids. But the script is often witty
about modern life and the illusion of family values, and it's got a
pop slyness as, like ``The Simpsons,'' it riffs off other pieces of
entertainment. The premiere opens on a spoof of ``The Brady
Bunch,'' with Greg being sentenced to four hours in a snake pit for
smoking cigarettes, and it proceeds to goof on ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' ``Joanie Loves Chachi,'' the Super Bowl, and Fox itself,
for shows like ``When Animals Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of ``Family Guy'' is rapid-fire _ some of the visual
and verbal jokes slip by almost unnoticed _ and that adds to the
sense of Griffin familial insanity. Indeed, there is only one
earthbound member of the family, and it's not Dad, a dummy who
falls asleep on the job, nor is it any of the three children _ baby
Stewie and teenagers Chris and Meg, who manages to finagle collagen
shots to fill out her lips. And it's certainly not Mom, who is so
clueless she doesn't realize her own child despises her (Mom: ``Why
don't you play in the other room?'' Stewie: ``Why don't you burn in
hell?''). The calm center of ``Family Guy'' is Brian, the dog, who
serenely advises Peter about the ways of the world. After Peter
loses his job in Sunday's episode and illegally cashes a botched
welfare check for $50,000, Brian plays Ward Cleaver to Peter's
Beaver: ``Peter, you may have to return that money to the
taxpayers,'' he warns paternally. He is the ironic answer to the
big question posed by the ``Family Guy'' theme song, ``Where are
those family values on which we used to rely?''
</P>
<P>
   After its premiere on Sunday, ``Family Guy'' will return in
March, when it will join the Fox schedule on an as-yet undetermined
night.

   For travelers in 1999, the watchword is ``buyer beware.''

<P>
   ``People out there are getting suckered every day,'' James
Ashurst of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) says.

   In part, Ashurst claims, this is because con artists seem to be
getting smarter, or at least more technologically savvy. In
addition to the mail and the telephone, the Internet looms larger
than ever as the preferred breeding ground for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ASTA now convenes an annual conference on travel fraud, which
they say is a $12 billion-a-year problem.
</P>
<P>
   According to ASTA, over the past few years, thousands of people
have been duped by a quick-and-easy offer to become a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   For an amount ranging from $500 to several thousand dollars,
consumers receive a package containing a training kit and an ID
card and agree to sell similar packages to other consumers for a
portion of their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is the promised opportunity to travel as a travel
agent, at substantially reduced rates. But like a classic pyramid
scheme, the result is usually a handful of people who make a great
deal of money and everyone else is the poorer for getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``free trips,'' which motivate so many people to sign
on, airlines, hotels and other travel suppliers are aware of fake
travel agent IDs, and they rarely honor them.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation certificates are another continuing scam these days.
Whether mailed, faxed or sent via e-mail, they all promise the same
thing: a great vacation at a bargain-basement price.
</P>
<P>
   But they invariably require substantial additional fees to
redeem the certificates. Invariably, people pay more for their
vacations than if they had bought the packages through conventional
travel operators.
</P>
<P>
   Free air tickets, typically to places such as Hawaii and the
Caribbean, continue to be a prime temptation, too. But as everyone
should know, there is no free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The usual catch is that the tickets have to be purchased from a
specified travel agency in conjunction with hotel or condo
accommodations, at prices so high they cover the agency's cost of
the ``free'' tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win a dream vacation'' is another siren song to be wary of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some offers are above board,'' Ashurst of ASTA says, but he
cautions that many of the entry forms that can be found in
restaurant lobbies or received via the mail or e-mail ``are just an
opportunity for someone to call and pitch you a time-share vacation
or sell you a cruise. When you get there, what you get is a
refurbished auto ferry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shady contests have received a new lease on life on the
Internet. For example, a consumer might receive an unsolicited
e-mail saying they've won a $2,500 vacation for two. But to
collect, they owe the contest sponsor $395.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, no specific departure dates are given, only the
promise that they can vacation anytime within the next 18 months.
They pay the sponsor the money, but every time they try to book the
trip, the operators just can't seem to accommodate them, and 18
months later they're out of time _ and $395.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a consumer distinguish a scam from a great deal?
</P>
<P>
   1. Watch out for travel offers that say ``You have been chosen''
or ``specially selected.'' If they use the phrase ``you have been
awarded a vacation,'' it's almost certain that no such thing has
occurred _ nor will it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Should anyone insist on instant action, reject the offer.
What's good today should be good tomorrow _ and next week as well.
And anyone who promises a vacation 60 days or more down the road is
suspect, because that two-month window is typically the one that
credit-card companies allow to dispute a charge.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be wary of firms that use the term ``registration fee'' or
expressly require money to pay for certain charges in advance.
</P>
<P>
   4. Consumers cannot be made to pay for something they have
allegedly won. A credit card or check is needed only to pay for
services, not for identification.
</P>
<P>
   5. Any traveler who's offered a cheap trip should do a little
comparison shopping. If it's a ``Hawaiian vacation,'' see what a
round-trip ticket and a seven-night hotel stay in Hawaii really
costs. Call the hotel, check it out on the Internet or speak to a
travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, the term ``luxury'' is subjective. Just because a
property is located in Hawaii, the Caribbean or the Bahamas doesn't
mean that it's on a beach. Or anywhere near one.
</P>
<P>
   6. Work only with a bona-fide travel agent, preferably one who's
a member of ASTA (1101 King St., Alexandria, Va. 22314;
800-965-ASTA; www.astanet.com)
</P>
<P>
   7. Search for advertisers on the Internet and in the Yellow
Pages that carry the seal of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). It
means that they have been in business for at least one year, have
not engaged in unscrupulous advertising and will commit to binding
arbitration in the event of a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Or contact the local chapter of the BBB by phone or via the Web
(www.bbb.org).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

   For travelers in 1999, the watchword is ``buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there are getting suckered every day,'' James
Ashurst of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) says.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Ashurst claims, this is because con artists seem to be
getting smarter, or at least more technologically savvy. In

<P>
   It's the so-called low season in many desirable travel spots,
and the low season means good bargains if you're a savvy shopper.
Here are a few that would tempt us:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VEGAS VALUES. &LR;  Las Vegas rooms are a bargain in the low season,
the first few months of 1999. Here are a few Las Vegas resorts
where travelers can get rooms for $50 a night or less. Some require
two-night minimums. The rates are per room, not per person. Book
directly or through your travel agent: Arizona Charlie's ($39 and
up weeknights), 800/342-2695; Gold Spike in Glitter Gulch
($22-$33), 800/634-6703; Nevada Hotel downtown ($30 and up),
800/637-5777; and Stratosphere Tower ($39 and up, Sunday-Thursday),
800/998-6937.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUPER SENIOR 20/20 CLUB. &LR;  The Comstock Hotel/Casino
(800/266-7862) in Reno, Nev., has created a Super Senior 20/20
Special that gives travelers 55 and older 20 percent off room rates
and meals. For example, a room at the recent weekday rate of $39
would cost a mature traveler only $31. Call for details on the club
and other offers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SWEDISH WEEKENDS. &LR;  The Swedish Travel &AMP; Tourism Council is

<P>
   The fully equipped accommodations can be a cottage, villa or
apartment. The countries involved are England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland, France, Italy, Spain or Portugal. To stay an additional

for seniors for a Feb. 21 South America cruise aboard the upscale
Crystal Harmony from Buenos Aires to Puerto Rico. The lowest-priced
outside cabin now available costs $3,275 (plus $130 port charges),
compared with the posted fare of $5,365. A 14-day Latin Romance

Janeiro, Fortalaza and Barbados. Contact Cruises, Inc., at
800/558-0610.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IBERIAN PENINSULA HALF OFF. &LR;  Value-season tours of the Algarve,
Portugal's Southern coast region, and Spain's Costa del Sol include
a 50 percent reduction of a travel companion's land costs through
March 11 when transatlantic air is booked through Petrabax. The
Spain Fiesta tour begins in Madrid, then heads to Cordoba, Seville
and the Costa del Sol. The discounted price of the six-night tour
is $899, including air from New York. Additional weeks start at
$225 per person/double.
</P>
<P>
   The Colors of Portugal tour includes three nights in Lisbon,
three nights in the Algarve and excursions to Sintra, Fatima,
Nazarre, Obidos and Evora. The price (including air from New York)

DNC CRITICIZED FOR DELAY IN CONVENTION-SITE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A member of the Democratic National Committee this week rapped
the party for again delaying its decision _ this time, until the
end of February _ on where to hold next year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Wyman, a member of the site advisory committee who ran
the 1984 national convention in San Francisco, said postponing the
selection, originally expected in the fall, imperils the host
city's ability to raise money and adequately plan for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, Boston, and Denver are the finalists in the fierce
competition for the lucrative convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going on; we've never made a decision so
late,'' said Wyman, who said at Saturday's DNC meeting in
Washington that hotels holding blocks of rooms need to know whether
to reserve the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, site committee chairman, told Wyman the panel is
still reviewing the three cities' bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much study do you need?'' Wyman said. ``All three cities
put in ample bids, but you can find a problem with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wyche, spokesman for the DNC, said the decision is expected
in late February at the earliest. ``We are trying to do things as
expeditiously as possible, but it's much more important to do it
right rather than quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche said all three cities have made ``adjustments'' to their
bids in the wake of follow-up visits last month by a small panel of
the site committee.
</P>
<P>
   Boston added a souped-up Internet proposal and plans for a
shuttle service for delegates, while Denver added more hotel rooms
and beefed up security.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also made changes in its bid, Wyche said, after a
widely reported stumble during the DNC panel's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are starting to get down to the final stages,''
Wyche said.

GOOD ETHICS AND CORPORATE DEMANDS AREN'T INCOMPATIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people want to make good business decisions. But what if
what's good for the bottom line isn't necessarily good for
employees? Or what's good for management isn't good for the
community?
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be good in business?
</P>
<P>
   This is where having a code of ethics comes in handy. Most
companies and professions have an ethics code, but often codes
don't help with such dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a code of ethics may contain hidden conflicts of
interest that make it hard for people to figure out how to make the
right decision, said the Rev. Robert Spitzer, president of Gonzaga
University in Spokane and a former professor with the Institute of
Professional Ethics at Seattle University.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the codes themselves often state conflicting
values. Consulting engineers, for example, have a duty to act in
the best interests of a client, and at the same time look out for
the public's safety and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Under some circumstances, those values can come into conflict. A
consulting engineer, for example, might have to wrestle between
saving a client money on a large construction project and potential
long-term environmental consequences for the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at professional responsibility and business
responsibility, there is a tension involved,'' Spitzer said at a
recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a way to close the gap between professional ethics
and corporate demands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to define the purpose of a business.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of most business undertakings is defined as
``maximizing shareholder wealth,'' he said. But ``shareholder''
isn't well defined. Most people equate shareholders with
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   In a looser sense, a shareholder is anyone who has a stake in a
company. Defined this way, ``stakeholders'' include employees,
customers, community members, company owners, suppliers, and even
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that weigh the needs of all these stakeholders when
making business decisions invariably make better choices, he said.
And taking a long-term rather than short-term view of wealth also
contributes to making better overall decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The second step in closing the gap between professional ethics
and business demands is to build a community of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a community of trust is good for business,'' he said.
``It will manifest itself in maximizing shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because a company that has a culture of trust among its
employees and other stakeholders will be able to adapt quickly to
changing market conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A culture that can change easily, creatively, and take
reasonable risks is a culture that can maximize shareholder
wealth,'' he said. ``Trust is the antidote to the culture of
anti-change.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust facilitates teamwork and motivates quality improvement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But to build trust, a company must first rid itself of what he
called the ``five debilitators.''
</P>
<P>
   Debilitators in the workplace include fear, anger, suspicion,
compulsive ego and passive aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more money lost to passive aggression in business than
almost anything else,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Passive aggression is unstated anger, he said. It's when the
person who's angry smiles and says, ``I can't help you.''
</P>
<P>
   All the workshops on conflict resolution or team building in the
world won't help if a company doesn't have a climate of trust, he
said. ``When trust is present, professional responsibility and
business responsibility come into unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Building trust requires honesty and communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your people will help you in the hard times if there's
trust,'' he said. ``They'll resent you in the hard times if there's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to build trust is to define ``shareholder'' and
``wealth'' in the widest possible terms, act on your code of
ethics, and develop a set of internal principles _ those lines you
will not cross.
</P>
<P>
   To build trust, ask this basic question at every turn: ``Is this
action going to increase trust on the part of the stakeholders, or
will it decrease trust?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the moral high road is good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask how can we go the extra mile for customers, the community,
our employees,'' he said. ``Think big and you'll wind up building a
community of trust.''

A PLEASANT TRIP TO PREDICTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SHE'S ALL THAT 
Directed by: Robert Iscove 
Screenplay by: R. Lee Fleming, Jr. 
Starring: Freddie Prinze, Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew Lillard,
Paul Walker, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, Kevin Pollak, Keiran Culkin, Elden
Henson, Usher Raymond, Kimberly ``Li'l Kim'' Jones, Debbi Morgan,
Tim Matheson, Anna Paquin, Gabrielle Union, Dule Hill 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content, crude humor, brief strong language
and teen drinking) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' bops the teensploitation movie index up a few
notches, thanks to the ability of a simpatico cast to generate more
urgency than the film's formulaic plot. Basically, it's a high
school Pygmalion caper, with Rachael Leigh Cook's inaccessibly
serious art student induced to lighten up long enough to transform
herself into a sleek, soulful beauty when she's suddenly pursued by
Freddie Prinze Jr.'s campus hotshot. What she doesn't know is that
he's just been ditched by his about-to-be prom queen girlfriend and
has bet a rival that he can turn even the most unpromising
candidate into prom queen material, namely her.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he's a babe magnet, Prinze's Zack is sensitive.
Sensitive enough to fall for Cook's zero named Laney. With a small
downward curl at the ends of his lips, he adds a layer of irony to
a character who could have spent most of the movie standing around
with his face hanging out. You don't need a laser torch to see
where this exercise is going, but it's entertaining to watch it go
there, and it does have a few surprises. Cook's Laney, for instance
is genuinely standoffish, having retreated into a shell of angry
art since her mom died of cancer. She's not desperate. But even her
father, played in an appealingly low-key manner by Kevin Pollak,
wants her to ease up a bit. Her brother, played by Kieran Culkin,
spends more time being loyal than indulging in sitcom brattiness.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the film isn't afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve
and bring conviction to its focus on feelings. It's written with
enough dexterity and wit to make you buy into it. Although Zack is
the A student with a drawerful of college acceptances, Laney is the
smart one, zinging him at will.
</P>
<P>
   It's a breakthrough film for Cook. It's also a comedy
breakthrough for ``Scream'' guy Matthew Lillard. As the
self-infatuated minor celeb for whom Zack gets dumped, he's loud
and vapid and his uncool dance moves are a stitch. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe
is another comic plus as the fickle prom queen. Anna Paquin
delivers a smartly rounded characterization as Zack's kid sister,
continuing to demonstrate, like Christina Ricci, that there's life
beyond child acting. ``She's All That'' brightly surpasses
expectations.

historical lineage of her own: the citizen denouncer. From the

week, they debated Beauvoir with a mixture of joy and reverence,
and at the end, their unsurprising conclusion was that ``The Second
Sex'' was as topical and worthy of study as ever. A perhaps more

HOW THE WEST WAS WON BY WOODY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HI-LO COUNTRY 
Directed by: Stephen Frears 
Screenplay by: Waylon Jennings (novel: Max Evans) 
Starring: Woody Harrelson, Patricia Arquette, Billy Crudup, Cole
Hauser, Penelope Cruz, James Gammon, Katy Jurado, Sam Elliott, Lane
Smith 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality, a scene of violence, and for brief
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Frears's postwar Western, ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' is
worth seeing for its central performance by Woody Harrelson as a
rip-roaring, large-hearted ultimate cowboy named, unfortunately,
Big Boy. Harrelson is enormously engaging and generous-spirited as
the last-of-a-dying-breed kind of cowboy who finds that there isn't
enough range for him to ride freely when he returns from World War
II. Small ranches like his are being gobbled up by rich cattle
barons, such as, in this case, Sam Elliott's. The trouble with
``The Hi-Lo Country,'' an unrealized project close to the heart of
the late Sam Peckinpah, is that Big Boy is not only bigger than the
small-souled groundlings around him, but that he's so much bigger
than the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Like many an outsider, the Englishman Frears is fascinated by
the detail of the American world he's photographing. He vividly
evokes a sense of time and place (New Mexico). But he's hard put to
fill in the gaps left by the perfunctoriness of the characters
surrounding Big Boy in this screenplay by ``Wild Bunch''
co-scriptwriter Walon Green. The film is narrated by Big Boy's
buddy, Pete, played by Billy Crudup. As he proved in ``Without
Limits'' and ``Monument Ave.,'' Crudup is an impressively versatile
young actor. But his character here is doomed to a fate as a
faceless whine as the guy who lusts after, but doesn't get, the
married woman with whom Big Boy embarks on a lusty affair. There's
only so much that even a talented actor can do with frustration and
self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   As Mona, the woman in question, Patricia Arquette is iconic,
with lipstick and hairdo convincing enough to place her securely at
the heart of any passing noir. But there's more heat in their sex
scenes than in the screenplay that scants the task of fleshing her
out. What's real enough is a sense of gathering ominousness and a
growing perception that a world that looks boundless is in fact too
confining to Big Boy. The men in his family have a history of being
involved in gunplay, and it's pretty obvious that Big Boy is not
going to be one to break with tradition, especially when honor
demands that he face down the big bad rancher's hired hands in the
local cantina.
</P>
<P>
   These include Lane Smith's potent turn as the big shot's
accountant, quick to borrow power by association, and Cole Hauser,
as Big Boy's kid brother, working for the bad guys and bearing the
fratricide-inspiring nickname Little Boy. One could argue that
``The Hi-Lo Country'' is as much noir as romantic Western
melodrama, given its bleak sense of possibility draining away from
the world of its protagonist. Harrelson's Big Boy is its chief
source of warmth, thanks to his ability to convince us that Big Boy
loves Mona as much as he loves his ranch and his cowboy code. The
others range from lukewarm to adequate (more in the easy rightness
of James Gammon's old rancher, effortlessly convincing us he's on
Big Boy's wavelength). But Harrelson's Big Boy is the only one who
fills his boots in anything like the mythic fashion demanded by the
film's perspective.

LAMOTT'S `MERCIES': ARTICLES OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TRAVELING MERCIES 
Some Thoughts on Faith 
By Anne Lamott 
Pantheon, 275 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Lamott is in bad shape. She's just gotten drunk after
having an abortion, and starts to hemorrhage. Too ashamed to call
for help, she lies in her room in a despondent stupor. Soon, she
senses a presence, squatting in the corner. It regards her with a
patience and love that comfort her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew as sure as I knew my own name that it was Jesus,'' she
says in her new collection of short pieces, ``Traveling Mercies.''
.
</P>
<P>
   It takes someone as formerly wild as California writer Lamott to
come out and say she saw Jesus sitting in her room to keep some
readers from tossing the book aside as so much born-again pap. So
often writing about faith seems so treacly, formulaic, and preachy
that if you're not already one of the converted of that particular
faith, it's hard to cotton to.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the writing by people who don't have an agenda (or big
hair), but merely want to pass along some of the lessons they've
extracted through hard times? Where's the cool stuff?
</P>
<P>
   It's out there. Lamott's book is one example. As she tells her
story, she's doing drugs and sleeping with married men. But she
finds herself drawn to a church across from a flea market she goes
to on Sunday mornings. It takes a while to go from listening
outside the church to the powerful singing to actually planting her
skittish self in the pews. But the warm hearts of the mostly black
women draw her in, and when she gets pregnant again, they convince
her she will be supplied with all she needs to care for the child.
So she has her son, Sam; gets sober; writes; and expresses profound
_ and sometimes hilarious _ gratitude for walking with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling Mercies'' is a collection of small pieces that shows
how a life involved even the tiniest bit with prayer can open up or
shift into place. The events can be as minor as Lamott's realizing
that the Republican soccer mom in spandex is not out to put her
down. Or as triumphant as facing down the bulimia bully that ruled
her.
</P>
<P>
   As the child of atheists in Marin, Calif., she caught glimpses
of faith through her friends' families. A warm Christian Science
mom would soothe her sleepless guest by saying, ``Let's find a
green pasture within us, Annie.'' She also has passing flings with
Catholicism and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I know who have what I want _ which is to
say, purpose, heart, balance, gratitude, joy _ are people with a
deep sense of spirituality,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She learns a lot about generosity from the church women on
Social Security who slip her 20-dollar bills to help with Sam; and
about courage from several friends with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lamott starts trying to be less judgmental, trust more in good,
and remember to be grateful. As it is in her previous books,
``Operating Instructions'' and ``Bird by Bird,'' her distinctive
style of owning up to her own shortcomings while taking a gleeful
pleasure in them is present here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought such awful thoughts that I can't even say them out
loud because they would make Jesus want to drink gin straight out
of the cat dish,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The book is studded with these little jabs of irreverence as
well as glimmers of self-awareness and wisdom. She asks big
questions, too. ``I couldn't understand why as usual God couldn't
give me a loud or obvious answer, through a megaphone or thunder,
skywriting or stigmata. Why does God always use dreams, intuition,
memory, phone calls, vague stirrings in my heart?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very dramatic happens in this book, just the steady
accrual of moments of grace, the opening of a clenched heart, the
stilling of a tongue. Anne Lamott doesn't become another person,
just a better one.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in its own way, is plenty.
</P>

COLLECTIVE SOUL'S EXPERIMENTS SPAWN HITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, if a band releases a fourth album, that's saying
something. Most bands are long gone by then, victimized by fickle
public tastes, radio format changes, or record label mergers or
other corporate capers that make it hard to establish any
continuity. But here comes Collective Soul with its fourth album _
and how sweet it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know many rock bands that have had four releases in
the '90s _ and ours have all been with the same lineup,'' says
Collective Soul singer-composer Ed Roland. ``We're proud of that.
All we ever wanted was to work hard on each one and see some
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   That growth is evident on the new ``Dosage,'' named for the
dictionary definition of ``the act of giving,'' not for an LSD hit,
says Roland. The album comes out Feb. 9 but is already spawning two
hits in the prettily melodic ``Run'' (also on the ``Varsity Blues''
soundtrack) and the revved-up, Aerosmith-boogie-influenced
``Heavy,'' recently the most-added song on modern rock radio.
That's a pleasant surprise, since Collective Soul is often cited
for its retro-tinged sound. Heck, these days, it's just nice to
hear a band that rocks, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy if anybody plays us. We're not choosy at all,''
says Roland, whose past hits have included ``Shine'' and
``December.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't label ourselves modern rock or whatever,'' he adds.
``Once you start labeling yourself, it's hard to get out of that.
We just call ourselves a rock 'n' roll band _ and that gives us the
parameters to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is basically what the band does on the new album, its best
yet. There's still a guitar-driven rock edge but also more
experimentation in the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had the luxury of time to make this record, which
was different from the past when we had to rush things,'' Roland
says of his Georgia-based band, which expects to tour the Northeast
this summer. ``This time, we experimented with drum loops and
different sounds, and we plugged keyboards in. Plus, a lot of songs
were done in the studio, where I'd write to a keyboard or a loop,
whereas before, the songs were written on the road with guitars.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland's famed archival touch is most evident on the newly
emerging hit, ``Run,'' which he wrote as a tribute to artists who
have inspired him. ``I was thinking of Elton John, the Beatles, and
Jeff Lynne,'' he says. ``I took elements of their productions, like
when Elton jumps up an octave to a falsetto range in `Yellow Brick
Road.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The sound was further honed by well-respected mixer Tom
Lord-Alge, who worked with Collective Soul for the first time. ``He
definitely played a big part,'' says Roland. ``He brought up the
low end and created a more rounded tonality.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son of a minister, Roland also informs some of the songs
(as he did on ``Shine'') with subtle spiritual messages. ``I don't
try to force them on there, but with my background, I can't deny
how I was raised.''
</P>

   A Charles Brown experience: R&AMP;B/jazz pioneer Charles Brown died
Jan. 20 of congestive heart failure, just two months shy of his
induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The 76-year-old
pianist was a contemporary of Nat King Cole in Los Angeles during
the '40s, and influenced Ray Charles (who opened for him), Fats
Domino, and Little Richard. Brown, who enjoyed a comeback after
opening Bonnie Raitt's tour in 1990, was a charming man, whom I met
once in Manhattan. Brown was a master of quips. ``I survived a lot
of the people who cheated me; where are they now? They're in the
graveyard,'' he said with a smile. He really appreciated the
newfound attention paid to him. ``You don't know what tomorrow will
bring, but you'd like to get a few flowers while you're here,'' he
said.

AN IGLESIAS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you're the son of Latin star Julio Iglesias, it's only
natural that you might take advantage of the industry doors that
open to you. After all, celebrity sons and daughters are a growing
fact of life in the music business _ witness Jakob Dylan, Sean
Lennon, Monica Mancini, Ziggy Marley, Rufus Wainwright, and many
others.
</P>
<P>
   But Enrique Iglesias _ the young Latin superstar and heartthrob
_ first applied to record companies under an anonymous name. He
refused to use his dad's clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's true,'' says the 24-year-old Iglesias, who has
since sold 12 million albums. ``I got rejected by three record
companies and then this record company that I didn't know (Los
Angeles-based Fonovisa Records) got back to me. They said, `We like
your music. We'd like to meet you.' Once I got signed, they knew
who I was. But when we first talked about the deal, they didn't
know my real name.''
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, he didn't tell his father until four months
later, typical of his desire to do things on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a singer and I started writing songs
when I was 14,'' says Iglesias, who performs his first area concert
at Lowell Memorial Auditorium on Feb. 18. ``But I never really told
anyone. It was my own little secret, my own little getaway.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not true that he and dad Julio have had a scarred
relationship, as some media have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get along perfectly with my father and with all my family. I
just don't see them a lot,'' says Iglesias during a recent phone
interview from Miami, where he grew up. ``I'm always working and
he's always working. To tell you the truth, I separate myself as
much as possible in my career, so that's where all this (talk of
conflict) comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   He also takes issue with a published report that quoted him last
year as saying he doesn't speak to his father because he sells more
records than his famous dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said that! I don't know where they got that from. It
would be stupid of me to say that. I never said that at all,'' says
Iglesias, whose three albums have all gone to No. 1 on the Latin
charts.
</P>
<P>
   As for a snapshot biography: He is the youngest of three
children born to Julio and Madrid-based socialite Isabel Preysler.
He grew up in Miami, where he learned to speak English (though his
albums have been in Spanish) and where he developed a love of
Western pop idols, as opposed to those from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have any Latin idols,'' he says. ``My idols
were Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and Bryan Ferry and Mark
Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and Peter Gabriel and Sting. Steve Perry
(of Journey) is amazing. I heard them all in Miami growing up.
Bryan Adams is another one. His `Reckless' is probably one of my
Top 10 favorite albums.''
</P>
<P>
   The first album that Iglesias ever bought was Dire Straits's
``Brothers in Arms,'' back when he was 12 years old. ``That's
probably my favorite album of all time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When you listen to Iglesias's gushingly romantic, but also
exceptionally intimate, music, it's clear that these Western
influences are central to his writing, which has a polished pop
sheen. ``I hear a lot of influences from these guys, even though my
music is in Spanish,'' says Iglesias, who has also used backup
musicians that have toured with Joel (singer Crystal Taliefero and
guitarist Tommy Burns), John Mellencamp, Cyndi Lauper, Meat Loaf,
and Joe Cocker.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Enrique's hits in the past few years were penned during
his formative teenage period. These include ``Si Tu Te Vas'' (``If
You Leave''), written at age 16; and ``Enamorado Por Primera Vez''
(``In Love for the First Time''), done at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   How has his writing changed? ``I don't want to say it's more
mature, but your vocabulary changes,'' says Iglesias. ``You don't
speak the same way when you're 15 that you do when you're 23 or
24.''
</P>
<P>
   His life has certainly changed _ an example being the mania with
which young women now approach him. ``That's great. That's the good
part of the job,'' he says with a chuckle. ``I used to get rejected
every time in college. Now I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has remained down to earth despite his success _ a sign
being his typical stage wardrobe of bluejeans and T-shirts.
``That's the way I've always dressed,'' says Iglesias. ``I don't
like to dress up to go on stage. I don't like to go out of the
ordinary. That's just the way I feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he feels comfortable on stage, because he doesn't
have much time to feel comfortable off of it. A quick Q-and-A
discussion:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you work all of the time?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Yeah, I love work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Q. What about making time for your hobby of windsurfing? A.
``I don't anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you do to relax?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like his dad, Iglesias plans to make an English-speaking album
as a way to notch greater acceptance in the States. ``I don't want
to set a date, but it will be after the year 2000,'' he says.
Knowing that his dad's first American hit was a duet (with Willie
Nelson), Iglesias would like to do duets as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see who wants to do a duet with me,'' he says. ``I
haven't explored it yet, but if you find anyone, tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's just trying to keep pace with the Latin market.
Asked if that market is as fickle as the American pop market, he
sounds older than his years when he says: ``All the markets are
same. You can be up one year, then down the next. I don't think the
language makes a difference. The only thing I know is that you have
to keep it up. It's the same for English as for Spanish or Chinese,
because people change their tastes. It's hard. It's a lot of
pressure. You've got to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the Spanish market is growing huge. It's getting
bigger and bigger, especially in the US,'' he concludes. ``There
are 30 million Spanish-speaking people and that's only the legal
ones. There are another 10 million illegals. By the year 2002, it's
going to be the biggest minority. So what else can you ask for?
Then you have all of South America. After English, Spanish is
definitely the biggest market.''

BC'S SKINNER FINDS THE BRIGHT SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are 4-14 overall, 1-9 in the Big East, destined for nothing
but a quick end to their season come early March.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Boston University and the University of
Massachusetts, which are still flirting with .500 and thinking
about postseason play, and you would think Boston College coach Al
Skinner is having a tough winter.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Skinner is having more fun and getting more
satisfaction than either BU coach Dennis Wolff or UMass coach
Bruiser Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because he sees progress. He sees kids busting their tails,
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's 78-67 win over Notre Dame _ the Eagles' first
this calendar year and first in the Big East _ was a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are too young and inexperienced to have an attitude.
When Skinner talks, they listen and learn.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass, where Flint has seen his team take dip after dip in a
season that has had only a few smooth trips, the expectations of an
Atlantic 10 championship and an NCAA tournament bid are fading
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At BU, Wolff has dealt with four returning starters from last
year's America East co-champions, who have gotten too full of
themselves, thinking they are above such petty details as showing
up on time for game-day shootarounds or listening to the wisdom the
coach and his staff try to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this team,'' said Skinner the other night. ``I enjoy
being around them. I can't say it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner says he tried everything he could think of to keep
spirits up as the Eagles made the halfway turn in the Big East
season without a win.
</P>
<P>
   He has given pep talks. He has brought in a psychologist. He
even got sophomore Jonathan Beerbohm into meditation before the
Notre Dame game. It worked when Beerbohm responded with 11 points
and five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a resiliency about this team,'' said Skinner, shaking
his head in admiration. ``Seeing how they came back, time after
time, there's satisfaction in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner says his team learned an important lesson a couple of
weeks ago when No. 1 Connecticut came to Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Most people expected the blowout of blowouts. ``For the first
five minutes, it looked like that,'' said Skinner. ``We were down,
16-2. But you know what? After that, we stayed right with them (in
a 91-78 loss). I told them, `If you can do that against the No. 1
team in the country, you can do it against anyone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Notre Dame by no means signifies a magic turnaround. The
Eagles will be hard pressed to win more than a few of their
remaining games. But make no mistake. They will compete.
</P>
<P>
   Can the same be said about BU? The Terriers had every reason to
believe they would compete for the America East title again this
season. They lost only Joey Beard from their nucleus of the last
few years, and they had veterans such as Walter Brown and LeVar
Folk returning, which seemed reasonable cause for optimism over on
Commonwealth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Folk and Brown have been two of the primary problems, not
the solution, much to the dismay of Wolff, who has had to put out
more brushfires this season than at any other time during his BU
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that this far into their careers, the two
Terriers would get it. They would understand it is important to
show up on time for practice, take some responsibility instead of
ducking it.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff has sacrificed games _ last week's home loss to Vermont
comes to mind _ in order to establish some discipline and order. He
has paid for it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now instead of a run at the crown, the Terriers will have to
struggle for an above-.500 record and a decent seed in the
conference tournament. Thankfully for the Terriers, the league
seems devoid of a super team this year, and anyone could wind up in
the league championship game, presumably against Delaware, which
again will benefit from having all the preliminary games on its
home court and could gain the home edge in the final by winning the
league regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff has had better teams. He's had better players. If he can
turn this team around in time for the America East tournament, he
merits Coach of the Year consideration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black mark for UCLA
</P>
<P>
   We saw it once and we didn't believe it. Had to be something
wrong with the screen. We saw it again a few weeks ago. Same
problem. UCLA in black? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Call us old-fashioned. Call us out of touch. But any school that
has the history and tradition of UCLA should be wearing the
standard school colors _ blue and gold, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Lavin is a Gen X coach. Lavin has done all the right
things with discipline and keeping the Bruins as classy as they can
be. But this fashion foray into black _ the Bruins have done it
only a few times on the road _ is something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what kind of response we would get from the
fans and the alumni,'' Lavin told the Los Angeles Times. ``But I
was hoping that once people realized the context, they would have
fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said he did it because his kids wanted it. The players
call it a '90s look.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. Lavin says the Bruins will wear their traditional
colors at home and all but a few road games; for instance, they'll
probably sport the new look at Stanford in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So the Men of Westwood are now men in black.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willard to Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   With the problems Pittsburgh is having, you have to wonder if
this is Ralph Willard's last go-round with the Panthers. Willard
could have had a job with the Celtics and Rick Pitino last year but
chose to stick it out for another season. Now he might take
Pitino's offer, which is reportedly still on the table . . .
Wisconsin may turn out to be the real sleeper in the Big Ten.
Opponents have a tough time figuring out how to play the Badgers,
who are off to their best league start since 1961 . . . Two reasons
for Xavier's resurgence in the Atlantic 10 are James Posey and
Lenny Brown. Posey had a stat liine to die for in the Musketeers'
win over Virginia Tech last week: 22 points (8-for-12 shooting, 4
for 7 from 3-point land), 13 rebounds, 9 assists, 7 steals. Brown
has averaged more than 21 points in Xavier's last eight games . . .
Temple sophomore Quincy Wadley has taken school spirit to a new
level. He has an Owl tattooed on his right biceps. Then there is
team manager John Deegan, who has seven tattoos on his body . . .
What's with South Carolina? The Gamecocks were a potential Final
Four team a few years ago. Last week they got beaten by Syracuse,
84-37, the fewest points allowed by a Jim Boeheim team in 23
seasons . . . One of the encourgaging aspects of Villanova's
success in the Big East is the balance. The Wildcats had a
four-game winning streak during which no player scored more than 20
points. Go figure. They played Providence Tuesday night, John
Celestand scored 24, and they lost . . . When Arkansas blew out
Providence last week, 118-79, it was not only an embarrassing loss
for the Friars, it marked the most points a PC team has allowed . .
. Here's how bad Rutgers was before Kevin Bannon revived the
program. With a 5-4 Big East record, the Scarlet Knights had a
winning record at the halfway point of the league season for the
first time . . . Look for the Scarlet Knights to play in the Jimmy
V Classic next season. It would be only fitting, since Jim Valvano
was a Rutgers graduate and the Scarlet Knights have yet to make an
appearance in the game . . . The NCAA recently took a survey of
college coaches who listed their concerns. The three biggest:
Nonscholastic coaches, graduation rates, and agents . . . St.
John's will return to the Holiday Festival next season, which
should liven up Madison Square Garden during the holidays . . . If
Notre Dame joins the Big Ten, don't expect any tears from Big East
basketball types. The Fighting Irish have been a disappointment in
league play and will not be missed . . . With a 16-game league
schedule in place for next season instead of 18 games, the Big East
could return to a two-division format without Notre Dame. Each team
then could play two games against everyone in its division and one
game against the six teams in the other division.

CHRONOPOULOS AN OLD RELIABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution suffered a crisis in
leadership last year on the way to the worst of their three seasons
of existence. Coach Thomas Rongen's management style of appointing
team leaders failed, either because the wrong leaders were
designated or they were not sufficiently motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team leaders seem to be evolving more organically.
Walter Zenga, who will coach and play goal, has brought a fresh
approach, and several veteran newcomers are injecting new attitudes
into the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Chronopoulos, the Revolution leader in games played, is
optimistic about the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter sets the tone,'' Chronopoulos said Thursday. ``He is a
great guy off the field but he is all business on the field. He's
been there, playing in the World Cup for Italy, and you can't get
any bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him joke around once on the field. He told us
that we should give 110 percent on the field and we can joke around
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Revolution never seemed to galvanize enough to enjoy
life away from soccer. The team suffered on the field, losing nine
successive games plus an exhibition to Benfica, and struggled to
keep the situation in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we didn't have any chemistry off the field, and that
translated onto the field,'' Chronopoulos said. ``A lot of players
were blamed for what happened and a lot of pressure was put on four
or five guys, and it was too much for them to handle. I put myself
among the leaders, and I didn't perform up to the way I want to
perform. We lost 10 games in a row and we started pointing fingers.
That was when it was up to everyone _ the coach and the leaders _
to step up and take control.''
</P>
<P>
   The team dynamic is forming in preseason workouts this week,
though several key players are missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are high with a new coach and some new players,''
Chronopoulos said. ``Already, this seems like a tight-knit family.
It's hard to explain why. We all come from soccer backgrounds, and
when you have a passion for the sport, you are going to be a lot
more tight-knit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have good chemistry off the field or you are not
going to have it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos, Paulo Dos Santos, and Paul Keegan are the only
current Revolution players who were with the team during its first
preseason training in 1996. Chronopoulos has 84 appearances with
the Revolution, the most by an area professional since Chris Turner
played 85 games for the New England Tea Men from 1978-80 but far
off the New England record of 349 games by Bill McPherson in the
American Soccer League of the 1920s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos, 26, is reaching a critical stage in his career. He
played for the United States in a 2-1 victory over Israel June 1,
1997, and seemed destined to be among the candidates for the 1998
World Cup team. He dropped out of national team consideration and
missed nine Major League Soccer games with knee injuries, then
spent the offseason settling a transfer deal from Panionios, his
former club in Greece, and recuperating with his family in Loma
Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If Zenga's defense-first style succeeds, Chronopoulos will be
among the keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is more difficult to learn,'' Chronopoulos said. ``On
offense, if you are talented, no one can teach that. But
defensively, you have to be able to work offside traps, and last
year we weren't in synch enough to be able to do it. We have a lot
of players coming in and out this year, but Walter knows the game,
and hopefully, he has brought in the right combinations. Dan
Calichman is a good leader, and some of the new players are
talented. I think we'll be better this year.''

KRAFT STICKS WITH THE BRAINTRUST HE HAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It's a huge offseason for Bobby Grier, Pete
Carroll, Bob Kraft, and everyone else associated with the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   After an injury-filled season that didn't meet anyone's
expectations, Kraft recently decided to keep his entire management
team in place with the proviso that they do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft wants Carroll to be himself and take control of the team.
He wants Grier to be more out front as the organizational leader.
And he wants to be less conspicuous to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby and Pete are running the football team on the field,''
said Kraft. ``Whatever they feel is necessary to get us back to a
Super Bowl, I'm behind them 100 percent. I'll do anything I can to
support their efforts to improve our football team and our
organization. They're working very hard already.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Carroll would have support if he attempts to get
tougher with players, the owner said, ``If Pete feels he needs to
do that, I'll support that and help him as best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said this was not a departure from the policy so far
during the Grier-Carroll regime, but the owner feels public
perception has changed since rumors surfaced that the coach would
be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's job was never in jeopardy,'' said Kraft. ``It's our
policy not to issue votes of confidence, because we never believed
there was a reason to do it. Pete had to overcome many obstacles
with all of the injuries he faced, and next year, hopefully, we
won't have the same problems with key players being injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, vice president of player personnel Grier expressed
dissatisfaction with the job he did as well as the performances of
the coaching staff and players. He said everyone must be
accountable for the performance of the team, which finished 9-7 and
lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is now focusing on the free agent period, which begins
Feb. 12. The Patriots are prioritizing their own free agents and
also looking down the free agent lists to see who might best fill
the needs.
</P>
<P>
   Grier was again frank about what he has done and what he is
trying to do. Some observations:
</P>
<P>
   --While many Patriots fans would purchase a one-way ticket to
Siberia for Chris Canty, Grier, who has taken much heat for
selecting the cornerback in the first round of the draft two years
ago, said he's not giving up on him just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have given up on Jimmy Hitchcock too fast, and I don't
want to do that all over again with Chris,'' said Grier. ``As we
watched him perform again on film, we found that he actually played
pretty well. We were 4-2 in the games he started, and really, it
was after his off-field incident (when he was stopped by police
with an open beer can in his parked car) that his play began to
decline. He's a little more rough around the edges than what we'd
like, but we have to take into consideration that he and (offensive
lineman) Ed Ellis are the two youngest players on the team and he
needs time to mature.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots would likely entertain a trade offer for
Canty, he wasn't on the list of players exposed to the expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   --Grier plans to speak to veteran left tackle Bruce Armstrong
soon about some issues, but said he wanted to speak to the six-time
All-Pro before saying too much in public. There has been
speculation that Armstrong has slowed down and may need to move to
the right side to prolong his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bruce is still quick enough with his feet where he's
still an outstanding pass-blocker,'' said Grier. ``I think he's
gone down a little bit at this stage in his career in his ability
to run-block.''
</P>
<P>
   --The staff has discussed a course of action if the Patriots
lose Todd Rucci to the Cleveland Browns in the expansion draft Feb.
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches and I agree that we'd like to be able to sign the
equivalent of Henry Thomas on the offensive line,'' said Grier.
``We'd like to find a veteran guy who can give us what Henry gives
us on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriots won't pay big money for one of the big-name free
agent receivers _ Antonio Freeman, J.J. Stokes, Carl Pickens, etc.
Grier said that while he feels the Patriots need help at receiver,
``I think we can find a good young receiver in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that Terry Glenn is still their game-breaker.
They have veterans in Troy Brown and Shawn Jefferson, which means
you can forget any sentimental notion about Irving Fryar returning.
Grier feels he has enough veterans at receiver, plus Tony Simmons,
and that if he adds another youngster, he'll have a good mix.
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriots have big plans for defensive lineman Brandon
Mitchell, their second-round pick two years ago. If Ferric Collons
is taken in the expansion draft, there's a good chance Mitchell
would play end. If Collons stays, Mitchell will have a significant
role either inside or outside.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Grier doesn't believe the Patriots will spend
big money on a defensive lineman, feeling last year's free agents
were busts. The Patriots will put a high priority on re-signing
unrestricted free agent Thomas and hope Chad Eaton continues to
progress.
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriots' top in-house priority is signing center Dave
Wohlabaugh, the unrestricted free agent who had probably the best
season of any offensive lineman on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that we have to have an anchor to the offensive line,
and Dave is it,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   --Grier thought Carroll did a good job rounding out his coaching
staff with the selection of Ivan Fears (receivers) and Brad Seeley
(special teams).
</P>
<P>
   Grier is a big fan of Fears, whose role is likely to encompass
not only receivers but the implementation of the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan has tremendous ideas about the running game,'' said
Grier. ``He brings different schemes on running the ball to the
table. I know he was very instrumental in developing the Bears'
running game when he was there.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... altered it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unraveling the painting's provenance from the Jesuit end was
both simple and frustrating. The woman who gave it to the priests
in the 1930s was Dr. Mary Lea-Wilson, a Dublin physician. Her
husband, an Englishman working for the Irish police, had allegedly
mistreated Irish prisoners and had himself been murdered.
Lea-Wilson sought spiritual counsel from a Jesuit; the painting was
a gift of thanks. She died in 1971; how she had acquired the
painting is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti filled the gap in the provenance with convincing _ if
circumstantial _ evidence. The painting had arrived in Leeson
Street in a frame identical to the ones around the paintings the
Nisbets had left to the National Gallery of Scotland. And the brass
plate on the frame misspelled Honthorst's name in precisely the
same way the Mattei archives had. The apotheosis of the attribution
came when Caravaggio authority Sir Denis Mahon authenticated the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now the picture has come to BC, as the apotheosis of
``Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' which
opens with works designed to demonstrate the power of a painting.
The most blatant illustration of this is Francesco Solimena's ``A
Miracle of St. John of God,'' a depiction of the heavens opening to
reveal the saint, come to save the city of Naples from the plague.
He's there in person _ but he's also carrying a portrait of
himself, which has more power than his actual presence. Naples,
meanwhile, is personified by a reclining female whose garments have
conveniently fallen away to reveal bare and creamy breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of 17th-century Italian Catholics were as crammed with
images of Mary Magdalene and Peter the Apostle as ours are with
rock stars and sports idols. The Magdalene and Peter ``were
portrayed as poor slobs like us, sinners who were redeemed,''
McMullen director Netzer notes. By the era of these paintings,
``Legend had turned Mary Magdalene into a harlot, just for added
effect,'' she adds. ``Nothing in the Bible indicates she actually
was.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly doesn't look it in Caravaggio's ``Conversion of
the Magdalene,'' an intense interchange between two sisters, Martha
and Mary Magdalene. The latter holds an orange blossom, symbol of
purity, over her heart. Mormando likens the contemplative mood to
the equally contemplative abstractions of the contemporary painter
Agnes Martin. Caravaggio himself often seems oddly contemporary,
his human dramas played out against plain backgrounds that suggest
no particular time or place, and which push the characters forward
into the viewer's space. No halos here: These characters are just
like us.
</P>
<P>
   While much Baroque art is restless, noisy, and frenetic, the
most powerful pictures at BC are still. Several deal overtly with
instruction, none more compassionately than the ``St. Matthew and
the Angel'' by the Northern European Caravaggesco Nicolas Regnier.
Leaning as tenderly over the aged evangelist as a mother helping
her child with schoolwork, the angel guides Matthew's hand as he
laboriously pens his gospel. Bolstering the painting's messages
about teaching and caring is its aching beauty _ the beauty of the
ordinary, elevated.
</P>
<P>
   In a red-walled room devoted to depictions of lust and avarice,
nobody's having a good time. People are, however, being forgiven,
most touchingly in Pietro da Cortona's ``Christ and the Woman Taken
in Adultery.'' Cortona could have tarted up the woman; instead, he
made her modest, soft, endearingly wholesome, and pale, as if lit
from within. She is the focus of the picture. Cortona paints her
accusers, the scribes and Pharisees, as crude creeps, and makes
Jesus, who leans forward to speak ernestly to them, into the voice
of reason.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible for a contemporary viewer to look at this
picture without thinking of the Clinton-Lewinsky debacle, and it
even may make some believers wish that Congress would call on
Christ to solve it. ``Jesus was not hung up about sexual sin,''
says Mormando. ``He refocused the problem. It's about hypocrisy and
lack of mercy.'' (A Jesuit of liberal persuasion, Mormando adds
that when lecturing on paintings of this scene, of which there are
many, ``I always say, `Excuse me, but in adultery, it takes two.
Where's the man?' '')
</P>
<P>
   Cortona was a conservative and highly religious man, with a
Jesuit spiritual adviser. Caravaggio was just the opposite, violent
and volatile, a murderer who himself died young, in mysterious
circumstances. Caravaggio's Christ and Cortona's adulteress strike
the same pose of humble resignation, though, both calm and
composed.
</P>
<P>
   There's another apt comparison, in Ludovico Carracci's ``The
Kiss of Judas,'' which Barber calls ``almost a rape rather than a
betrayal.'' A swarthy Judas is about to kiss Christ full on the
lips. A clawlike hand reaches into the painting from the left,
yanking down Christ's robe, exposing a thin, white, feminine
shoulder that Judas's hand hones in on.
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio, notorious for salacious portrayals of young men with
pouting lips and pomaded hairdos, does nothing of the kind in ``The
Taking of Christ.'' It's a solemn and riveting picture, set at
night; standing in the darkened gallery, you feel included in it.
Caravaggio uses his trademark tenebrism, glinting light from an
unknown source, to highlight Christ's ivory skin and contrast it
with eyes sunk in shadow. Mormando thinks the gleam of the
soldier's armor, which crosses the very heart of the picture, may
be meant as a metaphorical mirror held up to the viewer. Barber
compares Judas's bald patch with a monk's tonsure or a bishop's
cap. ``I wouldn't be surprised if Caravaggio was being ironical,''
he says, ``suggesting that the leaders of the Church betrayed
Christ _ even though Caravaggio made out very well from the Church,
in worldly terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The painter here acts as a stage director, reading a script and
figuring out the most dramatic way to pose the actors. He makes the
action push so forcefully from right to left that you half expect
the painting to move along the wall of its own accord. At the far
left, the terrified St. John opens his mouth in a scream and
stretches his arms forward, fingers splayed. Christ and St. John
look almost joined at the head, as if they were two sides of the
same person, mortal and divine _ a reminder that while we are the
former, the latter lives in us as well.

LEVI VACATES BUILDING OVER SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. has confirmed that it
deserted a leased office building at its headquarters complex after
seven employees who worked there were diagnosed with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 employees who worked in the building were moved to
other buildings in the complex a few months after company officials
first found out about the illnesses in January 1997, Clarence
Grebey, a Levi spokesman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired a team of health and environmental specialists
to inspect the building and interview employees, but the
specialists concluded the structure posed no hazards, Grebey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing environmental there that could be associated
with breast cancer risk, based on what we know about breast
cancer,'' said Dr. Patricia Buffler, an epidemiologist and former
dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California
at Berkeley. Buffler was one of the specialists hired by Levi, the
maker of blue jeans and other clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The company vacated the building in October 1997 because the
employees were concerned for their safety, Grebey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an issue like that is raised, we're going to take
action,'' Grebey said.
</P>
<P>
   All seven of the cancer victims held desk jobs and did not work
with hazardous materials or machine tools, Grebey said. He said he
did not know whether the women still worked for Levi or anything
about their current health.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer scare coincided with a staff reduction at the San
Francisco-based company that made space available elsewhere in the
10-building complex, located at the foot of Telegraph Hill. The
company decided not to renew its lease on the vacated building,
Grebey said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the building, Blue Jeans Equities West of San
Francisco, also hired a group of safety specialists. Those
specialists worked independently of the Levi team but came to the
same conclusion, that nothing was wrong, said Larry Kamer, a
spokesman for the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Levi's and the building's owner took this matter very
seriously when they found out about it,'' Kamer said. Levi was the
only tenant in the four-story building, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The building remains empty.

   STEM-CELLS _ WASHINGTON _ A major national debate has begun over
whether the U.S. government should invest research money in human
stem cells, the primordial units of life that ultimately grow into
fetuses and human beings. Because they are ``undifferentiated,''
stem cells can theoretically be used to produce any type of tissue,
and eventually perhaps, any organ in the body. Some researchers
already have begun to talk about a time when people will be able to
``grow'' their own perfectly compatible transplant organs or the
nerve cells that could rescue victims of Parkinson's disease or
Alzheimers. But the research involves using cells grown from
deliberately killed human embryos, and Congress has prohibited
research on embryos. A Senate hearing Tuesday was the opening round
in the debate that pits hope against deeply held moral beliefs.

Professors were being plucked off the streets in kidnappings. At

Department slapped a ban on U.S. travel to Lebanon. That ban was
lifted about a year ago, and now there are nine American students
and four American professors back on campus. Even more than the

offer hope that Beirut is recovering from the nightmare of civil
war. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   Can a bizarre spacecraft that is powered by a rotating rocket
engine and that lands like a helicopter transform space travel? In
March an American company will be a step closer to finding out,
when a prototype of the Roton craft starts putting these concepts
to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the atmospheric test vehicle (ATV), the prototype will
be used to test the craft's unique landing system _ four helicopter
blades, each 7 meters long, intended to slow the Roton's descent.
If the tests are successful, the first Roton could blast into orbit
as early as next year. It should slash the cost of getting
satellites into space, says Gary Hudson of the Rotary Rocket
Company in Redwood City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The secret lies in its outlandish design. Its conical body is
built from lightweight graphite composites instead of aluminum.
Hudson has also eliminated the need for the heavy turbopumps that
feed fuel to conventional rocket engines by making the whole engine
spin. Ninety-six combustion chambers are mounted around the edge of
a disc 7 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning at 720 revolutions per minute, the disc throws fuel and
oxygen outward into the chambers from storage tanks in the craft's
body. And to make the craft truly reusable, the Roton is supposed
to land gently beneath whirling rotor blades _ which is where the
ATV comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year the ATV will make about 10 manned flights at
Mojave in California to test the rotors and landing systems.
Although it lacks the spinning rocket engine needed to get it into
orbit, the ATV will still be able take off under its own power,
thanks to the small rocket thrusters on the tips of its rotors (see
Diagram). In real missions, the thrusters will be used just before
the Roton reaches the ground. The extra lift they generate should
allow the spacecraft to land without being damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming tests, however, the thrusters will also lift the
ATV off the ground. With each rocket producing 350 pounds of
thrust, the rotors will spin fast enough for the Roton to climb off
the launch pad like a helicopter. ``The rockets will provide about
5 to 10 minutes of power,'' says Hudson. ``In fact, it's the
largest tip-powered helicopter ever built.''
</P>
<P>
   After its ability to hover has been tested, the ATV will be
flown to an altitude of about 2000 meters. Then the thrusters will
be switched off, but as the craft descends, the airflow will keep
the rotors spinning, providing enough lift to slow its descent.
Just before it reaches the ground, the pilot will adjust the angle
of the rotor blades to maximize lift and slow the craft's descent
to about 1 meter per second. The tip thrusters will be fired at
this stage too, Hudson says, allowing the Roton to hover for a few
seconds before touching down gently.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the Rotary Rocket Company plans to
build three more Rotons: an unpowered version for training and two
complete craft for orbital missions in 2000. &QL;

RICH SEVERANCE PACKAGES TAP ILL FEELINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rod Kelly did a slow burn when he heard what kind of
severance packages the employees at BP Amoco were getting.
</P>
<P>
   Severed workers there are getting one month of pay per year of
service up to 12 months, individual outplacement counseling and
thousands of dollars in educational assistance to help them start
new lives.
</P>
<P>
   The company was incredibly generous, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was cut from Halliburton Co. in September he received
only one week of severance pay and a phone number to the Texas
Workforce Commission. He worked for the Dallas-based company from
1982 to 1990 and then returned in 1997 as a salesman in the global
business development group.
</P>
<P>
   The company gave only a week's pay for every year of service, up
to a maximum of 12 weeks, he said. Even though he initially thought
his prior years would count toward his service, they didn't, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's probably not the only laid-off worker in Houston feeling
a bit burned. At a time when employers have been handing out
severance packages that give employees a week or two of pay for
every year of service, BP Amoco comes along with a Cadillac of a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, which plans to terminate more than 6,000 employees
worldwide as part of British Petroleum's purchase of Amoco Corp.,
announced Tuesday it would cut 1,520 of its employees in the
Houston area during the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the employees are leaving BP Amoco with a year or more
of pay in their pockets. In addition to the basic severance pay,
the company gave employees with 26 years of service an extra week
and a half of pay up to a maximum of 71.5 weeks. And the terminated
employees were kept on the payroll until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESPONSIBILITY A FACTOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he understands why companies have to downsize _ they
have to make a profit, after all _ but a company needs to be
responsible too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Halliburton did that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton, one of Houston's largest employers, responded in
writing that the company believes it provides competitive and fair
severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the energy industry changes, Halliburton must calibrate its
business to best serve its customers,'' said the statement by
spokesman Dirk Vande Beek.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are intensely competitive with wages and benefits _
they constantly survey each other _ so, will BP Amoco's plush
severance benefit package encourage other companies to up the ante?
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, for example, gives its employees two weeks of severance
pay for every year of service up to a maximum of one year of pay.
The pay, coupled with career counseling and subsidized medical
benefits, was designed to meet the needs of terminated employees,
said spokesman Paul Weeditz. It's also competitive with other
companies' plans.
</P>
<P>
   But will they meet BP Amoco's exit benefits? Well, that's a
merger and Texaco is going through a restructuring that includes
terminating 2,000 employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But here are signs out there that severance pay is indeed
getting sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mobil/Exxon merger, which will eliminate 9,000 jobs, the
company is reportedly planning to give employees a month of pay for
every year of service. Mobil officials said they couldn't discuss
merger-related severance pay until spring.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub at Mobil: Employees severed in the normal
course of business _ as opposed to a merger _ receive only two
weeks of pay per year of service up to a maximum of a year.
Employees are reportedly upset with the two-tiered system,
especially since a layoff related to low oil prices is expected by
many Mobil workers soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil spokesman Russ Roberts said he can't discuss any rumors of
layoffs except to say Mobil is always looking to tighten its belt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WILL BP AMOCO RAISE BAR? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So will Halliburton increase its exit packages if it sees others
doing so?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say since officials there didn't address the
question. But Kelly said Halliburton's exit packages won't be much
different unless it feels some shame.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kelly, he cashed in his 401(k) plan and used his profit
sharing from last year to make ends meet until he finds a new job _
which he promises won't be in the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take much longer, he figured, speaking from his
home in Spring, Texas. But it would have been nice to get a little
more help.

DIRTY DANCING: FALCONS PERFECT THE TOUCHDOWN TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It started with a little Dirty dancing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Atlanta Falcons have a custody battle on their ...
claws?
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson would like the world to know that he
is the father of the Dirty Bird. Tight end O.J. Santiago claims
more than a little responsibility for the Dirty Bird spreading its
wings and taking flight across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Anderson said. ``I'm the originator.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago: ``I've always maintained that it's a collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago is quick to point out that his rendition of the Dirty
Bird _ complete with squawking _ is the one that started the
biggest dance craze since President Clinton took questions in front
of a grand jury. Of course, it all depends on what the meaning of
the word ``is'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is the one who unveiled the Dirty Bird touchdown dance
during a 37-15 victory against St. Louis in Game 8. Alas, an
Atlanta-St. Louis game in November is the National Football
League's answer to the Witness Protection Program. Timing, timing,
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago did the Dirty Bird the next week during a 41-10
thrashing against New England. The NFL had little choice but to
take notice at that point, because the Falcons were 7-2 and heading
for Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of went national with O.J,'' Anderson said. ``But O.J.
was like Jermaine Jackson. I'm like Michael Jackson. O.J. took us
to the point where everyone recognized us, but I took us
platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcon most likely to visit the end zone, Anderson had
the forum to spread the word of the Dirty Bird. It takes talent to
flap bent arms and high-step without looking like a reject from
``The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.'' It must, because some practitioners
make the Dirty Bird look more difficult than achieving world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of combination of Gregory Hines meets Baryshnikov,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen got worked up enough once to attempt the
Dirty Bird during a game. Once was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Dying Bird,'' Andersen said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Falcons, the Dirty Bird isn't compelled to go South
before the winter has even started. There is a Dirty Bird website
(dirtybirdsinc.com, started by offensive linemen Adam Schreiber and
Gene Williams) for ordering for Dirty Bird caps and Dirty Bird
T-shirts. There have been Dirty Bird sightings at the Blue-Gray
college All-Star game, and the Fiesta Bowl and at college
basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Even Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who comes from a primitive era
when players simply handed the ball to an official after a
touchdown, has done the Dirty Bird from time to time. Reeves did
the dance, sort of, after the Falcons' 30-27 upset of Minnesota in
the NFC title game. He did it again in the middle of Atlanta's
Peachtree Street, because he promised his players he would. To
avoid embarrassment or corrupting the youth of America, Reeves did
this dance just after dawn, when the street was empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People break out and do the Dirty Bird in the strangest
places,'' Anderson said. ``Somebody asked me (to do it) in the
bathroom. I'm like, `Whoa, buddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Nellie, is what Keith Jackson might have said if he had
been there for the first documented touchdown dance. University of
Houston receiver Elmo Wright changed the football world forever in
1969 when he did a dance that amounted to jogging in place.
Progress demanded that Houston Oilers receiver Billy ``White
Shoes'' Johnson, who later became a Falcon, would contribute ``The
Funky Chicken'' to NFL culture. Well, Dallas Cowboys receiver Butch
Johnson was almost obligated after that to unveil ``The California
Quake.''
</P>
<P>
   The next major breakthrough in touchdown dancing was team
choreography. Philadelphia Eagles used to gather in the end zone
and pantomime what looked like an illegal game of craps: ``Roll
Six.'' The Washington Redskins convened regularly in the end zone
for ``Fun Bunch'' celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL banned all end zone celebrations except the spike in
1984. That worked about as well as Prohibition. Ickey Woods came
along with the aptly named ``Ickey Shuffle,'' which required a
practitioner to have the coordination to walk or chew gum. Never at
the same time. Now it's not unheard of for players to acknowledge a
touchdown by breaking out in a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Give the Green Bay Packers credit for bringing athleticism to
end zone celebrations with the Lambeau Leap. Packers players would
actually leap into the stands after touchdowns. Thus inspired, the
Packers jumped to the logical conclusion that they were a Super
Bowl-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were favored last January to win a second
consecutive Super Bowl. Trouble for the Packers was, they ran into
the Denver Broncos. By the time the Broncos made it to San Diego,
they had perfected the Mile High Salute. The Broncos had been
working on it since boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of running backs got together, and we always said we
were warriors,'' Broncos running back Terrell Davis said. ``But
there was nothing catchy about warriors. We couldn't do anything
with that. We started using soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap song, ``No Limit Soldiers,'' set great Broncos minds to
thinking. And the rest is history. ``It was only fitting to do a
salute with that,'' Davis said. ``We said any time any of our
soldiers go into war _ we call each game a war _ and does anything
honorable, we give him a salute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Falcons will have to salute if the Broncos win their
second consecutive Super Bowl. The Broncos promise to be at full
attention on Sunday, ready to Mile High Salute. If the Falcons are
going to win their first Super Bowl, they're going to have to flap
their arms and do a lot of Dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new dance for the Super Bowl,'' Anderson said.
``It's a tad different. Actually, it's a lot different. Trust me.
It's a special, Around The World Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson would not offer a sneak preview, perhaps because nobody
offered him any money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, that's like somebody sneaking backstage to see
showgirls,'' Anderson said. ``You've got to wait for the game.''

MEXICO TRIES TO CLEAN ITS POLLUTED AIR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexico City may resort to unproven technology in an attempt to
cleanse the city's heavily polluted air. An antenna system designed
to alter local rainfall and wind patterns is being tested in the
city, despite the skepticism of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists Lev Pokhmelnykh of the Mexican company
Electrificacion Artificial de la Atmosfera and Gianfranco Bisiacchi
of the National Autonomous University of Mexico are testing an
antenna that is designed to ionize the atmosphere, creating nuclei
on which water vapor can condense. The researchers expect the air
to be warmed by the heat released during condensation, causing the
intensity and direction of air currents to change.
</P>
<P>
   By using an array of antennae to either create or neutralize
ions, they hope to influence local wind patterns and rainfall.
Since most of Mexico City lies within a valley, wind and rain can
help to disperse air contaminants that often reach high
concentrations within the confines of the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine,
who won a Nobel prize for his work on atmospheric chemistry, says
that natural radioactive materials continually decay and ionize the
air. Within a cubic centimeter of atmosphere, about 3000 free
electrons are generated every second. So any attempt to alter the
natural level of ionization would require the addition or removal
of an enormous number of electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Dionisio Moreno, a physicist in Mexico's environment department,
says a government committee evaluating the project _ of which he is
a member _ remains skeptical. He says they are still unable to
detect a clear change in the intensity or direction of any winds
produced by the antenna. ``Preliminary results are insufficient,''
he says. More recent results, presented by Bisiacchi and
Pokhmelnykh on Jan. 15, are still being analyzed. &QL;

   Mexico City may resort to unproven technology in an attempt to
cleanse the city's heavily polluted air. An antenna system designed
to alter local rainfall and wind patterns is being tested in the
city, despite the skepticism of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists Lev Pokhmelnykh of the Mexican company
Electrificacion Artificial de la Atmosfera and Gianfranco Bisiacchi
of the National Autonomous University of Mexico are testing an
antenna that is designed to ionize the atmosphere, creating nuclei
on which water vapor can condense. The researchers expect the air
to be warmed by the heat released during condensation, causing the
intensity and direction of air currents to change.
</P>
<P>
   By using an array of antennae to either create or neutralize
ions, they hope to influence local wind patterns and rainfall.
Since most of Mexico City lies within a valley, wind and rain can
help to disperse air contaminants that often reach high
concentrations within the confines of the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine,
who won a Nobel prize for his work on atmospheric chemistry, says
that natural radioactive materials continually decay and ionize the
air. Within a cubic centimeter of atmosphere, about 3000 free
electrons are generated every second. So any attempt to alter the
natural level of ionization would require the addition or removal
of an enormous number of electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Dionisio Moreno, a physicist in Mexico's environment department,
says a government committee evaluating the project _ of which he is
a member _ remains skeptical. He says they are still unable to
detect a clear change in the intensity or direction of any winds
produced by the antenna. ``Preliminary results are insufficient,''
he says. More recent results, presented by Bisiacchi and
Pokhmelnykh on Jan. 15, are still being analyzed. &QL;

DENVER'S OFFENSIVE LINE REVELS IN ANONYMITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They were forgotten athletes. That's what Denver
offensive line coach Alex Gibbs liked most about them.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have a chance, so they didn't have egos. If he found
them, they would listen to him, and that's the first thing he
needed from those under his tutelage. They had to have nothing to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's offensive line came on different routes, some through
the draft, many through free agency, and most were linked by one
basic quality _ somebody else didn't think they had what it took to
play in this league. It doesn't matter now, though. They have a
team that is the NFL's best unless the Atlanta Falcons prove
otherwise. They have the league's best runner charging behind them.
And they have Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get high-drafted guys,'' Gibbs said. ``I have to take
the ones who are rejected. My guys weren't taken high because a lot
of people are concerned with computer drafts. So my guys are maybe
a little shorter or a little lighter or have something somebody
didn't like about them. But like everyone says, they don't measure
character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos offensive line, the unit that cleared the way
for Terrell Davis' 2,008 yards this season, is often talked about
because of its size. The starting five average 286 pounds per man,
making it the smallest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But more fascinating is how each member of that line reached
this point, because it wasn't easy. The starters include an
undrafted free agent (Pro Bowl left tackle Tony Jones), a
10th-round draft pick (left guard Mark Schlereth) and two
seventh-rounders (right tackle Harry Swayne and Pro Bowl center Tom
Nalen). Most have a sad story to tell, like Swayne, who studied for
an English test in order to avoid watching the draft in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Dan Neil is the only prima donna of the bunch. He
was the Broncos' third-round pick in 1997, and though it was a
delight then, it doesn't score him many points now. The Broncos'
line holds a kangaroo court with a list of finable offenses _
including talking to the media during the regular season _ and Neil
was hit for being taken too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They traded up to get Dan so when we were playing against the
guy we could've had in the draft, we told Dan this dude was playing
better than him,'' Jones said. ``We said that if we hadn't taken
him, we could've had the other guy, so we fined him $500.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a lot,'' Neil said. ``But it was enough to get my
wife irritated at me.''
</P>
<P>
   The things Gibbs loves most about his group of unknowns is their
work ethic and their ability to stay healthy. Not one of his
linemen has missed a game this season because, as Gibbs said, ``I
don't have much tolerance for that and I don't want someone who's
going to play 12 games and miss four. I want someone who's going to
be in there all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs attributes some of his players' persistence to the fear
factor. Given the history of Denver's offensive linemen, most know
the sense of urgency that comes from hoping you make a team and
none were likely to shed such concerns as their careers evolved.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if it's a longtime veteran like Swayne or a
younger player like Nalen, each understands that nothing is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had to work hard to get here,'' Nalen said. ``And you
don't want to waste that opportunity. Plus, you never feel the
pressure of expectations. When you're a first-rounder, you carry a
big burden. When you're low pick, if you screw up, nobody cares
because you're supposed to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and Broncos coach Mike Shanahan believe their success with
offensive linemen has much to do with their philosophy on grooming
them. They don't think linemen arrive ready to play professional
football in their first year. So it's better for another team to
handle the growing pains and then Gibbs targets those players with
the essentials he values.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't complicated. Gibbs' linemen have to be quick and
agile because the Broncos prefer to push defensive lines laterally
to open up cutback alleys for Davis, instead of blasting forward.
They must be bright, because players who aren't don't make the
Broncos' draft board or free agent list. After that, there's only
one other thing Gibbs is looking for and it's one area in which
size does matter _ heart.
</P>
<P>
   With those characteristics, Gibbs can erect the type of
successful offensive line he now has, a unit filled with players
who will always view publicity as a negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want as little attention as possible,'' Schlereth said.
``That's the whole mystique of playing offensive line. You don't
need a bunch of superstars down in there. As long as you're on the
same page, you can go out and accomplish great things and we've
proven that.''

WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES MEAN COSTS WILLL GO DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most important fact in American political life today is
this: For every dollar Americans earn, they spend $1.10. This
situation either changes (Americans become more productive and earn
more than they spend) or it unravels. The question that hangs over
Wall Street, the Federal Reserve Bank and the American political
system is this: which will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Optimists hope (and some believe) that technology will bridge
the gap, by increasing productivity to the point that the numbers
realign into positive balance. Pessimists (who call themselves
realists) believe that the behaviors associ ated with a negative
savings rate inexorably lead to dis aster. They envision a kind of
doomsday scenario in which, say, Brazilian panic leads to a
collapse in emerging mar kets, which leads to a global financial
crisis, which causes a credit crunch in the US, which leads to deep
recession if not depression.
</P>
<P>
   One senses that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, as he
gazes out at posturing panels of congressmen, shares the more
pessimistic view. Regardless of political ideology, most economists
argue that spending more than you make is, over the long haul,
unsustainable. This is particularly true in financial arenas (like
credit card debt) governed by compound interest.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
can keep all the plates spinning until tech nology rides to the
rescue. Technology is the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics-based medicine could cut the cost of health care
dramatically. Genomics-based agriculture could double the world's
food production.The wireless revolution in combination with
pervasive computing could open up markets around the globe and
create a parallel universe of e-commerce. Voice recognition
technology could enable enormous productivity gains. Taken
together, genetic and information technologies can create
extraordinary, almost unimaginable wealth.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, or enough people believe that it will happen,
then the ``$1 in/$1.10 out'' equation can be elided and the
political system will muddle along through the year 2000
presidential election. Vice President Gore would have the leg up,
both in the primaries and the general election, based on economic
performance and incumbency. He'd have a strong argument (we're good
plate spinners) and a strong counter-argument (do you really want
those right-wing lunatics in charge of spinning the plates).
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, some financial chain reaction occurs that
overwhelms Greenspan's mastery and Rubin's emergency-room skills,
then all bets are off. The country will look for someone or
something to blame. That something will not be Wall Street (which
most people think is an engine of wealth creation). That someone
will not be Alan Greenspan, who has smartly positioned himself
outside the political box. That something will be Washington. Those
someones will be Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes the presidential candidacies of John Kerry and
Bill Bradley, at some level, unfathomable. It makes some sense to
be the only alternative to Vice President Gore in the Democratic
Party primaries. But two not-Gores don't work, even if yet more
scandal rocks the Clinton-Gore administration. They divide the
anti-Gore vote, which ensures Gore's early nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's candidacy, as yet unannounced, makes some long-term
sense. He wants to raise a national profile but realistic about his
chances of winning the presidential nomination in the year 2000
(they're not great). Knowing that, he stays inside the Democratic
tent to ensure his re-election to the US Senate in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's affiliation is harder to figure. He's retired from the
Senate and largely disengaged from Democratic politics. He would be
far more attractive (to a much wider audience) as an independent
candidate than he would be as the Democratic challenger who beat Al
Gore in a 30-primary street fight. If all the plates keep spinning,
Gore will beat him anyway, and probably handily. If all the plates
come crashing down, the Democratic nomination won't be worth spit.
</P>
<P>
   The real opportunity for Bradley is to abandon his Democratic
Party nomination bid and reinvent himself as the third party
candidate for president. This would elongate his political horizons
and put him astride what is potentially the booster rocket of
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   The one true thing about American politics is that more and more
people are disgusted by it. Increasingly large majorities of people
feel that Washington is an entirely rigged game, to which only
insiders and fixers are given seats at the table. That's tolerable
if all the plates are spinning.
</P>
<P>
   It's unacceptable if they start falling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The wizards advise us that third party politics can't happen
here. Of course, it did happen here, in the Minnesota gubernatorial
race last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine brand names of Republican and Democratic politics were
on the ballot and they lost to a professional wrestler who ran on
the Reform Party ticket. And the plates were spinning. Imagine how
much the wrestler might have won by if they'd fallen to the floor.

GOP SENATORS FACING RE-ELECTION HOPE IMPEACHMENT FADES BY 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are not quite in panic mode, but the 19
Republican senators facing re-election in 2000 are looking over
their shoulders back home as they ponder the upcoming impeachment
vote on President Clinton's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Especially nervous are the 13 senators from states that Clinton
carried in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All 19 are mindful of poll numbers showing substantial
majorities favoring Clinton's continuance in office. But they also
are aware that their tenure in office depends on keeping faith with
Republican grass-roots loyalists, many of them conservatives who
believe deeply that Clinton should go.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats cast themselves as the party that wants to move
forward on issues such as Social Security, Medicare and education,
Republicans dither about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to look more and more like an issue that will
motivate people to the polls,'' said Kerin Polla, spokeswoman for
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But, she added, a
strategy built on impeachment finger-pointing easily could backfire
on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword and at this point, we don't know if
it's a sword we want to use or not,'' Polla said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, are framing themselves as the party that
went by the book and respected the impeachment process, rather than
attempting to short-circuit it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever misgivings individual Republican senators might have
about their votes, ``it's too late for them to turn back now,''
said Donald Kettl, director of the Robert La Follette Institute of
Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. ``This is a game of
Novocaine, how to get the thing out of there with the least pain
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Party activists and independent experts say it is way too early
to tell how impeachment will play as an issue in 2000. One thing
seems clear: Each senator faces a unique set of political
circumstances back home. So the impeachment issue is likely to be
framed by the different political dynamics of each race.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 19 incumbents may not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Six others _ Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Sen. Conrad
Burns, R-Mont.; Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; and Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo. _ come from states that Republican presidential candidate
Bob Dole carried in 1996. Of all the 19, these six may be immune
from any repercussions flowing from the impeachment controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 from states that Clinton carried in 1996 are Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.; Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.; Sen. John Chaffee,
R-R.I.; Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio; Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.; Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.; Sen. Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt.; Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.; Sen.
William Roth, R-Del.; Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.; and Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham of Michigan has shunned the limelight on impeachment,
avoiding talk shows that other senators regard as profile builders.
A first-termer, he lacks the kind of deep political roots and
durability that sometimes enables long-term officeholders to ride
over bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts consider Abraham vulnerable if Michigan
Democrats are able to field a strong challenger. ``All things being
equal, if he voted against his own party, that would help him
overall with the general electorate,'' said Bill Ballenger, editor
of the bi-weekly newsletter ``Inside Michigan Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But a vote to acquit Clinton might draw a primary challenge from
the conservative wing of the Republican party, which Abraham
considers his home nest. ``At this point, I can't see a vote for
conviction dooming Spencer Abraham by itself,'' Ballenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kyl of Arizona, appear to have a more stable
political base back home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's victory in Arizona, ``this is a Republican
state,'' said Jerrold Rusk, a political science professor at the
University of Arizona. With a Republican governor, Jane Dee Hull,
and both state legislative bodies in GOP control, Kyl is ``not
worried at all,'' Rusk said. ``Clinton's victory (in Arizona)
doesn't make a damn bit of difference to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others such as Snowe of Maine are more moderate and
uncertain of the best way to proceed. Snowe has called impeachment
a ``grave responsibility'' and an ``extraordinary constitutional
power.'' Last week she balked at the prospect of calling witnesses,
saying ``we want to make sure that it doesn't turn out to be the
`Jerry Springer Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, she voted with the rest of Republicans in
favor of a scaled-down witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe is a pro-choice centrist unafraid to buck the party
leadership. And she has a long track record with Maine voters,
having been first elected to a House seat in 1978 before winning
her Senate seat in the 1994 Republican landslide. This may help her
over any electoral rough spots impeachment may produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine is an independent kind of state, and even if Sen. Snowe
votes contrary to what a lot of voters want, people are
understanding of her independence and know what she does will not
strictly be on a party-line basis,'' said Douglas Hodgkin, a
political science professor at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``if she is tipping one way or the other
strictly from the calculus of what gets the most votes, voting for
acquittal probably would be the safer way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton of Washington finds himself in much the same predicament.
Gorton has first-hand experience with the sting of political
backlash. After serving one term, he lost his seat in 1986 when
Democrats seized control of the Senate, only to win it back in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton depends on the 35 percent of Washington's electorate who
are independents, according to state GOP chairman Dale Foreman.
Many of those voters are chagrined over how impeachment has
distracted Congress and the White House from other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not minimizing it,'' Foreman said. ``This is a major issue
that most people feel strongly about one way or another and it
could have a big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``two years is an eternity in politics.
And depending on how things work out, it may not be much of an
issue at all by 2000.'' A swift resolution to impeachment with a
final vote early next month would go a long way toward dampening
whatever aftershocks might come from a Gorton vote for conviction,
Foreman said.

ATLANTA'S CHANDLER GETS A LIFT FROM HIS FATHER-IN-LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons' quarterback Chris Chandler credits his
father-in-law, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback John Brodie,
for helping him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot to do with getting inside my head,'' Chandler
said. ``It isn't one exact thing he ever told me, but whenever I
got done talking to him, I just have a really good feeling about
what I can do on the field. It's the overall tone of his voice,
what he leaves me with.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie might have been Joe Montana with half the supporting
cast. He did 17 years as the 49ers' starting quarterback, give or
take a failed experiment with someone else, and might be the least
appreciated good quarterback of the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie's long career, with all its fits and starts, all its
disappointments and triumphs, all its 17 years, provided a basis
for the attitudinal adjustments Chandler needed to hear to make
himself a Super Bowl quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his career was good from day one and all 17 years
worth,'' Chandler said. ``I didn't know about them trying to bring
in all the different quarterbacks they tried to bring in. I didn't
know the different head coaches he went through. I didn't know any
of his career until I started talking to him. He really didn't
develop until he was in his late 20s, early 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like Chandler. A lot like Chandler, as it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler played for six coaches, five of whom saw Chandler as
nothing special. Brodie played for four, three of whom thought
there was somebody better at arm's reach. Chandler had to cope with
five other quarterbacks on four other teams, Brodie six on one.
Both were sure at different stages of their careers that they might
never be free of all those shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Both thought about bagging football. Both persevered. Both
triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler makes a point of crediting not only Brodie but Jerry
Rhome, the quarterbacks coach in Phoenix under Joe Bugel, for
giving him the base where he rekindled his love for the game after
being discarded in Indianapolis (by Ron Meyer for Jack Trudeau) and
Tampa Bay (by Richard Williamson for Vinny Testaverde). He was in
foul humor after being shoved off twice, and was wholly unreceptive
to even those who saw the light under all that attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Rhome) told me (in 1992) about the offseason program that
he was going to have, and at the time I still kind of felt like I
knew everything I needed to know,'' Chandler said. ``I kind of left
that meeting with the big ego that I had at the time, `Maybe I'll
be back, maybe I won't.' Over the month off, I did a lot of
thinking and realized that maybe I didn't have all the answers, and
maybe I would give it a try. It was the best thing I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for a while. He had a good year in Phoenix, and was
rewarded the next year with the news that Bugel was bringing in
Steve Beuerlein to run the offense. He went to the Los Angeles Rams
and ran into Chris Miller. He went to Houston (again, with Rhome as
the quarterbacks coach) and held the job long enough for Steve
McNair to be drafted in 1996. By the time he reached Atlanta,
though, he had met his wife-to-be, Diane, and his
father-in-law-to-be. And he believed.
</P>
<P>
   A little tinkering with his setups and drops, a few discussions
with Brodie about believing in his own abilities, and Chandler
suddenly sensed he was being positioned for one more crack at the
big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I met him, he said I was one of the best
quarterbacks in the league,'' Chandler said. ``I thought maybe it
was just because I was dating his daughter, but he convinced me. He
told me about not making it until he was 30, and that sort of hit
home for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was, after all, 28. Plus, it was helpful for him to
learn that he wasn't the first quarterback to be battered by
competition. Brodie graduated from Stanford University in 1957 and
backed Y.A. Tittle until Tittle's trade to New York, then spent
much of the next decade fighting off challengers _ Lamar McHan,
Billy Kilmer, Bob Waters, George Mira and Steve Spurrier. He knew
what Chandler knew, only he was old enough to have seen the end
game.
</P>
<P>
   And now that end game is a Super Bowl, Brodie is the best kind
of father-in-law to his son-in-law ... a proud one.

DIRECTOR MAKES LIFE OF IRISH LEGEND STUDY OF PRIVATE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Boorman has traveled to some of the world's most exotic
places to make movies, but his best work has been done closer to
home.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old director has circumnavigated the globe to film
stories on the Amazon (``The Emerald Forest''), in Thailand and
Burma (``Beyond Rangoon'') and the rural backwoods of America
(``Deliverance'').
</P>
<P>
   But he's won more fame and followers with movies made on British
turf: his dark Arthurian legend, ``Excaliber''; ``Hope and Glory,''
which was nominated for three Oscars (including best picture and
director), and, now, ``The General,'' which won him the best
director award at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' is a gritty, stark, black-and-white film about
charismatic Dublin gangster Martin Cahill, who master-minded
robberies that netted some $60 million and became Ireland's
most-wanted criminal.
</P>
<P>
   With a macabre sense of humor that delighted the press but
horrified the police, Cahill eluded capture for more than 20 years.
His career _ and life _ ended with an Irish Republican Army bullet
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Was he an Irish folk hero or just a low-life thug?
</P>
<P>
   Boorman and Brendan Gleeson, a beefy, buoyant actor best known
for playing Mel Gibson's mate in ``Braveheart'' and who turns in a
remarkable performance as Cahill, mulled the question during a
recent visit to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman, founding father of the film journal ``Projections,'' is
as introspective and thoughtful as Gleeson is gregarious. Gleeson
is the type of fellow with whom it would be fun to hoist a pint and
listen to his endless yarns about acting and actors. They make an
odd pair, but their differences bring out the best in each other.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boorman has been making movies for more than 30 years,
he's clearly thrilled by the response to ``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose there is something about this picture, as far as
physical terms, that's less ambitious than many of my other
films,'' he says. ``It's more contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a very intense film to make and I think it's quite
a mature film. It's about the characters, and the style matches the
content very closely,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it takes quite a long time to learn the mastery of
the craft of filmmaking. When David Lean was dying, I spent some
time with him and he was only six weeks away from filming
`Nostromo' and he said, `I hope I'll get well enough to make this
film because I'm just beginning to get the hang of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, Boorman says, ``The great privilege about doing
this kind of work is that you're a different person afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparing `Beyond Rangoon,' I went to Burma and learned
about Buddhism. I traveled through the area and got tremendous
insight. Of course, I traveled with a purpose. And when I did `The
Emerald Forest,' I lived with a Stone Age tribe in the Amazon. It
was the most profound experience of my life. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is so intense you become close to people in a way
that, under normal interaction, would take many years to
approximate. ... It's not larger than life, it's just more
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson says he had doubts at first about taking on a character
like Cahill, wondering why anyone would want to ``tell a fella's
story who does so much damage to people.'' But he changed his mind
because ``it's an actor's dream to get a role with such a scope of
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with a fictional character, you understand the
core of the character and build around it,'' Gleeson says. ``Here
we had footage of Cahill and I could see physically what he was
like, hear his voice, see the mannerisms and I had to build from
the other side. It was `Heart of Darkness' country going on. I even
had nightmares playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boorman intervenes, ``But once Brendan got there, he didn't put
a foot wrong. His responses were accurate and so deadly. It's a
remarkable, astonishing piece of acting. It's mysterious, and it's
hard to say so in Brendan's presence. I don't know how it works. I
understand the externals of acting but when you get to his level,
it transcends acting. It's a precious thing, so when it happens I
perceive my role to be a protector.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson says that in the end, he realized playing Cahill had to
be culled from a part of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust in the truth of the imagination,'' maintains
Boorman. ``It becomes a fiction and then you're free. Cahill was
the leader of the lost people in a sense. His people were the
rejects, the dregs, and Cahill respected them with a loyalty to his
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he demanded loyalty in return. He was against society and
felt society was against him. It essentially was a war.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the components in this war was Cahill's counterpoint and
childhood friend, Irish police inspector Ned Kenny, played in the
film by Voight, whom Boorman had directed in ``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon's changed totally,'' says Boorman. ``Acting was always an
agonizing process for him, but the last few years, he's become open
and daring and able to move into different parts without any of the
problems he had when younger. He has the need for challenges now
and he relishes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Jon said yes to this role immediately and that was
before he'd read the script. What a contrast from `Deliverance,'
where he couldn't make up his mind for weeks,'' laughs the
director.
</P>
<P>
   The war that Cahill and Kenny are involved in produces violence
that may bother some filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of American films, violence is used as a form of
entertainment,'' Boorman says. ``Things explode and the bodies fly.
It's a kind of ballet and it's fairly harmless really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is disturbing when it's real. When I made
`Deliverance,' there was a huge outcry and the censors wanted to
cut the scene where the Burt Reynolds' character shoots a guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the film, to me, was that it's about a man who
wanted the experience of killing somebody. I wanted to show the
consequence of the act by watching a man die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried in `The General' to show what Cahill did, but we also
showed the consequences. We showed Martin's gang robbing a jewelry
factory, but we also showed that 100 people lost their jobs because
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson adds, ``John showed what happened to the victims and
there's a great line from the play, `Playboy of the Western World,'
and I always get it mixed up, but it says `there's a great
difference between a heroic story and a dirty deed.' And you know,
one can be the other.''

<P>
   The question each of us patriotic Americans must ask ourselves
every year about this time is how seriously we should take a
holiday built around the made-up words of a large rodent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of cosmic matters, this may not rank as high as,
say, whether people who actually got to go to the Super Bowl should
be given paid time off to get back to work. Nonetheless, it is, in
the end, no trivial matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For on Groundhog Day each year we observe the folkloric
tradition that Punxsutawney Phil (or one of several pretenders)
comes out of his hole after a long sleep and predicts whether we'll
have six more weeks of winter depending on whether he sees his
shadow. (And I take it that Phil is a he, unless the name is short
for, say, Philomena or Philodendron or some such.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, on the whole this is a goofy deal, based, as it is, on the
meteorological skill of the common woodchuck, which, like
``whistle-pig,'' is another name for groundhog. Earlier I called
the groundhog a rodent, and though I don't wish to abandon that
pejorative appellation, I do wish to note for the record that the
animal is a marmot of the family Sciuridae, which, as we all know,
is a member of the order Rodentia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, groundhogs are big ugly rats. So I ask again,
how seriously must we take a holiday based on what big ugly rats
say about the weather? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can guarantee you that people on local TV news programs all
over the country will devote time to the story again this year. It
is as inevitable as stories about cute little trick-or-treaters on
Halloween or cute little pyromaniacs getting their fingers blown
off by firecrackers on the Fourth of July (which, by the way, is
scheduled this year for July 4). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a few years ago comedian Bill Murray played a TV
weatherman in the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' Against his will, he was
sent to Punxsutawney, Pa., to report on this annual ceremony.
However, that the film wasn't shot in Punxsutawney at all but in my
old hometown, Woodstock, Ill., which dressed up to look like
Punxsutawney. I happened to visit there for part of the shooting,
and it occurred to me this would be a serious movie embarrassment
Woodstock would have trouble living down. But I was wrong.
``Groundhog Day,'' starring both Murray and Andie MacDowell, turned
out to be a charming little film that showed off Woodstock's
natural beauty. (Though who knew?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Woodstock now makes a big deal out of Groundhog Day
each year as it tries to capitalize on fleeting fame. But so far
locals have ignored my pleas to make even more of all this by
stretching Groundhog Day into Woodchuck Week and by temporarily
renaming the surrounding area ``Rat Region.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But enough. Back to the animal. My several minutes of devout
research shows groundhogs feed mainly on low green vegetation. It
makes me wonder why they weren't regulars at my college cafeteria,
where everything _ from Mystery Meat No. 1 through Mystery Meat No.
Mystery _ looked like low green vegetation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly incomplete research (look, I have work to do; I can't
spend much time looking up stuff just to make sure what I write is
correct) tells me we may be able to blame England for Groundhog
Day. It turns out that the idea of the groundhog being able to
predict the weather comes from similar beliefs associated with
cloudy or clear weather on Candlemas, a Christian observance
celebrated each Feb. 2 in Britain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good, I say. We've not had enough to blame on the English lately
beyond the royal family and the bizarre practice of drinking warm
beer. How about if this year we get the queen to emerge on
Groundhog Day, sip some warm beer and see if she sees her shadow?
But only if a woodchuck could chuck wood. &QL;

FOR $94,000 SHE STAYS HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who understands bureaucracies should know that the way to
get a cushy job isn't to make yourself desirable but to make
yourself undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, while we're suffering through a national crisis over
alleged favors to Lewinsky, the one person who clearly has enjoyed
a big payoff--at taxpayer expense--is Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was a secretary at the White House, a holdover from the
Bush administration. When she began to look like trouble, she was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Pentagon is no surprise. Although
conservatives who inveigh against overpaid, do-nothing federal
bureaucrats probably have in mind the Department of Health and
Human Services, if your urgent need is a government job in general,
rather than anything in particular that job might accomplish,
apparently the Pentagon is your best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a military force of one and a half million people, the
Defense Department employs about 800,000 civilians. Linda Tripp is
one of them, holding the position of public affairs specialist with
a civil service ranking of GS-15, Step 6. That puts the 49-year-old
high-school grad at the top of the Pentagon's middle management
ranks. Like all GS employees, she just received an
across-the-board-pay increase. Tripp's raise, including a
``locality'' adjustment for working in the Washington, D.C., area,
was 3.68 percent, bringing her salary to $94,098 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For which she does ...? Since March 1998, nothing. Although she
has supposedly been working at home, she was stripped of her
duties--but not her pay or her title--shortly after the scandal
broke. Tripp has characterized this as a politically motivated
``demotion.'' It will strike many as a demotion devoutly to be
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's title at the Pentagon was confidential
assistant to the assistant secretary for public affairs. Her job
was writing press releases, for which she was paid $33,000. Note
that Lewinsky got this job as a payoff for being undesirable to a
presidential aide, not for being desirable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Tripp is the public affairs specialist for a program
called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, an arguably
worthwhile annual propaganda effort that takes 60 civilian ``public
opinion leaders'' on a weeklong tour of military operations. Tripp
had primary responsibility for the paperwork involved in the
selection process, for making travel and hotel arrangements, as
well as for other logistic odds and ends such as the week's
kick-off banquet. According to the New York Times, before Tripp
took the job, this position was part-time.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for more detail, the person now doing Tripp's job
used the word ``coordinating'' a lot, but that was about it. There
is, it turns out, no official description of the job. Writing one
is among the tasks Tripp is being paid to perform now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are official descriptions of other GS-15 public
affairs specialist positions. For instance, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights is currently looking for someone to ``assist in the
reviews and analysis of numerous requests for speeches; to develop,
clear, release, and distribute a wide range of information and data
concerning the nature and objective of the Commission's programs;
(and to) prepare press releases, fact sheets, etc. and arrange
press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: PR grunt. Salary: $80,658 to $104,851.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get some sort of independent measure of what these
jobs are worth, I called Kelly Services, the nationwide temp
agency. Without mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon, I described her
job there to the woman at Kelly. Oh, she said, that's high-end
secretarial. How much would you have to pay somebody to do a job
like that, I asked. Oh, $18 to $25 an hour, she said. That's
$36,000 to $50,000 a year--roughly half of what Tripp is being paid
not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folks on duty in the skies over Iraq make about half
of what Linda Tripp makes. Indeed, Tripp pulls down more than all
but a handful of the U.S. military's most senior officers. She
earns more than a ballistic missile submarine commander and is on a
par with aircraft carrier skippers in the Persian Gulf and Army
generals ready to lead thousands of troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Bob Barr and Henry Hyde would say if Monica had got
a deal like that.

 &HT;    MAJOR CANDIDATES IN THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS

   JERUSALEM _ On May 17, Israel holds the first round of it
elections for prime minister. Following are the major candidates:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE INCUMBENT: Benjamin Netanyahu, 49, was elected in 1996 and
has been such a controversial head of the Likud Party that members
defected from his loose coalition and joined those calling for
early elections. His term was not up until 2000. He has slowed the
Oslo peace process, at the urging of the right wing allies, and
proved a masterful campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE OPPOSITION: Ehud Barak, 56, heads the major left-wing
party, Labor, and has been plotting the strategy against Netanyahu
for more than two years. A former army chief of staff, famous for
secret commando operations, he supports the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE POPULAR ROOKIE: Yitzhak Mordechai, 54, was Netanyahu's
defense minister until the two recently had a falling out and
Mordechai joined a newly-former Center Party. A well-respected
general, he is also the first Sephardic (from Asia or Africa) Jew
to run for prime minister in a system long dominated by European
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE IDEOLOGUE: Benny Begin, 55, is son of former right-wing
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and used to be a Likud supporter.
But, he split from Netanyahu saying too much was being given to
Palestinians in the peace process.

   JERUSALEM _ Would you vote for James Bond for president?
</P>
<P>
   How about a guy who disguised himself as a woman, sneaked into
an enemy headquarters in Beirut, assassinated a couple Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas, then sped to an awaiting boat?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Ehud Barak, a leading candidate for prime minister
in Israel's May 17 elections, did in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a former general and army chief of staff, provides just
one example of the type of credentials many of Israel's leading
politicians hold. In a country where security has been the biggest
issue since it was born in the 1948 war of independence, military
experience carries a lot of weight.
</P>
<P>
   Among a people divided along lines of ethnicity, religious
observance, or between right wing and left wing, the army is the
one institution with nearly unanimous trust and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties bid, offering plum posts, to sign up generals
as they retire from the army and are free for political
allegiances. In Israel, almost every man or woman must serve in the
army and it is often where career networks are forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army symbolizes consensus and the parties in parliament
symbolize the disagreements, the confusion. Parties are seen as the
problem and the army is seen as the solution,'' says Uri Dromi,
publications director at the Israeli Democracy Institute, a think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 56, has a short and hardly-Bond-like portly build. But,
he was a shining star in the military, known for his nearly
photographic memory, Stanford University degree in systems analysis
and skills on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he is the candidate of the left-wing Labor Party and,
like many of Israel's top military brass, a strong supporter of
making peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he commanded a pair of brothers, Benjamin and Yoni
Netanyahu. Benjamin Netanyahu rose to captain and was injured in a
raid on a hijacked airplane. Nowadays, he is the right-wing Israeli
prime minister Barak is challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Yoni Netanyahu was the leader and the only commando killed
during Israel's famous raid on Entebbe, Uganda, freeing a planeload
of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Benjamin Netanyahu's ministers, with the prime
minister's approval, alleged that Barak had fled an army training
accident, Barak fired back that Yoni, a close friend, would have
been ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   But, even this military saga is overshadowed lately by another
general, Yitzhak Mordechai. Once Netanyahu's defense minister, he
recently split to lead his own opposition campaign. He is a
possible front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   His unit suffered heavy losses at the Chinese Farm, site of one
of Israel's most important victories and bloodiest battles in the
1973 Yom Kippur War. Mordechai, now 54, was given the army's second
highest award for bravery and, of great importance in Israeli
culture, has stayed close with the families of those who died.
</P>
<P>
   He also garnered sympathy in 1984, when he was framed for one of
Israel's most notorious crimes. He was accused of beating to death
two terrorists who had hijacked a bus.
</P>
<P>
   A commission concluded that Mordechai, perhaps after roughing
them up in interrogation to learn if the bus was set with
booby-traps, turned the terrorists over alive to Israel's secret
service. There, agents killed them and blamed Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   He was stoic while accused, lending him an air of the righteous
underdog that has served him in his battle against the
controversial Netanyahu.

GETTING SERIOUS IN KOSOVO

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reflecting a savvy recognition of America's and Europe's
interest in stopping the warfare in the Serbian province of Kosovo,
the Clinton administration and the NATO alliance have finally
issued an ultimatum to the belligerent parties _ the regime of
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, and the fractured
leadership of the 1.8 million Albanians who are 90 percent of
Kosovo's population. In theory, at least, the US initiative
contains all the requisite elements for successful peacemaking: an
overall strategy, no-nonsense deadlines, a concrete political plan
to be negotiated, and a credible threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the US-brokered Dayton accord that ended the war in
Bosnia, the attempt to make peace in Kosovo is multilateral and
multi-organizational. The threat of force comes from NATO. The
diplomatic sponsor is to be the nations of the Yugoslavia ``contact
group'' _ the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and,
most helpfully, Russia. The strategy and the tough means to compel
the parties to negotiate are backed by the United Nations and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   This alphabet soup of diverse organizations has made imposing
peace in Kosovo a particularly complex and difficult task. But
Washington had no choice in the matter. European cooperation is
needed to bring to bear a credible threat of NATO force, and
Moscow's involvement is necessary because of the danger that the
NATO countries might create an even nastier problem for themselves
if they tried to exclude Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All the aspiring peacemakers have a stake in preventing two
possible outcomes of an unchecked conflict in Kosovo: massive
ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbs or the crystallizing of a
Greater Albania. The supreme allied commander in Europe, General
Wesley Clark, put the case for a peacemaking intervention lucidly
in a meeting this week with Globe writers and editors. The
countries involved ``may be at the periphery of Europe
geographically,'' Clark said, ``but the crises they generate are at
the heart of Europe strategically.''

   In the time it takes to sit through Sunday's 11-hour Super Bowl
broadcast on the Fox Network, you could (1) take the state bar
exam; (2) fly from Boston to Honolulu; (3) watch all of Ken Burns's
``The Civil War''; or (4) learn introductory Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're idle or sedentary enough to tune in that long, you
might feel like you've done all four.
</P>
<P>
   What we have coming up is a major sports event that long ago
ballooned into a Major Television Event. And that continues to
expand, like Henry Hyde's suit measurements, until everything
around it looks linty and undersized.
</P>
<P>
   The sure-bet MVP of Super Bowl XXXIII is not Terrell Davis or
Jamal Anderson. It's Rupert Murdoch, the native Australian press
baron who founded Fox TV, wooed the NFL from CBS, and just bought
the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has Cher singing the national anthem.
Marge Simpson must have been unavailable. Incidentally, rumors that
Murdoch ordered the Super Bowl broadcast to include clips from
Fox's new show ``The World's Most Shocking Medical Videos'' are
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is the world's most shocking medical video.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some football? Good. But if you're one of
those rural New Englanders who can't pull in a UHF signal without
standing on your roof and aiming two rolls of tin foil toward
Sydney, you had better leave home now. Recommended viewing venue:
Toronto's CN Tower.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Super Bowl viewing, past, not passing yardage,
is prologue. Seasoned fans have come to anticipate a flat, lopsided
game preceded by hours of gassy hype. Blown calls on the field,
inane chatter in the booth, overproduced junk-food ads spiced with
pouty supermodels _ it wouldn't be Super Sunday without them.
</P>
<P>
   Lyin' and laughin'? Bring 'em on, too. After booking rap artists
Ice Cube and Mack 10 for its pregame show, Fox promises to ``pull
the plug'' at the first naughty word from these two. Which is not
unlike Olympic Committee site-selection delegates offering to
return their souvenir Rolexes if anyone can prove their votes were
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some established trends to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton factor: No politician has used Super Sunday to
greater advantage than Bill Clinton. In 1992, he and Hillary went
on a post-game edition of ``60 Minutes'' to confront Clinton's
``Gennifer Flowers problem.'' Grilled by Steve Kroft, Clinton
admitted having caused ``pain in my marriage'' but denied the
affair with Flowers, insisting their relationship was ``friendly
but limited.'' Huffed Hillary, ``I am not . . . some little woman
standing by her man like Tammy Wynette.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaking around him,
Clinton sat for a Super Bowl interview promoting his national
dialogue on race relations. Could it have been his bold response to
Dan Quayle's cameo in a 1994 Super Bowl ad, which Quayle used to
promote potato chips? Maybe. This year's longed-for Super Bowl
surprise? Hillary in a Gap spot.
</P>
<P>
   Halftime follies: What began with a collegiate marching band and
a couple of stuntmen wearing jet packs has swollen into a
Vegas-on-Viagra spectacle that makes ``Cats'' look like catnip.
This year's $3 million Progressive Auto Insurance halftime
extravaganza stars Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan, Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy, and, as they say, a cast of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moments from previous telecasts include:
</P>
<P>
   --Super Bowl IV's reenactment of the Battle of New Orleans,
during which cannon fire spooked Andrew Jackson's horse, sending
steed and rider flying from the stadium at a gallop.
</P>
<P>
   --Super Bowl XIV's Caribbean-themed show, when a float got
snagged on a goal post, causing a 10-minute delay to the
second-half kickoff. Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll fumed that the
pageant ``made a mockery of the game.'' And his team won.
</P>
<P>
   --Singer Michael Jackson's 1993 concert, a crotch-grabbing
riposte to the bad press Jacko had been getting for sharing his
bedroom with prepubescent boys.
</P>
<P>
   --The lip-synch hall of fame, headlined by Up With People
(mistiming the vocal track to ``Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow
Polka Dot Bikini'') and Chubby Checker (mouthing the amazingly
insipid lyrics to ``The Super Bowl Twist'').
</P>
<P>
   Product placement: Apple Computer broke the mold in 1984 with
its Orwellian ad introducing the company's Macintosh computer. In
its wake have come beer brawls, cola wars, animated lounge lizards,
3-D eyeglasses, hot-sauce sucking mosquitoes, Mike-vs.-Larry hoop
dreams, celebrity shills (Jerry Seinfeld, Cindy Crawford), and
millions of dollars in word-of-mouth publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In a low note, on the eve of Super Bowl XXXI, Frito-Lay pulled a
scheduled ad after a bungee jumper died during a practice session
in the Superdome in New Orleans. The ad featured comedian Chris
Elliott's bungee jumping out of a blimp and into (almost) a bowl of
dip. Frito-Lay officials decided it would be ``inappropriate'' to
air the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time help: Think of the broadcast as a billion-dollar
infomercial for Murdoch's network. Should you desert Fox early and
skip the post-game debut of its new adult animated series ``Family
Guy,'' Rupert will be very disappointed in you.
</P>
<P>
   But if you must leave early, think back to shows that have used
previous Super Bowls as their launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. There's the extremely short-lived ``Extreme,'' on ABC
(James Brolin in ``Baywatch'' on skis, 1995). There's NBC's ``The
Last Precinct,'' a comic cop show that turned in its Nielsen badge
after eight episodes in 1986. There's CBS's ``Grand Slam'' (1990),
a grandly unfunny comedy about, of all things, bounty hunters. And
there's ``The A-Team,'' a hit for NBC in 1983, but one saddled with
the dubious distinction of having made a star out of Mr. T.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Pass the chips. Those medical videos don't sound so bad.

SOLARA, THE CAMRY OF COUPES _ WHAT ELSE NEED BE SAID? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-door automobiles, for the most part, leave me cold. What's
the point of having two rows of seats and one set of doors? I'm not
talking about sports cars with back seats designed for tax
collectors (more properly, perhaps, to avoid them), or wee
convertibles with rudimentary melon carriers in the rear. I refer
to real cars, bread-and-butter cars that working stiffs and
families own.
</P>
<P>
   Stop! Don't start yelling ``The bum hates the handicapped'' and
reach for the poison pen. I understand _ totally _ the advantage of
the long door on the coupe for the wheelchair-users among us. No, I
am not advocating the demise of coupes, but maybe we'd all be
better off _ you, me, and the wheelchair user _ if all coupe
manufacturers adopted the Saturn 3-door scheme, not as an option
but as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn rear-opening door on the driver's side is a design
innovation that affords maximum convenience for all and a measure
of added safety to a rear passenger _ how is one supposed to get
out of the back of a coupe after the crash?
</P>
<P>
   But I digress; this is not a column on Saturn. It is a
dissertation on a two-door, a coupe for which I have developed
quite warm feelings, the Toyota Solara with V6 engine. I do not
dismiss the Solara with the sturdy little 4-cylinder; I simply have
yet to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara is, of course, the coupe sibling of the Camry, the
bread-and-butter horse in the Toyota stable. Solara is new, in the
sense of new model or new name, anyway, but it's anything but new
in that it is merely a Camry with two fewer doors. (What a car it
would be if it had three, a la Saturn!)
</P>
<P>
   Camry has been described here frequently as boring _ and I mean
that in the best possible way. There are no surprises with Camry,
no opportunities to make new friends while awaiting a tow or a jump
start. There is no excitement, no thrill of sudden oversteer or
understeer, no adrenaline rush as a Camry fails to proceed through
a unfamiliar neighborhood after dark or home from a snow-encrusted
parking lot. With all due respect, Mr. Toyoda, you build a boring
car. People tend to value that sort of boring.
</P>
<P>
   Solara has at once all of that boring built into it and less of
it. It can be expected to perform in the Camry manner _ it is,
after all, a Camry with fancy moniker _ and yet it is more
interesting to drive than its sibling sedan. The tested Solara
seemed a bit crisper in the handling department than the Camry
sedans _ perhaps this is imagination born of its sportier
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The tested SE model arrived with the 2.995-liter, four-cam, 200
horsepower (slightly less in California) V6 under the hood and a
4-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed manual is available with
either the V6 or the base 2.164-liter I4 engine. The SE V6 is the
middle-of-the-road model (a figure of speech, please) with a
$21,998 price tag and a $420 destination charge. A base 4-cylinder
SE with manual gearbox is $18,638, plus destination, and the
top-of-the-line SLE Solara is $24,988 plus.
</P>
<P>
   The tested SE was equipped with a few options, including the
$250 side air bags, $900 power moonroof, $550 antilock brakes, $300
traction control, and a few other bits. In the columnist's humble
opinion, ABS and traction control are musts, should be standard on
the car. A moonroof is nice, but detracts from the headroom
somewhat (and why is it a Power Tilt/Slide Moonroof on Camry and
Camry Solara but a Power Tilt/Slide Sunroof on a Celica?). The
writer is undecided on the Toyota side air bags but leaning in
their direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara feels quick _ can it really be significantly quicker
than its sedan sibling? Not likely, but style can change one's
perceptions. The suspension does feel different, tauter, yet no
less forgiving of road roughness than in the Camry four-doors.
Solara is a car for that customer who craves the boring solidity,
the reputation, the peace of mind of the Camry _ but who needs
something sportier to feed the sense of image. Solara fills the
bill nicely, just sporty enough to please the mildly adventuresome
but not so testosterone-soaked as to put off those who view
themselves as the sensible center.
</P>
<P>
   Solara may have a sunny name, a moniker that conjures up visions
of summer sun and desert driving, but this little coupe has the
right stuff for winter touring. With hard-packed snow abuilding on
the road and snow blowing all around, the Solara crusied with the
traffic easily. It was capable of faster speed with less difficulty
than most others on the road, it seemed, but there's nothing to be
gained being aggressive in the snow _ and plenty to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the back roads and ice-encrusted byways of rural Maine,
Solara bumped right aslong, taking the ruts and rough in stride,
transmitting little to the driver _ until the dirty stretch, of
course. Dirt roads in winter are washboards at best, nightmares at
worst, encouragement for chiropractors all the time. Camry Solara
softened the blows considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Good car _ very good car _ but not perfect. The major complaint
is the trunk. It's roomy enough, but the opening is smallish and
there is a high sill; lifting heavy stuff over that sill is not for
the faint of spine or the old and weak. The 60/40 split rear seats
fold to increase cargo space. Interior storage is a mixed bag; the
glove box is small, augmented by a deep covered storage bin between
the seats, narrow door bins, and pockets in the front seat backs.
</P>
<P>
   Performance is very good _ Solara accelerates with zip and
passes with pep _ yet fuel mileage is good. The 4-banger with
automatic is EPA rated 23 miles per gallon city, 30 highway (23/32
highway with manual) and the V6 is rated 20/28 with the tested
automatic (21/28 with manual). The tested Solara delivered 24.06
overall with varying loads over varying roads in widely varying
weather conditions over 750 miles charted.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, if you like coupes, Solara is a dandy. There's some
room in the rear and from the passenger side, the old and weak can
make it in _ the front seat shoots forward and tilts to offer room
for ingress. The coupe is still not this driver's cup of tea, but
the Solara worked well, gets high marks _ a definite thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under unfinished buiness is Protege mileage. Assistant sports
editor Bill Griffith delivered the verdict on this small Mazda
sedan, but other members of the jury were in possession of the
mileage evidence. The little sleeper from Mazda (essentially
similar to Ford Escort) delivered an impressive 27.26 miles per
gallon over 565 miles charted. So now you know.

HONDA ODYSSEY IS A MEGA-MINIVAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a brand-new Honda on the market, ready to battle for
dominancy in yet another market segment: the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   It's the completely redesigned 1999 Odyssey, and it makes most
of its competitors seem like last year's leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, the Japanese automaker whose Accord sedan has
consistently ranked first or second among the top-selling vehicles
in America, finally jumped into the minivan market five years ago
with its first Odyssey, a respectable van built on the Accord
chassis.
</P>
<P>
   But sales never caught on the way the Accord's did. That's
because even though the vehicle was typically very high quality, a
Honda trademark, it really didn't stand out among the minivan
crowd. The four-cylinder engine was not quite powerful enough, the
interior was not quite as roomy as it should have been, and there
really just wasn't anything very exciting about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Honda, for sure. It reflected Honda's tradition of
building practical, dependable cars that aren't particularly snazzy
but will keep running for years without a lot of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, exciting has been about the last word that most people
would associate with most Honda products.
</P>
<P>
   But Honda has come up with a unique combination in its all-new
Odyssey: It's a vehicle with style, power and functionality. Honda
bills it as the largest Honda ever offered. And with 210
horsepower, the Odyssey also becomes the most powerful vehicle in
this class.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you after a week's worth of test-driving the Odyssey
that Lee Iacocca and the folks at Chrysler never envisioned a
performance-oriented vehicle like this one when they rolled out
their first minivans in 1983. The Odyssey is a minivan that refuses
to be a boring mommymobile; it looks great and is fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides style and performance, the Odyssey takes convenience to
a new level, too, with such features as dual electric sliding
passenger doors.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line EX model, with a base price of $25,800 (plus
$415 transportation), which we tested, comes with electric doors.
General Motors introduced the first electric sliding door on its
Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan five years ago, and has since added
this option to the Chevrolet Venture and Pontiac Trans Sport. But
Honda is the first to offer the electric doors on both sides. That
feature alone will capture some sales for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Cleverness abounds inside the Odyssey, beginning with the third
row seat. It can be folded into the floor to create a huge cargo
area. The two individual middle seats can be pushed together to
make one bench seat, or left apart to separate two kids who would
otherwise pick at each other the whole trip.
</P>
<P>
   A folding tray divides the front bucket seats, so you can serve
lunch to a passel of kids in the back. There is room enough under
the seats for skis or pieces of lumber. The middle seats can be
removed quickly, and with the rear seat folded into the floor, the
Odyssey becomes a cargo van _ it can even hold 4-by-8-foot sheets
of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers have their own reading lamps that also shine onto the
ground when the doors are opened so people can see where they are
stepping in the dark. Cupholders abound, and they will hold just
about anything a kid wants to drink. I believe real moms had a
large hand in designing the interior of this vehicle; it's the
essence of practicality for kid-hauling.
</P>
<P>
   How about this for passenger convenience: Each person has his or
her own heating and air-conditioning controls.
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey, at 200 inches long, is almost as big as the
extended-length versions of DaimlerChrysler's vans. It's 13.6
inches longer than the previous Odyssey and 5 inches wider. Yet it
retains the tight 37-foot turning radius of the previous model.
There is an inch-and-a-half more headroom than in the Dodge Grand
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Power comes from a 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine that has the
largest displacement in the minivan segment. It's connected to a
smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission, and the shift
lever is mounted on the steering column to keep it off the floor
and out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is very stable in turns, thanks in part to its
four-wheel independent suspension and wide track, the widest in the
minivan class. The unitized body is built on a sturdy cross-section
ladder-type frame with seven cross members under the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes are an important safety feature, and they come
on all Odysseys at no additional charge. The EX model comes with
electronic traction control to minimize wheel spin on slippery
surfaces. There are dual air bags up front, and all seven seats
have three-point lap and shoulder belts. An engine-immobilizer
antitheft system is standard; keyless entry is available on the EX.
</P>
<P>
   The base LX model, which lists for $23,200 plus transportation,
comes with power rack-and-pinion steering, power front disc/rear
drum brakes, 16-inch steel wheels, dual manual rear sliding doors,
rear wiper/washer, front and rear air-conditioning, power windows
and door locks, AM/FM/cassette stereo with four speakers, cruise
control, tilt steering wheel, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, rear
defroster and rear-seat heater ducts.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra money, the EX model adds the power sliding doors,
auto-off headlights, eight-way power driver's seat, compact-disc
player, six stereo speakers and 16-inch alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the Accord sedan chassis, the Odyssey is assembled at
Honda's plant in Alliston, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are 18 miles per gallon in the city
and 26 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 20.5 gallons of gasoline.

LIVING IN THE GRAY AREAS  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Zoom in on the sands at Sag Harbor, on the
eastern edge of Long Island. Spalding Gray is catching some rays.
Muscles ripple, his tan line sharpens beneath the summer light.
Women cast surreptitious glances as they pass, awed, or maybe only
amused, by the sight of such manly pulchritude courting melanoma
for their pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, you say. The picture's a little fuzzy. Are we talking
about (begin ital) that (end ital) Spalding Gray? The monologuist?
The country's most famous talking head? No way that guy's a studly
beach hunk.
</P>
<P>
   How little you know. You've only to listen to ``Swimming to
Cambodia,'' ``Gray's Anatomy,'' ``Monster in a Box,'' ``Booze, Cars
and College Girls'' or ``Sex and Death to the Age of 14'' to know
Gray is no stranger to the joys of exposure. He is a man of
libidinous parts, with a compulsive itch to scratch them in public.
</P>
<P>
   A friend once described Gray's style as ``tell it all, tell it
well and tell it with irony.'' It's a style that's hard on his
friends, harder on his women. And there have been women; Gray is
attractive to the other sex. Not content to merely catch their
fancy on the beach, he's engaged them in marital combat, usually on
the losing side. It's a relative thing, losing, when applied to
Gray. He always gets in the last shot. One of those broadsides is
``It's a Slippery Slope,'' which he will perform this week at the
Scottsdale Center for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The monologue represents a homecoming of sorts. Gray workshopped
the piece at the center in 1996, under the title ``Skiing to New
England.'' He's since honed it to a fine edge, tightening its focus
on an adulterer in crisis, a man who finds therapy of a sort in
soaring down the slopes while making kamikaze runs on his personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   The monologue had its origin in a trip Gray made to Flagstaff,
Ariz., and the Grand Canyon with his then-wife, Renee. He was
involved in a passionate affair with Cathie, who is now his wife.
Renee knew. He knew she knew. Cathie knew she knew. Cathie also was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Gray retitled his monologue ``It's a Slippery Slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Krantz would have turned it into a steamy bestseller;
Aaron Spelling would have made it into an even steamier miniseries
with Nolan Miller ski outfits for the women. Gray did what he
always does with his life. He fashioned an intensely personal, wry,
sometimes painful but always funny treatise on the imperfections of
man. Audiences should be appalled; instead they are enthralled. He
is the storyteller incarnate, a yarn-spinner whose saving grace is
that his ruthless honesty begins with himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is no aspect of Gray's life that escapes his art, so it is
no surprise to learn in a phone call from Sag Harbor that his real
reason in returning to Scottsdale is to fine-tune his latest
monologue, which he calls ``Morning, Noon and Night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's winter on Long Island now. Summers on the beach with their
passing fancies are far from his thoughts. Rather he is reliving an
autumn day in 1997, Oct. 8 to be exact. What was it like that
morning, noon and night for him, Cathie, their daughter, Marissa,
12, and their sons Forrest, 6, and Theo, 2?
</P>
<P>
   Still a work in progress, the monologue will be performed
Thursday and Friday in the intimate confines of the center's
cinema, a setting he finds creatively inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locating the structure was the key here,'' he says. ``There
were so many incidents I wanted to discuss, but how to contain that
chaos? I'm a big audiophile, and I happened to be listening to
Donal Donnelly reading 42 hours of James Joyce's ``Ulysses,''
which, as you know, takes place during a single day. I thought, `If
Joyce can contain all of that story in one day, I should be able to
do something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the attraction. Like Joyce, Gray is an artist
to whom the story's framework is merely a foundation for extensive
modifications. Anyone else would be accused of rambling, but Gray
has the gift of taking the tangential byway and not getting lost,
of mixing the mundane and the cosmic. Everything arouses his
curiosity, and, sooner rather than later, everything makes it into
the story.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' which takes place on one day but
encompasses many, will range far afield of the 1890s Sag Harbor
Victorian that houses the Gray family. He'll explore the town
itself, which he says ``is truly a village,'' and ruminate on lives
and incidents that have never known the sound of Long Island surf.
Mostly, however, at least at this stage of development, it is about
the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning how to breathe in a new environment,'' he says.
``I am not great about being in that uncontrolled chaos. Cathie is
much better at it. She is a good mother. But I feel redeemed by
this monologue. By talking about it, I can organize the chaos to
some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense a much more centered, almost joyful, celebratory,
nurturing adult force coming to the fore. There is less irony. The
family is giving me a kind of center. I'm not always looking over
someone's shoulder, fantasizing about being somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Family isn't limited to those living under the same roof. Gray's
father is much on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing what I have with my two boys, I find I'm missing what I
didn't have with him. I think a lot about not being there at his
deathbed, about his not knowing that I have sons. Not just my
father, either. I think about not being closer to both my parents,
and wonder why I didn't appreciate them more. In their absence,
this piece is a celebration in a strange way.''
</P>
<P>
   Women? They play an important role in ``Morning, Noon and
Night.'' Even he admits there is no way a Gray monologue could
ignore the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on this piece has given me a minor insight into the
nature of my passive-aggressive relationships with women,'' he
says. ``I've had three that I would categorize as serious. One
lasted for 12 years, the other for 14. But when it came to the
first two women, I never was in touch with my anger. They owned the
anger. I would provoke the anger in them so that, in some crazy
way, I was getting rid of my anger by having theirs come back at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising children has affected him in a wholly unexpected way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a good sense, not in any way abusive, they have liberated a
pure anger in me,'' he says. ``I can yell at them, `Get down here
and set the table!' Before, I never felt I could do that. On
another level, I feel I can show my anger to Cathie, and it isn't
going to be the end of the world. I'm 57 years old and I'm learning
to express my feelings. That's a healthy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marissa is his stepdaughter, the boys are his and Cathie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it sounds crazy, but I have no idea how those little guys
were conceived,'' he says, laughing. ``I've been going through the
motions all my life, but I never made a woman pregnant. I just
assumed I wasn't very fertile. You can't imagine how surprised I
was when Cathie said, `You're going to be a father.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he have imagined then how he would respond to being
Spalding Gray, dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I had these natural tendencies toward fatherly
love and nurturing,'' he says. ``I thought it was going to be all
work. I wanted to be a sweet old uncle, who had all the fun and
then sent the kids home to their folks. But those children consume
me. I find myself always thinking about them, always looking out
for them. I didn't know I was such a patient person. It's a hell of
a surprise discovering something like that this late in life. It's
a well that has gone untapped.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many such wells, if Gray would admit them. Each
monologue leaves its mark on him. In the course of developing
``It's a Slippery Slope,'' he became a good skier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go skiing alone. I've never done anything like that. All day
on the slopes, only me, the weather, my thoughts, with plenty of
time to consider why I do things. It's exhilarating. For most of my
life, the pattern has been falling into depression, drinking,
picking up a woman, falling into depression. Now this. What took me
so long?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Morning, Noon and Night'' may have the greatest
impact of any of the monologues. Mellow is not an adjective that
ever will fit comfortably into Gray's self-awareness, but he's
achieving something like its rough equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy? I've been told I seem happier these days. I don't see
the changes as strongly as the people outside of me, but, yeah,
even I sense there's something going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good thing happening in Scottsdale. Pairing these
monologues is like discovering I've created two paintings that
should be hung together. I seem to be coming out of the shadow and
turmoil of ``Slippery Slope'' into the coalescing family of
``Morning, Noon and Night.'' There's never been that kind of
crossover before. It's exciting!'' &QL;

CONSUMERS UNION FINDS OEM PARTS ARE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, you may have heard rumblings about OEM vs.
aftermarket crash parts _ you probably wondered what they were
rumbling about.
</P>
<P>
   OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer and means a part
made for your car by the company that made your car or made the
parts for the company that assembled your car. Aftermarket means
everybody else who makes pieces for your automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups from time to time mount campaigns to focus
public attention on the need for OEM parts. Since these efforts are
heartily endorsed by car manufacturers who have a vested interest
in widespread use of OEM parts, public confidence in the validity
of these consumer efforts is easily undermined _ especially by
insurance companies prattling about ``saving consumers money'' and
aftermarket lobbyists insisting that their parts are just as good,
only less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermarket, we have been led to believe, covers a wide spectrum
of quality ranging from just as good or better than OEM to not as
good. So what's the scoop here? If your car is damaged in a
collision, do you fight the insurance company to use OEM or do you
accept the less expensive alternative and avoid the hassle? Well,
Bunky, it would seem the best advice is embodied in an old football
song _ fight, fight, fight.
</P>
<P>
   The premier consumer watchdog, Consumers Union, has investigated
the pros and cons in its usual thoroughly analytical way and
published the despairing truth of it in its magazine, Consumer
Reports. The truth? Aftermarket parts are frequently inferior to a
woeful degree and the only one saving money on the deal isn't the
consumer _ it's the insurer. Cost savings from the lower-price
parts are not passed on to the consumer, CU finds.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem with the aftermarket crash parts is two-fold:
They usually don't fit and they don't stand up in ordinary use. CU
found that the aftermarket stuff was prone to corrosion, frequently
didn't match the original, frequently resulted in an inferior
repair.
</P>
<P>
   To test the hypothesis that aftermarket is as good as OEM, CU
took two popular automobiles, a Ford Taurus and a Honda Accord, and
went shopping for common replacments for crash-damaged parts to be
installed. CU also did extensive interviewing of repair
professionals. The vedict: There's a lot of junk out there and it's
very difficult for the consumer to know if he or she is getting a
quality repair part or a shoddy imitation from a pushcart across
the Pacific. It's not chump change, either; CU says it's a $9
billion business affecting 35 million damaged autos annually.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certification program for aftermarket parts, CU says,
administered by the Certified Automotive Parts Association, a
nonprofit group founded in 1987. CAPA certifies but a small
percentage of parts, however, placing its seal on the certified
pieces. The seal, by the way, comes up as a void label if it's
removed.
</P>
<P>
   But how good a job does CAPA do in its small way? CU finds CAPA
parts aren't always good quality and the group, itself, somewhat
suspect. CAPA is quick to accuse manufacturers of having a vested
interest in OEM parts but slow to reveal that half its budget comes
from insurance companies (the rest from sale of certification
seals) and that six of nine directors are insurance industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   CAPA doesn't certify bumpers; aftermarket bumpers did miserably
in CU's bumper-basher tests, faring much worse than OEM bumpers. CU
routinely bashes bumpers in its auto evaluation program for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Repairers claim that aftermarket parts don't fit up to 70
percent of the time and frequently can't be made to fit and must be
rejected _ time-consuming, and time is money.
</P>
<P>
   Foisting the imitation parts on the consumer, CU concludes,
merely transfers the cash flow from the auto manufacturers to the
insurance companies and doesn't benefit the consumer. And adjusters
are not always forthcoming about the decision to repair with
pushcart parts.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Think about replacement parts when you're buying
insurance, CU says. Get it up front and in writing that you are
entitled to OEM pieces for your car after an accident. Shop and
compare insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Think twice before using aftermarket parts, CU advises. Although
it is cleaerly in the interest of the consumer to use less
expensive parts on a quality par with OEM, there's no guarantee
that's what you'll be getting. Don't surrender haggling rights, CU
advises. According to a CU survey, 71 percent of those who insisted
on OEM parts got the OK from their insurers. If you don't ask, you
won't get.
</P>
<P>
   And you might think about used parts, hard to find sometimes,
but recycling yards offer good value, and it makes environmental
sense to patronize them.
</P>

Region-Sports Car Club of America have scheduled a winter rally for
next Saturday, Feb. 6. ``Snow &AMP; Ice 99'' kicks off from the
Fairfield Inn, Concord/Bow, N.H. (exit 13 off Interstate 93) at
8:30 a.m. for a 175-mile time-speed-distance rally _ a rally is a
driving competition, not a race. Beginners are welcome. Cost is $50
per car (two-person team), $45 for club. For information or
registration, telephone rallymaster David Lewis at 978-386-2268.

SOLARA, THE CAMRY OF COUPES _ WHAT ELSE NEED BE SAID? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-door automobiles, for the most part, leave me cold. What's
the point of having two rows of seats and one set of doors? I'm not
talking about sports cars with back seats designed for tax
collectors (more properly, perhaps, to avoid them), or wee
convertibles with rudimentary melon carriers in the rear. I refer
to real cars, bread-and-butter cars that working stiffs and
families own.
</P>
<P>
   Stop! Don't start yelling ``The bum hates the handicapped'' and
reach for the poison pen. I understand _ totally _ the advantage of
the long door on the coupe for the wheelchair-users among us. No, I
am not advocating the demise of coupes, but maybe we'd all be
better off _ you, me, and the wheelchair user _ if all coupe
manufacturers adopted the Saturn 3-door scheme, not as an option
but as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn rear-opening door on the driver's side is a design
innovation that affords maximum convenience for all and a measure
of added safety to a rear passenger _ how is one supposed to get
out of the back of a coupe after the crash?
</P>
<P>
   But I digress; this is not a column on Saturn. It is a
dissertation on a two-door, a coupe for which I have developed
quite warm feelings, the Toyota Solara with V6 engine. I do not
dismiss the Solara with the sturdy little 4-cylinder; I simply have
yet to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara is, of course, the coupe sibling of the Camry, the
bread-and-butter horse in the Toyota stable. Solara is new, in the
sense of new model or new name, anyway, but it's anything but new
in that it is merely a Camry with two fewer doors. (What a car it
would be if it had three, a la Saturn!)
</P>
<P>
   Camry has been described here frequently as boring _ and I mean
that in the best possible way. There are no surprises with Camry,
no opportunities to make new friends while awaiting a tow or a jump
start. There is no excitement, no thrill of sudden oversteer or
understeer, no adrenaline rush as a Camry fails to proceed through
a unfamiliar neighborhood after dark or home from a snow-encrusted
parking lot. With all due respect, Mr. Toyoda, you build a boring
car. People tend to value that sort of boring.
</P>
<P>
   Solara has at once all of that boring built into it and less of
it. It can be expected to perform in the Camry manner _ it is,
after all, a Camry with fancy moniker _ and yet it is more
interesting to drive than its sibling sedan. The tested Solara
seemed a bit crisper in the handling department than the Camry
sedans _ perhaps this is imagination born of its sportier
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The tested SE model arrived with the 2.995-liter, four-cam, 200
horsepower (slightly less in California) V6 under the hood and a
4-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed manual is available with
either the V6 or the base 2.164-liter I4 engine. The SE V6 is the
middle-of-the-road model (a figure of speech, please) with a
$21,998 price tag and a $420 destination charge. A base 4-cylinder
SE with manual gearbox is $18,638, plus destination, and the
top-of-the-line SLE Solara is $24,988 plus.
</P>
<P>
   The tested SE was equipped with a few options, including the
$250 side air bags, $900 power moonroof, $550 antilock brakes, $300
traction control, and a few other bits. In the columnist's humble
opinion, ABS and traction control are musts, should be standard on
the car. A moonroof is nice, but detracts from the headroom
somewhat (and why is it a Power Tilt/Slide Moonroof on Camry and
Camry Solara but a Power Tilt/Slide Sunroof on a Celica?). The
writer is undecided on the Toyota side air bags but leaning in
their direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Solara feels quick _ can it really be significantly quicker
than its sedan sibling? Not likely, but style can change one's
perceptions. The suspension does feel different, tauter, yet no
less forgiving of road roughness than in the Camry four-doors.
Solara is a car for that customer who craves the boring solidity,
the reputation, the peace of mind of the Camry _ but who needs
something sportier to feed the sense of image. Solara fills the
bill nicely, just sporty enough to please the mildly adventuresome
but not so testosterone-soaked as to put off those who view
themselves as the sensible center.
</P>
<P>
   Solara may have a sunny name, a moniker that conjures up visions
of summer sun and desert driving, but this little coupe has the
right stuff for winter touring. With hard-packed snow abuilding on
the road and snow blowing all around, the Solara crusied with the
traffic easily. It was capable of faster speed with less difficulty
than most others on the road, it seemed, but there's nothing to be
gained being aggressive in the snow _ and plenty to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the back roads and ice-encrusted byways of rural Maine,
Solara bumped right aslong, taking the ruts and rough in stride,
transmitting little to the driver _ until the dirty stretch, of
course. Dirt roads in winter are washboards at best, nightmares at
worst, encouragement for chiropractors all the time. Camry Solara
softened the blows considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Good car _ very good car _ but not perfect. The major complaint
is the trunk. It's roomy enough, but the opening is smallish and
there is a high sill; lifting heavy stuff over that sill is not for
the faint of spine or the old and weak. The 60/40 split rear seats
fold to increase cargo space. Interior storage is a mixed bag; the
glove box is small, augmented by a deep covered storage bin between
the seats, narrow door bins, and pockets in the front seat backs.
</P>
<P>
   Performance is very good _ Solara accelerates with zip and
passes with pep _ yet fuel mileage is good. The 4-banger with
automatic is EPA rated 23 miles per gallon city, 30 highway (23/32
highway with manual) and the V6 is rated 20/28 with the tested
automatic (21/28 with manual). The tested Solara delivered 24.06
overall with varying loads over varying roads in widely varying
weather conditions over 750 miles charted.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, if you like coupes, Solara is a dandy. There's some
room in the rear and from the passenger side, the old and weak can
make it in _ the front seat shoots forward and tilts to offer room
for ingress. The coupe is still not this driver's cup of tea, but
the Solara worked well, gets high marks _ a definite thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under unfinished buiness is Protege mileage. Assistant sports
editor Bill Griffith delivered the verdict on this small Mazda
sedan, but other members of the jury were in possession of the
mileage evidence. The little sleeper from Mazda (essentially
similar to Ford Escort) delivered an impressive 27.26 miles per
gallon over 565 miles charted. So now you know.

KIRK FRANKLIN HAS FAITH IN HIS ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without being rude, Kirk Franklin states that he's not going to
read this story. ``I stay away as much as I can from my press,
because I don't want to build any ego,'' says the gospel artist,
who is becoming a superstar whether he likes it or not. ``I stay
around people who don't let me get a big head. The most important
message is faith _ and that faith has to be a lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin believes in Christian faith _ and presenting that faith
in a contemporary, rap-and-funk-stoked manner that has made him the
hottest gospel act around. No gospel album had ever sold more than
a million copies until Franklin came along, yet he has had three of
them within five years, including 2.5 million sales for 1996's
``God's Property from Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He's up for four Grammy awards, including song of the year
(the first time a gospel act has earned that nomination) for ``Lean
on Me.'' The tune features backing from U2's Bono, R. Kelly, and
Mary J. Blige; and its proceeds _ now $250,000 _ are going to help
rebuild burned churches in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very serious about my faith. If I wasn't, I'd be doing
another kind of music,'' says Franklin, 28. ``I'm a Christian and a
very committed one. I'm not afraid to talk about Jesus, even though
this is a society built on science, and religion doesn't have much
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's music has been called ``hip-hop gospel,'' though he
deflects personal attention if you call him a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only one doing it,'' he says from a tour stop in
Baltimore. ``There are a whole bunch of cats out there. You've got
the Winans and you've got Commission and the Gospel Gangstas. And a
young one named Tone X. There's a lot of talented cats out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who has been a choir director since age 11, shares
singing and rapping duties with choir members. The result is music
reaching young people in unprecedented numbers for a gospel act,
though it also provokes heat from some traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're threatened by what I do. I just think
they don't understand it,'' Franklin says. ``A lot of them feel
that I'm making it too worldly and not spiritual enough. I don't
have an answer for that. I don't even entertain it.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why he is not too keen on church politics.
``I'm not big on a whole bunch of rules that man has put together,
you know what I'm saying? I'm down with the Book and I'm down with
the church, but not down with all the political stuff that has
gotten mixed up with organized religions. You know, all the stuff
from these right-wing activists that lobby for certain things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, there are people out there who are hurt and
broken; and people who need to know how to make it to heaven,''
adds Franklin, who grew up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. ``People
need to know that Jesus will help _ and that we need to help each
other in the spirit of love, you know what I'm saying? That's what
I'm down for _ the spirit of love and not condemning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind you, as a Christian, I do have my beliefs. I do believe
there are some things that are right and some that are wrong, but
it's all in the spirit of how you preach them. It's got to be in
the spirit of love. It can't be any spirit that comes across as
`I'm better than you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, is there any particular Christian faith he believes in?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Christian,'' he repeats. ``All the rest of the stuff is
negative, because that's separation. I mean, how is it that one man
can die, and after that one death and resurrection, you've got
about 5 billion interpretations of it? You've got Methodist,
Lutheran, Apostolic, and many others, you know? I'm not condemning
anybody, but we're making it entirely too difficult to get it. . .
. It's too confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can a person do?
</P>
<P>
   ``You read your Bible and you live right,'' says Franklin.
``That's what you do. And what you also do is find a church that's
good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many gospel performers, Franklin didn't always live right.
``I was into drugs and premarital sex and staying up all night
partying and smoking weed. I was doing that growing up,'' he
admits. ``But it's a mistake for Christians to not share these
things from their past. Some people just see the holy roller side
and that drives them away from the faith. It's like, `Man, you
know, there's no way I can be like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Franklin is no stranger to the secular side of life,
either. As a child, he loved the sounds of the '70s, listening to
James Brown, Zapp, Con Funk Shun, Grandmaster Flash, Bootsy
Collins, George Clinton, and Stevie Wonder _ all of whose
influences weave into his often high-energy sound.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some gospel acts, however, Franklin never wanted to
pursue a secular pop career. ``I've been doing gospel music all my
life. I never had a desire to do any other style.''
</P>
<P>
   His music has crossed over nonetheless. He first exploded
nationally with the 1993 album ``Kirk Franklin and the Family,''
followed by 1995's ``Whatcha Lookin' 4.'' Then he truly hit the
star ranks with 1997's hit song, ``Stomp,'' which won major play on
MTV and many urban radio stations as well as gospel outlets. (The
album whence it came, ``God's Property from Kirk Franklin's Nu
Nation,'' went to No. 3 on Billboard's pop chart and won a Grammy
for best gospel album by a choir or chorus.)
</P>
<P>
   Is he impressed about the four Grammy nominations _ including
contemporary soul gospel for his latest album, ``The Nu Nation
Project''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not going to say I'm not impressed, because I don't
want to belittle the Grammys. I'm grateful and appreciative,'' he
says. ``But I don't want to deal with the arrogance if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   The only glitch in his magical rise is a recent lawsuit filed
against him and his record label, GospoCentric Records, and several
employees of the label and the distributor, Interscope Records. In
the suit, Linda Searlight, a Dallas woman who helped form the God's
Property choir, says they conspired against her and denied her
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that gospel had to be put in a situation like
that,'' says Franklin, who denies the accusation. ``I think it's
very sad that people's differences of opinion had to get put into
the legal system. For me or for anybody else involved, I just want
what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Franklin, who also has three young children,
says he's taking life one day at a time. ``I'm trying to keep the
tour going and keep my spirit going, and trying to be the best
husband on the planet and the best father. And everything else is
fluff.''

CONSUMERS UNION FINDS OEM PARTS ARE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, you may have heard rumblings about OEM vs.
aftermarket crash parts _ you probably wondered what they were
rumbling about.
</P>
<P>
   OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer and means a part
made for your car by the company that made your car or made the
parts for the company that assembled your car. Aftermarket means
everybody else who makes pieces for your automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups from time to time mount campaigns to focus
public attention on the need for OEM parts. Since these efforts are
heartily endorsed by car manufacturers who have a vested interest
in widespread use of OEM parts, public confidence in the validity
of these consumer efforts is easily undermined _ especially by
insurance companies prattling about ``saving consumers money'' and
aftermarket lobbyists insisting that their parts are just as good,
only less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermarket, we have been led to believe, covers a wide spectrum
of quality ranging from just as good or better than OEM to not as
good. So what's the scoop here? If your car is damaged in a
collision, do you fight the insurance company to use OEM or do you
accept the less expensive alternative and avoid the hassle? Well,
Bunky, it would seem the best advice is embodied in an old football
song _ fight, fight, fight.
</P>
<P>
   The premier consumer watchdog, Consumers Union, has investigated
the pros and cons in its usual thoroughly analytical way and
published the despairing truth of it in its magazine, Consumer
Reports. The truth? Aftermarket parts are frequently inferior to a
woeful degree and the only one saving money on the deal isn't the
consumer _ it's the insurer. Cost savings from the lower-price
parts are not passed on to the consumer, CU finds.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem with the aftermarket crash parts is two-fold:
They usually don't fit and they don't stand up in ordinary use. CU
found that the aftermarket stuff was prone to corrosion, frequently
didn't match the original, frequently resulted in an inferior
repair.
</P>
<P>
   To test the hypothesis that aftermarket is as good as OEM, CU
took two popular automobiles, a Ford Taurus and a Honda Accord, and
went shopping for common replacments for crash-damaged parts to be
installed. CU also did extensive interviewing of repair
professionals. The vedict: There's a lot of junk out there and it's
very difficult for the consumer to know if he or she is getting a
quality repair part or a shoddy imitation from a pushcart across
the Pacific. It's not chump change, either; CU says it's a $9
billion business affecting 35 million damaged autos annually.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certification program for aftermarket parts, CU says,
administered by the Certified Automotive Parts Association, a
nonprofit group founded in 1987. CAPA certifies but a small
percentage of parts, however, placing its seal on the certified
pieces. The seal, by the way, comes up as a void label if it's
removed.
</P>
<P>
   But how good a job does CAPA do in its small way? CU finds CAPA
parts aren't always good quality and the group, itself, somewhat
suspect. CAPA is quick to accuse manufacturers of having a vested
interest in OEM parts but slow to reveal that half its budget comes
from insurance companies (the rest from sale of certification
seals) and that six of nine directors are insurance industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   CAPA doesn't certify bumpers; aftermarket bumpers did miserably
in CU's bumper-basher tests, faring much worse than OEM bumpers. CU
routinely bashes bumpers in its auto evaluation program for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Repairers claim that aftermarket parts don't fit up to 70
percent of the time and frequently can't be made to fit and must be
rejected _ time-consuming, and time is money.
</P>
<P>
   Foisting the imitation parts on the consumer, CU concludes,
merely transfers the cash flow from the auto manufacturers to the
insurance companies and doesn't benefit the consumer. And adjusters
are not always forthcoming about the decision to repair with
pushcart parts.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Think about replacement parts when you're buying
insurance, CU says. Get it up front and in writing that you are
entitled to OEM pieces for your car after an accident. Shop and
compare insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Think twice before using aftermarket parts, CU advises. Although
it is cleaerly in the interest of the consumer to use less
expensive parts on a quality par with OEM, there's no guarantee
that's what you'll be getting. Don't surrender haggling rights, CU
advises. According to a CU survey, 71 percent of those who insisted
on OEM parts got the OK from their insurers. If you don't ask, you
won't get.
</P>
<P>
   And you might think about used parts, hard to find sometimes,
but recycling yards offer good value, and it makes environmental
sense to patronize them.
</P>

THE WORLD REINTRODUCES SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR TO THE FRENCH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ This is where Simone de Beauvoir lived and loved,
marched and wrote, so Paris is the natural place for scholars to
gather to start celebrating the 50th anniversary of her seminal
feminist book, ``The Second Sex.'' For four days here last week,
they debated Beauvoir with a mixture of joy and reverence, and at
the end, their unsurprising conclusion was that ``The Second Sex''
was as topical and worthy of study as ever.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps more pressing reason to raise Beauvoir's voice here
was that 13 years after her death, she is still not a prophet in
her own country. In the United States, for instance, she is a
feminist icon whose complex, contradictory and passionate life
continues to fascinate readers of her letters or of biographies
about her. Beauvoir is widely studied in Britain, too, while new
translations of ``The Second Sex'' regularly appear, most recently
in Russian, Bulgarian, Hindi and Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in France, she was overshadowed _ she even wanted to be
overshadowed _ by her companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, whose
intellectual influence has waned. As a feminist in her own right,
she has not prospered here either. Women's studies have never
caught on in French universities, and women fighting for equality
in France today avoid calling themselves feminists for fear of
being mocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we have had to preface our remarks with, `I am not
a feminist but . . .,''' explained one French campaigner for
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's two organizers, Christine Delphy and Sylvie
Chaperon, were reminded of French indifference to Beauvoir when
they tried to raise money for the gathering. ``The Culture Ministry
finally came up with some money, but at first we were treated with
contempt,'' Ms. Delphy, a sociology researcher, said. ``Someone _ I
won't say who _ said, `Who cares about Beauvoir?' They said she was
passe. They are probably unhappy the conference was a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two organizers felt some progress had been made in
drawing French attention to Beauvoir. ``We achieved some
visibility, thanks to articles in Le Monde and Liberation,'' Ms.
Delphy said. ``We also succeeded in getting everyone to stop
talking about Beauvoir's private life and to focus on her work.''
Ms. Chaperon, a history professor, added: ``We wanted to show the
French the extent of Beauvoir studies around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, they succeeded. No fewer than 140 scholars from
31 countries presented summaries of research into Beauvoir and
``The Second Sex.'' American academics made up the largest national
contingent, but participants also came from as far away as
Australia and Japan, Brazil and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of plenary sessions and workshops ranged from
Beauvoir in the history of ideas to ``The Second Sex'' and
Communists, to contemporary feminist debates, to lesbianism in
``The Second Sex,'' to the different national reactions to
publication of the book (in France, its central idea, ``One is not
born, but rather becomes a woman,'' was considered pure subversion,
and in Iran the book is still banned). The approach was almost
entirely academic, with far more debate about the philosophical
roots of Beauvoir's work than about her impact on feminist
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's studies are very much part of the academic world,''
explained Kate Fulbrook, who teaches at the University of the West
of England in Bristol. ``They are not very linked to political
activity.'' Margeret Simons, director of women's studies at
Southern Illinois University at Edwardville, agreed. ``In America,
the focus is more on Beauvoir's ethics than her politics,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The main French contribution came from women who knew and worked
alongside Beauvoir _ or ``Castor,'' to use her nickname _ during
the women's movement of the 1970s. Their addresses were tinged with
nostalgia; some even spoke of Beauvoir in the present tense, as if
she, too, were attending the meeting, as they remembered the aging
writer's active role in the campaign for legalization of abortion
here in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was both radical and practical,'' recalled Anne Zelinsky,
who now heads the League of the Rights of Women, which Beauvoir
helped to found. Yvette Roudy, who was France's first Minister of
Women's Rights in the early 1980s, recalled that Beauvoir threw her
weight behind the campaign against sexist legislation. Claudine
Montiel, who now works in the French government, spoke of
Beauvoir's involvement in a campaign to allow single mothers to
remain at school.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Delphy cautioned that for young French women today,
these battles took place ``at the time of the Neanderthals.'' ``We
have a duty to keep alive these memories,'' she told the
conference, ``because the absence of memory condemns us to
repetition. Today, we are repeating what was said in 1970. What
worries me is that the next generation will have to start from
scratch, as we did in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Delphy's concern seems to be substantiated by the falling
sales in France of ``The Second Sex,'' from 31,296 in 1978, to
17,377 in 1988, to 8,390 in 1998, according to the book's publisher
Editions Gallimard (the Vintage paperback edition of the book sold
around 10,000 copies in the United States last year).
</P>
<P>
   Feminist activists may see further cause for alarm in the way
Beauvoir is now studied in American and Northern European
universities: today, she is seen more as philosopher than
revolutionary, while ``The Second Sex'' is read more as an academic
text than a call to arms.

POPE JOHN PAUL VISITS AN OLD FRIEND: MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II loves Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it reminds him of his native Poland, also overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic, suffering from social and economic privations and
surrounded by world powers that have sometimes invaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you, Mexico,'' John Paul told adoring Mexicans at
Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City on Tuesday as he
departed that city after a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Tears were in the eyes of his followers. Some probably thought
they were seeing John Paul in person for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Although we in this country have focused our attention on John
Paul's visit to St. Louis on Tuesday and Wednesday, his journey to
Mexico was filled with significance.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pontiff spent parts of four days in Mexico,
speaking to perhaps 1 million people at a Mass held at a race
track. He visited the aged and the sick. He kissed children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the heartbeat of the Mexican people,'' John Paul
declared during the farewell address at the airport. An English
translation of his speech was provided by Eternal Word Television
Network, the Catholic television station of Mother Angelica, which
provided live coverage of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul spoke out against drug trafficking and called for
assistance to the homeless, the old and the unemployed during the
Mexico trip. He urged fair treatment of minority Indian groups.
</P>
<P>
   The aging pontiff also saluted Mexicans who warmly received him
in 1979 on his first overseas trip, the beginning of 85 official
papal journeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is a great country rooted in the Christian faith,'' he
said. ``I felt that here on my first trip at the beginning of my
Petrine ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   His first action in Mexico was to sign a major church document
calling for Catholics in North, Central and South America to work
together in a ``new evangelization.'' It was a response to goals
put forward by bishops of the Americas, who held a synod in Rome in
1997 to ponder goals for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why John Paul visits the Americas. More
than 500 million of the world's 1 billion Catholics are in North,
Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his first trip to Mexico, John Paul sought to shore
up the Catholic faith there. He is concerned about many Catholics
converting to Pentecostal or other evangelical Protestant faiths.
Still, polls show that 95 percent of Mexico's 96 million people
identify with the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul sat with his eyes closed at the airport, perhaps
concentrating on the Spanish language of Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo as he thanked the pope for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Although concerned about the loss of Catholics, John Paul
admirably spoke up for religious freedom in Mexico, calling it a
fundamental right in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   TV coverage showed John Paul's left hand trembling slightly. But
he was firm in his speech as he repeated the phrase ``God bless
you, Mexico'' several times in his last address in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is still spiritually strong. And he is not physically
decrepit, as he showed the Mexicans. He brushed away assistance
and, carrying a cane, climbed the stairs of a Mexicana jet that was
waiting to take him to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The final action of his visit to Mexico was to greet several
Catholic schoolchildren dressed in red-and-white school uniforms.
He smiled warmly when one girl gave him a bouquet of yellow roses
and kissed him on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul again showed his devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe,
the patroness of the Americas, whose image is believed to have been
stamped on the blanket of a Mexican peasant named Juan Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The pope prayed before the Virgin's image at the Basilica of Our
Lady of Guadalupe outside Mexico City. And he spoke directly to her
in the airport address, calling her ``Mexico's mother.'' And he
asked for her protection over the United States and the other
nations of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgin of Guadalupe, watch over this whole beloved American
continent,'' he said.

FIRST MAJOR AMERICAN PRESENTATION OF MODERN MASTERS OPENS SUNDAY AT
KIMBELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ It could be the most important show in the Kimbell
Art Museum's history _ an exhibit of more than 100 paintings,
drawings and sculptures by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sunday, ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry,'' will
be the first major American museum presentation of works by the
century's most acclaimed masters of modern art. New York's Museum
of Modern Art is organizing another exhibit of the two artists'
work, but it will not open until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you were surveying baseball in the 20th century and
picked the two greatest sluggers for an exhibition game,'' said New
York art historian and critic Leo Steinberg, who will be in Fort
Worth for the exhibition opening. ``Here we are at the end of the
century, dealing with two great masters who are recognized as the
twin peaks in their field. This is an opportunity to unlock the
work of each to a greater extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matisse-Picasso museum show is the first since 1945-46, when
London's Victoria and Albert Museum mounted an impromptu display of
55 paintings that toured to four other European cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell exhibition, however, will be the only time that
Matisse and Picasso works have been shown under the auspices of a
scholarly thesis. This one examines the artists' intense
interaction during the later stages of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of the century, they vied for pre-eminence
in the world of modern art. From about 1930 on, however, their
mutual respect grew and they started sharing ideas and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse and Picasso'' is the latest in a string of
internationally acclaimed Kimbell-organized presentations, from a
groundbreaking 1986 survey of Maya art to the 1997 ``Monet and the
Mediterannean,'' which drew 338,000 visitors to the Kimbell and was
among the world's top-attended shows that year.
</P>
<P>
   As with a number of those exhibitions, ``Matisse and Picasso''
will be shown only in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the 20th century, Picasso and Matisse, I think,
are it,'' Kimbell director Timothy Potts said. ``This exhibition
encompasses so many of the elements of our visual culture that we
now take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the show has compelling human interest, Potts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people, Matisse and Picasso are two icons, so great
and important as to simply be revered. But here we see that they
also may be understood in very human terms and that their art, and
the ways in which it came into being, also may be understood in
human terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen whether ``Matisse and Picasso: A
Gentle Rivalry,'' which runs through May 2, will rival other
popular Kimbell shows in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's best-attended show _ the 1994 presentation of
pictures from the Barnes Foundation, which attracted 400,000
visitors _ is a dubious corollary: By the time it reached Fort
Worth, ``Masterpieces from the Barnes Collection'' was an
international phenomenon, and much of its record-setting attendance
can be attributed to its five-month run and its taking place during
peak tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renoir's Portraits,'' whose early 1998 run compares in
duration and timing with ``Matisse and Picasso,'' attracting
208,000 patrons, is a more telling fit, said Kimbell assistant
director Wendy Gottlieb. Advance ticket sales for Matisse-Picasso
compare favorably with Renoir, as do bookings for group tours from
around the state, nation and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse and Picasso'' is also part of Fort Worth's 1999
marketing campaign to American and foreign tourists and is being
publicized in magazine advertisements, direct-mail brochures and on
the Internet. The show is on the February cover of the major
international art journal Artforum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Kimbell is doing is very exciting,'' Artforum editor
Jack Bankowsky said. Exhibition curator Yve-Alain Bois ``is one of
the most significant art historians working today and we pay close
attention to all of his work. The exhibition will tell us a lot
about how art gets made and it will attract a real international
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matisse and Picasso'' was first discussed four years ago by
the museum's chief curator at the time, Joachim Pissarro; and its
then-director, Ted Pillsbury. They approached Bois, a Harvard
University art historian, about serving as guest curator.
</P>
<P>
   Bois suggested that the show focus on the later stages of each
artist's career. The early rivalry, from about 1907 to 1917,
already was relatively well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Kimbell team learned that London's Tate Gallery, two
museums in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art had allied to produce
a Picasso-Matisse for 2002. The museums plan to feature about 175
works and span both artists' careers.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbell curators wondered if their show could stand on its own
merit. After further research and consideration, they decided it
could.
</P>
<P>
   Then came another challenge: Pissarro and Pillsbury left the
Kimbell in mid-1997 and mid-1998, respectively, leaving the museum
without a staff liaison for the exhibition for five crucial months
before Potts' arrival in November. Kimbell trustees, however, voted
to continue with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an optimist and thought the crisis would solve itself,''
Bois said, ``so I continued writing my book and working on loans
for the exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   The show features both iconic and unknown artworks from museums
and private collections in Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Russia,
the United States and France _ including the Pompidou Center and
the Picasso Museum in Paris, both of which are participating in the
2002 exhibition.

NOT SO FLY (FOR THIS WHITE GUY)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent wintry morning, walking a desolate strip
of Flatbush Avenue in downtown Brooklyn, I heard a baritone voice
growl my name, followed by an emphatic, ``Yo! What's the deal?''
The menacing bark emanated from the driver's side of a passing
Mercury Sable, the tinted window of which was now rapidly
descending.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I soon saw that the grimace and hard glare,
half-concealed under a jet-black Fubu baseball hat, belonged to my
good friend Justice. His look of mock anger dissolved into a broad
smile, gold cap gleaming in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   A hulking construction worker and hip-hop clotheshorse, Justice
was going on one of his marathon shopping sprees, and invited me
along.
</P>
<P>
   En route to a Costco in Sunset Park, I took in the impressive
effect of his urban uniform du jour. He was, as he put it, ``Fubu'd
out to the max.'' Not just the ball cap, but the black satin Fubu
baseball jacket and the baggy, prefaded Fubu jeans, impeccably
pressed and cuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be kind of hard for a white guy to pull off that look,''
I told him with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Justice countered, ``a lot of white people are rockin'
Fubu right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be so, but I knew I would never attempt Justice's Fubu
flush. Although I've dabbled in hip-hop fashion over the years,
it's always been with some uneasiness. Street trends change so
quickly, they're hard for an outsider to keep track of. Even the
letters of the Fubu logo are an acronym of exclusion: ``For Us, By
Us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a white, rap-music-obsessed journalist based in Manhattan, I
have spent much of the last decade traveling through the city's
hip-hop underground. For several years in the mid 1990s, much to my
amazement, I found myself moonlighting as the de facto manager for
an aspiring rapper called Big K.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the first night we met, in the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
on the Lower East Side, Big K would howl at my lack of street
panache _ the way I'd allow my sneakers to get scuffed up and
filthy (he'd clean his nightly with a toothbrush, and moisturize
the leather with Jergen's hand cream), the way my baseball caps
were sweat-stained and shapeless (his collection of some 50 ball
caps remained, miraculously, virginal).
</P>
<P>
   How could I possibly be his right-hand man, K would loudly
wonder, if I insisted on dressing like such a cornball?
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of guys like Big K and Justice _ my bedroom
closet has become a veritable archive of failed hip-hop fashion
experiments. There's the black quilted zip-front hunting vest,
street chic on rap groups like Naughty by Nature, but an accessory
that tends to make a diminutive Jewish male, like me, resemble
Chico Marx on an ice-fishing expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Or my black Kangol Spitfire cap, which when spun backward _ and
worn beret style, a la Samuel L. Jackson _ makes me look about as
tough as one of the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the pair of burgundy suede ``British walker''
loafers that Big K gave me two winters back, no doubt the strangest
Hanukkah gift I've ever received. On K, as on countless other
Brooklyn ``rudeboys'' (the West Indian variant of homeboy), the
crepe-soled shoes available in myriad shades, including hot yellow,
have long been a hallmark of a tough streetwise fashion.
</P>
<P>
   On me, however, they were eerily reminiscent of those hated Hush
Puppies that would have earned any seventh grader a strafing of
noogies on his way out of homeroom.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the ascendancy of black-owned, black-oriented clothiers
like Fubu, Shabazz Brothers, Pure Playaz and Mecca that's given me
the most pause. Yes, it's true, as my friend Justice noted, that a
lot of white people are rockin' Fubu today.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in Women's Wear Daily recently proclaimed ``Fubu's
Move to the Suburbs.'' But can a white consumer really get away
with wearing a product designed and marketed by a youthful
African-American company whose very name is a rallying cry of
racial solidarity and economic empowerment?
</P>
<P>
   In the hit video ``Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)'' by the
alternative band the Offspring, a white hip-hop wannabe is seen
flashing ersatz gang signs and making a foolish attempt at break
dancing while dressed in a powder blue Fubu football jersey. Fubu
merchandise should come with a warning label: ``Can backfire with
humiliating consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And there are many other fashion hazards out there in the
streets. Regional distinctions and subtleties abound. These days,
for instance, the Brooklyn hip-hop demimonde is riven by
fashion-related isms and schisms.
</P>
<P>
   There's the so-called Big Willie look (flashy designer labels),
popularized by the late Notorious B.I.G., in sharp contrast to the
``roughneck'' gear (camouflage and boots) of rappers like Jeru the
Damaja, Buckshot and M.O.P.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with many of the leading rappers hitting their 30s, a
more conservative, GQ-influenced hip-hop style is emerging, even in
the streets of Brooklyn. Witness the basic-black wiseguy ensemble
sported by Jay-Z, a rapper from Brooklyn, on the cover of his
chart-topping CD, ``Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life.''
</P>
<P>
   He appears in a black four-button blazer over black cashmere
sports shirt, buttoned to the neck. Diamond pinky ring optional.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hip-hop fashion is a big tent, encompassing both the
flamboyant matador-on-speed get-ups of Busta Rhymes and the
understated, surburban-friendly T-shirts and baggy khakis of the XL
boutiques owned by Mike D of the Beastie Boys. Hip-hop runs through
so many trends you never know what will turn up next.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, it seemed that even my own personal style (I
grew up in Western Canada) had come into vogue during the great
hip-hop hockey jersey craze, when rap superstars like Snoop Doggy
Dogg had, for inexplicable reasons, fallen in love with the
regulation National Hockey League uniforms of the Toronto Maple
Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping through fashion spreads in Vibe and the Source, I was
bemused but delighted: my northern compatriots, suddenly and
unwittingly, had become the height of homeboy fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the hip-hop-hockey nexus was short lived. By the time I
dusted off my vintage Rangers jersey to accompany Big K to a rap
showcase downtown, I felt myself the object of countless smirks and
glares.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the ineffable element of all street fashion:
attitude. Snoop can sport a regulation NHL jersey without being
taken for a gap-toothed Canadian on skates, just as he can adorn
his braids with baby-girl baubles or colorful rubber bands without
looking like a long-missing member of Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   Attitude seems to have no strict correlation with age, class, or
even ethnicity. My friend Jack, an Ivy League-trained clinical
psychologist _ like me, in his early 30s _ counsels hospital
patients by day and is a devotee of the downtown drum-and-bass
scene by night.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding his suit and tie, he opts for the ultra-baggy jeans and
exotic skateboarding sneakers that are de rigueur in such
after-hours spots as Jungle Nation.
</P>
<P>
   One night last summer, as we were heading out to a club, Jack
insisted that I try on his latest accessory: a tan-colored Eddie
Bauer fishing cap. On him, the soft cloth hat was either old-school
hip-hop or new-school drum-and-bass. But on me, I realized, the
droopy cap made an even bolder statement: Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the new year (and my wife's repeated requests
that I start dressing like a grown-up), I've resolved to do away
with all such overreaching attempts at youth-culture fashion.
</P>
<P>
   I'll still head out on my regular shopping runs with Justice,
and I may try on some of the more mature outfits at Phat Farm. But
the next time I throw on my vintage hockey jersey, I'll be sitting
in the icy glow of the MSG Network, rooting for Gretzky and the
other Ranger old timers.

AS ANTHOLOGIES DUEL, WOMEN GAIN GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By JOYCE JENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first stone in the war between Longman and W.W. Norton, the
David and Goliath of the anthology publishing world, has been cast.
With the recent publication of ``The Longman Anthology of British
Literature,'' Longman has mounted a challenge to Norton to become
the literary anthology of choice in colleges and universities
around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' has been dominant
in the field for 36 years. The Longman anthology, published by
Addison Wesley Longman, has been five years in the making and is
the first major all-new anthology in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-volume, 6,000-page text features more women than
Norton's current edition and places British literature in the
context of history, culture and politics. (The poetry of William
Butler Yeats, for example, is featured together with speeches on
Irish independence.) About 250 colleges and universities have
signed up to use the Longman text, and this figure is expected to
grow by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's two-volume, 5,200-page anthology, which it considers
its flagship, is used in about 1,500 colleges and universities. The
current edition features 36 women out of more than 200 writers,
including the complete ``Oroonoko,'' a story of a slave's
experiences on a sugar plantation in Suriname by the 17th-century
writer Aphra Behn, and ``A Room of One's Own'' by Virginia Woolf in
its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Norton is revising its text for a seventh edition, to be
published in the fall, in which women's writing, 20th-century
literature and cultural and thematic ``Issues'' clusters will be
expanded. Seamus Heaney's new verse translation of ``Beowulf'' will
also be featured.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, both anthologies include the same
writers and cover the same material. There are some unexpected
nuggets, though, hidden among the expected offerings. Here are a
few.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
</P>
<P>
   1797-1851
</P>
<P>
   Norton features Mary Shelley's ``Introduction to Frankenstein,''
Longman the complete ``Frankenstein'' text. Norton offers
``Transformation,'' a tale based on the theme of the split
personality. Longman includes entries from her journal.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts, from March 1815, concern her baby
daughter, born two months premature on Feb. 22. On Monday, March 6,
she found the baby dead and wrote to Thomas Jefferson Hogg, a close
friend:
</P>
<P>
   ``My dearest Hogg, my baby is dead _ will you come to me as soon
as you can. ... It was perfectly well when I went to bed _ I awoke
in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping quietly
that I would not awake it _ it was dead then but we did not find
that out till morning.''
</P>
<P>
   From her journal:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday 9th. Read &AMP; talk _ still think about my little baby _
'tis hard indeed for a mother to lose a child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday 19th. Dream that my little baby came to life again _
that it had only been cold &AMP; that that we rubbed it by the fire &AMP;
it lived _ I awake &AMP; find no baby _ I think about the little thing
all day _ not in good spirits _ Shelley is very unwell.'' (Her
husband was Percy Bysshe Shelley.)
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wordsworth
</P>
<P>
   1771-1855
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wordsworth, sister of William Wordsworth, has recently
been acknowledged as a writer in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   Both anthologies include excerpts from the journals she kept at
Grasmere in the Lake District, where she and William settled in
1799 and remained together for the rest of their lives. Norton
includes an excerpt from her journal written in Alfoxten, where she
and William had moved in 1797 to be near Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
</P>
<P>
   Longman's new edition also includes a selection of her poetry
and her letters.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to her close friend Lady Beaumont, dated April 20,
1806, she expressed her feelings about writing. ``Those two little
things'' are two of her poems that William had read to Lady
Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly glad that my Brother's manuscript poems give you so
much pleasure. ... Do not think that I was ever bold enough to hope
to compose verses for the pleasure of grown-up persons ... even if
I had the gift of language and numbers, that I could have the
vanity to suppose could be of any use beyond our own fireside, or
to please, as in your case. ... But I have no command of language,
no power of expressing my ideas. ... As to those two little things
which I did write, I was very unwilling to place them beside my
Brother's poems, but he insisted upon it, and I was obliged to
submit; and though you have been pleased with them, I cannot but
think that was chiefly owing to the spirit which William gave them
in the reading and to your kindness for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Heaney
</P>
<P>
   Born 1939
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Heaney, the Irish poet and Nobel laureate, is represented
in the Longman anthology with ``Feeling into Words,'' a lecture
given at the Royal Society of Literature in October 1974 in which
he offered his views on writing.
</P>
<P>
   Norton includes several Heaney poems, among them ``Digging,''
his first major poem, excerpted here:
</P>
<P>
   ``Between my finger and my thumb
</P>
<P>
   The squat pen rests; snug as a gun
</P>
<P>
   Under my window, a clean rasping sound
</P>
<P>
   When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
</P>
<P>
   My father, digging ...
</P>
<P>
   By God, the old man could handle a spade,
</P>
<P>
   Just like his old man.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather cut more turf in a day
</P>
<P>
   Than any other man on Toner's bog. ...
</P>
<P>
   Over his shoulder, going down and down
</P>
<P>
   For the good turf. Digging.
</P>
<P>
   Between my finger and my thumb
</P>
<P>
   The squat pen rests.
</P>
<P>
   I'll dig with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronte Sisters
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte 1816-1855
</P>
<P>
   Emily 1818-1848
</P>
<P>
   Anne 1820-1849
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the anthologies chose different sisters. Longman
selected an excerpt from Charlotte's ``Jane Eyre'' and an excerpt
from Anne's ``Agnes Grey.'' Norton went with Emily but bypassed
``Wuthering Heights'' in favor of her less well-known poetry. An
excerpt from ``The Prisoner: A Fragment'' by Emily:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less;
</P>
<P>
   The more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless;
</P>
<P>
   And robed in fires of Hell, or bright with heavenly shine,
</P>
<P>
   If it but herald Death, the vision is divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Crashaw
</P>
<P>
   Circa 1613-1649
</P>
<P>
   Richard Crashaw was a religious poet devoted to ritual and
ceremony, and he fled from the Puritans to embrace Roman
Catholicism. Although both Norton and Longman include Crashaw's
``Non Vi'' (``Not by Force'') and ``To the Noblest and Best of
Ladies, the Countess of Denbigh,'' Norton features additional ones,
including ``The Flaming Heart,'' about St. Teresa of Avila, a
16th-century Spanish mystic Counter-Reformation figure. An excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave her alone the Flaming Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Leave her that, and thou shalt leave her
</P>
<P>
   Not one loose shaft, but love's whole quiver,
</P>
<P>
   For in love's field was never found
</P>
<P>
   A nobler weapon than a wound.''

 SUSAN CIANCIOLO'S DO-IT-YOURSELF FASHION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My favorite Susan Cianciolo dress is called a Change
dress. It is made of muslin and has several features: a snap-on
pompom at broach level (choose a pink, yellow or blue one), a
dangly bit of crocheted string that attaches in two places and a
handy little muslin bag filled with little rectangles of fabric.
These are called snappers. You can snap them over your waist, as
the designer suggests, or wing it, snapping a corner of one, for
example, where the pompom usually goes, so that the rectangle flies
about like a little hanky on your chest.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Change dress, which costs $1,100, is too rough-looking
to be conventionally pretty _ a slash up one thigh is hand-stitched
in an awkward blanket-stitch style, a Cianciolo trademark _ but it
is appealing in a fuzzy and homespun sort of way, like a Victorian
memory box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuzzy'' and ``homespun'' are very big ideas in fashion right
now. They may be an inevitable backlash against the proliferation
of slick labels on clothes. (In a nice example, New York magazine
reported recently that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy had asked the staff
at a Prada store to remove the labels from a ski outfit that she
had purchased.)
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks you will find a lot of girlish-looking,
craft-y things in the stores for spring, innocent-looking pieces,
like the nubby crocheted ponchos with long fringes made by a
Belgian designer named Veronique Branquinho, and more decadent
ones, like the beaded, feathered and ripped jeans made by Tom Ford,
the Gucci designer, that look like the jeans you used to
personalize all by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At Ether on Prince Street next weekend, you will be able to
watch Elisa Jimenez, a New York designer represented by the Holly
Solomon Gallery (a new trend: the gallery-owner-as-fashion rep),
hand-sew her one-of-a-kind dresses (about $1,200) and G-strings
(about $150) for her coming fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, you will be able to buy Ms. Cianciolo's
clothing at retail in Manhattan for the first time. About 70
handmade pieces will be offered by the store ``in a gallery
setting, like a little exhibition,'' said Chrissie Lee, a buyer for
Barneys. (The boutique If SoHo New York, on Grand Street, will also
be carrying her things.)
</P>
<P>
   These are crossover times for Ms. Cianciolo, whose work has
heretofore been shown in galleries, including the Andrea Rosen
Gallery (on mannequins accessorized with crocheted booties and
Barbies), or in installations, including one under the West Side
Highway last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, said: ``To me, what we're seeing is a
very interesting 90s version of what we used to call Art to Wear _
that sort of knitted Woodstock/Cranbrook look. Of course, because
the fiber arts people aren't working on looms anymore, you're
getting something more conceptual, something that looks like it's
gone through the gallery system and out again, and something
related to deconstruction, which gives you that gamy look.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cianciolo has been making gamy clothes under the Run label
for more than three years and selling them by special order to
friends and fans. (The name Run has no particular significance, Ms.
Cianciolo said; she just likes the sound of it.) She was educated
in fashion and textile design at Parsons School of Design, and has
worked for the designers Badgley Mischka and for X-Girl, Kim
Gordon's cooler-than-cool clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   You will not find her clothes in ``25 Date-Pretty Looks.'' You
will find her in the March issue of Surface (a magazine devoted to
``representing the American avant-garde,'' said its co-publisher,
Riley John-donnell), along with Geoffrey Beene; the issue is
devoted to craft.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cianciolo, who is 29 and grew up in Cranston, R.I., makes
videos and fanzines with her friends and husband, Aaron Rose, the
owner of the Alleged gallery. She sells them packaged in Ziploc
plastic bags, along with her clothes, postcards of her clothes,
T-shirts and snappers, out of her Canal Street workroom. The
credits on these little art totems read like a Who's Who of a
certain Manhattan cultural nexis: there are thank-you's to and
contributions by the filmmaker Harmony Korine, the artists
Francesco Clemente and Rita Ackerman, and so forth. Certainly, the
women currently wearing Run pieces _ a passionate, devoted bunch of
buddies _ seem to represent a new sort of cultural adept.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Ok, 25, is an artist-musician-actress-model who crochets
booties and snappers for Ms. Cianciolo, models her clothes in
videos and shows and owns a closetful of Run creations. You can see
her in my favorite Run video, No. 7 ($100), narrating the features
of a denim skirt, a truly do-it-yourself item that is an enormous
size 20-ish denim skirt sold with an assortment of safety pins: use
your scissors and cut it up, if you like, and fasten with the pins.
Ms. Ok turned hers into a cape. ``Hem to desired length,'' Ms. Ok
says in the film, slicing a few inches off.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Goldwyn, 22, is a consultant to the fashion department at
Sotheby's, a collector of vintage fashions and a photographer. She
lives in a modest loft dominated by a 15-foot garment rack. On it
hang a 19th-century French peasant skirt, a Martin Margiela slip
dress and about 100 Run pieces.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that you can see what Ms. Cianciolo is up to. Clothes
that look raggedy or punk-inspired (``I know, let's rip a T-shirt
and stitch it back together!''), or merely derivative of Martin
Margiela, reveal themselves as unique and very pretty garments:
T-shirts that hug ribs like a beautiful corset; a crocheted dress
that fits Ms. Goldwyn like a second skin, pieces of it sliding on
and off in a dizzying variety of looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking about dust bunnies, and laundry lint, and the
string that hangs out of your pocket when you turn it inside out,''
Ms. Ok said, describing some of the ideas that went into the spring
collection. Past themes, Ms. Cianciolo said, have included
relationships, physics, sleep, tragedy and plant life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what's really interesting and useful about Run pieces is
that you get to rearrange them: add a snapper here, take a sleeve
off there, wrap the thing on your head. It's personal fashion,
glorious D.I.Y. _ do-it-yourself. If you ignore the art babble,
some things will never become a bore.

DIRTY DANCING: FALCONS PERFECT THE TOUCHDOWN TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 14thgraf, ``It's a, to correct quote; adds edits
thruout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It started with a little Dirty dancing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Atlanta Falcons are in the middle of a custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson would like the world to know that he
is the father of the Dirty Bird. Tight end O.J. Santiago claims
more than a little responsibility for the Dirty Bird spreading its
wings and taking flight across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Anderson said. ``I'm the originator.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago: ``I've always maintained that it's a collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago is quick to point out that his rendition of the Dirty
Bird _ complete with squawking _ is the one that started the
biggest dance craze since President Clinton took questions in front
of a grand jury. Of course, it all depends on what the meaning of
the word ``is'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is the one who unveiled the Dirty Bird touchdown dance
during a 37-15 victory against St. Louis in Game 8. Alas, an
Atlanta-St. Louis game in November is the National Football
League's answer to the Witness Protection Program. Timing, timing,
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago did the Dirty Bird the next week during a 41-10
thrashing against New England. The NFL had little choice but to
take notice at that point, because the Falcons were 7-2 and heading
for Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of went national with O.J,'' Anderson said. ``But O.J.
was like Jermaine Jackson. I'm like Michael Jackson. O.J. took us
to the point where everyone recognized us, but I took us
platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcon most likely to visit the end zone, Anderson had
the forum to spread the word of the Dirty Bird. It takes talent to
flap bent arms and high-step without looking like a reject from
``The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.'' It must, because some practitioners
make the Dirty Bird look more difficult than achieving world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of combination of Gregory Hines meets Baryshnikov,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Morten Andersen got worked up enough once to attempt the
Dirty Bird during a game. Once was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wounded bird,'' Andersen said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Falcons, the Dirty Bird isn't compelled to go South
before the winter has even started. There is a Dirty Bird Website
(dirtybirdsinc.com, started by offensive linemen Adam Schreiber and
Gene Williams) for ordering for Dirty Bird caps and Dirty Bird
T-shirts. There have been Dirty Bird sightings at the Blue-Gray
college All-Star game, and the Fiesta Bowl and at college
basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Even Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who comes from a primitive era
when players simply handed the ball to an official after a
touchdown, has done the Dirty Bird from time to time. Reeves did
the dance, sort of, after the Falcons' 30-27 upset of Minnesota in
the NFC title game. He did it again in the middle of Atlanta's
Peachtree Street, because he promised his players he would. To
avoid embarrassment or corrupting the youth of America, Reeves did
this dance just after dawn, when the street was empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People break out and do the Dirty Bird in the strangest
places,'' Anderson said. ``Somebody asked me (to do it) in the
bathroom. I'm like, `Whoa, buddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Nellie, is what Keith Jackson might have said if he had
been there for the first documented touchdown dance. University of
Houston receiver Elmo Wright changed the football world forever in
1969 when he did a dance that amounted to jogging in place.
Progress demanded that Houston Oilers receiver Billy ``White
Shoes'' Johnson, who later became a Falcon, would contribute ``The
Funky Chicken'' to NFL culture. Well, Dallas Cowboys receiver Butch
Johnson was almost obligated after that to unveil ``The California
Quake.''
</P>
<P>
   The next major breakthrough in touchdown dancing was team
choreography. Philadelphia Eagles used to gather in the end zone
and pantomime what looked like an illegal game of craps: ``Roll
Six.'' The Washington Redskins convened regularly in the end zone
for ``Fun Bunch'' celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL banned all end zone celebrations except the spike in
1984. That worked about as well as Prohibition. Ickey Woods came
along with the aptly named ``Ickey Shuffle,'' which required a
practitioner to have the coordination to walk or chew gum. Never at
the same time. Now it's not unheard of for players to acknowledge a
touchdown by breaking out in a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Give the Green Bay Packers credit for bringing athleticism to
end zone celebrations with the Lambeau Leap. Packers players would
actually leap into the stands after touchdowns. Thus inspired, the
Packers jumped to the logical conclusion that they were a Super
Bowl-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were favored last January to win a second
consecutive Super Bowl. Trouble for the Packers was, they ran into
the Denver Broncos. By the time the Broncos made it to San Diego,
they had perfected the Mile High Salute. The Broncos had been
working on it since boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of running backs got together, and we always said we
were warriors,'' Broncos running back Terrell Davis said. ``But
there was nothing catchy about warriors. We couldn't do anything
with that. We started using soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap song, ``No Limit Soldiers,'' set great Broncos minds to
thinking. And the rest is history. ``It was only fitting to do a
salute with that,'' Davis said. ``We said any time any of our
soldiers go into war _ we call each game a war _ and does anything
honorable, we give him a salute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Falcons will have to salute if the Broncos win their
second consecutive Super Bowl. The Broncos promise to be at full
attention on Sunday, ready to Mile High Salute. If the Falcons are
going to win their first Super Bowl, they're going to have to flap
their arms and do a lot of Dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new dance for the Super Bowl,'' Anderson said.
``It's a tad different. Actually, it's a lot different. Trust me.
It's a special, Around The World Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson would not provide a sneak preview, perhaps because
nobody offered any money to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, that's like somebody sneaking backstage to see
showgirls,'' Anderson said. ``You've got to wait for the game.''

TOONS- NETWORK (Los Angeles) _ You may be dimly aware that there's
a Cartoon Network, although you probably don't get it through your

of is that there's a second cartoon network that's gearing up, and
by March, it will have five animated series in its prime-time

TOONS-HARDSELL (Los Angeles) _ Even in the middle of an apparent
animation bonanza, the Big Three networks aren't the only ones who
are skittish about putting ``edgy'' animated shows on the air.
While 25-year-old wunderkinds like ``Family Guy's'' Seth MacFarlane
are getting a shot at creating the next ``Simpsons''/``King of the

 &HT;    New Orleans celebrates opening of convention center expected to
generate billions in revenue
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _The room is 25 acres, large enough for all the
National Football League teams to play in. Simultaneously. With
room for spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, the Morial Convention Center will open the final
phase of a 1.1-million-square-foot hall, the largest contiguous
exhibition space in the country. That, plus 3.1 million square feet
of total enclosed space covering more than half a mile beside the
Mississippi River, means only two convention centers are larger:
Chicago's McCormick Place and the Las Vegas Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta World Congress Center has 947,500 square feet of
exhibition space, divided on two floors. However, Atlanta, once
considered the second-largest covention center in the country, is
hoping to catch up with a $225 million expansion that will put its
total exhibition space at 1.4 million square feet. But that space
will not be contiguous like the hall in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good strong competitor, but we're building one
bigger than they are,'' said Dan Graveline, executive director of
the World Congress Center. ``Of course, Orlando is expanding its
center, so we are all leap-frogging each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly competitive convention business, the $250 million
New Orleans expansion shoots the city into the big leagues as one
of the nation's top meeting sites. It will have a major edge when
it competes against Atlanta and Orlando to host the Super Show in
2004. The Super Show, which will move from Atlanta to Las Vegas for
three years starting in 2001, is the nation's second largest
convention, a 100,000-person revenue machine.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to compete for conventions of all sizes ensures
billions in future revenue for local hotels, restaurants, taxis,
and city and state government coffers. In a city that has lived and
died on the boom-and-bust oil industry, that kind of steady income
is cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many oil busts have we had? That industry is a tease to
our economy,'' said Don Engler, head of marketing for the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   In about a month, the exhibition room will stretch so far it
will take at least 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other.The
exhibit room is so large in fact, that only one show in the near
future would have used the entire hall. That was the Shot Show, the
firearms industry's largest trade association, which was supposed
to be in town in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the city's lawsuit against several gun
manufacturers and trade groups, the Shot Show canceled its trip to
New Orleans. The convention will be in Atlanta next week, despite
Mayor Bill Campbell's announcement that Atlanta also will be suing
gun manufacturers. His announcement came too late for the show to
cancel.
</P>
<P>
   But even without the Shot Show, the convention business in New
Orleans promises to boom for years to come. Events are scheduled as
far ahead as 2013, when a homebuilders convention will bring in
80,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, even without the enormous new hall, there were 87
conventions with almost 800,000 attendees. The total economic
impact of the center on the area was staggering at more than $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new hall will expand the center's capacity by 60 percent and
boost use by one-fourth. ``This means a great deal to us,'' said
Vicky Bayley, owner of Mike's on the Avenue, an upscale restaurant
on the edge of downtown. ``There are now so many neighborhood
restaurants in New Orleans that locals don't come downtown for
dinner like they used to. We are very dependent on the out-of-town
visitor.'' One thing holding New Orleans back is a dearth of direct
flights. And that, of course, is where Atlanta has the clear
advantage, Graveline said. ``We have the best airport in the United
States, if not the world,'' he said.

MAKING A GETAWAY ON SKIS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANA DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Zahn had been to the Sundance Film Festival a
few times, but this was the first time he was equipped with a cell
phone. The actor, known for quirky roles like his part as a
bookstore worker in ``You've Got Mail,'' pulled out a brick-size
early-model Motorola and searched futilely for the button to access
his number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it from my mom,'' Zahn said. ``She works at the YMCA.''
Effecting his mother's Minnesota accent, he added, `` `Well, the
counselors had an extra one, and I thought you could use it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zahn, who lives in Warren County, N.J., doesn't consider himself
the type of actor who fits the cell-phone-toting Hollywood cliche.
He was at the Sundance Festival in Park City, Utah, for five days
last week, promoting ``Happy Texas,'' a screwball comedy in which
he plays an escaped convict who masquerades as a gay man named
Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't like doing the publicity blitz. Last Wednesday
evening, he skipped the daily round of cocktail-hour cruising to
try night skiing. On the lift, he sounded like a high school
truant, bragging about how he had cut a few interviews scheduled
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Zahn had been on skis once before, on his first trip to Sundance
in 1993. Then he was there for the hipster comedy ``Reality
Bites,'' and he forayed onto the slopes with the film's star, Ethan
Hawke, and a film executive, Jason Blum, both good skiers.
</P>
<P>
   After watching him on an easy run, he recalled, they convinced
him to tag along on a black diamond trail. ``I fell all the way
down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Zahn stayed up as he careened down the bunny hill and
a handful of intermediate runs, looking ungainly but happy.
</P>
<P>
   After the fun came the work: partying. On Main Street, he
stopped every block or so to sign autographs and to pose for
pictures with festival-goers. Spotting one of the ``Happy Texas''
screenwriters, he heckled him, then made a plan to meet him later
at the William Morris party.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Zahn was headed to the most-talked-about party of the
night, a tribute to DJ Spooky, of course a deejay, with the
celebrity deejay Mark Ronson as the host. He stayed 15 minutes,
long enough to take in the ear-splitting music, girls in hip-hugger
pants and guys with hair gel. A fan stopped him on the way to the
men's room and asked for a photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, sure,'' said Zahn, amiably. ``Can I go to the bathroom
first?''
</P>
<P>
   After standing for 10 minutes three deep at the bar, Zahn gave
up. He went next door to Alamo, a bar that is strict about
admitting members only _ an anti-velvet ropes strategy intended to
keep out the Hollywood types that they refer to as PIBs, or
``people in black.''
</P>
<P>
   In his plaid shirt, cargo pants and ski cap, Zahn didn't have a
hard time finding an Alamo patron to sponsor his admittance. Zahn
refilled the patron's pitcher of beer and bought one for himself.
He signed up for the pool table, and standing under a mounted deer
head, backlighted by neon beer signs, waited his turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Minnesota, going to keggers in the woods, not
parties where you have to yell at each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When his name was called, Zahn played against two locals named
Steve, whom he beat, and held the table for more than an hour. A
fan bought him a kamikaze shot to congratulate him on a Miramax
deal that Zahn hadn't heard about. He toasted anyway, figuring he'd
find out more later, maybe meeting his friends at the William
Morris party.

FERTILE IMAGINATION

<P>
   PASADENA _ Taking the trash out? Stop right there! You may be
throwing away just what you need to grow yourself a lush _ and
economical _ vegetable garden this year.
</P>
<P>
   So says Yvonne Savio, head of the Common Ground Garden Program
and coordinator of the Master Gardener program for the University
of California Cooperative Extension in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Call her the Heloise of gardening. Savio has a trick for using
and reusing all kinds of garbage as ``tools'' to raising a lush and
fruitful garden.
</P>
<P>
   And most of her solutions won't cost you a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Savio practices what she preaches in classes and seminars.
You'll find old orange rinds, mesh berry baskets, old putty knives
and plenty of other would-be discards helping almost a dozen fruits
and a wide variety of vegetables flourish in her own quarter-acre
terraced garden in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Savio says she's been a saver for years, but while others turn
old newspapers into fireplace logs or discarded greeting cards into
place mats, all her castoffs seem to wind up in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just collect all the rubber bands that come with
the newspaper. I collect everything else,'' she said with a laugh.
``Why buy something when you can reuse something? I don't like to
throw anything away.''
</P>
<P>
   So after she squeezes oranges for breakfast juice, the empty
rinds are used as organic pots in which to start seeds. Forks
mangled in the garbage disposer aren't thrown away; they're
straightened and used to gently lift seedlings from pots for
transplanting. Old cans aren't tossed into recycling bins; they're
used as pedestals to keep growing pumpkins off the damp ground.
Empty half-gallon milk jugs have their bottoms sliced off and
become mini-greenhouses for tender new lettuce plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find lots of uses for things you'd ordinarily throw
away if you just think about it,'' Savio said. ``It's not hard to
put stuff to other uses if you try.''
</P>
<P>
   Old shoe boxes, for example, become files to hold seed packets,
divided into very early season, spring and fall plantings. Within
those divisions, seed packets are alphabetized and bundled with
markers made of discarded Popsicle sticks and short lengths of
slats cut from old miniblinds. When the seeds are planted, the
markers are stuck into the soil alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   Savio gives many of her vegetables _ particularly cucumbers,
squash and others that don't transplant well _ a head start by
planting seed indoors before it's warm enough for them to go
directly into the garden, generally after Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using citrus halves as biodegradable pots, she
also uses plastic mesh berry baskets lined with pieces of newspaper
or paper towels. The lined baskets are filled with potting soil and
seeds dropped in and covered with soil.
</P>
<P>
   Watered and placed in a warm spot, the seeds will sprout in a
few days. In a few weeks, the plants will be 2 to 3 inches tall,
just the right size for placing in the garden once the weather
warms.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need to lift the plant out of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper rots out _ it's like a little bit of compost _ and
the holes in the basket are large enough to let the roots grow
through,'' Savio said. ``You just plant basket and all. After you
harvest the vegetables, you dig up the basket, wash it off and use
it again next year. They last just about forever.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contouring beds for vegetables _ building berms
around sunken areas that can be flooded for deep watering _
gardeners can use an old mason's trowel or even a child's beach
shovel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black plastic flats _ those square, low-sided, trellis-bottomed
trays retail nurseries pack shoppers' plants on for the trip home _
can be overturned and used to screen fledgling herb beds. The flats
let filtered light through, protect from overheating and hold in
moisture while slow-germinating plants establish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In using empty plastic milk jugs as greenhouses for tender new
lettuce, Savio anchors the carton with a stick or dowel _ ``that'll
hold it steady even in a high wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Recycling isn't over once vegetables are harvested. Clean, empty
mayonnaise jars hold seeds collected from her plants. Kept in a
cool place, onion seeds will last about a year, lettuce seed will
be viable for two years and tomatoes ``last for years if they're
kept in a coolish interior room in a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Using her recycling tricks, Savio is constantly planting,
watering, fertilizing and harvesting, weather permitting. Rarely
does she buy fresh produce at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do sometimes, but it bugs me,'' she said with a laugh. ``It
means that I've failed. It means that I have nothing going on in
the garden, and I can't stand that.'' &QL;

TRICKS OF THE TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _Here are more tips and tricks that will help gardeners
recycle items for use in the garden:
</P>
<P>
   Use an old paring or putty knife to cut transplants from a flat
or as a harvesting aid.
</P>
<P>
   Slit open plastic drycleaning bags to use as lightweight
sheeting over newly seeded flats or beds; anchor in place with
rocks. Remove when plants are 1-inch tall.
</P>
<P>
   Slip half-gallon milk cartons with tops and bottoms cut off over
celery plants to blanch (whiten) them as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   Use plastic mesh berry baskets to protect newly sprouted
seedlings such as corn, cucumber, melons and squash from birds. By
the time the seedlings are tall enough to reach through the top of
the basket, the plants are hardier and less tempting to the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Metal cans placed under melons concentrate the sun's warmth,
transferring it to the maturing fruit so it matures sweeter and
earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   To dry fruit or herbs, sandwich them between layers of
cheesecloth held in place by old refrigerator or oven racks; put
the racks in the sun and turn occasionally for even drying.
</P>
<P>
   Tie twine through the springs of two clothespins and clamp the
pins to a trellis on each side of a cucumber, pea or other
reluctant climbing vine; as the plant grows, readjust tension by
moving the clothespins.
</P>
<P>
   Use a child's wagon to haul compost, fertilizer, potting soil
and other items in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Save yourself from backaches when you have to plant seeds, such
as corn and beans, that require a certain planting depth. Place a
rubber washer around a length of dowel at the correct planting
depth and use that end of the dowel to punch planting holes; move
the washer up or down to adjust for different seed depths.
</P>
<P>
   Use cutoff bottoms of plastic milk jugs as saucers for pots,
shallow seed-starting trays or cutworm guards. For guards, cut a
slit from one side to the center and remove an inch-wide hole at
the center for the plant stem. Slip the plastic into place with the
bowl directed downward.
</P>
<P>
   Use old pantyhose as hammocks to hang individual fruits and
vegetables from trellises and to protect them from birds, earwigs,
snails and other munchers. For protection, slip the fruit or
vegetable into a leg of the hose, knotting above and below the
fruit; the hose will expand as the fruit grows.
</P>
<P>
   Save a Y-shaped branch from pruning to scrape mud from boots and
tools.

BRIGHT PICTURE FOR GROWING DVD MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You have a new DVD player on your TV or in your
computer and now you want stuff for your new toy. Well, the good
news is, there's more and different new stuff hitting the shelves,
and to help you keep abreast of it all, some nifty new online
resources.
</P>
<P>
   One new wrinkle is coming courtesy of Palm Pictures, the new
corporate home of former Island Records owner Chris Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   Palm is selling what it calls ``DVD singles'' of music and
performance videos for $7.98, starting with ``Superthruster'' from
reggae rhythm gods Sly &AMP; Robbie and ``Detonator'' from electronica
dance act Mocean Worker.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the term DVD single minimizes what's offered on the
discs, which have material designed for computer DVD-ROM drives, as
well as the music and videos that will play on TV set-top players.
</P>
<P>
   The discs, which each have eight to 12 minutes of video
performances, also include interviews, album samplers, Web links, a
photo gallery, brief biographies and more. The Sly &AMP; Robbie single
also includes an interview with noted producer Howie B, who
collaborates on the music.
</P>
<P>
   Palm also is offering two wildly different longer-form pieces: a
Sly and Robbie set of 11 music videos featuring Los Angeles dancers
called ``Strip to the Bone'' and a lovely black-and-white tone poem
to Africa called ``Hommage A' Noir,'' from German filmmaker Ralf
Schmerberg.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's distributor, Rykodisc, also is mingling with singles,
issuing ``Indoscrub'' from long-time Grateful Dead drummer Mickey
Hart. It contains two songs and two videos, a video interview of
Hart, a Web link to Rykodisc's site and more. The visuals are kind
of cool, too, constructed by filmmaker Chuck Fishbein from
time-lapse photography and ``found'' footage.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you having a hard time finding a local place that
rents and sells DVD, check out the Web site put together by the DVD
Video Group and the Video Software Dealers Association, which
represents all the video rental stores in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.dvdvideogroup.com, type in your ZIP code, and the Web
site will tell you the closest DVD retailer and even create a map
to get you there.
</P>
<P>
   And DVD.com (at www.dvd.com! is offering an electronic
newsletter of DVD-related information to keep you up to date with
developments in the business. The site, along with competitor
Netflix.com and others, sells and rents DVDs online at competitive
prices.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when it seems like the only thing proliferating
faster than new Web pages on the Internet are studies about the
Internet. Among the array of recent tidbits:
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit organization called SeniorNet _ which helps train
older people on computers at learning centers around the country _
said 40 percent of those between ages 50 and 75 own the machines.
Among senior citizens with college degrees, the computer ownership
figure is 53 percent. SeniorNet can be reached at www.seniornet.org
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   InfoWorld columnist Bob Metcalfe _ creator of the Ethernet
protocol and networking giant 3Com Inc. _ predicts more than half
of American households will have computers, and a third of them
will be online by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this year, there will be more female than male Internet
users, which will change Net usage patterns (less surfing,
different destinations, more control over household purchasing
decisions), and change the Net itself as a result. For more
information on these trends, go to International Data Corp.'s site
at www.idc.com/F/Ei/123199ei.htm
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a long-running annual UCLA study of more than 275,000
freshmen at 469 U.S. colleges found that about five out of six of
them used the Internet to do research and homework, and almost
two-thirds used it for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of good news: Only 3 percent of the students want to be
lawyers, while nearly three-fourths say they volunteer for various
causes. The study is conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research
Institute and the American Council on Education. &QL;

ORIGINALITY CUTS BOTH WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in the middle of an apparent animation
bonanza, the Big Three networks aren't the only ones who are
skittish about putting ``edgy'' animated shows on the air. While
25-year-old wunderkinds like ``Family Guy's'' Seth MacFarlane are
getting a shot at creating the next ``Simpsons''/``King of the
Hill''/``South Park,'' some creators grumble that it's as hard as
ever to sell any network or cable channel on a truly original idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret they're all looking for the next `South
Park','' says John Kricfalusi, the animator who brought you ``Ren &AMP;
Stimpy.'' ``When something primitively drawn that happens to be
funny becomes a hit, everyone else tries to imitate the most
obvious thing: the primitive style. Things aren't going to succeed
because of that. They'll only succeed if they're funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kricfalusi should know: ``Ren &AMP; Stimpy'' became the
highest-rated cable show to date at the time it debuted in the
early 1990s, on the Nickelodeon channel. Since Kricfalusi left the
show in a creative dispute with Nickelodeon, he has tried
unsuccessfully to get another show on the air. Earlier this month,
he struck a deal with Canadian production company Cambium
Entertainment to produce a new superhero spoof, ``He-Hog the Atomic
Pig,'' expected to debut sometime next year. So far, though,
Cambium still is shopping for an American distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Kricfalusi nearly had deals with Fox and the Cartoon Network in
the last several years, but the shows haven't materialized.
Meanwhile, he's stayed busy working on Internet cartoons, music
videos, commercials and animated short subjects.
</P>
<P>
   One problem animators have faced is that Americans (especially
cautious TV executives) have tended to classify animation as a
medium exclusively for children. Adult-oriented animation has long
been more successful in overseas markets such as Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakout hits have appealed to all ages: `Bugs Bunny,'
`Ren &AMP; Stimpy,' `The Flintstones','' Kricfalusi says. ``If you went
and pitched `South Park' to somebody, they'd have a hard time
seeing that even adults would watch it. But they do. Kids,
teen-agers and adults all like it. Who would have thought?''
</P>
<P>
   The law of averages dictates that not all the new animated shows
will be hits. Already, some outlets seem to be rethinking their
animated programming strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office, which has had respectable success with its TV
version of the comic book ``Spawn,'' seems to have pulled back
somewhat from its commitment to animation. Last year, it got rid of
most of the people who were working in-house on the show, which may
be on the way out after a new series of six episodes is shown
starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   ```Spawn' was a very special idea. I don't know that there's
another show out there like `Spawn,''' says Carmi Zlotnik, vice
president of original programming production and creative
operations at HBO. He adds that while HBO may put on more animated
shows in the future, it is looking not at comedies, rather than
dark, comic book properties such as ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Animated programming tends to be an odd duck,'' says Zlotnik.
``There are a lot of considerations as to what you pair it with,
your scheduling strategy, who you're aiming at.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO had built up an in-house team to produce ``Spawn.'' At one
time, the plan was to use this team to work on other shows in
development, such as ``Fritz the Cat'' creator Ralph Bakshi's
``Spicy City'' and an animated version of the underground cartoon
strip ``Hollywood Dog.'' Now, Zlotnik says, HBO has changed its
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our emphasis has shifted to some of the more known quantities:
writers, executives, producers. ... Our goal is to get strong
programming for the network, first and foremost. People aren't
looking for an animated show just to have an animated show on their
network.'' &QL;

MADE FOR EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You may be dimly aware that there's a Cartoon
Network, although you probably don't get it through your cable
provider's basic package. What you may be increasingly aware of is
that there's a second cartoon network that's gearing up, and by
March, it will have five animated series in its prime-time lineup.
The network is Fox, known mostly to viewers now for its reality
based-programs (``World's Scariest Car Chases IV!!!'') and its
failure to successfully launch a hit live-action sitcom. (``Married
... With Children,'' a live-action cartoon, shouldn't count.)
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, if we're the Cartoon Network, does that make NBC the
Sitcom Network,'' asks Doug Herzog, Fox's new entertainment
president. ``People say, `You guys can't launch a live-action
comedy.' Well, nobody else can launch an animated comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog recently came to Fox from Comedy Central, where he helped
turn ``South Park'' into a potty-mouthed phenomenon. But, while he
may know something about cartoons, Herzog may be displaying a
little false bravado about the marketplace. These days, every
upstart network is launching animated comedy programs, and one of
them, UPN's ``Dilbert,'' already is drawing the beleaguered
network's highest ratings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 new shows slated to debut as midseason series on the
networks, one-third are animated. We've already seen Fox's ``The
PJs,'' the visually striking and racially insulting foamation
cartoon (and ratings hit) co-created by Eddie Murphy. Premiering
today on Fox after the Super Bowl is ``Family Guy,'' a fast-moving
series about an outlandish family of middle-class New Englanders
that likely will engender a comment or two about its tastelessness.
(Matricide is a frequent theme.)
</P>
<P>
   In March, Fox will unveil Matt Groening's long-awaited
``Simpsons'' follow-up, ``Futurama,'' a sci-fi comedy where anxious
citizens battle the Y3K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Downtrodden UPN contributes the season's other two entries:
``Dilbert,'' which brings Scott Adams' popular corporate cubicle
comic to life, and ``Home Movies,'' featuring Paula Poundstone
voicing a divorced mother of an 8-year-old movie lover. ``Home
Movies'' will be partly ad-libbed (that will cut down on the
sprawling writing staff) and comes in SquiggleVision, a vibrating
animation technique honed on ``Dr. Katz.''
</P>
<P>
   And all that is just the beginning. The folks at WB have another
comic strip favorite, the diaper-soaked ``Baby Blues,'' in the
works as well as ``The Downtowners,'' kind of a cartoon
``Friends.'' Meg Ryan is developing a
quintuplet-girls-in-junior-high show for UPN, and Fox has three
more projects in the planning stages, one of which sounds like
``Beavis and Butt-head,'' only in claymation. Can a California
Raisins reunion be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can blame most of this on the success of `King of
the Hill,''' says David Cohen, an executive producer for
``Futurama'' who produced ``The Simpsons'' and wrote several of its
most famous episodes (``Lisa the Vegetarian,'' ``The Itchy &AMP;
Scratchy &AMP; Poochy Show'' among them).
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, networks viewed `The Simpsons' as a fluke of
nature,'' Cohen continues. ```King of the Hill' proved the audience
was there for another type of show. We're only starting to see more
shows just now because of the amount of time needed to start an
animated series.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much time (and money) is required to produce the
animation for these shows, networks typically give them longer
episode commitments and a little more space to find an audience.
For instance, Fox guaranteed ``Family Guy'' creator Seth MacFarlane
13 episodes, and he already is storyboarding another half dozen.
It's a pretty good deal considering that MacFarlane is only 25 and
got the gig based on an eight-minute demo he gave to Fox. The
network also has guaranteed its wunderkind a $2 million salary for
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawing Woody Woodpecker and Fred Flintstone when I was
2; my parents still have the drawings,'' MacFarlane says. ``It was
something that always came pretty easy to me.''
</P>
<P>
   MacFarlane and his producing partner, David Zuckerman, who came
to ``Family Guy'' from ``King of the Hill,'' are lobbying Fox for
the Sunday prime-time slot between ``The Simpsons'' and ``The
X-Files.'' (``I think we're the best fit,'' Zuckerman says.
``Anything you can do would be greatly appreciated.'') Groening,
though, believes his new show should follow his old one. (``We
think any programming genius would figure out that a show like
`Futurama,' which is sort of a part `Simpsons,' part `X-Files,'
could go ... I don't know, could go Sunday at 8:30,'' Groening
says, tongue firmly in cheek.)
</P>
<P>
   Neither ``The Family Guy'' nor ``Futurama'' will be ready to go
fulltime until March _ at the earliest. But the good-natured (and
very serious) jostling for the Sunday time slot underscores a great
unspoken fear. What if there isn't an audience for all of this
animation?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``King of the Hill'' has lost more than a third of
its audience since being moved this season from Sunday to Tuesday
has caused more than a few sweaty palms in network programming
offices. On the plus side: consistently high scores from ``The
PJs'' in its post-``King of the Hill'' time slot, and the
encouraging showing from UPN's ``Dilbert'' on its Monday premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone knows if people can handle this much
animation,'' Groening concedes. ``But I guess we're going to find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Herzog is a little more optimistic, part of the territory
that comes from running a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get to 16 animated comedies, then I think we'll have a
problem,'' Herzog says. ``But I won't pass on a great animated show
if it's better than anything else we've got. If we're afraid to put
a show on, it's probably the best reason to put it on. We need to
be a little more fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fearlessness remains a quality that the so-called Big Three
networks apparently lack, at least when it comes to animation. It
also could be that executives at NBC, CBS and ABC remember
``Capitol Critters,'' ``The Fish Police'' and ``Stressed Eric.''
Not many other people do, and that's the point. But in this
post-``Seinfeld'' age of eroding audiences and splintered viewing
habits, the folks running the Little Three (and, believe us, the
gap is narrowing) have less to lose and are willing to roll the
dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never see `Family Guy' on CBS,'' Zuckerman says. ``There
would be an enormous discomfort level, I think, for everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And given that animated shows typically generate more discomfort
than live-action series, you have to have the stomach for a little
controversy if you're going to make them. It took all of one
episode for ``The PJs'' to draw fire from African-Americans who
think the series, which is set in an urban housing project, is full
of demeaning stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of scratch my head why Eddie Murphy's doing this
because it shows no love at all for black people,'' says filmmaker
Spike Lee. ``It's really hateful, I think, toward black people.''
</P>
<P>
   The other animated series take more conventional approaches in
the ways they push the envelope. Thus, flatulence jokes, cartoon
nudity and basic tastelessness co-exist with wry topical humor and
family dysfunction. Examples: On ``Family Guy,'' 1-year-old Stewie
is in such pain from teething that he urges his mother to ``shake
me like a British nanny'' to end his suffering. On ``Futurama,''
the first words the cynical robot character, Bender, utters are,
``Bite my shiny metal ass.'' On ``Dilbert,'' we see the title
character's shiny, yellow ... backside two minutes into the first
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of animation,'' says ``Family Guy's''
Zuckerman. ``You can get away with a lot of funny things that would
be gross if you did them anywhere else. Like the episode on `King
of the Hill' where Hank was constipated. It only works because it's
one step removed from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one step?
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up an entire world of possibilities, letting you tell
old stories in new ways,'' Groening says. ``For instance, Bender
the Robot on `Futurama.' He shoplifts, he drinks, he smokes, he's
very corrupt, and I thought, `This way, parents can't accuse me of
providing a bad role model.' He's a robot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the wave of the future. &QL;

STARDUST SPACE PROBE HAS DATE WITH PRIMORDIAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR
SUN, PLANETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 31) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the name implies, NASA's Stardust probe will trek 3
billion miles through the solar system to gather remnants of the
dust and ice that long ago served as the building blocks for the
sun and planets.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious goal of the $212 million mission is a 2004
rendezvous near Jupiter with the comet Wild-2, a natural repository
for leftover primordial fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory of Pasadena,
Calif., the camera-equipped Stardust probe was designed to collect
the fragments as it swoops within 100 miles of the bright nucleus
of the comet. It will then return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Other samples, of microscopic debris generated by distant
stellar explosions, will be captured by the probe in early 2000 and
late 2002 as it makes its way toward Wild-2.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon, silicon and other elements prevalent on Earth were
forged from lighter elements when early stars exploded and cast
them into interstellar space.
</P>
<P>
   Samples of these interstellar grains should provide scientists
with a pristine record of the explosive conditions in which they
were forged.
</P>
<P>
   The desk-sized spacecraft is to make a high-velocity atmospheric
Earth re-entry and parachute onto a military preserve in the Utah
desert on Jan. 15, 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Stardust's return capsule will be whisked to NASA's Johnson
Space Center in far south Houston. There the fragments will be
preserved, archived alongside the lunar rocks gathered by the
Apollo astronauts and parceled out to scientists for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Stardust is scheduled to be launched Feb. 6 from the Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida aboard a Delta II rocket,
but it could depart as late as Feb. 25 and still achieve its
milestones. The mission is the first since the final Apollo voyage
of 1972 to be launched with the goal of gathering extraterrestrial
materials and returning them to Earth for study.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hope Stardust will supply them with new clues about the
origins and mineral composition of the particles that coalesced
into the sun and planets an estimated 4.6 billion years ago,
furnished the water that filled the early oceans and possibly
seeded the Earth with the reactive chemicals called ``organics''
that gave rise to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite possible that Earth's entire supply of those kind
of biologically important molecules as well as enough water to fill
the Earth's oceans were delivered by comets,'' said Carl Pilcher,
the science director for NASA's solar system exploration program.
``Life, in fact, formed on Earth very shortly after the end of the
formation of the planet itself. That may be all very well due to
the contribution of comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the study of comets is extremely important not only for
understanding the origin of life on Earth but for understanding the
biological potential of other planets,'' Pilcher said. ``The same
comets that hit the Earth, when the Earth was forming, were also
hitting Venus and Mars. Comets may also very well have influenced
the early conditions on Venus and Mars as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A range of factors turned comets into nature's deep freeze,
places where the solar system's early building blocks would be
preserved, astronomers believe.
</P>
<P>
   During the formation of the solar system, surplus material
swirled on the distant frontier and loosely clumped into comets.
The gravitational influence of the large planets flung these cosmic
gypsies to even further distances where they now swarm in
formations called the Oort Cloud and Kuiper Belt. Occasionally,
though, the gravitational forces of the outer planets alter the
course of a comet, tugging it into the heart of the solar system on
an elliptical course that swings it back out to the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   The geologic record compiled by scientists suggests the planets
formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a disk of stellar dust and
ice churning around the sun. Studies of craters on the moon and
other planets further suggests that the young planets were
bombarded by comets and asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   In the Earth's case, the pelting warmed the planet, vaporizing
the early oceans and making it much too hot for the fragile
carbon-based chemistry upon which life is based.
</P>
<P>
   The bombardment tapered off about 3.9 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are puzzled at what sparked life to arise so quickly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be that as the Earth cooled, the tapering rain of
comets replenished its oceans and introduced the ingredients
essential for life.
</P>
<P>
   The riskiest phase of Stardust's 3.2-billion-mile journey to
Wild-2 and back will fall Jan. 2, 2004, as the spacecraft maneuvers
itself into the path of the nucleus of the 4-mile wide comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing a game here,'' said Don Brownlee, the
University of Washington scientist who serves as the principal
investigator. ``We want to get as close as possible to the comet,
but we don't want to get hit by a large enough particle to destroy
the spacecraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Stardust is shielded against high-velocity impacts from objects
as large as a half-inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the National Research Council concluded that
cometary debris and cosmic dust do not pose a potential biological
hazard to the Earth because they have been exposed to sterilizing
radiation in space.

for Sunday, Jan. 31, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For a generation,
Republicans have represented resurgent American conservatism. But
now, with the budget balanced and significant reductions in crime,
welfare, divorce and single motherhood, Republicans find themselves
defined by impeachment and their argument that President Clinton
represents a nation in moral decline. They are also finding that
Americans are leery of a party that appears to be pressing for
moral cleansing. By Richard L Berke. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Berlin) _ If the late '90s have
produced a dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps `conservative.' The
right-of-center ideology that played an important role in
privatization, advancing the market economy and facing down the
Soviet Union has fizzled. At the beginning of the decade,
conservatives were in charge or on the rise nearly everywhere in
Europe, but today there is not a single major country where that is
true. By Roger Cohen. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ZERO-TOLERANCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Zero-tolerance'' policies of
seizing cars, boats and other property of persons suspected but not
convicted of drug trafficking or other offenses pleased
criminal-justice conservatives, but enraged scores of motorists,
boat owners, civil libertarians and policy analysts. Critics
complained that draconian steps tie up enforcement personnel better
deployed elsewhere, swamp overburdened administrative systems and
worse, provide little if any deterrence. By David Johnston. (`a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-RITUALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Although resisting major
change, the Catholic Church has been enacting lesser changes in
ritual and practice designed to render ancient religious customs
compatible with the spirit of the times. In much of this, experts
say, the Vatican struggles to take into account the sensibilities
and convictions of a widely varying membership in broadly differing
societies. A recent statement on exorcism is an example. By John
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-CLUSTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Disease clusters are
concentrated areas in which an unusually high percentage of people
succumb to some type of illness, possibly caused by local
environmental conditions. Every time a disease cluster turns up,
communities worry, scientists scramble for a cause and, as in ``A
Civil Action'' lawyers start suing. Yet over and over again,
despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to link the disease
with a cause, scientists usually come up empty-handed. By Gina
Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-DEBT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The end of the annual budget
deficit is hardly the end of the government's financial troubles,
and it marks the beginning of a new debate over how fiscal policy
should be used to shape the nation's future. The cumulative the
national debt built up over decades of deficit spending remains an
economic millstone of considerable proportions. And only now do
Congress and the White House have the luxury of debating what to do
about it. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   EARTHQUAKE-HOUSES-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Americans viewing the
devastation caused by the earthquake in Colombia might be tempted
to knock on wood. Wood-frame houses, the type generally built in
the United States, can stand up far better in quakes than the
outwardly solid masonry homes that crumpled so quickly in Colombia.
By Andrew Pollack
</P>
<P>
   SEX-MUTATIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Evolutionary biologists have
long wondered why sexual reproduction took precedence over asexual
reproduction. Now, a new report shows there is indeed a purpose to
sex: to sweep away the bad mutations that would otherwise drag us
toward terminal degeneracy. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Much of the Senate debate
during the impeachment trial has been over to the degree to which
the proceedings should be conducted publicly or in closed session.
A look at the background of Senate secrecy and openness. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-ESSAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ So it has come to this. The
essay, that great literary art form, has fallen to a state where
someone thinks it is a swell idea to ask a computer if an essay is
any good. The new computer, which is called e-rater, will be used
along with a trained human to grade the two essay questions on the
Graduate Management Admission Test taken by 200,000 business-school
applicants each year. By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOVIET-ESPIONAGE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A new book, `The Haunted
Wood: Soviet Espionage in America _ The Stalin Era,' offers a new
look at what communist spies were really up to in this country
before and during World War II. It is a staggering account of
sloppiness and stupidity among the Soviets and their American
agents. And it underscores how much the most powerful people in
Washington freely gave Moscow when faced with a common enemy in
wartime. On balance, it appears that Moscow gained more from its
open alliances with the United States than from its secret American
underground. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shakespeare showed royalty to
be larger than life, but in the end very human. Now, from the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, comes evidence to support that
portrayal: a most extraordinary document in the voice of a
modern-day king struggling with his own mortality as he grapples
with issues that were the stuff of the 16th century.

Club warehouse operation at WalMart and at category killer Petsmart
_ just the kind of companies whose nimbleness and logistical
prowess have been bedeviling Fleming and its customers. One unusual
initiative: he wants the board to face re-election every year. By

JOHN ELWAY FACES THE GAME OF HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a last-second steal and a jumper that won the 1998 NBA
Finals, Michael Jordan ended a ridiculously perfect career in
outlandishly perfect fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who retired earlier this month, capped his career with a
sixth world title. Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons, John Elway
will seek to join His Airness and a select few others as elite
athletes who walked away as champions.
</P>
<P>
   It is close to a forgone conclusion that Super Bowl XXXIII will
be the last game Elway ever plays as quarterback of the Denver
Broncos. The drama _ and hasn't John Elway always been about drama?
_ is whether he will go out with a second consecutive Super Bowl
title after years of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall be like that tree,'' author Jonathan Swift once said,
``I shall die at the top.'' But most athletes don't leave their
games on their terms. They usually either burn out suddenly, the
victim of catastrophic injury that is always a play away, or
succumb to the lure of one more season, one more shot, pushing them
past their prime but no closer to a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will have to come and tear the uniform off me,'' Hall
of Famer Early Wynn said while still playing (he retired in 1963
with exactly 300 wins), ``and the guy who comes better have help.''
But there are those who leave with the trophies, champions making a
graceful exit.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, that usually meant departing from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio left after winning the 1951 World Series, in which
his home run helped win Game Four. Johnny Mize retired after the
1953 season, leading the league in pinch-hits. (``Your arm is gone,
your legs likewise, But not your eyes, Mize, not your eyes,''
sportswriter Dan Parker wrote). Phil Rizzuto ended his career after
the 1956 Series, which featured Don Larsen's perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Yankees of basketball, the Boston Celtics.
Bill Russell ended his amazing run as the cornerstone of the
1950s/60s Celtics dynasty with a title in his final year as a
player in 1968-69, a season in which he also served as coach. It
was the back end of a double feat for Russell, who ended his
college career at the University of San Francisco with an NCAA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Celtics greats also were among those who ended their
careers with titles: Sam Jones in 1969 and Bob Cousy in 1963,
although Cousy did come back for seven games in 1969-70 as a
player/coach for the Cincinnati Royals. An aside: The greatest
Celtic, Larry Bird, won a gold medal as a member of the original
Dream Team in the 1992 Olympics and never played again.
</P>
<P>
   When you are talking Stanley Cups, you are talking the Montreal
Canadiens. So it's not surprising that Ken Dryden (1979), Jean
Beauliveau (1971) and Maurice ``The Rocket'' Richard (1960) all
hoisted the Cup in final victory laps on their long careers.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Maureen Connolly's tennis career was cut short by a
horseback riding accident. But from 1951 to '54, when her career
ended, she won every major singles tournament she played in, nine
in all.
</P>
<P>
   But football may be the toughest sport of all to leave with a
championship ring. Injury always looms, and with 30 teams (31 next
year) vying for spots in a one-loss-and-out playoff, one misstep
can end a season, or a career.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Van Brocklin did it in 1960, quarterbacking the
Philadelphia Eagles to the NFL title over the Green Bay Packers.
Hall of Fame center Frank Gatski bowed out three years before as a
titlist for the Detroit Lions. Two years before that, Otto Graham
captured the flag leading the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   A final thought on retirement: DiMaggio left baseball after
winning the World Series because, he said, ``When baseball is no
longer fun, it's no longer a game.'' He was more blithe when asked
how the New York Yankees would do without him: ``There's always
some youngster coming up _ they'll find somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. His name was Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart, Broncos fans.

   Recently, while looking through a new cookbook, I noticed that
the term ``imported bay leaf'' was used throughout. The book later
explained that only imported bay leaves, often from Turkey and
sometimes called Turkish bay, were to be used in the recipes
because these were the leaves of Laurus nobilis, the sweet bay of
the Mediterranean, so full of flavor and indispensable in
Mediterranean cooking. Domestic bay leaves, which come from a
different tree, Umbellularia californica, commonly called
California laurel and Oregon myrtle, were to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Umbellularia californica is native to both California and
Oregon, growing primarily in the coastal mountains, where it is
found along the edges of watercourses, even canyons and gullies
that are only seasonally wet. The trees are very aromatic and can
become towering, spreading giants, rising to 75 feet and covering a
circle 100 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves of the California laurel somewhat resemble those of
the sweet bay in shape, but not in color or flavor. Sweet bay
leaves are glossy, dark green and seductively aromatic, while the
intensely pungent leaves of the California laurel are a dull sage
color and, when used in cooking, can deliver a resinous, rather
oily flavor to the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, you would not want to use domestic laurel in cooking.
But that doesn't mean you have to use only imported dried leaves. I
have six Laurus nobilis trees outside my kitchen window north of
San Francisco, and friends in harsher climates grow their bay in
pots and move them inside in winter. Gardeners in this country can
grow their own and use leaves both fresh and dried.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet bay has been known for at least 4,000 years in
Mediterranean countries, where it was used culinarily and
medicinally, as well as in religious and civil ceremonies. The
ancient Greeks and Romans, of course, twined the branches into
wreaths and crowned their victors in war and sport. The same
victorious symbolism lives on today in words like baccalaureate and
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean, sweet bay grows wild as far north as the
lower Alps in Haute Provence, often in partial shade, to 60 feet
tall. It is hardy to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and can endure even
lower temperatures for a brief period. In the United States, Laurus
nobilis grows well in areas where temperatures rarely fall much
below 20 degrees, and where it grows readily to 40 feet. My sweet
bays, planted four years ago, are now reaching above the roof line
of my house, about 20 feet. After an uncharacteristic week of
temperatures dipping into the high teens, the leaves are unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet bay wasn't introduced into northern Europe until the
17th century, when it became a popular decorative feature for
castles and estates. In the late 19th century, there was a small
industry of sweet bay nurserymen in southern Belgium, near the
French border, who propagated the plants in pots, raising and
pruning them into pyramids or globes with spiraling trunks, and
shipping them throughout Europe. A scarcity of coal for their
greenhouses during World War I set the industry back heavily, but
it still exists, providing potted bay plants for terraces,
balconies and doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   The trees, while rather slow-growing, are quite long lived.
Potted specimens may grow to 20 feet tall, although 5 to 6 feet is
more common. Sweet bay is more easily grown from cuttings than from
seed, and even the cuttings can be difficult to start, sometimes
taking six months to root well.
</P>
<P>
   Established one-, two- or three-year-old trees are a good choice
for most casual gardeners, although older, larger ones are
available. I started my planting with small one-gallon transplants
about a foot high. At first, because they seemed to be such spindly
little sticks, I was afraid to pick the leaves, and the harvest was
the main reason I had planted them. However, I found that cutting
off the top inch of leaves encouraged new, spreading growth, as did
picking leaves from the stem. Within a year or so, my spindly
little trees were on their way to becoming shrubby.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to keep them under control, I periodically give the trees a
side shearing and top lopping whenever they make my kitchen too
dark, although I have not tried any more elaborate shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet bay, whether potted or planted in the ground, needs, above
all, good drainage, because standing water and soggy roots will
kill them. Spring fertilizing with a slow-release granular
fertilizer is recommended, and in summer, when the growth is most
intense, both a liquid and granular fertilizer should be used,
tapering off as autumn approaches. Keep the plants well watered,
but avoid overwatering; sweet bay is more tolerant of dry
conditions than of wet.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in winter, fertilizing and watering generally can be
omitted altogether, because rainfall should provide adequate water,
and since cold weather restricts plant growth, there is no need to
replenish soil nutrients. Sweet bay trees generally are relatively
pest-free. They sometimes get aphids, but those can be hosed off.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few additional maintenance rules for potted bay
laurel. If you live in a cold-winter climate, the potted tree
should be brought inside for the winter and kept in a cool, bright
location. Water just enough to keep the root ball moist. Every two
years, repot to a container about two inches larger than the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   I use the leaves fresh all year, and I dry some to give to
friends. Sometimes I will just cut a leafy branch and hang it to
dry, and other times I will pick a number of leaves and put them
loosely in a covered basket in a cool corner. Drying leaves in the
open light tends to wash the color out somewhat, but doesn't affect
the flavor. If you want the dried leaves to be flat, put a board or
some type of weight on top of them. Unweighted, the leaves will
curl as they dry.
</P>
<P>
   Laurus nobilis is available from Mellinger's, 2310 W. South
Range Road, North Lima, Ohio 44452, (330) 549-9861 (it's listed as
sweet bay, and a three-inch pot costs $3.95); and from Papa Geno's
Herb Garden, 11125 S. 14th, Roca, Neb. 68430, (402) 423-5051 (a
two-and-one-half-inch pot costs $5.90 plus shipping and handling;
there is a minimum of three herb plants per shipment).

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a brand-new Honda on the market, ready to battle for
dominancy in yet another market segment: the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   It's the completely redesigned 1999 Odyssey, and it makes most
of its competitors seem like last year's leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, the Japanese automaker whose Accord sedan has
consistently ranked among the top-selling passenger vehicles in
America, finally jumped into the minivan market five years ago with
its first Odyssey, a respectable van built on the Accord chassis.
</P>
<P>
   But sales never caught on the way the Accord's did. That's
because even though the vehicle was typically very high quality, a
Honda trademark, it really didn't stand out among the minivan
crowd. The four-cylinder engine was not quite powerful enough, the
interior was not quite as roomy as it should have been, and there
really just wasn't anything very exciting about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Honda, for sure. It reflected Honda's tradition of
building practical, dependable cars that aren't particularly snazzy
but will keep running for years without a lot of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, exciting has been about the last word that most people
would associate with most Honda products.
</P>
<P>
   But Honda has come up with a unique combination in its all-new
Odyssey: It's a vehicle with style, power and functionality. Honda
bills it as the largest Honda ever offered. And with 210
horsepower, the Odyssey also becomes the most powerful vehicle in
this class.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you after a week's worth of test-driving the Odyssey
that Lee Iacocca and the folks at Chrysler never envisioned a
performance-oriented vehicle like this one when they rolled out
their first minivans in 1983. The Odyssey is a minivan that refuses
to be a boring mommymobile; it looks great and is fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides style and performance, the Odyssey takes convenience to
a new level, too, with such features as dual electric sliding
passenger doors.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line EX model, with a base price of $25,800 (plus
$415 transportation), which we tested, comes with electric doors.
General Motors introduced the first electric sliding door on its
Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan five years ago, and has since added
this option to the Chevrolet Venture and Pontiac Trans Sport. But
Honda is the first to offer the electric doors on both sides. That
feature alone will capture some sales for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Cleverness abounds inside the Odyssey, beginning with the third
row seat. It can be folded into the floor to create a huge cargo
area. The two individual middle seats can be pushed together to
make one bench seat, or left apart to separate two kids who would
otherwise pick at each other the whole trip.
</P>
<P>
   A folding tray divides the front bucket seats, so you can serve
lunch to a passel of kids in the back. There is room enough under
the seats for skis or pieces of lumber. The middle seats can be
removed quickly, and with the rear seat folded into the floor, the
Odyssey becomes a cargo van _ it can even hold 4-by-8-foot sheets
of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers have their own reading lamps that also shine onto the
ground when the doors are opened so people can see where they are
stepping in the dark. Cupholders abound, and they will hold just
about anything a kid wants to drink. I believe real moms had a
large hand in designing the interior of this vehicle; it's the
essence of practicality for kid-hauling.
</P>
<P>
   How about this for passenger convenience: Each person has his or
her own heating and air-conditioning controls.
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey, at 200 inches long, is almost as big as the
extended-length versions of DaimlerChrysler's vans. It's 13.6
inches longer than the previous Odyssey and 5 inches wider. Yet it
retains the tight 37-foot turning radius of the previous model.
There is an inch-and-a-half more headroom than in the Dodge Grand
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Power comes from a 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine that has the
largest standard displacement in the minivan segment. It's
connected to a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission,
and the shift lever is mounted on the steering column to keep it
off the floor and out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is very stable in turns, thanks in part to its
four-wheel independent suspension and wide track, the widest in the
minivan class. The unitized body is built on a sturdy cross-section
ladder-type frame with seven cross members under the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes are an important safety feature, and they come
on all Odysseys at no additional charge. The EX model comes with
electronic traction control to minimize wheel spin on slippery
surfaces. There are dual air bags up front, and all seven seats
have three-point lap and shoulder belts. An engine-immobilizer
antitheft system is standard; keyless entry is available on the EX.
</P>
<P>
   The base LX model, which lists for $23,200 plus transportation,
comes with power rack-and-pinion steering, power front disc/rear
drum brakes, 16-inch steel wheels, dual manual rear sliding doors,
rear wiper/washer, front and rear air-conditioning, power windows
and door locks, AM/FM/cassette stereo with four speakers, cruise
control, tilt steering wheel, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, rear
defroster and rear-seat heater ducts.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra money, the EX model adds the power sliding doors,
auto-off headlights, eight-way power driver's seat, compact-disc
player, six stereo speakers and 16-inch alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the Accord sedan chassis, the Odyssey is assembled at
Honda's plant in Alliston, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are 18 miles per gallon in the city
and 26 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 20.5 gallons of gasoline.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Framed in the waiting room of Drs. Marc Lowenberg and
Gregg Lituchy is a New York magazine cover, with their photograph,
touting a listing of ``The 100 Best Dentists in New York.'' It's a
fake, a Spy magazine parody from 1991, when the idea of celebrating
dentists still seemed ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because who would care?'' Lowenberg said. He and his partner
show off the cover at their Central Park South practice as a
reminder of how far their profession has come in the last eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people do care about dentists, especially cosmetic dentists
able to promise yet another form of makeover by whitening,
straightening or replacing inferior teeth with million-dollar _ or
at least $20,000 _ smiles.
</P>
<P>
   This booming business has made its most skilled, or best-known,
practitioners not only rich, with salaries up to seven figures, but
quasi-famous. The old stereotype of the dentist as bland,
lab-coated nerd has been elbowed aside by an aggressively
mediagenic new breed eager to do some image polishing.
</P>
<P>
   Like plastic surgeons of a certain class, these power dentists
hobnob with their celebrity clients (Donald Trump, Norman Mailer),
show up in gossip columns and hire publicists to promote their
high-tech gum lasers and state-of-the-art laminating techniques _
even sending out Hollywood-style head shots of themselves to
advertise their star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the sterile house of pain that used to be identified
with dental offices. The newly hip and patient-sensitive dentist
operates in opulent surroundings, with an attractive staff trained
to deliver concierge services like cappuccino and massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of them, it's more about the publicity and trying to
elbow their way into high society and get invited to openings,''
said Dr. Richard Rashbaum, a New York dentist who doesn't consider
himself in the dental fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Rose, president of the American Dental Association,
said that the drop in the decay rate among America's fluorinated
generation has given dentists time to focus on aesthetics, as has
the demand by aging boomers for ``the bionic body.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose added, ``Most dentists now practice some phase of cosmetic
dentistry.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey in the Journal of the American Dental Association
found that 84 percent of dentists offer tooth whitening, a
once-exotic procedure. Membership in the American Academy of
Cosmetic Dentistry, a professional group, has doubled in five
years, to 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Improved technology has expanded services from what dentists
call the routine of ``drill, fill and bill.'' Lasers can alter gum
lines without sutures, or bleach yellowing teeth almost instantly.
Chipped, crooked or just plain bad teeth can be concealed with
fingernail-thin porcelain veneers.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of bionic beauty, the ``smile lift'' has become as
familiar as the facelift. Traders in cocktail-party confidences can
score points by announcing, ``Larry did my teeth,'' referring to
Dr. Larry Rosenthal, whose patients include Donald Trump, Kathie
Lee Gifford and a long roster of socialites.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said, ``The guys who focus on discretionary services have a
little bit of that old salesman-type thing, to tell people why they
have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And do they ever. Seminars in ``practice management'' for
business-minded dentists can include such nonmedical
recommendations as: When presenting a patient with a treatment
program, always use a Mont Blanc pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer enough to have published in the journals,''
said Dr. Jeff Golub-Evans, a New York dentist and a frequent
contributor to professional journals. ``Now people want to know if
you've been on `The View.''' Or they want to know that Golub-Evans
has ministered to the marquee mouths of Regis Philbin and Wayne
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Smigel, president of the American Society for Dental
Aesthetics and, after 40 years in practice, a dean in the field, is
skeptical of his high-flying colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about dentists with publicists, he said:
``Very, very leery. They're not interested in learning, just making
a name for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-end New York dentists _ not the (800) NU TEETH guys in
the subway ads _ share several uncanny similarities. They tend to
come from blue-collar backgrounds. Many are ex-musicians and share
a vision of the dentist as artist. Their own fake teeth always look
amazingly real.
</P>
<P>
   But each has a unique style. And even a selective sampling
reveals a distinct typology.
</P>
<P>
   The Smile Lifter
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not God,'' Rosenthal said. ``I'm only a dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his patients might disagree, with the ``only'' part
anyway. Rosenthal's same-day, $15,000 smile lift has attracted
chief executives, socialites and models and generated a puff piece
in last November's Vogue hyped with the cover line ``Smile! How to
Buy Cover-Girl Teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most telling detail of Rosenthal's resume is
that he once worked as a lounge piano player on a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   He seems congenitally up. His motivational patter is nonstop, a
live infomercial. Imagine a kinetic cross between Michael Douglas
and Tony Robbins. ``People ask me, `Larry, when do you rest?''' he
said. ``I say, `When I'm preparing teeth and reshaping them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal and his family spent last Easter in Palm Beach, Fla.,
as a guest at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. His 50th birthday
party in the Hamptons last summer drew a guest list of patients
sufficiently notable for an item in The New York Post: Trump,
Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford, Sandy Korn Taylor (a former Penthouse
Pet).
</P>
<P>
   But as for all celebrity dentists, it is the nonfamous who keep
Rosenthal in $40,000 laser machines. Enid Goodman, a nonfamous
prospective patient, from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., had come for a
consultation in his wood-paneled office on East 76th Street after
reading the Vogue article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked out some people in my area, but they didn't seem as
good,'' she said, flattening her vowels like rivets on an assembly
line. Ms. Goodman had had plastic surgery six weeks earlier _ ``so
my face is kind of lopsided'' _ and said she now wanted a
``brighter smile,'' adding, ``But I don't want to leave looking
like Jim Carrey.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely. Rosenthal has built his reputation on natural-looking
porcelain veneers that can cost up to $2,000 apiece, almost double
the fee of a non-brand-name dentist. His patients do not get the
blinding, uniform laminates derisively known in the trade as
Chiclets.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year he plans to roll out a consumer product line
bearing his name, including an electronic toothbrush and dental
floss that he said would remove stains between teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the Beatles know they were the Beatles?'' he asked,
pondering his legacy. ``Did Muhammad Ali know he was Muhammad Ali?
I'm not saying I'm in that league, but ....''

 &HT;    EDS: CORRECTS factory reference in seventh paragraph.
 &HT;    A year later, FBI still believes Rudolph in N.C. mountains
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 31
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ This seems such an unlikely place to find a
domestic terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime is rare and people in this town of 2,600 don't
hestiate to speak to strangers. The streets are adorned with
rambling old Victorian homes and stately churches. A few families
still keep chickens in backyard pens. From anywhere in town is a
breathtaking view of 5,000-foot high peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet federal authorities remain convinced that accused bomber
Eric Robert Rudolph still is somewhere in these mountains into
which he disappeared a year ago. Led by the FBI and the U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, about 200 federal and state
agents continue the 12-month search on foot and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   They remain convinced that Rudolph is here because they have no
proof he is anywhere else. He knows the mountains, they point out,
and the dense forests where he learned survival skills as a
teenager near his remote home in the Nantahala community. The
country is so rough that it can conceal an airplane crash with no
trace to be found.
</P>
<P>
   And some residents think he still is here because he is getting
support from local sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   An old textile factory along the railroad tracks is now a
heavily guarded command center for the Southeast Bomb Task Force.
Helicopters rumble over the town day and night. Each morning,
squads of law officers, often with tracking dogs, fan out over the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, a carpenter and former soldier, is charged with a
series of bomb attacks that began at Centennial Olympic Park, where
one person was killed and 111 others injured, during the 1996
Summer Games and ended with the Jan. 29, 1998, explosion at a
Birmingham abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer
working as a security guard and seriously injured a nurse. He also
is accused of setting bombs in 1997 at a Sandy Springs abortion
clinic and at an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say he was motivated by extreme anti-government and
anti-abortion views. He is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list and
carries a $1 million reward on his head.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the most intense manhunts in American
history, the pursuit of Rudolph also has resulted in painful media
scrutiny of this town and surrounding villages. Community leaders
contend the area has been linked unfairly to anti-government
extremists who have settled in the mountains the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people here support what (the agents) are
doing,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said. ``We may have some militants around
here, but no more than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to find Rudolph sympathizers in Andrews,
it is not so difficult in the rural community of Nantahala north of
here. In a high and remote mountain valley, Nantahala is where the
Rudolph family moved from Florida when Eric Rudolph was 14 in 1981
and where he lived off and on until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here I'd say it's 50-50 as far as the people who would
turn him in and those who wouldn't,'' said John Wagner, as he
sipped coffee in Nantahala's only restaurant, The Lake's End Grill.
``A lot of people say he killed people who were killing babies.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wagner's wife, Joy, who writes a regular column for the
weekly Andrews Journal, disagrees. ``I think those who support him
are just a few.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the town of Andrews has tried to make the outside
law enforcement agents feel welcome. Over the Christmas holidays, a
number of agents were invited into local homes for dinner, while
residents delivered food to the command center.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have presented programs to Scout groups and attended
local churches. FBI and ATF officials have maintained for months
that most citizens have cooperated fully, offering information
about Rudolph's background and tips about his possible whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mayor and others are at a loss to explain why on a
chilly night in November several rifle rounds were fired at the
federal compound. One bullet grazed an agent inside the building
and narrowly missed another.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the shooting and federal agents
declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack. A few days
after the shooting, leaflets were distributed in town calling the
investigators ``jack-booted thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the community, theories about who fired the shots range from
Rudolph sympathizers to drunken teens or maybe a jealous husband.
Some residents say they feel agents overreacted by continuing to
press misdemeanor charges of impeding the investigation against a
local mechanic arrested the night of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Rogers, 45, admits to shining his son's toy laser on a
surveillance helicopter as it flew over his house. Agents said they
thought it was a laser-targeting device used on sharpshooting
rifles. Rogers was quickly swarmed by at least 10 agents who threw
him to the ground and handcuffed him, recalls Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it was a dumb thing to do,'' says Rogers, a life-long
resident of Andrews, who says he was not aware of the shooting at
the time. ``But I was just playing with my little boy's toy laser
he got for his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were led the day after the Birmingham blast to
this rugged area where Cherokee and Macon counties. The
registration for a gray Nissan pickup truck seen near the clinic
was traced to Rudolph, who rented a mobile home in neighboring
Murphy. He was charged Feb. 14 in the Birmingham attack. In
October, federal agents declared they had enough evidence to also
charge Rudolph in the three metro Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The last verified sighting of Rudolph immediately after the
Birmingham explosion was Jan. 30, 1998, when he rented a video,
Kull the Conqueror, in Murphy. He resurfaced briefly in July and
obtained food from a friend living in the Nantahala community.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, George Nordmann, a noted local herbalist who owns a
health food store in Andrews, waited four days before alerting
authorities. By then, Rudolph again had slipped into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, authorities said Rudolph had obtained six months'
worth of food. They think he now may be hiding in a bunker, cave or
old mine and may be running short of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he is still here,'' Woody Enderson, the FBI agent in
charge of the task force, said at a recent media briefing. ``There
is no evidence that he has left, and, as we told you before, he has
to have food, and may make a significant move to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   That move may come soon, Enderson added.
</P>
<P>
   It would be virtually impossible for the fugitive to live off
the land, especially in winter, and not be conspicuous about it,
says Burt Kornegay, a guide who has led numerous hiking and camping
trips into the mountains where Rudolph is thought to be hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's either dead and been eaten by a bear or someone is
helping him.''says Kornegay, owner of Slickrock Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   With food, the hiding places are nearly unlimited. The 30-mile
prime search area is mostly within the Nantahala National Forest.
The remote peaks are thick with stands of hardwoods, which shade
jungle-like tangles of laurel and rhododendron. Water is readily
available from a myriad of springs and creeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, a private plane piloted by the father of an
agent flying to visit his son crashed into the remote ridges. The
plane has yet to be found, despite an intense air search.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't find something as big as an airplane that is
fixed in one place, what makes people think it would be so easy to
find a person who can move around?'' asks former Cherokee County
Sheriff Jack Thompson. Part of the search has concentrated on
trying to locate abandoned mines and caves in the area. Darren
Free, a Hendersonville, N.C., spelunker is assisting agents in
their search for old mines.
</P>
<P>
   Free says there are about 300 mines in the area, most of them
abandoned pits for digging mica, gold, corundum and other minerals.
Some are narrow tunnels dug back into the mountain, he adds, and
would provide excellent hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be very stressful on the agents,'' says Lee
Colwell, former associate director of the FBI and now director of
the University of Arkansas Criminal Justice Institute. ``They know
they are very vulnerable to him. In many ways he has the upper
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rudolph is receiving aid from an area resident, it does not
surprise Mark Potok, who helps track hate groups for the Southern
Poverty Law Center. Intelligence gathered by the Montgomery civil
rights organization indicates that western North Carolina is a
``center of anti-government activity,'' along with the Ozark
Mountains in Arkansas and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Potok contends that most of these people moved into the area
because ``there are few minorities there, it's very white. It's
rural. There's a lot of privacy. And it's the Bible belt and they
feel comfortable there.'' But Andrews Police Chief Clay Hardin, who
is also a minister for Mountain View Baptist Church, says just
because many residents are traditional Christian conservatives does
not mean they support the tactics of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that most people in this area are conservative and
are against abortion,'' he says. ``I don't think they would cover
up for him, though. In fact, many people have been helpful (to
investigators).''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rudolph may have escaped long ago from this area.
That is the opinion of Gary Perlstein of Portland State University,
a criminologist who has studied the militant anti-abortion
movement. He thinks Rudolph may have tapped into a sort of
``underground railroad'' for militants fighting abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who may not murder a doctor, who may not blow
up a clinic, but they understand why the person did it and deep
down have some empathy with them,'' Perlstein said. ``They are the
kind of people who would help move him across the country.

   The Players
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities are as nice, if not nicer, than average people,''
Lowenberg said, in the small private office of his Central Park
South practice. The office is decorated in a style that could be
called early Carnegie Deli. Floor-to-ceiling celebrity glossies are
autographed with fulsome sentiments of thanks and praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going to him so much,'' said Courtney Cox, who first
went to Lowenberg when she was nobody and he was ``just this young
hip guy'' willing to put her on a payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Julianna Margulies found him in the Yellow Pages when she was a
21-year-old waitress with a badly replaced front tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to two dentists who said we'd have to give you six new
teeth,'' Ms. Margulies said. ``Marc said, `Just some tweaking, and
we'll make it match.''' She still flies from Los Angeles to New
York for checkups.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer, another devoted patient, enjoys Lowenberg's
company enough to go out to dinner with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known a great many dentists over 75 years,'' Mailer said.
``And I don't remember ever looking forward to seeing any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Show-business people seem almost to regard Lowenberg as one of
their own. Four years ago, a producer patient suggested that
Lowenberg try directing a play. ``It was about a man and a woman
picking each other up in a bar,'' Lowenberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was staged way off-Broadway, and though it was hardly a
critical or a commercial coup, the experience clarified his true
calling. ``When I had the choice of being a director and being a
dentist,'' he said. ``I knew I would never direct again.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Lituchy, 40, came to work for Lowenberg, 52, as a
Columbia University dental student and still seems slightly awed by
his charismatic mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant businessman,'' Lituchy said of Lowenberg,
noting his idea to hire a masseur to rub anxious patients'
shoulders in the waiting room, or massage their feet as they
recline in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenberg estimated that half his mid-six-figure income from his
thousands of patients comes from what he calls smile makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s a physician friend who treated the Rolling Stones
sent Ron Wood and Keith Richards his way. He has been treating
dentally underprivileged celebrities ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Cseh, a Hungarian model, provided the startling
before-and-after shots gracing the outside of the Lowenberg-Lituchy
press kit and video. Eastern Europeans have supplied an influx of
candidates for their services, as have rap and hip-hop stars, many
of them sent by the music impresario Russell Simmons, himself a
patient of Lowenberg. On the wall of fame is a signed, framed cover
of the February issue of Vibe, featuring Foxy Brown, a rap star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half my practice is in this magazine and I have no idea who
these people are,'' Lowenberg exclaimed, sounding stunned that
famous people exist who are unknown to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sy Presten, the practice's press agent, turns some of those
famous names into gossip items. But such is the status of the
celebrity dentist that details of Lowenberg's personal life made
the papers when, a year ago, he started dating a patient, Joan
Finkelstein _ the society-page ex-wife of Jim Finkelstein, a former
owner of the New York Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   How did he like reading about his romance on page six?
``Initially, I was embarrassed,'' he said. ``But you get used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dentist-Artist
</P>
<P>
   Not in name only is Golub-Evans a hyphenate. Two business cards
sit on his receptionist's desk. One reads, ``Jeff Golub-Evans,
D.D.S.'' The other is for ``Jeff Golub-Evans/Mixed Media Artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The white exposed-brick walls of his airy brownstone on East
71st Street are decorated with art (his own) and giant, blown-up
magazine covers of Paulina Porizkova, a patient and model.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating one of his woodcuts, he said, ``A bunch of these are
in a museum of Bali.'' He taught dentistry on the island last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a brown turtleneck, blue wool pinstripe pants and Doc
Martens, he could be a hip, well-paid college professor. Or a more
respectable Lou Reed, with his wary gaze, quietly intense manner
and New York-inflected drone.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his generation, Golub-Evans hoped dental school
would help keep him out of Vietnam, he said. It didn't. Having
joined the reserves in 1966 after finishing dental school, on the
bad advice that reservists wouldn't get called up, he was sent to
Vietnam anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Golub-Evans figures he has done 30,000 porcelain veneers over
the course of his career. He calls the people he treats clients
rather than patients, ``because they're not sick,'' he said. ``This
is the era of the designer dentist and dental salons.''
</P>
<P>
   As a dentist-artist, he can also paint a broader mega-picture of
his trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make celebrity smiles, and other people then want to
reproduce those smiles,'' he said. ``We create the illusion of
beauty, rather than the reality.''

CHARITY REALLY BLOOMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the world of flowers and florists, there are
the Rose Parade and Las Floristas.
</P>
<P>
   During the latter's dinner-dance at the swanky California Club
in downtown Los Angeles, I learned it isn't an organization of
florists, but a group of women who came up with a fragrant idea in
1938 to raise money for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   The evening in which florists and mannequins (i.e. models) for
the April 23 Las Floristas Floral Headdress Ball were announced had
a South Seas theme reflected in the pink-and-green floral-trimmed
invitations as well as the decor, which included lavish
centerpieces topped with huge white and purple cata le ya orchids.
</P>
<P>
   And as partygoers entered the dance floor through a
flower-covered archway, I noticed many women wearing flowers in
their hair.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burbank floral designer Clark Jellison, ``The
entire floral scene has changed. Corsages on the chest are rarely
seen and have been replaced by flowers in the hair. And when it
comes to bouquets, the era of a simple design is gone, and we're
back to the era of Victorian elegance with a profusion of
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said large orchids are making a comeback, but the single
hottest flower of the moment is the gerbera daisy from South Africa
_ but you wouldn't wear one in your hair or in a corsage because
they need to be in water, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who closed his floral shop and began creating
flower arrangements on a grander scheme for the Rose Parade (two of
his floats won prizes this year), and his partner Kelly Burke have
planned a rain-forest theme for their entry in the annual contest.
According to Burke, the mannequin's headdress will include parrots,
dragonflies, a monkey and lots of dried flowers. Fitting all those
critters can't be taken lightly; the masterpiece will weigh as much
as 30 pounds and reach 6 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   As we dined on filet mignon, with a dessert of creme brulee in a
pool of chocolate sauce topped with an orchid and a chocolate
butterfly, dinner chairwoman Gail Reeves of Encino told me about
the organization. She says there are 400 members who work to raise
money to support clinics for handicapped children _ including
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center and USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising money through dining-for-dollars galas, the
members help with Valentine's Day and Halloween parties at the
hospitals and even put the children on gurneys and take them out to
hunt for Easter eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Also at my table was longtime member Katherine Bentley, who
explained to me that the group started from the very beginning with
headdresses as a way to be different in a sea of charitable
organizations. They started out small with simple flowers
arrangements, but now every flower arranger in town wants to be in
the competition _ and only eight are chosen. So the winning florist
carries the same clout in his or her business as an Oscar-winning
actor.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The sluggish storm system that barraged the southern Plains and
western Gulf States with combinations of heavy rain, snow, hail,
flooding, thunder, sleet and freezing rain Friday will drift
east-northeast from central Texas Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A line of heavy thunderstorms will march across east Texas into
Arkansas and Louisiana Saturday morning as humid air from the Gulf
of Mexico is vigorously lifted by a cold front associated with the
storm system. The line will forge eastward during the day, bringing
locally heavy rain, flash flooding in some areas and a slight
threat of severe weather, which will come mainly from strong winds
and isolated tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, moderate to locally heavy rains will douse the
Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys as moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico is forced to glide over a layer of cooler air next to the
ground. Rainfalls of two inches or more are possible in some areas.
To the west, a stripe of moderately heavy snow will fall across
parts of western Kansas and northwest Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rain will develop across southwest
Oregon and northwest California as a cold front barrels inland from
the Pacific. Steady rains will change to scattered showers and
isolated thunderstorms as a trailing jet stream disturbance comes
ashore. The chance of thunder will be restricted mainly to the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, snow showers and snow flurries will develop again
over Cape Cod as cold winds blowing from the north-northeast are
moistened in transit over the relatively tepid waters of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Boreal Alaska
</P>
<P>
   As the coldest air mass since 1989 knifed southward over Alaska
early Friday, the air temperature plummeted to minus 71 degrees
Fahrenheit at Chandalar Lake in the northern interior. Along the
western Arctic Coast, the merciless combination of frigid air and
hyperborean winds lowered wind-chill values to below minus-80
degrees. Wind-chill values as low as minus 100 degrees were
forecast for Friday night. Across the southern tier, winds gusting
to 60 mph early Friday at Prince Edward Island were the precursor
of stronger winds that were expected to gust as high as 110 mph
Friday night.

children in the Third World. His observation, initially ridiculed
by many scientists, is now saving the lives of millions of children

   STEM-CELLS _ WASHINGTON _ A major national debate has begun over
whether the U.S. government should invest research money in human
stem cells, the primordial units of life that ultimately grow into
fetuses and human beings. Because they are ``undifferentiated,''
stem cells can theoretically be used to produce any type of tissue,
and eventually perhaps, any organ in the body. Some researchers
already have begun to talk about a time when people will be able to
``grow'' their own perfectly compatible transplant organs or the
nerve cells that could rescue victims of Parkinson's disease or
Alzheimers. But the research involves using cells grown from
deliberately killed human embryos, and Congress has prohibited
research on embryos. A Senate hearing Tuesday was the opening round
in the debate that pits hope against deeply held moral beliefs.

Professors were being plucked off the streets in kidnappings. At

Department slapped a ban on U.S. travel to Lebanon. That ban was

war. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   FROM THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION
</P>
<P>
   FBN-CHUCKSMITH _ MIAMI _ Chuck Smith, who grew up in Athens,
Ga., spent his childhood Sundays at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium
watching the Falcons during their lowlight film days. So he knows
the history and what the team must overcome on Sunday to shed the
image. Smith is a throwback in pro football _ tremendous respect
and knowledge of the game. (Wilkinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

on the Super Bowl. What's legal? (Friendly wagers? Office pools?)
What's not legal? (Offshore/online Betting?) Where do you start,
and would you want to? Gamblers Anonymous should be ready with an
answer. What are ``the line'' and ``the odds'' and the ``juice?''
(Farber, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER-COMMERCIALS _ What to watch for, how much they cost, etc.
(Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER-CHAPLAIN _ Former Dallas Cowboy Charles Collins, 52, is
the soul man of the Super Bowl-bound Atlanta Falcons. Since 1983,
Collins has been chaplain to the Falcons. He understands football
since he played at Campbell High School in Smyrna, Auburn
University, Dallas and two teams in the Canadian league before
coaching 7 years at McEachern High School. He attributes his own
faith to a Jesus freak brother-in-law and a locker room Bible study
in Saskatchewan. He's seen the Falcons through plenty of bad times.
Now, he's enjoying the good. (Gwhite, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   FROM THE WEST PALM BEACH POST
</P>
<P>
   SUPERPARTY _ MIAMI _ Last year in San Diego, the NFL rented out
the convention center for a night to throw its annual bash. We
figured the NFL paid roughly $8 million for that thing. They had

etc. Apparently, the NFL thinks public relations is very important.
(Moffett, Palm Beach Post).
</P>

he ought to be caged. Usually, that depends on whether you met him
on the field or off the field. (Cantu, Austin American-Statesman).

 &HT;    Parents should follow pope's example when it comes to our kids
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ It didn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of jubilant teen-agers packed a sports stadium, waving
signs and screaming in adoration. The object of their unbridled
affection was not the current ruling rock band, but a 78-year-old
man who speaks in heavily accented English and dresses funny.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II did it again in St. Louis last week as he did
in Denver in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He drew young people like a magnet _ adoring young people, some
of whom openly disagree with his teachings on things such as
ordination of women and the death penalty. Yet they still came to
cheer, and give him gifts and shower him with their love.
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard to understand this sort of behavior toward a
religious leader by some of the most pampered, cynical, rebellious
youth in the world: American kids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we who are parents, if we stop and think about it, will
recognize these children as our own _ the ones who test every
barrier we erect and challenge each rule we set. We know they love
us despite it all, because we love them and we provide for them and
we stick with them no matter what. We also know that, eventually,
they come around and they do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this man who resides in a foreign country and has no
wife, no children of his own, what does he offer them?
</P>
<P>
   His faith.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of their views, which sometimes oppose his, and in
spite of their rebellion, he still believes in them. While he talks
about baseball and soccer, he also encourages them to train to
follow Christ. He playfully feigns a hockey shot with his cane, but
he also challenges them to ``live responsibly the truth of our
relationship with God and with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   They hear no uncertainty from him about what he believes is
right and wrong. That's not true for many of the adults from whom
today's teens seek guidance. And John Paul II doesn't wait for
young people to come to him. He seeks them out.
</P>
<P>
   So should we.
</P>

   DELPHI _ The unions that represent GM's Dayton-area workers have
agreed to promote the Delphi Automotive Systems spinoff to
potential investors in a stunning turnaround for GM-Union
relations. Nick Nichols, chief GM negotiator for the IUE, delivered
a speech late last year to about 600 GM executives and received a
standing ovation. Nichols' theme was that GM and its workers must
be partners in this spinoff if it's to succeed. In exchange for the
IUE's support, GM has agreed to extend the retirement benefits
cut-off date for IUE members until Oct. 1. IUE will also be
eligible for significant discounts on trucks and cars through 2000.
This contrasts to the heated battles that have characterized GM's
relations with the UAW, it's largest union. But there is some
evidence, at least here in the Miami Valley, that the frostiness
between GM and the local UAW membership is thawing. (Wagner, Dayton

with to 24 cities in Georgia that are more than 40 miles from the
nearest IRS office. Monday, the vans will visit the first three
cities: Elberton, LaGrange and Tifton. (Tharpe, Atlanta

   DELPHI _ The unions that represent GM's Dayton-area workers have
agreed to promote the Delphi Automotive Systems spinoff to
potential investors in a stunning turnaround for GM-Union
relations. Nick Nichols, chief GM negotiator for the IUE, delivered
a speech late last year to about 600 GM executives and received a
standing ovation. Nichols' theme was that GM and its workers must
be partners in this spinoff if it's to succeed. In exchange for the
IUE's support, GM has agreed to extend the retirement benefits
cut-off date for IUE members until Oct. 1. IUE will also be
eligible for significant discounts on trucks and cars through 2000.
This contrasts to the heated battles that have characterized GM's
relations with the UAW, it's largest union. But there is some
evidence, at least here in the Miami Valley, that the frostiness
between GM and the local UAW membership is thawing. (Wagner, Dayton
Daily News). 30. WITH PHOTOS AND CHARTS. FOR SUNDAY

nearest IRS office. Monday, the vans will visit the first three
cities: Elberton, LaGrange and Tifton. (Tharpe, Atlanta

the two entities for the TV contract _ and made money from both

record-setting 59 at the Bob Hope. His golf game is so solid, so
terrifying for competitors, that they all wish he'd pack it up and

   OLY-LAGRANGE _ LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga., became a
training center for African Olympic athletes in the months before
the Atlanta Games and wound up awarding academic scholarships to
Africans. That raises the question as to whether the scholarships
were payback for African support for Atlanta. (Turner, Atlanta

<P>
   BKC-UGA-AUBURN _ When star player Chris Porter was suspended for
three games last week, it was thought that the Auburn Tigers would
struggle. Instead, the Tigers have won their two games without
Porter and will look to win their third straight today at Georgia.
The fact that the Tigers continue to win without Porter adds to an
already impressive season which includes a 19-1 record and the
nation's No. 7 ranking. (Towers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).18.

   OLY-CONFLICT-OFINTEREST _ Alex Gilady is a part-time executive
for NBC. He also is an IOC member who works on the committee's
radio/TV commission. He was a middleman in the negotiations between
the two entities for the TV contract _ and made money from both
sides. He is an example of people who work both sides of the fence
behind the Olympic scenes and raises conflict-of-interest
questions. This system apparently will continue even while the IOC
cleans up its act on awarding bid cities. (Fish, Atlanta

   GLF-DUVAL _ David Duval is in one of the hottest ``zones'' in
golf history, a stretch that continued last Sunday with a
record-setting 59 at the Bob Hope. His golf game is so solid, so
terrifying for competitors, that they all wish he'd pack it up and
go home. ``We're playing for second,'' is the common refrain. For
years, critics snickered that Duval didn't have what it takes to
win. Now, after winning the first two tournaments of 1999 and more
than an $1 million in January, they think he may never lose.

SUPER BOWL XXXIII: WHY ATLANTA WILL WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Key stat: Chris Chandler _ 118.6 quarterback rating last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: While John Elway was struggling early in the
conference final against the Jets last week, Chandler was hot
against Minnesota. He started that way, and ended the game that
way, finishing 27 of 43 for 340 yards, three touchdowns and a
quarterback rating of 110.6.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should have been surprised by Chandler's showing.
While much of the attention this week has been focused on whether
or not Elway will retire after Super Bowl XXXIII, the fact that
Elway has not played his best and Chandler is playing great
football has been overlooked. In the end, that will be the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, because of Chandler, have started off quick almost
every game the last part of the season. While running back Jamal
Anderson is a crucial part of the offense, bruising and bashing
teams, it is the Atlanta passing game that can at times be more
deadly, especially in the ``red zone.'' Anderson may push the team
between the 20-yard lines, but it is Chandler's pinpoint passing
which leads to the touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years with the Falcons, Chandler has not thrown an
interception in the ``red zone'' while throwing 24 touchdowns. The
mistake the Vikings made was to pay too much attention to Anderson,
stacking the line of scrimmage with eight men, daring Chandler to
beat them. One gets the feeling that Denver will try the same
approach because Broncos players have talked all week about
Anderson as if he were Jim Brown. But in interviews they've barely
mentioned Chandler. It is the same thing the Vikings did, and
Chandler took notice, saying after the game he was insulted by what
he thought was a lack of respect. Don't think he isn't paying
attention now.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense will be tougher than Minnesota's. They are
meaner, to be sure, but the Jets exposed some serious weaknesses.
Because of slow safeties, Denver is extremely vulnerable to fast
wide receivers, and the Falcons have two of the quickest in Terance
Mathis and Tony Martin. Denver also has a hard time covering
receivers who run crossing patterns in the middle of the field,
something else Mathis and Martin do well. And there is no one on
the Broncos who can effectively cover tight end O.J. Santiago, now
a force in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Vikings, he had three catches for 54 yards,
including a 26-yard reception on the team's final drive. In his two
seasons, Santiago has 19 catches of at least 15 yards. The Falcons
have a great chance to win this game if Chandler keeps tossing
those pinpoint passes. But perhaps most importantly, coach Dan
Reeves must continue to be aggressive with his play calling, as he
was against the Vikings and as he has been all year. A past
criticism of Reeves in his previous Super Bowl appearances with the
Broncos was that he tightened up and became conservative. You can
bet Mike Shanahan will be trying to score 50 points against his old
buddy. But he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 20-17.

THE BUBBLES MUST BURST, IF THEY'RE REAL BUBBLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is pretty easy to be excited and amazed about exciting and
amazing technology stocks. It is equally easy to be scared to death
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 250 stocks that make up Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's
technology index rose 55.4 percent, the biggest annual gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   And the gains have not stopped; for 1999 through Friday, the
index, which does not include Internet stocks, was up 13.7 percent.
The firm's Internet index is up 48.6 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   All good things, of course, come to an end. And expectations are
high and rising that sooner rather than later the bubble will
burst, particularly for Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But from his office in Half Moon Bay, Calif., Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, took some time
last week to share his views on why technology stocks are likely to
remain white-hot.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Last summer, technology stocks stumbled badly, along
with everything else. You don't think that selloff was justified,
do you?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I don't. There was a real fear last summer and early fall
that personal computer sales were not growing and communications
and semiconductor sales were never going to pick up. It was utterly
wrong. At the time, we were in the process of seeing accelerating
sales, which have continued into this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the communications side _ hardware, routers and switches _
there never was a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor pricing bottomed in May or June, and now we are
hearing that there is a real imbalance of supply and demand for
certain, mostly higher-valued, chips. And that has translated
pretty quickly into orders for semiconductor equipment. So the
business looks like it may be approaching a year of normal growth
in 1999. And 2000 may be a boom year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why is that?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are three legs to technology: communications, computing
and biotech. All three are having very strong positive product
cycles. It is those product cycles that drive the business, not the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the semiconductor industry's forecasting meeting in Monterey
earlier this month, they were talking about sales growth of 7
percent for 1999, but with sales exiting the year at a 20 percent
growth rate, which is a tremendous amount of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year, we will get Windows 2000 from
Microsoft, which should further personal computer spending. The
Internet will continue its build-out, which will further
communications spending. In biotech, we had 50 new drugs approved
last year, almost double 1997, and this year we expect that 80 new
drugs will be approved. There are 10 profitable biotech companies
today. That number will probably double this year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How do you think this forecast will play itself out
in the stock market?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. For the last 18 to 24 months we have had a very strong rally
in the big technology stocks, the Microsofts, the Dells, the MCI
Worldcoms. If this move is going to continue, it will spread out to
the smaller-cap issues. If it doesn't, I think the rally will die.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Oracle is selling at or close to an all-time high,
but Informix is selling at half its previous all-time high. Cisco
Systems is extremely overpriced, but Premisys, another data
communications company, is underpriced. There are lots of mid-cap,
second-tier companies that are selling at big disparities to the
leaders.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Speaking of overpriced stocks, what is your opinion
of Internet shares?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. We are short most of the Internet stocks. My theory has been
that you can pop a bubble like this without taking the rest of the
market down.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bubble has to pop because the supply of stock is so
large. Investment bankers are filing as many offerings as they can,
and lots of stock is beginning to unlock from IPOs done last year
as insiders are allowed to sell their shares.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Has Internet mania inflated prices of issues that
are not pure Web plays?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The Internet has infected the rest a lot more than I thought
it would have. Cisco, for example, has gotten an extra run because
people believe the overwhelming demand will spread out.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What do you tell people who own shares in companies
you consider overpriced or fully priced _ the Microsofts, Intels,
Ciscos and Lucents of the world?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I tell people that companies like these are core holdings,
that even if in the short term they go down, don't buy them so you
can trade the shares. There are none I would run out and buy this
minute, but none I would sell right now because they are grossly
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   I think people should have 30 percent to 50 percent of their
portfolio in these kinds of stocks. If you don't already own them,
start dollar cost averaging into them over a six-month period.
</P>

SO YOU WANNA BE A ROCK 'N' ROLL STAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Bill Nighy got the gig playing a narcissistic
rock singer in the movie ``Still Crazy,'' he knew he had a lot to
learn, particularly since he was going to do all his own singing.
He came to realize, though, that the singing was the least of his
worries. The real challenge came during the instrumental breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they never tell you,'' Nighy says dryly. ``When
the guitar player takes his solo _ and since this is a '70s band,
it's a really long solo _ you've got to do something as a singer.
But what?''
</P>
<P>
   What indeed? These are the things Nighy never thought about when
he was dancing around his home in London, practicing his Mick
Jagger moves and mortifying his 14-year-old daughter to no end.
Here's what Nighy was told by the movie's musical advisers:
</P>
<P>
   1) Walk back to the drummer and have a fake chat, ``which is
good,'' Nighy says, ``because it takes a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Make creative use of the towel or the water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   3) Stand at the mike looking straight ahead as if you're having
some kind of creative, moody experience (a favorite of Oasis singer
Liam Gallagher)
</P>
<P>
   4) Dance your way through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would be especially reckless and dance, but I
found out that once I did, after the three or four moves that I
thought looked great, there was still acres of time left in the
guitar solo,'' Nighy says. ``I tell you, this rock star thing is a
lot harder than it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the premise of the wickedly loopy and
surprisingly touching ``Still Crazy.'' The film follows a
splintered '70s band, Strange Fruit, trying to regroup after 20
years. All the old tensions and resentments between the Fruits
still exist, and the band must cope with fallout as well as the
fact that rock's youth culture has moved on without them. While it
sounds a bit like Rob Reiner's classic mockumentary ``This Is
Spinal Tap,'' the movie distinguishes itself with its warmth and
humanity and fully realized and recognizable characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have moments in our lives where our life is dead,''
says director Brian Gibson. ``We might have money and family, but
there's something creatively missing, and we need to prove
ourselves anew. That theme is central to this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' also gets all the musical details right, not
surprisingly given that it comes from the writers who gave us ``The
Commitments'' (Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) and the director
responsible for the Tina Turner biopic ``What's Love Got to Do With
It'' (Gibson).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group must examine what killed them off in the first
place,'' Gibson says. ``In their case, they were petty and fearful
and jealous of one another. They were drug-ridden. Each character
must deal with the same issues he dealt with then _ and this time
break through them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Stephen Rea (``The Crying Game'') as the
flat-broke keyboard player with an unrequited love for the band's
personal assistant (Julie Aubrey), and Jimmy Nail, who plays a
virtuoso bass player openly contemptuous of strutting lead singer
Ray (Nighy). A wonderful array of British actors and comedians _
Billy Connolly and Timothy Spall among them _ fill out the cast.
It's Nighy, though, who steals the show. Sony, the film's
distributor, has even mounted a modest Oscar campaign on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Ray is a big reason why I did this movie,''
Gibson says. ``Then we met Bill Nighy, and I knew he could bring
this sensual man to life. Without him, the movie would be sweet,
but it would have no real center. And his voice was an added bonus.
He probably could have made a living as a rock singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Nail, a popular singer himself who tours England and has a
gold album to his credit: ``I was immensely impressed how Bill
carried it off. He was a little sheepish when he first came into
the recording studio, but that wore off quickly when we made him
feel at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Nighy says, it took a little longer than suspected for
him to become comfortable playing a rock frontman. First, he had to
get past the clothes or, rather, get into the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through four pairs of unspeakably tight trousers doing
high kicks on the final number,'' Nighy says. ``Then there were the
3-inch heels, the hair extensions and the fake, full-length fur
coat. But I think the most disturbing thing was that I had to wear
my shirt three buttons open down to the navel. That was shaky for
me, because I don't think I have the most attractive chest in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Before filming began, Nighy worked with a vocal coach who
forbade cigarettes and alcohol and told him to get plenty of rest.
Once Nighy entered the studio to record his songs, however, he
received a different message from the musicians who recommended
smoking, drinking and sex between takes to achieve truly superior
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up taking a middle approach,'' Nighy says smiling. ``A
moderation of excess if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this guy really could be a rock 'n' roll star. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta posts higher hotel occupancy rates
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's less room at the inns in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy in metro area hotels was 65.8 percent in 1988,
surpassing a 20-year average occupancy level of 64.8 percent and
ending three years of declines, according to preliminary figures by
PKF Consulting in its 19th annual survey of hotel general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta occupancy rates also outpaced the national rate. Based
on the report, which was prepared by PKF and Smith Travel Research,
the national average occupancy last year was 65.7 percent, down
from 66.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is a key indicator of the health of the lodging
industry, which is a major employer in the area and an important
segment of Atlanta's economy. The final report is scheduled to be
released in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitality is a $16.5 billion industry in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Higher occupancies and development of new properties has been
fueled ``by the general business and commerce growth that we find
prevalent throughout metropolitan Atlanta,'' Mark Woodworth,
executive vice president of PKF in Atlanta, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer numbers of available rooms, for example,
Atlanta ranks fourth in the nation with 75,000 rooms, trailing Las
Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Los Angeles, all of which draw major
convention and business travel.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found:
</P>
<P>
   _ The demand for hotel rooms in Atlanta rose by 9 percent,
second only to Houston, which increased 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Total room sales increased by slightly more than 12 percent to
$1.4 billion. When other sources of hotel revenue such as food and
beverage are included, the amount increased to more than $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ 42 new hotels, or 4,400 rooms, were added to the Atlanta
market in 1998. Only Phoenix added more rooms last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average price of a room in Atlanta rose by 2.8 percent.
The average price was not noted in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Revenue and demand growth was strongest along the Ga. 400
North corridor, followed by the areas around Gwinnett Place and
Town Center malls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only two sectors experienced slight declines _
convention-oriented hotels downtown and hotels in the Emory/
Decatur area. The declines were attributed to increased competition
elsewhere in the metro area.
</P>
<P>
   The market is expected to continue at a modest pace this year,
said Woodworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operators feel very optimistic about 1999,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mit Shah, executive vice president of Noble Investment Group,
which owns and operates hotels in Georgia and the Carolinas, said
some areas of the Atlanta market are extremely strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Atlanta is really a bunch of very different
submarkets,'' he said. ``In general we are very positive on
Atlanta. I don't think there is an underserved market in Atlanta.

LOOKING FOR THE NON-SUPER BOWL AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Couch potatoes today can choose between marathons
of cartoons, country music, ``Murder She Wrote,'' ``Absolutely
Fabulous'' or ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' Oh, there's also a
football game on.
</P>
<P>
   You know a day has achieved national holiday status when so many
channels are airing special programming. Not that anyone expects to
beat Fox's ratings: Based on past viewership, today's Super Bowl
XXXIII is expected to attract roughly 130 million viewers _ a
whopping 64 percent or so of all U.S. households that are watching
television. Still, millions of other viewers who aren't fans, or
who are merely restless with the game, will have alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mayberry lovers, stock up on videotape: TBS runs a 24-hour
``Andy Griffith'' marathon, starting at 3 a.m. It's Fife-O-Mania!
For the slightly more highbrow, A&AMP;E reruns the perennial favorite
``Murder, She Wrote,'' kicking off at 9 a.m. One warning: If you
saw them the first time around, you already know whodunit. And for
those who are just too fabulous to rise before noon, Comedy Central
shows viewers' favorite ``Ab Fab'' episodes, beginning at the
civilized hour of 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cartoon Network puts a twist on reruns: It features four
hours of classic Warner Bros. Sylvester and Tweety cartoons with
``color commentary'' from well-known football hosts including Pat
Summerall and John Madden (the block is scheduled for 1 to 5 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the all-time great rivalries: Tom and Jerry,
Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Tweety,'' gushes Rob
Sorcher, executive vice president of Cartoon Network's U.S.
division. Don't be surprised if the showdown next year is between
ultimate enemies Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner: The network is
getting back rights to those cartoons from Nickelodeon this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sorcher admits there's a hard-nosed business logic at work.
``This kind of stunt programming usually gives us a ratings bump.
... We promote the hell out of it,'' says Sorcher with a laugh.
With this Super Bowl theme _ and a starting time two hours before
kickoff _ the channel hopes to get the attention of men who might
normally think of the network as just for young children. Cartoon
Network is even taking out its first-ever ads in newspaper sports
sections to promote the show.
</P>
<P>
   Cable's Country Music Television (CMT) is similarly trying to
grab some attention beyond its usual, predominantly female
audience. Beginning at 7 a.m., CMT is running a 12-hour marathon of
interviews and music videos from such performers as Garth Brooks,
Dwight Yoakam and Dolly Parton.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Country Music Showcase
marathon features highlights from CMT's series of the same name.
Chris Parr, CMT's director of programming, confides he wouldn't
mind if the Super Bowl is a one-sided joke. ``If the game's a
blowout in the first quarter, I'm looking great. You kind of hope
that will happen as a programmer,'' Parr says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those who plan to be glued to the set for most of
the game _ but who aren't interested in the NFL's halftime musical
pastiche of Gloria Estefan, Stevie Wonder and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
_ MTV offers up a halftime ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's battle of the animated clay figures pits Dolly
Parton and Jennifer Lopez, followed by Mike Tyson and Evander
Holyfield. An on-screen clock counts down the minutes left before
halftime's over _ hopefully not before you see MTV's ``fantasy
version of what would happen if Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield
met for a no-holds-barred claymation fight to the finish,'' as MTV
ominously puts it. Let the biting begin. &QL;

   Such is the renown of Warren E. Buffett that 10,000 admirers
flocked to last year's shareholder meeting in Omaha for his
conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway. Many of them regard publication
of the company's annual report, whose main feature is Buffett's
folksy philosophizing, as a highlight of their financial calendar.
And people gladly shell out $30 for two decades' worth of the
chairman's collected letters.
</P>
<P>
   So why would this icon of Graham and Dodd investing, a man
stingy with public utterance, who cares nothing for short-term
performance, suddenly decide to establish a special link to Wall
Street, cultivating a fraternity he has often disdained?
</P>
<P>
   And why did Buffett agree to give Alice D. Schroeder, an analyst
little known outside insurance circles and employed by a primarily,
ugh, retail brokerage house, unprecedented access to Berkshire _
access that culminated in her issuing a report on the company last
week, marking the first time a major Wall Street firm has covered
the Omaha conglomerate?
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to an inquiry by The New York Times, in
which he said he did not actually ``seek'' a Wall Street
intermediary, Buffett said he had been impressed with Ms.
Schroeder's research. ``It was clear to me that she was a superior
analyst, both in her knowledge of the insurance business and in her
willingness to do the legwork to garner facts,'' Buffett wrote. He
added that he thought she was the only analyst to attend the
special meeting at which Berkshire stockholders voted on last
year's merger with the General Re Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder, 42, who said she ``nearly fell out of my chair''
at Paine Webber's midtown-Manhattan office when Buffett first
called, confirmed the rumor that he had provided direct access for
her to the people who have run Berkshire with such success that
each $10,000 invested in 1965 is now worth some $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I would do him a favor,'' Ms. Schroeder recalled.
The idea was to see that Berkshire, transformed by last year's
purchase of General Re, the nation's largest direct writer of
reinsurance, is less misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder, who says she works 80 to 90 hours a week and has
hung a boldly lettered ``No Speed Limit'' sign next to her desk,
set about reading the voluminous public record on Buffett and
Berkshire _ annual reports and transcripts of meetings going back
decades, biographies and the occasional speech.
</P>
<P>
   After building the most elaborate earnings model she had ever
created for a company, Ms. Schroeder met with Buffett in New York
one November day, flew with him to Omaha and then toured various
Berkshire-owned businesses, including the famed 72-acre Nebraska
Furniture Mart and Borsheim's, a giant jewelry store.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts resulted in the appraisal distributed to Paine
Webber offices last week, the first time, according to Ms.
Schroeder, that Berkshire has been examined by an insurance
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite obsessing over Buffett, Wall Street has done
only cursory work on Berkshire over the years. The company is a
poor source of business profit for Wall Street since it has little
need for investment banking and since its shares tend to be salted
away for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a price target, Ms. Schroeder instead takes a page
out of Buffett's own investing manual by estimating Berkshire's
so-called intrinsic value, the discounted value of all future cash
flows, a figure that is a key to security analysis as practiced by
Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, who wrote the book on value
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Her conclusion, after repeatedly scaling back assumptions to
avoid a number so high that it would have been ``absurd,'' is that
Berkshire's current intrinsic value is $91,000 to $97,000 for each
class A share. The stock closed Friday at $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the analysis is Ms. Schroeder's rejection of the
notion that Berkshire is basically a closed-end investment company
whose value is determined mainly by the prices of the shares of
Coke, Gillette and other stocks in its portfolio, with some premium
added to account for the Buffett mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she regards Berkshire as a holding company whose main
business _ 79 percent of earnings _ is property-casualty insurance.
Next comes its fast-growing aviation business, which trains flight
crews and markets fractional ownership of executive jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thrilled'' and enlightened as she was by Buffett's special
attention, Ms. Schroeder said her report, which she views as a
``tool kit'' for fellow laborers, contains virtually nothing she
could not have derived from the public record. ``He's been very
scrupulous,'' she said, in avoiding the impropriety of selective
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, in his statement, said: ``I believe that interested
investors can obtain all of the information they need about
Berkshire from our published materials, but the quantity available
may overwhelm them. Alice may fulfill a useful function by
organizing and distilling.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do Buffett and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice
chairman, do for their next trick? Ms. Schroeder denies any
knowledge of Buffett's next move _ one of the investment world's
best-kept secrets _ and declines even to guess. She writes in her
54-page report: ``We don't know. Please don't ask.''

   DENVER: such as Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune
</P>
<P>
   These artistic blessings flow from Seawell's powerful historical
influence over the board of the Bonfils Foundation (his son is now
the chairman), which gives $4.2 million a year to the Denver
Center, partly to make up for any losses incurred by DCTC. The
theater claims an annual budget of $6.5 million and no current
deficit (the Alliance has a budget of more than $9 million and
carried a $700,000 deficit into the current season). The Denver
numbers seem startlingly low for such an extensive operation and
may be deceptive because the parent complex ``wipes our slate clean
at the beginning of each season,'' according to a DCTC spokesman.
The Woodruff Arts Center likewise pays all bills for its component
parts when they go into the red but still expects, say, the
Alliance to pay back its deficit over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blockbuster tours (``Riverdance,'' ``Titanic'') that
play at the other end of the galleria help subsidize the DCTC.
(Woodruff Arts Center staffers would surely salivate at the thought
of tapping into, say, blockbuster musicals at the Fox). Also, the
Denver Center pays for the National Theatre Conservatory, including
living expenses for its students, thereby creating another casting
pool for the DCTC. By contrast, the Alliance has shut down its
internship program _ causing cries of dismay among local artists _
which is credited with attracting some of Atlanta's best actors to
town, as the theater searches for a way to afford a new joint
internship program with a local university.
</P>
<P>
   All of DCTC's financial good fortune appears to translate into a
healthy artistic climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complacency is a danger you always have to fight,'' says
Anthony Powell, a leading actor-director, ``but there's a lot to be
said for minimizing outside pressures. We get what I call `quality
of life' audience here, people who come to Denver not only for
fresh air but for mental stimulation, and they tend to run younger
than at other regional theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking to Bob Westenberg,'' Powell continued,
``who can have his pick of roles on Broadway (``Into the Woods'')
but who's here this season because, he says, `I want to have a
family and I want to be an actor!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``God, it's great to be paid well and live in a good community
and find out that work doesn't have to be a constant crisis,'' says
Randy Moore, who survived two stormy auteur artistic directors as
longtime leading man of the Dallas Theater Center and recently
began a second career in Denver with actress-wife Norma Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The power of modesty
</P>
<P>
   No one ever mentions Marley's name in the same breath as
``auteur'' _ in fact, with all due respect, his name doesn't get
mentioned much in the theater world at all. He isn't one of those
artistic directors _ such as Robert Falls of Chicago's Goodman
Theatre, Carey Perloff of San Francisco's ACT, Kenny Leon of the
Alliance _ whose work is regularly seen outside his home city or
known for a distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   A big, kindly, avuncular New Mexico native, Marley quietly ran
California's Pacific Conservatory for the Arts for 20 years before
being summoned to DCTC by Seawell in 1983. He's a throwback among
nonprofit artistic directors: an older white male of conservative
temperament (``Guilty as charged!'' he says, raising his hand to
cheerfully acknowledge this characterization). And yet his
repertoire is diverse. Marley is proud to have mounted ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'' in a state where gay
issues are especially explosive, and he was the first to cast women
in this previously all-male work.
</P>
<P>
   Still it's in Marley's modest, un-``artistic'' character to let
his boss, Seawell, take the spotlight, even when the two accepted
the Tony together on national TV last June. ``If I'm overshadowed,
I'm delighted,'' Marley says. ``At a benefit gala, Don can walk
into the room, and every eye and checkbook goes to him. A key to my
success here is that, unlike many artistic directors, I'm not
waist-deep in fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was also a Marley-esque idea to pass the Tony trophy to
250 current and past employees of the DCTC, lined up from the
street into the main stage. Some hugged it, kissed it, twirled its
silver medallion. Local TV stations recorded this moving ceremony
of collaborators, which one anchorman described as ``Denver's
proudest moment since the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Donovan,'' says Powell. ``That's Denver.''
</P>

 &HT;    Denver's super arts center
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If there is one fact about Denver that smacks you
across the eyes, driving in from the airport _ it's space. Miles of
it, gulfs of it. The sky seems to start a few feet off the
table-flat ground and extend up past the rarely clouded sun. Two
things jump from the prairie: the Rocky Mountains and the silvery
city skyline in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   A place to make an artist think big. A canvas for bold strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The strokes were bold, all right, if not very tidy, the day in
1972 that Donald Seawell _ a former Broadway producer, then
publisher of The Denver Post _ had a brainstorm while walking
downtown and sat down on a curb with a pen and envelope. Facing
four square blocks of little-used buildings and lots, Seawell
sketched what became the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. His
drawing yoked together the 1908 neoclassical Auditorium Theatre, a
vacant police headquarters and sports arena and several projected
new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Today the center _ seeded by $65 million from the Bonfils
Foundation (Seawell, conveniently enough, ran this philanthropy of
the Post's controlling family) _ is second only to New York's
Lincoln Center in capacity, with 9,300 seats. Its facilities
include a 1978 concert hall, a 1991 theater for touring Broadway
musicals, the refurbished Auditorium for touring plays and smaller
musicals, a 1987 cabaret/bar, a parking/retail building and the
four-stage facility of the Denver Center Theatre Company, winner of
the 1998 Tony Award for achievement by a regional theater.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra,
Atlanta Opera, the Fox Theatre (with its touring musicals) and a
couple of fringe theaters were all massed in one downtown Atlanta
tract.
</P>
<P>
   Down the center of this 12-acre, balanced-budget operation,
which has a $41 million annual budget ( $27 million from ticket
sales) runs a two-block galleria. With reddish Colorado sandstone
underfoot and a glass roof overhead, flaring out at the ends like a
giant champagne flute, this galleria is a beacon in the heart of a
downtown that was as dark and silent as a tomb20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the dressed-up crowds packed into that galleria: It's
like, `Get your ticket!' and `Where do we meet them?' and `Do we
have time for a drink?' '' says Claudia McMurdo-Wallis, who
recently played an Atlanta matron in the DCTC production of Alfred
Uhry's ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo.'' ``It's a New York energy,
but in a setting that feels friendlier and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Seawell, an old-school patrician of 86 (see article above),
boasts that the Denver Center's theatrical productions alone sell a
million tickets a year in a city of 2 million. As former chairman
(now president emeritus) of the Bonfils, he concentrated the $110
million endowment on building and sustaining the Denver Center,
``instead of trying to play Santa Claus to a whole variety of
causes,'' he says, in an interview at his Denver Center office. ``I
knew that the center could make the greatest impact on the
community. And look around: They can't build condos and lofts fast
enough now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on a recent evening there were crowds, horse-drawn
carriages and vending carts up and down the pedestrian mall (16th
Street) that runs most of the length of downtown, and a good chunk
of the crowd was veering off to the Denver Center entrance two
blocks away. It was a scene that would be the envy of almost any
city, let alone quiet-core Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the oil economy went down (in the 1980s), downtown might
have dried up completely without the arts center,'' says Susan
Powers, a developer of residential projects near the Denver Center.
``Now, with baseball at the other end of downtown (Coors Field,
home of the Colorado Rockies, opened in 1995), suburbanites are
spending more time and money here than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Room to breathe, dream
</P>
<P>
   Space, again, is the leitmotif inside DCTC, the 20-year-old
resident theater company. There's an amazingly abundant supply of
it throughout this complex-within-a-complex, including stages of
700, 427, 250 and 200 seats (the Alliance Theatre, by contrast, has
two stages of 800 and 200, and occasional access to the 300-seat
14th Street Theatre). The extra stages mean that a hit play can
settle into one space as a long-term revenue spinner. DCTC became
probably the nation's most spacious regional theater in 1991 with
the addition of the 1911 Tramways building across the street. To
tour its vast scenery shops and rehearsal rooms is like entering
another, enclosed city.
</P>
<P>
   It's space put to good use, as DCTC rolls out 10 to 15
productions a year, with a strong contingent of classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only major theater for 1,000 miles in most
directions,'' says artistic director Donovan Marley, 61, ``so we
have a responsibility to be many things to many people. I want my
daughter to enjoy `Peer Gynt,' and if we don't do it here, it ain't
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Space to burn is only one of the DCTC's pricey special features
that are rare among regional theaters. It can afford to mount the
yearly US WEST festival of six to eight world premieres, some
experimental, some garnering acclaim in larger cities (1993's
``Black Elk Speaks''). DCTC can afford to share resources with the
Harold Prince Musical Theater Program, a laboratory to create
Broadway-bound shows (last year's ``Eliot Ness . . . in
Cleveland''). It can afford to keep a repertory company of 14
actors on a partial-season contract, and 14 on full-season, in
contrast to the show-by-show hiring of most residential theaters.
There are pros and cons to this system, designed to keep actors at
relatively isolated theaters such as the Alabama and Oregon
Shakespeare festivals, and it wouldn't necessarily help casting
quality in a larger actor pool such as Atlanta's.

 &HT;    Mel revisits uneasy territory in edgy `Payback'
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After winning best director and best picture Oscars
for ``Braveheart,'' Mel Gibson didn't go to Disney World. He went
to work, starring in ``Ransom,'' directed by Ron Howard, and in
``Conspiracy Theory'' and ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' both directed by
Richard Donner. On Friday, he's back in ``Payback,'' playing a
small-time crook named Porter, willing to go through hell, high
water and a dozen or so dead bodies to get back $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview last week from his Los Angeles office,
Gibson spoke about ``Payback,'' his career and life after Oscar:
</P>
<P>
   A: He's not such a happy camper, ol' Porter. He's enigmatic. You
never know what he's going to do, and he does kind of
unpredictable, pigheaded stuff. So it's hard to get a read on him.
A character like that can really make people uneasy. He makes me
uneasy. If I meet somebody like that, I don't know what they're
going to do. And they don't express much, so you don't know what
they're thinking. Nothing. Scary guys.
</P>
<P>
   I met a fellow like that one time. He was with the SAS. It's a
kind of elite commando unit in Australia. He was in his 40s, and he
had a really pretty nasty history. Once you got to know him, he was
OK, but initially he frightened the hell out of me. Because he
never expressed anything. He'd just stare at you. You wondered if
he wanted to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   A: Porter certainly had to be that. I don't know whether it
helps (my image) or not, but it certainly serves this story. You
know, get your teeth out. But mostly, I just liked the story. When
I was growing up, I watched Don Siegel movies and Sam Peckinpah and
``Dirty Harry'' and ``Charley Varrick'' and ``The Getaway.'' I
loved that stuff. This, for me, was like a retrofit (going) back to
those kind of movies. But by virtue of being shot in the '90s, you
push the envelope a little further. And because it's looking back
in a little way, it's kind of an homage. So you can take yourself
less seriously. Although I don't think those folks took themselves
too seriously either. The gratifying thing for me was that people
laughed all through it. So they got it. Because it's also supposed
to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All the brouhaha written about the making of ``Payback,'' the
rewrites. Bringing in a second director. Can you tell me what
happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. I'm the producer of the film. You look at it, and
you have a sense of responsibility. To myself first, and then to
the studios, the people who give you the money. I wanted to change
some things. So we worked on it. We put our creative hats on and
came up with a solution and approached Brian (Helgeland, the
original writer-dir-ector; he also wrote ``Conspiracy Theory'' and
won an Oscar for co-writing ``L.A. Confidential''). We asked him if
he would make these changes. He opted not to do it because he felt
it compromised his principles and, you know, he's got strong
principles. He stuck to his guns. You gotta give him 10 points for
that. But then he stepped aside and let what had to happen happen,
for the benefit of the film. He was very professional and
responsible. He was never fired. His name is still on it. And for
the greater part of that film, that's him. That's his deal. I hate
it when you get in controversies like this. Bad blood and all that.
But the answer's really very simple. We're in the business of
filmmaking, and there are different facets and everyone has
different jobs. There are people you have to satisfy. I feel that
Brian was responsible. I feel that I also did the job of
responsible producer. We made the film as good as we could.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a line that Chris Rock said about you: ``The cool
thing about Mel Gibson is that he is Mel Gibson.'' So, what does
being Mel Gibson mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) You know, I'm still trying to figure that one out.
But if I ever do figure it out, you'll be the first person I call.
No, no. I'll have to tell my wife first. She wants to know the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever people write about you, whether they adore you or
slam you, they always mention your boyishness, your energy, your
impulsiveness, your practical jokes. Are you channeling your inner
9-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think we ever get over that. And that's a good thing.
In a ``traditional religious'' sense, they say you're supposed to
nurture that child and maintain some kind of innocence. And that is
so easily killed off. I've pretty well destroyed mine, so maybe I
try to get back to it through the back door, which is by acting
like an adolescent. But I think that's true of most guys. They grow
up, and they're still big kids. They like the game. I'm watching
the Tyson fight and you know, I'm biting my nails, yelling at the
TV screen. That's kid behavior. Bobbing around in the chair. I
think guys are more likely to do stuff like that than women. I
think women are more mature about life in general. Or at least it's
a good trick, and they're keeping it from me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of sports, any words of encouragement for the
Falcons in the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Watch your back. (Laughs.)

   ATLANTA: Watch your back. (Laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the ``Braveheart'' promotional tour, everyone asked if
there would be a ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' and you said no. But then you
did it, and it was a huge hit. Why did you change your mind and why
do you think that series has held up so well?
</P>
<P>
   A: I changed my mind because Dick (Donner, the director) and
Joel (Silver, the producer) started to get on me. You get in a room
with these guys, and they get you laughing. Then you start throwing
ideas into the pot. It's sorta like the dumb fighter. They ring a
bell, and the guy starts punching. That's me. It was Pavlovian.
They got me in a room and rang a bell, and I started drooling. So I
ended up on board, and I enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   I love working with Dick. It's the sixth time we've worked
together, and that's pretty weird. Who'd think you'd work with
someone that often? He's like a benevolent uncle. He's one of
nature's gentlemen. And funny. And smart. And I've learned so much
from him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what is it about that series?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. I just think people like those two guys.
They're kinda goofy and relaxed. But it's really hard to deliver
those guys. Every time it gets harder. So I really don't think
there'll be another.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This time three years ago, you were taking the first steps
toward what turned out to be a really great Oscar night. Any advice
for this year's front-
</P>
<P>
   runners?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just don't waste too much energy. (Laughs.) Man, it'll drain
your energy. There's just so much attention focused on this stuff.
You've got to be ready to lose. Because you can get really
disappointed. But I was not disappointed at all. I was really
gratified.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there such a thing as post-Oscar depression, and if so,
did you suffer from it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I really didn't. That's an interesting thing. I wondered
if there would be. The next day, I thought, that was that and it
was just back to normal. But you start in your mind thinking, now
what am I going to do next? I'm not going to back off. I just want
to do stuff better. Then you start moving your wheels about how
you're going to get friends for ``the boys.'' The boys are on the
shelf and they need friends. (Laughs.) There's two of them. Perhaps
they'll start multiplying when I'm out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've quit smoking. Does this mean you're going to make
``Thank You for Smoking'' (a long-contemplated project) or that
we'll never see it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, you'll see it. It'll probably be on HBO. It's a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you still be involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. Producing-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about ``Fahrenheit 451'' (based on the Ray Bradbury
sci-fi novel about a futuristic society where reading is banned)?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I've worked on it for years and will continue to do so.
It's on a back burner at the moment, and it's real hard to get it
on a front burner. A lot of things have to fall into place for it
to happen. So I'm just waiting to win the lottery on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's next? More acting, more directing, both?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure. I really don't know. If you've got any
yardwork, I'm available. I really have absolutely nothing in front
of me at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In previous interviews, you've attributed your longevity to
the fact that you ``love (making) movies so much.'' That sounds
honest. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. I really dig the process. It can consume and involve
and make you richer and all that stuff. It's a really good exercise
to go through. Kinda like battle plans. And you can have a
profoundly moving experience. No matter how commercial a movie is,
it can still be art.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jodie Foster said that one thing she admires about you is
that you ``can so elegantly make an audience relax.'' How hard is
it to make it look easy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I guess the ease of the thing comes with time. It
wasn't always that easy. I used to butt my head up against the
wall, but you don't get too far that way. I'd like to think that I
can relax people so they can enter the story vicariously along with
me, if that's what's required _ and it usually is. But I thought
you were going to say she said I had nice legs or something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In that mode, whose eyes are bluer, yours or Paul Newman's?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) I don't know. I'll have to check the salad dressing
bottle.

 &HT;    Cherokee healer looks to plants, herbs to cure what ails you
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABERDEEN, N.C._ He can make aspirin from willow; he can make a
poultice from comfrey. And antiseptic from thyme. Thomas Broken
Bear Squier is a plant man, a plant medicine man.
</P>
<P>
   Part Cherokee Indian, ex-Green Beret, author and lover of stock
car racing, Squier is a large man (but not as tall as he used to
be) with hair swept back in a ponytail, a direct gaze and a soft,
resonant voice. His knowledge of botanical medicine is
encyclopedic, his passion for it palpable.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when plant medicine enjoys rising popularity, tinged
with controversy over whether it is science or charlatanism, Squier
stands steadfastly on his ancestors' historic practices and beliefs
and asserts that there's nothing elusive about having a good supply
of healing plants: ``If you have a yard big enough to mow, you
probably have a dozen plants you could use for medicine, or food,
or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Practicing what he preaches, Squier, a hard-worn half a century
old, collects his cane on this chilly night and launches a tour of
his 3 1/2 acres in south-central North Carolina, where pine trees,
sand hills and golf courses flourish. The land around the home he
shares with his wife of nine years, Frances, is rich in berries,
bark, leaves, roots, stems _ and, yes, herbs _ that Squier grows
and uses in everyday remedies.
</P>
<P>
   First stop: a man-high eucalyptus, whose dried leaves ``can be
crushed,'' says Squier, ``to release their oil into salves for
making your own `vapor rub.' '' He adds that mixing the leaves in
olive oil makes a good decongestant that can be rubbed on the
chest. Of course, eucalyptus leaves also are well-known for their
use as purely-for-pleasure fragrance bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of pleasure, Squier's hops make most beer lovers think
of nothing but the brew, but he points out that the vine's flowers
and dried leaves ``can make a tea that has a lot of sedative
properties,'' adding that, ``Historically, hops have been used to
treat insomnia, restlessness and tension _ and to stimulate
appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a story or a homily about every plant he grows or knows.
</P>
<P>
   Take sassafras, whose roots make tea, while the crushed dried
leaves are turned into the spice called file powder. Stopping at
his sassafras tree, Squier painstakingly demonstrates how you can
find three different leaf shapes on the same tree.
</P>
<P>
   That says something about diversity, he observes: ``All these
leaves look different, but they all come from the same tree. People
are the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's pokeweed, which grows whether you want it to or not
and is a traditional early-spring dish in the South, revered for
its tender leaves that are both tasty and tonic. Poke salad.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the berries are poisonous, Squier says they can
combat pain when used in proper doses by experts: ``I know an
84-year-old lady, an herbalist, who takes pokeberry to relieve the
pain of arthritis, and I've seen her up in the top of a tree
picking cherries.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indians used the berries and poke roots to treat boils
and cancers, says Squier, whose maternal grandfather, Joseph Thomas
Jones, was ``a Cherokee root doctor.'' Squier credits him with
guiding him toward plant healing during Squier's younger days in
his native Cherokee, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me much of what I know about using plants for
medicine. He was definitely a healer.''
</P>
<P>
   Squier notes that much of traditional Cherokee healing involved
heat, including the kind you get from peppers. While capsaicin, the
substance in pepper that makes it hot, is enjoying a surge of
popularity for its painkilling properties, Squier says that his
grandfather, who today ``would be looked upon as primitive,'' used
ground-up red pepper years ago in a salve to treat joint pain.
</P>
<P>
   `They never took all'
</P>
<P>
   Such remedies resonate with Holly Shimizu, managing director of
the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden in Richmond. In the 1980s, she
designed a Native American garden at the U.S. Arboretum, where she
was the first curator of the National Herb Garden. Shimizu was
chief horticulturist at the U.S. Botanic Garden from 1988 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native Americans always knew the value of plants,'' she says.
``And they never took all of a plant. Today, because botanical
medicine is becoming so popular, some plants could face
extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, says Squier, many Native Americans ``go past the first
seven plants and take the eighth so there will be some left for the
next seven generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with such tradition and infused with a passion for
adventure, young Thomas Keith Squier embarked on a lifelong quest
to teach the value of plants. Following graduation from high
school, he joined the Navy in 1966 and did time in Vietnam, driving
small boats on jungle rivers. Switching to the Army in 1976, he
joined the elite Special Forces and taught survival training to
Green Beret aspirants, showing them how to live off the land and
how to treat illnesses with plants _ including how to grind willow
bark to make a painkilling tea, heal broken bones by wrapping them
in comfrey leaves and boil thyme to make an antiseptic wash.
</P>
<P>
   Squier studied plant medicine throughout his military career,
and when he retired in 1993, he intensified his efforts to spread
the word about plants as food and medicine, lecturing and writing.
His books include ``The Wild and Free Cookbook'' (Loompanics
Unlimited, 1996) and ``Herbal Folk Medicine'' (Henry Holt and Co.,
1997). His day job is as veterans' service officer for Hoke County.
</P>
<P>
   In none of his writings or teachings does Squier claim that
plants work medical miracles. But from the afflictions he
describes, he himself is something of a medical miracle, having
suffered everything from a broken back _ in a parachute jump in the
late 1980s, a crash into a concrete wall that smashed him from 6
feet 3 inches to 5 feet 10 1/2 inches and inspired the name
``Broken Bear'' _ to stomach cancer, which he says is in remission.
The ultimate toll on him of Agent Orange, the controversial
defoliant the United States used in Vietnam and which many war
veterans blame for subsequent illnesses, is unknown, he says. (``If
I'd known I was going to live so long, I'd have taken better care
of myself,'' he quips.)
</P>
<P>
   Conventional healing deals with his overwhelming problems as
best it can, but Squier says he does drink mint tea to calm his
stomach. Mint certainly works for wife Frances, who says, ``When I
get sick on the stomach, I'm like a cat. I go out in the yard and
eat some mint.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient and modern
</P>
<P>
   As the evening grows older and darker, talk in the living room
turns from mint tea to sassafras. The Squiers serve some up,
warning that its taste is strong. It is, but it's also pleasant,
like root beer.
</P>
<P>
   Squier says that ``many turned away'' from sassafras tea a few
years ago amid government claims that it causes cancer, but his
ancestors considered it a good diuretic and used it to reduce blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the clash between ancient practice and modern fear.
While respecting the ancients, Squier is also careful to give
modern medicine its due. And he assiduously avoids promoting any
remedy as a sure-fire cure, noting that to do so would be illegal.
Moreover, he cautions that many plant concoctions can kill you if
you don't know what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Herbal Folk Medicine'' he writes, ``With so many
complicated new diseases and conditions being diagnosed today, it
is probably dangerous to treat some forms of illness with herbs
alone. The key is to get all the information you can about both
traditional and alternative forms of treatment, and then use that
knowledge to make intelligent health-care decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shimizu suggests the term ``complementary medicine''
instead of ``alternative medicine,'' adding that her personal and
professional knowledge tells her that plant medicine works best
when you ``stay healthy and not allow your body to become weak.''
For example, echinacea (coneflower) root, widely hailed as an
antiviral agent and immune system booster, is most effective if
used before illness really takes hold, says Shimizu.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues, however, are mercifully uncomplicated. Squier's
love and respect for nature, for example. ``I always lived close to
the earth,'' he says, sipping sassafras tea. ``I like taking care
of the earth. Take care of the earth, and it will take care of
you.''

 &HT;    Shaw redeemed choral canon _ and Atlanta, world the richer
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Welcome to Atlanta. Robert Shaw has died.
</P>
<P>
   I thought the world of Robert Shaw and looked forward to meeting
him as part of my new job as classical music writer at the
(Atlanta) Journal-Constitution. Now I'll never have that chance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as I've talked to members of Atlanta's
cultural community about his passing, I've gotten a very good sense
of who he was.
</P>
<P>
   My high school and college choirs _ like thousands of others in
the middle decades of this century _ sang a slew of pieces arranged
by Shaw and his longtime partner, Alice Parker. We didn't know they
were works that changed the course of American choral music, but we
sure knew they made for good singing. Maybe that's the tribute Shaw
would have liked best.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaw/Parker pieces were all folk music: black and white
spirituals, sea chanteys and hymns, and Christmas carols. They were
notable for clean arrangements and subversive harmonies _ just
pointed enough to arrest the ear but not enough to trigger the
``illegal dissonance!'' alarm on one's mental dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hall, music director of the Baltimore Choral Arts Society
and president-elect of the national service agency Chorus America,
says, ``He brought to people's attention a great chunk of
indigenous music, recorded them with professional choirs and
arranged them so that any high school, church or college choir
could sing them.''
</P>
<P>
   In this, Shaw was like the Hungarian composers Bela Bartok and
Zoltan Kodaly. They spent years traveling throughout the back
country of Hungary and Central Europe, notating the songs and
dances of villages and ethnic enclaves before industrialization
passed over them like a wet sponge, neatening up their robust
rhythms and sugaring all the tang out of their harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   What Shaw is primarily known for in Atlanta is building the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra into a respected national entity. But
don't forget how he got here. In the 1950s, when Shaw formed the
Robert Shaw Chorale and raised the Cleveland Orchestra's chorus to
the exacting standards of George Szell, the title ``choral
conductor'' was synonymous with ``second-rate.'' Those who could,
conducted orchestras; those who couldn't, well, they stood up and
waved their hands at choirs. High school music teachers were choral
conductors. Musicians such as Shaw and Margaret Hillis, the dynamic
director of the Chicago Symphony Chorus, got no respect.
</P>
<P>
   So when Shaw (who briefly had been music director of the San
Diego Symphony in the 1950s) began to think again about an
orchestral career, no reputable American orchestra would consider
him. The combination of his blunt, plain American name and his
blunt, plain American hands _ for choral conductors almost never
use the baton, a European symbol of authority _ got him a blunt,
plain American rejection slip.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Atlanta, where an orchestra barely out of its
community phase was looking for a music director. Knowing that he
wasn't the best podium technician but figuring that his name on all
those choral records couldn't do any harm, the ASO hired Shaw. I
don't know that the ASO board thought any further ahead than
building an audience for the next season, but it soon realized what
it had gotten.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw believed in living composers as well as acknowledged
masters, and more than once his programming of difficult
contemporary works landed him in hot water. Long before Yoel Levi's
partisans bought billboards around town protesting his dismissal,
ASO subscribers revolted over the board's decision to terminate
Shaw's contract after his fourth season. He was saved by a write-in
campaign that netted 3,500 subscribers _ keeping the faith, in ink,
on their ticket-reservation forms by stating they wanted Shaw to
continue. When Shaw retired from the ASO in 1988 after 21 years, it
is probable that he had brought it the farthest the fastest of any
American orchestra. That kind of accomplishment is its own
testament. But when Tim Page, music critic of The Washington Post,
said Shaw deserved to be on the list of the most influential
American musicians, he wasn't talking about the orchestral career.
He meant the choral legacy.
</P>
<P>
   More than any single figure in American music, Shaw turned
around our expectations of what a choir should be, and what it
should be able to do. For 75 years, choruses in big American cities
had been congenial community sing-along organizations such as the
Handel &AMP; Haydn Society in Boston, the Mendelssohn Club in
Philadelphia and the May Festival Chorus in Cincinnati. Shaw led
conductors, who in turn led their audiences, to expect professional
ensembles that could perform, individually and collectively, on as
high a plane as their symphony counterparts. And he turned those
choruses from social organizations of European immigrants into
American institutions of musical craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Another Shaw hallmark was his deep belief in musical
responsibility. Even those who cannot forget the tongue-lashings he
gave his singers recognize that his temper, his demands and his
driven rehearsal manner all stemmed from his love for the music he
led and for the composer who had created it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put so much sweat into the study of the scores,'' said
Roswell choir director Michael O'Neal, who was in the ASO chorus
for years as section tenor and soloist. ``By the time he was ready
to conduct the first rehearsal, he'd already put in so many hours.
For those of us singing for him, how could we do any less? He
didn't want to let the composer down, but there's no question that
we didn't want to let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shared an unusual and humbling story about Shaw after a
reviewer had criticized him for refusing a solo bow despite
prolonged audience applause. (It showed a lack of respect for the
audience and the performers, the critic said.) Shaw apologized to
his choir before the next evening's performance, telling them how
much he respected and appreciated them. In private, he told O'Neal
why he could not take a special bow: ``I was ashamed,'' he said.
``I'm always ashamed after a concert, because of how I have
failed.'' Every note meant so much to him that if one went amiss,
he believed the whole performance suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it did. But the ears of heaven, I suspect, pay no
attention to those human imperfections. The most sublime works of
Western music are the choral/orchestral masterpieces Shaw conducted
so well: Mozart's C minor Mass, Verdi's ``Requiem,'' Handel's
``Messiah,'' the major works of Berlioz and Elgar, Britten and
Vaughan Williams, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and Mahler's
``Symphony of a Thousand.'' I doubt that God gives demerits because
of a hissed final ``S'' or a chord that takes a moment to
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite books as a kid was a young reader's biography
of Stephen Foster called ``He Heard America Singing.'' It strikes
me that it might be a good title for a profile of Robert Shaw. He
was a great man and a great musician who took nothing about his
talent for granted.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry he left town the day I got here.

 &HT;    Alliance ought to be next in line for Special Tony
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ You may not have heard much about the other Super Bowl,
the face-off of top regional theaters, played quietly behind the
scenes last spring. Denver won. Atlanta was shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Denver Center Theatre Company steal the Alliance Theatre
Company's Tony Award?
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking larceny here. Both companies are richly
deserving of the Special Tony for achievement by a resident
nonprofit theater (the more precise term for what are commonly
called regional theaters, though many are in New York). The
question is, which theater deserves it more?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alliance clearly deserves the Tony,'' says board chairman
Ken Bernhardt, ``especially with our track record in the creation
of new work,'' which includes Pearl Cleage's ``Blues for an Alabama
Sky'' and Alfred Uhry's ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo,'' both of
which went on to become two of the most frequently staged plays
across the nation. ``And we had the national spotlight here for
`Elaborate Lives,' so we'd certainly expect to be in contention
(for the Tony).''
</P>
<P>
   I am no shill for the Alliance, but I agree. 1999 ought to be
the Alliance's year, if there's any justice. Having seen some of
the great productions that brought the Tony in years past to the
Steppenwolf Theatre of Chicago, the Alley of Houston, La Jolla
(Calif.) Playhouse, etc., I know the level of competition. The
Alliance was nowhere near it 10 years ago, but it's there now. Add
to this that, at 30 years old and with a $9 million budget, the
Alliance is the largest and second-oldest theater in America never
to win the prize. The mere fact of such community service over
three decades should sway those who select the winner.
</P>
<P>
   And who might these selectors be?
</P>
<P>
   They're members of the American Theater Critics Association
(Full Disclosure No. 1: I was a member in the 1980s, then let my
membership lapse, but will rejoin). Any member can nominate, and
second, a theater for the Tony. The group votes to select one
nominee to recommend to the Tony administration in New York, which
has never failed to give it the award.
</P>
<P>
   A pattern appears. Critics who host the annual spring
conventions of the theater association very often land the group
nomination for their leading local theater because it's often the
first time that some critics are able to confirm with their own
eyes the good reports they've heard about that theater. (Full
Disclosure No. 2: The association's convention in Atlanta in 1989
was an exception, a case of unfortunate timing, because it was just
before Kenny Leon took over the Alliance and the whole local scene
began rising).
</P>
<P>
   The silver Tony medallion is only about half the size of a
Frisbee, mounted upright, but for winners it means prestige, ticket
sales and appreciation from local funders that translates into more
generous contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jones, Chicago-based correspondent for Variety and the
theater association's Tony committee chairman, listed some of his
members' reasons for nominating Denver: a leading actor-training
program; location in a huge, underserved region; and the annual US
WEST festival of premieres. This fest is so prolific on paper that
the association nominated Denver before its convention there last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes that most association members are well aware of
the Alliance's merits. He said the nomination process is
confidential but didn't rule out the possibility that, Susan
Lucci-like, the Alliance may have been a runner-up that could never
quite win the tiara.
</P>
<P>
   I can't fully assess the Denver Center Theatre Company from a
recent two-night sojourn. Certainly the facilities are first-class,
the artists eloquent. For the record, Denver's ``Christmas Carol''
is the best I've ever seen (that's saying something: The Alliance's
is excellent), but its production of ``Ballyhoo'' paled beside the
1996 Alliance original.
</P>
<P>
   I found it more enlightening that Denver _ like 19 other U.S.
theaters this season _ chose ``Ballyhoo,'' winner of the 1998 Tony
Award for best play, for its season. By contrast, some of the more
widely circulated plays from Denver's US WEST are overrated
(``Quilters,'' ``The Immigrant'') or are pleasant musical revues
that didn't take a lot of vision to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Denver artists repeated is that, until the Tony, they
felt remote and overlooked by the country: ``We're out here, man!''
says actor-director Anthony Powell. Yes, geography can be unfair to
a theater, and the Alliance is still tasting that injustice.

   DENVER _ If it weren't for two bewitching Southern women _ one
of them Tallulah Bankhead, the other his wife, Eugenia Rawls of
Dublin, Ga. _ Donald Seawell, the aristocratic 86-year-old founder
of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, might never have
gotten mixed up in the crazy world of the theater. And the Rocky
Mountain region would be culturally poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Seawell (pronounced SUE-ell), seated erect in his familiar
double-breasted blue blazer in a Denver Center office that's larger
than some rehearsal halls, recalls that he first spotted Eugenia
walking _ on the arm of another man _ across the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill campus.

<P>
   ``I said, `How do you do? I'm going to marry you.' And she said,
`You'll have to wait, I have a career,' '' says silver-haired
Seawell, who traces his ancestry back through wealthy Carolina
planters to a 17th-century Massachusetts judge. ``I walked off with
her, and as far as I know the young man is still standing --
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia's career was as an actress, playing in a 1940s tour of
``The Little Foxes'' opposite Bankhead (more on her role in the
Seawell saga in a moment).
</P>
<P>
   Whether Seawell's romantic campus legend is factual, it makes a
point about his iron will and cavalier confidence _ confidence
bolstered by a resume worthy of several successful men. Seawell has
been a staff officer for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's London
headquarters during World War II, New York entertainment lawyer,
Tony Award-winning Broadway producer (1983's ``On Your Toes''),
publisher of The Denver Post from 1966 to 1981. He once debated
Winston Churchill and gave Marlene Dietrich the use of his bathtub
at the Paris Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   Building the arts center in the early 1970s took every bit of
Seawell's drive, though it didn't hurt that he controlled a
newspaper and was head of the Bonfils Foundation, which paid the
lion's share of construction. He was accused of arm-twisting and
bankrolling a personal dream with others' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must be careful not to abuse one's power, and I didn't,''
Seawell says. ``I was simply determined, so I was seen as a crazy
carpetbagger from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nigh impossible to name an active arts administrator
anywhere with such glittering contacts in the worlds of business
and culture. Since the death of his friend and inspiration, Kennedy
Center founder Roger Stevens, Seawell is the last of the arts
center impresarios bred in Broadway's golden age, the kind of men
whose bios list their club memberships (for the record, Seawell's
include Dutch Treat in New York, Bucks in London).
</P>
<P>
   And at 86 he's still every bit in charge of the Denver Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don keeps a schedule,'' says Denver Center Theatre Company
director Donovan Marley, ``that would kill men half his age.''
</P>
<P>
   But young lawyer Seawell might never have plunged into culture
and glamour if his wife had not recommended his services to a great
Dixie diva from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tallulah summoned me to her (Broadway) dressing room, where
other people were congratulating her, and she was perfectly
charming and casual and naked, as if that were the most ordinary
thing in the world,'' Seawell recalls. ``I learned to conduct
business on her phone schedule, usually after 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good preparation,'' Seawell adds, ``for the demands of
running an arts center.''

 &HT;    Herbert Brito takes high-rise condos to new levels, modern style
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Latin music pumps a soft, understated energy through
the room. Modern art and furnishings in bright colors and sleek
finishes lure visitors in for a closer look, as sunlight casts
shadows from Midtown skyscrapers against the two-story foyer's
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Among it all, Atlanta interior designer Herbert Brito surrounds
himself with his passions _ for history and heritage, for fine
20th-century design, for an urban lifestyle _ in the Colony Square
condominium he calls home and office.
</P>
<P>
   There, Brito demonstrates how high-rise space can best be used
without sacrificing location, views and openness. The two-story
home he created last year by combining units on the 11th and 12th
floors of Hanover House is among a half-dozen such projects the
designer has tackled for intown dwellers seeking more room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing happening in Atlanta is that people are
returning to the city center because they've had it with the
commutes but still want the space,'' Brito said. ``These high-rises
are great envelopes _ you just need to enhance what's inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Brito's ``enhancing'' has ballooned into serving as
architect, general contractor and decorator for many of his
projects _ the type of one-stop design architects practiced years
ago. And that suits him just fine, given his lust for 20th-century
things, from art deco silver to Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic preservation has always been the love of my life,''
said the 45-year-old designer, who has degrees in both design and
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cuba, Heriberto Brito was 7 when his family moved to
Miami during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   His first job after college took him to Washington, where he
worked for the National Register of Historic Places, then to
Savannah as a historic preservation planner.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1986, Brito decided to pursue his other passion, interior
design, in Atlanta, a city fast becoming a mecca for the industry.
Five years and several firms later, the designer formed Brito Inc.,
with offices in Colony Square.
</P>
<P>
   Though he considers most of his work ``very nontraditional,''
two of his homes were featured last year in Traditional Home
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One is Sequoyah, a 1960 Prairie Style home in Atlanta, for which
Brito oversaw the entire renovation. ``It's probably the only house
I love so much I could move in and not change a stick of
furniture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the house comes closest to embodying the
principles of Wright, the acclaimed architect who designed entire
settings for clients, from stairs to stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbert is a master at understanding a client's needs and
translating them into something you love,'' said Stephen Dull, the
home's owner _ especially if they involve 20th-century design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb is a Modernist with more knowledge of the period than
anyone I know,'' said another client, former Atlantan Dick Dailey
of Charleston. ``You learn to trust what he says because he's just
so talented.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attribute that allows Brito to get away with telling
clients, ``listen to me now, hear me later.''
</P>
<P>
   So many, in fact, have listened that Brito's business mushroomed
in recent years. ``I suffer from not being able to tell people
no,'' the designer said. ``I soon became drawn in too many
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a career counselor helped him focus on what was
most important. He then streamlined his business and moved his
office into his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I work only with clients who are passionate about their
homes and what they collect,'' he said. ``If someone tells me, 'Do
what you want,' I don't like that. I want them involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's regardless of whether the client has a couple of
thousand or a couple of million to spend on their homes. ``A good
designer will always work with a client has,'' Brito said. ``If a
decorator walks in and says, 'This will have to go, get rid of
that,' you tell them, 'No, you have to go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some two dozen of his projects have been condos in Colony Square
in Midtown, Atlanta, and several have been the combination of
adjacent units as the demand for large in-town condos grows.
``Herbert's very knowledgeable about structure and how things can
be put together,'' said Don Davis, whose Four Seasons Hotel condo
was the first Brito created by remodeling two units.
</P>
<P>
   For his own renovation, Brito served not only as architect,
contractor and designer but client to boot. ``It's a wonder I
didn't end up on the funny farm,'' said the designer, who was able
to keep a close eye on things because he already lived in Colony
Square .
</P>
<P>
   Because the two large one-bedroom units faced southwest,
overlooking Peachtree Street (Midtown, Atlanta), the floor-length
windows became every room's focal point. Brito reconfigured the
11th-floor unit to house a living room, dining room and kitchen,
all open areas to avoid obstructing that view; the 12th-floor condo
contains his office, master suite and guest suite, joined by pairs
of wide doorways.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at a floor plan in a highrise, I immediately ask
how many walls I can get rid of,'' said Brito, who currently is
designing two other two-story units.
</P>
<P>
   By going up, instead of out, Brito was able to take advantage of
the second entrance upstairs, convenient when clients visit, and
gain coveted highrise ceiling height with the two-story stairway
hall.
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge in the 10-month project was the concrete
structure, which can be a roadblock to repositioning plumbing,
ductwork and electrical lines, he said. By working with a
structural engineer, Brito was able to move some fixtures and
heating and air units, and conceal electrical, cable and sound
wiring in the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Crews removed some 6,000 pounds of concrete to create the stair
hall. There Brito designed a structural steel staircase with open
risers, adding a sculptural element to the streamlined interior.
</P>
<P>
   The designer's collection spans the century from a 1919 Peacock
chair by Frank Lloyd Wright to a Macassar ebony armoire, ottoman
and pedestal Brito designed himself. ``I run the whole gamut,'' he
said, ``from the expensive to the very cheap,'' from a Philippe
Starke chair to flea market lamps made from cypress knees.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pieces, not the prices, that are his passion, rivaled
only by his love of 20th-century architecture.
</P>
<P>
   And like any other Modernist eyeing the future, Brito believes
the possibilities for both are endless. The condo's taught him
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living here, the sky's the limit,'' he said.

 &HT;    Constructive tips for connecting condos
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecting condos on different floors involves several issues,
Atlanta interior designer Herbert Brito said. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Availability. Be aware of who lives below, beside and above
you so you can act quickly when a unit goes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Costs. Depending on the building's construction and the extent
of finishes you desire, remodeling costs range from $40 to $120 per
square foot. (Because no concrete ceilings are involved, it's less
expensive to connect adjacent units, or about $20 to $100 per
square foot.) Consult a real estate agent about property values to
avoid overinvesting in improvements.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Space. Rooms no longer have one specific use. Consider
alternatives. Can a powder room double as a laundry room, a guest
room as a home office?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Views. One reason for buying in a high-rise is the view.
Maintain lines of sight by using furniture, instead of walls, to
define intimate areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Noise. Work with your condo association to prevent problems
with construction noise.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Structural limitations. Most high-rises are post-and-lintel
construction, which means floors and ceilings contain concrete. To
reconfigure utilities, consult a structural engineer about the
possibilities for piercing the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plumbing. In redesigning kitchens, baths and laundry rooms,
know that sinks, washers and dryers can be easily moved because
they don't require moving drains that flow between the concrete
floors. But bathtubs, shower pans and toilets typically cannot be
moved and must be aligned between units, though toilets plumbed
through the wall are an option.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Heating and air. A structural engineer also can help
reposition units and ductwork to allow you to maximize volume.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electrical. To install additional lighting, sound and cable,
suspend the ceiling by 2 inches to form a channel for concealing
wiring.

 &HT;    Uniting the neighborhood
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath about two
hours away, Rabbi Benyomin Friedman is out on patrol. A yellow hard
hat over his yarmulke and binoculars in his hand, the bearded
Orthodox rabbi stares up at wires stretched across utility poles in
the neighborhood around his synagogue, the 80-family Congregation
Ariel in Dunwoody (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   He is one of four men checking parts of the synagogue's eruv, an
uninterrupted border, in this case formed by existing power lines,
that symbolically unites the neighborhood into a single domain.
It's a thoroughly modern adaptation to an ancient tradition that's
brought a new freedom and sense of community to many of metro
Atlanta's Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jewish law, observant Jews may carry items within
their own household on Shabbat, or the Sabbath, but are prohibited
from working _ including hauling items from one place to another or
driving a car. Unifying the neighborhood into a symbolic household
makes it permissable to carry items _ and children _ within the
boundary of the eruv on the Sabbath, between sundown Friday and
sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When his inspections are finished, Friedman will record a
message on a special hotline, just as he does each week, letting
his congregants know that the eruv is sound. The assurance means
families can be out and about in the community, take food to
neighbors' houses and even use umbrellas when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the eruv, Karen Adler, 33, was able to take her
children to a friend's house last Saturday when the community
celebrated the bris, or ritual circumcision, of an 8-day-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With three small children, the eruv allows us to do things
like push a stroller and carry a diaper bag,'' said Adler, whose
children range in age from 2 to 7. ``It enables us to interact a
lot more with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Orthodox Jews shun artificial birth control and take
seriously the teaching to be fruitful and multiply, so large
families are not unusual. Before the eruv, many women stayed home
with their small children during the Sabbath because they couldn't
carry their babies or take what they needed to care for their
youngest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunwoody eruv, established in early 1998, was destroyed by
tornadoes in April and rebuilt. It is one of three in Atlanta. The
others are in Sandy Springs, around Congregation Beth Tefillah, and
in Toco Hill, surrounding Congregation Beth Jacob and Congregation
Ner Hamizrach.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the eruv movement in metro Atlanta is Dr. Joseph
Tate, 54, an obstetrician-gynecologist who delivered many of the
babies whose families benefit from eruvs. Tate had lived in
Antwerp, Belgium, with his family for a while in the '70s in a
neighborhood with an eruv.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at any large Jewish community throughout the
world, there are certain basics you need to have,'' said Tate, the
father of six children. ``There's accessibility to kosher food, a
mikvah, or ritual bath, and Jewish schools. Although I suppose you
could do without an eruv, it's one of those defining features that
says you're becoming a mature Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toco Hill (Ga.) eruv, the first in metro Atlanta, was
completed in 1992 after four years of planning and research. It
unites streets with names like Christmas, Mistletoe and Santa
Claus, named by a 1960s developer apparently of another faith, into
an identifiably Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went from nobody walking the streets except adults walking
to synagogue to, all of a sudden, the streets were filled with
strollers,'' said Tate. ``There was a block party the first week.
To think I was part of a group that could have that kind of effect
on the community was heartwarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's first eruv was a plastic strip, strung at a cost of
more than $15,000 and maintained for about $10,000 a year,
surrounding an area of about two square miles. But two years ago,
the Toco Hill group figured out a way to use existing electrical
and telephone lines to serve the purpose, cutting maintenance costs
in half. The Dunwoody eruv is modeled after the newer Toco one.
</P>
<P>
   The eruv ``has really helped anchor the community, stabilize the
neighborhood and increase property values,'' said Rabbi Ilan
Feldman of Congregation Beth Jacob. Feldman and his wife, Miriam,
are the parents of eight children, the youngest 5 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Hirsch, an architect and real estate agent who lives in
the area, says property values have increased dramatically since
1992 and says the eruv is a factor, along with proximity to Emory
University and the CDC complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eruv may have prompted some people from out of town to
move into this neighborhood,'' says Hirsch. ``It gives the area
cohesiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 600-family Beth Jacob synagogue, the increased number of
small children at services since the eruv was completed has
resulted in organized activities for pre-schoolers on Saturday and
a parking problem for baby strollers and carriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, that's still an issue in the synagogue,'' said
the rabbi. ``Where do you put them without taking up space from
where people gather?''
</P>
<P>
   There may be as many as 50 or 60 strollers on a sunny sabbath,
estimates Rivka Lipschutz, the mother of six children ages 2
through 9. But the congestion in the vestibule is a small price to
pay for the new freedom women of the neighborhood feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eruv allows a mother and family to be part of the
community on shabbas,'' she said.

 &HT;    Food plants do their thing in cool places
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You just never know where you'll find your next
gardening adventure, as Gerrie McCue can tell you. In her letter
from Gwinnett County (Ga.), she recounts how she turned a turnip
into a potted plant:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a long-delayed refrigerator cleaning, I found a small white
turnip that had retreated to a far corner of the vegetable drawer.
I looked at the growth it had been secretly putting out. I was
touched by the fact that even though it was imprisoned in a strange
environment, it `knew' what it was and what it was supposed to do.
I could not throw it away because it was a living thing. So, I
potted it. In a short time it grew into a most attractive plant
about 2 feet tall with a spray of yellow blossoms at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us have faced the choice _ whether to pitch or plant
sprouting food _ described by McCue, who is 90 years old and a
lifelong gardener. Among those around my house that often force the
choice: onions, garlic, potatoes _ foods that know what they are
supposed to do and do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I ask them to do it. Over the years, avocado has been
my most frequent ornamental food plant, beginning in childhood when
I first enjoyed the magical experience of sticking toothpicks in an
avocado seed to hold it halfway covered in a glass of water to let
it sprout and grow.
</P>
<P>
   I've grown houseplants from seeds of citrus and mango, tops of
carrot and pineapple. Most have long gone, leaving one lasting
success: a 14-year-old orange started with a seed tossed into a pot
of dirt. Still in the same pot, it has grown a trunk 2 inches in
diameter, while constant pruning keeps it at about 4 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   While most of my efforts aim to grow plants for the eyes only, I
have cultivated some for food. At a farmers market, I bought lemon
grass, which adds zest to soups, and put it in the ground, where it
has flourished and returned each of the last two springs.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, I planted a few garlic cloves. In a couple of months,
they sprouted, as did hopes of harvesting many fistsful of that
supremely fine flavor _ and a bonus of beautiful flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a food will do what it is supposed to do with no help
at all. Last summer, my most successful tomatoes were volunteers,
springing from seeds that must have been in compost I spread around
my McCaysville (Ga.) garden. Sweet and juicy, the 'maters proved to
be as tough as they were tasty, defying heat and drought.
</P>
<P>
   At least as satisfying are the foods cum plants that wind up
strictly ornamental. ``I enjoyed it long after I would have had I
eaten it!'' McCue says of her turnip.
</P>
<P>
   She sent me a photograph, taken when the plant was about a month
old. ``Now I have several turnips in the refrigerator and plan to
try again to see what I get,'' she says. ``I guess I'll have to eat
rutabagas from now on.

 &HT;    Through bad years and good, an Atlanta chaplain _ once a pro
linebacker himself _ has helped Falcons players to `walk the talk.'
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During late 1997, Charles Collins' congregation was in
despair. After six sessions with themes such as ``How to Deal With
Defeat,'' ``How to Handle Disappointment'' and ``How to Overcome
Obstacles,'' Collins was running out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't win this weekend, I'm starting over,'' he warned
his flock, the then 1-6 Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Collins, Falcons chaplain since 1983, has another challenge
_ helping his friends on the team maintain perspective in the midst
of Super Bowl hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 52, understands football.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a construction worker, he relocated with his parents
every few months of his childhood until about 1960, when the family
landed in metro Atlanta. For the first time, he was attending the
same school on a long-term basis, but felt he didn't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed up in overalls, and all the kids were wearing slacks
with button-down shirts,'' he recalls. ``I was sadly lacking in the
academic aspects, and my clothes weren't appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He came into his own on the playground. ``At recess, I gained
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to play football at Campbell High School in Smyrna,
then for Auburn University and the Dallas Cowboys before landing in
the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   He knows firsthand the impact a chaplain can have on a player's
life. He says that if he had not wandered into a pre-game locker
room Bible study while he was a player in the Canadian Football
League, he would not have the faith he has today.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1973 and Collins had just signed a three-year, no-cut
contract in Saskatchewan, the most lucrative of any linebacker in
the history of the team. He and his wife were buying a new
condominium. He had just paid cash for a new car. He was happily
married with one daughter and another baby on the way. Nominally,
he was a Christian. Although his parents were not religious,
Collins joined the United Methodist Church in 1968 when he married
his wife, Melda, who made church attendance a condition of
matrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sitting there and I'm miserable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The chaplain leading the study was direct. ``Going to church
doesn't make you a Christian anymore than going to McDonald's makes
you a hamburger,'' he told them. And: ``It's great that you've been
baptized, but if you don't know Jesus Christ, you're going to hell
wet.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, after going to bed, Collins said, ``for some reason,
I got back up and got the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   He read the Gospel of John, which had been recommended to him by
his ``Jesus freak'' brother-in-law, now a Baptist minister in North
Carolina. ``I slowly slid off my cot and got on my knees,'' Collins
says. His confession of faith was simple. ``God,'' he recalls
saying, ``I'm tired of trying to hack it by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to realize just how much he needed help six months later
when his second daughter was hospitalized with a viral condition
doctors were unable to cure. After she had spent six weeks in the
hospital, a doctor told Collins to prepare his wife for their
daughter's death. Late that night, he went into the nursery, got on
his knees and prayed. The next day at the hospital, he and his wife
learned that during the night their baby had taken a dramatic turn
for the better. They soon were able to take her home.
</P>
<P>
   Collins shared his faith with someone else for the first time at
a conference for Christian athletes in Chicago. Assigned to
evangelize in Chicago's O'Hare airport, he chose the busiest man he
could find, figuring he would be brushed off and then would have an
excuse to go eat breakfast. To his surprise, the man put aside his
work and listened. It turned out, says Collins, that the man and
his wife had separated and he had been contemplating suicide.
Together, they prayed.
</P>
<P>
   They kept in touch for about 10 years. The man and his wife
stayed together, and the man became a deacon in his church.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says his own life was changed by the encounter. ``I
walked out of that airport and I've never been the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   He left professional football in 1976 and moved back to metro
Atlanta to coach football and teach history at McEachern High
School. While still at McEachern, he was recruited in 1983 by
Athletes in Action, an arm of Campus Crusade for Christ, to start a
ministry to college and professional teams in the metro Atlanta
area. He joined the Athletes in Action staff full time that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Collins and his wife began leading a Bible study with
some Falcons players and their wives. Now, Collins has a men's
Bible study on Mondays with an average of 12 to 15 players. His
wife holds a similar group for their wives. On Thursdays, they
conduct a couples Bible study. Every game day, he holds a chapel
service. He also spends one-on-one time with players who want it
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Collins attends First United Methodist Church in
Marietta (Ga.), through his brother-in-law he was ordained a
Baptist minister to be able to ``marry people and bury people.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the Falcons organization has been open to the work he is
doing. ``If it weren't for them, I could be standing out in the
parking lot handing out fliers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the team before the Minneapolis game that the
greatest motivation in the world is love. It shows, he says, ``when
you've got a group of guys and coaches who really care about each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins says his basic message to the team is ``the same as it
would be if I were leading a Bible study of businessmen. It's
grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Says the chaplain, ``The reason I think these guys have had as
much impact as they have is that they walk the talk. It's a special
group.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even now, after the voices have been silent for four
years, and he has built a life for himself much like the lives that
other people live, Ken Steele speaks with some gingerness, as if
talking about those times in too much detail might somehow bring
them back.
</P>
<P>
   He was 14 years old when it began, a boy who loved scouting and
books and basketball, a straight ``A'' student, alone in his
bedroom in the Connecticut town where his parents worked in a
factory and his grandmother lived downstairs, helping her grandson
off to school each morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crisp fall night and a large harvest moon was visible
through the window as he lay on his bed, listening to the radio.
His mother and father were asleep next door, so he kept the volume
low, humming along with the Supremes and the Four Seasons crooning
``Sheeeerry, Sherry baby.'' Then the music trailed off and a talk
show began, and as he listened more closely he realized that the
men on the show were talking about  &UR; him &LR; , saying he was ``a fool,''
and ``no good'' and that he deserved to die.
</P>
<P>
   He lay awake most of that night and for several weeks he did not
tell anyone. He went to school and to Scout meetings and fought
back the voices _ they were talking to him directly now, from the
radio, the television set, even programs like ``Bonanza'' _ and he
pretended that nothing was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually he decided to let someone know, and he found his
grandmother in the kitchen and told her that people were talking to
him and telling him to hurt himself. And his grandmother looked at
him for a long time and then she said, ``These voices must be from
the devil.'' And she took out her Bible and began to read to him.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later he left home, taking a bus to New York City,
hoping to find a way to die. It was the beginning of what he now
calls a ``32-year, cross-country schizophrenic odyssey,'' the scars
from which are only beginning to heal. ``I don't think about the
years gone,'' Steele said recently. ``I try to think about what I
can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele is sitting at his desk in his small apartment in midtown
Manhattan. He is retelling this history because he believes that
doing so may help people better understand schizophrenia and
recognize its symptoms earlier, and because his story, which is one
of hope and recovery, offers a counterpoint to others with less
happy endings, like that of Andrew Goldstein, the 29-year-old
schizophrenic man charged with pushing Kendra Webdale off a subway
platform to her death on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia afflicts an estimated 2.7 million Americans. It is
an illness notable for its laceration of consciousness, and for the
terrible isolation it imposes on sufferers. It also exacts a severe
toll from family members who often can do little but watch
helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   The public, however, usually hears about schizophrenia only in
the context of lurid headlines, like those that followed
Goldstein's arrest. And sensational news coverage reenforces the
mistaken belief that violence frequently accompanies the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, now 50, has only partial recollections from the years of
his illness, most of them involving state hospital wards, gurneys
where he was pinned in restraints, one-to-one suicide watches and
the haze of sedation brought on by such drugs as Haldol, Mellaril
and Stelazine, which at the time were the only medicines available
to treat psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the hospital he was in when Apollo 11 landed on the
moon, when the Watergate hearings began, when Lady Diana got
married, when the shuttle exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Steele is trying to make up for the years that
disappeared. His recovery speaks to his personal strength and
determination to get well, but it also reflects the benefits of a
new generation of anti-psychotic drugs, which for many patients
control psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, without the
disabling side effects of older medications, allowing a growing
number of people to resume a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Steele, with the support of Dr. Rita Seiden, a
psychotherapist at the Park Slope Center for Mental Health in
Brooklyn, began taking Risperdal, which came on the market in 1994.
Seven months after starting the medication, Steele's voices, which
had tormented him ceaselessly, stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And when, for the first time in three decades, he found himself
able to concentrate and to focus his energies, he realized that
even though he did not even have a high school diploma, his
experience put him in a position to educate people about his
illness. He decided to devote his efforts to helping others who
suffer similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Steele is now vice chairman of the Mental Health Association in
New York State and serves as chairman of the organization's
governmental affairs committee. He is the publisher of a bimonthly
newspaper, New York City Voices, which offers articles on mental
health issues and features first-person accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And because he believes that isolation is one of the worst
consequences of mental illness, he founded Awakenings, a support
group where those with schizophrenia or depression or
manic-depression can come weekly to share their experiences and
help one another survive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, Steele, who lives on a monthly
Social Security disability check of $587, has been able to shape
for himself an independent life with his own state-subsidized
apartment, friends who drop by, a coffee table covered with
knick-knacks and his cat, Diva, who rubs against his legs when he
comes home.
</P>
<P>
   But he lives with the physical legacy of the medicines he has
taken and the years he spent in hospitals and halfway houses: He is
overweight, a frequent side effect of anti-psychotic drugs, and
suffers from diabetes and emphysema. But after years of co-existing
with roommates, he is for the first time living alone _ and
enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a home today,'' Steele said. ``I never had a home in my
life. I feel like a teen-ager just growing up. I have this
incredible appetite to do as much as I can and to grow as much as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that for Steele and for many others who are
attempting to piece together their lives after years of illness,
and for their families, the drama of an Andrew Goldstein or a
Russell E. Weston Jr., the schizophrenic man charged in the fatal
shootings of two police officers in the Capitol last summer,
becomes very personal. The day after the subway incident, Steele
received a call from a mother panicked about her son, who had
recently experienced his first episode of psychosis and was
refusing to take his medication. ``She was afraid he would turn
into a Goldstein,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele himself feels considerable distance from Goldstein, who
spent much of the past few years drifting and who, unlike Steele,
had a history of aggressiveness toward others.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The same was not true, however, last summer, when Michael B.
Laudor, who received national attention after he recovered
sufficiently from schizophrenia to graduate from Yale Law School,
was indicted in Westchester County, on charges of second-degree
murder in the stabbing death of his pregnant fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Steele had met Laudor several times, and looked up to him as a
role model. ``That one sent me to the hills,'' Steele said. ``I
said, `Jesus, too close to home.' I had to step back from it, to
get some distance. It was very scary.'' (Laudor was found unfit to
stand trial and is receiving treatment at a psychiatric center.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steele is also convinced that there are differences that
will keep him from following the same path. Over the three decades
of his illness, Steele walked into heavy traffic and tried suicide
in other ways, but never attacked other people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Steele is aware that recovery is a complicated
process, accomplished in small steps. He knows that continued
treatment is critical, as is the support of friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest risks for people with schizophrenia is that
they will stop taking their medication, inviting a return of the
delusions or hallucinations that make normal functioning
impossible. Many patients stop taking the older drugs because they
find the side effects intolerable: Haldol and other older
anti-psychotics are heavily sedating, producing the glazed stare
familiar on state hospital wards, and they often cause stiffness,
trembling and restlessness. People who take the drugs also risk
developing the repetitive movements _ chewing motions, lip smacking
and contortions of the arms and legs that are symptoms of a
condition, tardive dyskinesia, that can persist long after the
drugs are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   With newer medications like Risperdal (others include Zyprexa
and Clozaril), the risk of tardive dyskinesia appears greatly
reduced and the drugs have fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, the newer medicines are clearly better than the
older medicines,'' said Dr. Peter Weiden, director of the
Schizophrenia Research Program at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center and the author of ``Breakthroughs in Anti-Psychotic
Medications,'' (Norton, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, these benefits can lead patients to assume that
they are cured and no longer need medication, Weiden said. Yet even
for those who, like Steele, are aware that their illness is only in
abeyance, the temptation to stop the medication often persists.
</P>
<P>
   And while the hallucinations and delusions that are hallmarks of
the disease are frequently terrifying and disorienting, they can
also make people feel powerful and special, making it difficult to
settle for the drabness of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the star,'' Steele said, describing the intensity of
his psychosis, a state he describes as ``like being underwater or
floating weightless in outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Everybody on TV is talking about you. They're
talking about you on the Johnny Carson show.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Frey, a 22-year-old college student who had his first
psychotic episode last summer and now helps Steele with the
newspaper and other projects, says of the incident, ``It was a
spiritual experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Frey knows intellectually that he is ill and that he must keep
taking his medication. But the voices that spoke to him during his
illness still exert a pull. His first hospitalization was
traumatic. ``I was petrified of what they might do to me,'' he
said. And it has been difficult to come to terms with the
disruption of his normal life, his classes, his relationships with
friends. Still, he concedes that the treatment he received was
necessary and in his best interest. ``Even though I believed that I
was in control,'' Frey said, ``I suppose there are too many cases
out there where people hurt themselves or somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson Steele takes from his own experience and from working
with others like Frey, is that recovery is never simply a matter of
taking pills: It also requires a decision to let go of illness and
to embrace the responsibilities that are an inevitable
accompaniment of getting well.
</P>
<P>
   In his own case, the decision came when he met a
psychotherapist, Dr. Seiden, whom he trusted _ and who trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   It was she who persuaded Steele to try Risperdal and to stay on
it long enough for it to work effectively. ``In the year or so
before he went on the new medicine, he was always kind of wild to
deal with,'' Dr. Seiden said. ``I never knew what he was going to
tell me or whether he was going to show up. It was like being in a
whirlwind.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day he realized that the hallucinations had stopped,
Steele said he curled up in his bathtub in a fetal position and
remained there for four days. He said he debated whether to tell
his doctor the voices were gone. ``What am I going to do without
them?'' he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he played a game with himself, he said, telling
himself that ``if this gets too bad, I can always stop taking the
medicine again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the voices departed, they left behind a man who has
considerable emotional resources and who is able to inspire and to
comfort those around him. ``Ken is the nucleus,'' said a member of
the Awakenings group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``All this is possible because Ken is a courageous man.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Steele and others like him, there remains the
question of ``What next?'' In many ways, the mental health system
is built around the notion that people with schizophrenia will
never get well, and achieving an independent life can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Steele would like to work, though his physical ailments may make
this difficult. He feels that the mental health system itself
invites dependency, and he would like eventually, he said, to be
entirely self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, he has plenty to keep him busy, plenty
of people who need his help, plenty of organizations delighted to
accept his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And when, as sometimes happens, his voices return in a dream,
and he wakes up in the darkness in a cold sweat, the fear only
lasts a few minutes. It was, after all, only a dream.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the impeachment trial progresses, historians, pundits and
senators are trying to cast President Clinton and his actions in
historical context. No one is doing the same for Linda Tripp, but
perhaps they should. For just as the president has been portrayed
as following in various traditions _ be it presidential
philanderer, accused liar or victim of partisan attack _ Mrs. Tripp
has a historical lineage of her own: the citizen denouncer.
</P>
<P>
   From the Salem witch trials to the McCarthy hearings, from the
McMartin Preschool accusers to Frank Serpico, who testified about
New York City police corruption, American history and the American
present are full of denunciations by citizens to the state.
Sometimes the denunciations are public, sometimes anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the crimes reported are real; in other cases they are
imagined or invented. Sometimes the transgressions are ideological
rather than legal. And sometimes, as in Mrs. Tripp's case, the
motives are not clear to others, with the line between public good
and private gain muddied.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have tended to view denunciations as characteristic of
totalitarian societies, which elevate the betrayal of family,
friend and neighbor to both virtue and obligation. But now some
historians are trying to broaden the scope of inquiry, looking at
denunciations not just as a political phenomenon, but as an
anthropological one as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whether denunciation surfaces in a police state, a monarchy or a
pluralistic democracy, the similarities tell us something about
human nature and society, they suggest. The question, says Sheila
Fitzpatrick, a historian at the University of Chicago and a leader
in ``comparative delatology,'' as the tiny field is known, is ``To
what degree are we getting a behavior that goes across cultures?''
</P>
<P>
   To address that question, she and Robert Gellately, a historian
at the Clark University Center for Holocaust Studies, have edited a
book, ``Accusatory Practices: Denunciation in Modern European
History, 1789-1999'' (University of Chicago Press), which examines
denunciations in various societies and institutions: France during
the Revolutionary reign of the Jacobins, the rural Russian
peasantry in the late 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the former Soviet Union,
Nazi Germany, and the former German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The editors define denunciations as ``spontaneous communications
from individual citizens to the state (or to another authority such
as the church) containing accusations of wrongdoing by other
citizens or officials and implicitly or explicitly calling for
punishment.'' Denouncers are distinguished from informers, who have
a more regular, and overtly profitable, relationship with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these practices as an important but unstudied point of
contact between individual citizens and the state,'' they write,
``one that embodies a whole set of unarticulated decisions about
loyalties to the state, on one hand, and to family and fellow
citizens, on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The essays' running theme is that there is a third competing
loyalty _ to the self _ that complicates denunciations, ultimately
stripping them of their patriotic veneer. The potential for
manipulative denunciations has generated what Ms. Fitzpatrick and
Gellately call ``opposing discourses'' of denunciations _ ``one
exalting it as a duty to the state, the other deploring it as a
betrayal of fellow human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobins, for example, at first saw denunciations as the
highest virtue of the Revolution, the path to total transparency,
Colin Lucas writes in his essay in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacobins tried to separate _ semantically and practically _
the public-spirited denunciation (``denonciation'') from the
treacherous, self-interested denunciation (``delation''). But as
denunciations became an instrument of the state, the
revolutionaries concluded that ``the notion of virtuous
denunciation simply did not hold up,'' Lucas writes.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulative denunciations were almost inevitable in the
totalitarian states that Ms. Fitzpatrick, Gellately, and their
colleagues examine: notably the Soviet Union under Stalin, Nazi
Germany and the former German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveillance societies,'' Gellately notes, depend on the eyes,
ears and notes of ordinary citizens to maintain law and order _ and
terror _ and to regulate the populace's behavior. Under such
regimes, citizens see the potential to advance their interests by
feeding the government's hunger for information.''
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, for example, the Gestapo numbered only about 7,500,
Gellately points out. The real pinions of the police state were the
citizenry, who reported everything from Jews and non-Jews holding
hands to Germans listening to foreign radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the denunciations were driven by petty grievances,
jealousy, fear (one man, certain he was going to be denounced by a
neighbor, simply went ahead and denounced himself), anti-Semitism
and greed. Denunciations aimed at securing a larger or better
living space were so common in totalitarian societies like
Stalinist Russia that they spawned the coinage ``apartment
denunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about so-called denunciations in a modern democratic
society? Are they comparable to those that occur in a totalitarian
state?
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Americans abhor denunciation: Schoolchildren, cops
and prisoners alike learn that ``snitching'' is despicable.
``Playing the informant runs against the American grain,'' wrote
Victor Navasky in ``Naming Names,'' his book on those who
cooperated with the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet denunciations keep surfacing in American history, as Mrs.
Tripp reminded us. Even among denouncers, she is somewhat unusual,
scholars say: She is as much agent provocateur as denouncer, and in
democracies and dictatorships alike, denunciations of national
leaders are rare.
</P>
<P>
   But aberrant or not, she does reflect an American ambivalence
about the practice. Ms. Fitzpatrick argues that the United States
has its own ``opposing discourse'' about denunciation that makes it
acceptable in some contexts and reprehensible in others.
</P>
<P>
   The standards for judgment seem to come down to the motive of
the denouncer (does he or she have something to gain?), the
willingness to make the denunciation publicly, and the content of
the denunciation: Is it ultimately perceived as constructive, or
destructive, to society?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more clearly shows the stigma associated with denouncing
in America than the ``blue wall of silence.'' While reporting
brutality or corruption seems laudable, and important, to
outsiders, to many police officers, betrayal is the greater evil.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, American whistle-blowers who, starting
largely in the 1970s, began denouncing corporate or governmental
malfeasance, are considered heroic.
</P>
<P>
   They had little to gain _ in fact they often risked their jobs.
(The equation may be changing with the enactment of federal
statutes that reward whistle-blowers with a cut of the money they
help the government save.) They went public with their accusations.
And their causes were generally seen as in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The public interest, however, is a fluid and malleable concept,
and throughout history, legitimizing causes and perceived threats
have sprung up to ``justify'' denunciation.
</P>
<P>
   In nativist periods, for example, it becomes acceptable to
report illegal immigrants to the authorities. In the 1980s and
early 1990s, day-care workers and priests suddenly became the
target of suspicions and fears about child sexual abuse (and
Satanic rituals), prompting an epidemic of accusations that
snowballed along with parents' fear. In the end, many of the
charges were unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing is actively encouraged in the country's long-running
``War on Drugs,'' to the chagrin of civil libertarians. Posters
around New York City now urge citizens to call 1-888-374-DRUG and
anonymously report narcotics dealers. Federal laws encourage drug
suspects to trade accusations against friends, neighbors and
relatives in exchange for shorter sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet Union had Pavlik Morozov, the child who
allegedly denounced his own father to the authorities for hoarding
grain; the modern United States has a sixth-grade boy who,
responding to an anti-drug program at school, reported his own
parents to the police after discovering a small amount of drugs at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The most sweeping bout of denunciation in America, of course,
was the Red Scare that prompted the HUAC hearings. Under pressure
to demonstrate their anti-communist bona fides in order to keep
working, screenwriters, actors, directors and others named friends
and colleagues. As Navasky points out, an entire subculture _ not
just right-wing American Legionnaires but also liberals in
Hollywood _ sprang up to support their decision to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether that cooperation was justified _ about
whether combating a threat of totalitarianism required using one of
its tactics _ burns among historians to this day. That scholars
feel compelled at all to make judgments about whether historical
actors were ``right'' or ``wrong'' hints at the volatile nature of
the decision to denounce.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians reject outright the premise that denunciation in
a pluralistic democracy is in any way comparable to that in a
totalitarian state. The comparison, they suggest, is as immoral as
it is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Garton Ash, whose book ``The File'' documents his
personal history of being informed on in the former East Germany,
called the contention that American practices are in any way
comparable to totalitarianism ``a ludicrous piece of pseudo-liberal
moral relativism and intellectual wooliness'' in a review of
``Accusatory Practices'' in the London Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   The denouncer in a dictatorship and a whistle-blower in a
democracy, he went on to write, ``are not merely different things;
they are opposites. The former secretly passes information about
fellow citizens to the authorities, the latter publicly passes
information about the authorities to fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzpatrick counters that the coupling of moral judgment
with historical analysis is often ``an injection of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   But her fellow editor, Gellately, confesses to some discomfort
with the anthropological approach. The consequences of a
denunciation in a totalitarian society make it a phenomenon unto
itself, he says. While people in the United States can easily
report a neighbor they don't like as a crack dealer or child
molester, that neighbor still has protections under the American
judicial system _ the right to an attorney, due process, the right
to a trial. As he notes, ``We still have habeas corpus.''

GROUPS AIM TO DEFEAT CLINTON'S DEFENSE SPENDING BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday will formally propose
the first major increase in defense spending since the Reagan era,
arguing that the $112 billion boost over six years is needed to
give troops a big raise and buy new weaponry,
</P>
<P>
   But critics including Dale Bumpers, the former Democratic
senator from Arkansas, are urging Congress to reject the proposed
increase of $112 billion over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers argues that such a boost is not needed and that the
money would be better used for other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about to squander a golden opportunity to address
pressing problems in education, health care and Social Security,''
said Bumpers, who is now the director of the liberal Center for
Defense Information. ``With no credible military threat to the
United States, we should be looking for additional ways to reduce
military spending, not increase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense in the
Reagan administration, said more defense spending isn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are buying a new generation of submarines when the current
ones have plenty of life left, and we are buying very expensive
aircraft, like the F-22 that costs nearly $200 million each,'' said
Korb. ``We have enough money but are not putting it in the right
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in some quarters within the Pentagon, a spending boost is
considered ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Spinney, a senior analyst in the Pentagon's program
analysis and evaluation division, maintains that the increase is
not justified given that the military threats once underpinning
defense budgets ``have completely evaporated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you count Russia and China as threats, and add in all
the rogue countries (such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea), we
already are spending over three times as much money as they are,
combined, on defense,'' Spinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in the defense budgets of the NATO allies, the West
outspends the band of potential adversaries by at least five times,
Spinney said. The ratio jumps even higher when the defense budgets
of non-NATO allies are added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is totally preposterous,'' Spinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed the increase in his State of the Union address
earlier this month, declaring that ``it is time to reverse the
decline in defense spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is requesting a total of $267.2 billion for defense
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The sum includes $12.6
billion as the first installment of the proposed $112 billion
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $112 billion, which would be spread out until 2005, $36.5
billion would go for higher military pay and additional retirement
benefits. The remainder would be spent on new jet aircraft, ships,
upgrades to ground combat weapons and stepped up military training.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal group called Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities
began an advertising campaign this month opposing Clinton's defense
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the military advisers listed by the organization are David
Hackworth, a retired Army colonel and highly decorated veteran of
the Vietnam War, and Paul Warnke, a former arms negotiator and
assistant secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Cohen of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., the organization's
president, said: ``Far and away, we already have the strongest
military in the world. That's just not where we need to put our
limited resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concerns we have as people are education and
healthcare,'' said Cohen, vowing a ``long-term campaign'' to block
the increase that Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are very receptive to a
defense spending boost, with some pushing for an even greater
increase.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of liberal lawmakers is attempting to turn the tide.
They include Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., John Conyers, D-Mich.,
Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an Independent, and Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers earlier this month called Clinton's military
spending plans ``misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three new attack submarines, costing $13 billion, would
provide health insurance for the 11 million uninsured kids in
America,'' Sanders said.

PRIMARY-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - Arizona could be pushed out of the
national limelight and back into the political desert under a bill
that would change the state's 2000 presidential primary from
mid-February to March 14 - well after California's primary and a
proposed Rocky Mountain presidential election. Critics say the move
would destroy Arizona's hopes of regaining the national attention
the state enjoyed in 1996 when the Feb. 16 presidential primary
launched Steve Forbes campaign and dashed Pat Buchanan's hopes.
Some Republicans wonder whether the real motive for the proposed
change is to to help Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., avoid the being
attacked in Arizona by Forbes early in the primary season. By MIKE

conducted no background check. Needless to say, Chino Valley is in
an uproar. Especially since the former prisoner town manager was
very instrumental in the firing of the popular town police chief:

 &HT;    Medical College of Georgia project wrongly spent $70,000, report
says
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A program run by the Medical College of Georgia spent
more than $70,000 in state funds inappropriately, and the use of
another $400,000 should be re-examined, according to a report by a
state health care fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
   The money came from a state trust fund designed to help
hospitals care for poor patients. Instead, the misspent funds
related to purchases of food and beverages, TV and computer
technology, and a puppet program, among other items, said the
report, released this week.
</P>
<P>
   An MCG employee alerted the State Health Care Fraud Control Unit
of the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the money was supposed to be for poor people,'' the
employee, Gail Woods, said Friday when contacted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The MCG inquiry, which found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing,
is expected to raise new questions about the state's Indigent Care
Trust Fund, which doles out more than $350 million a year to
hospitals and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new data from the Department of Medical Assistance,
which runs Medicaid and the fund, show that total contracts from
the Indigent Care Trust Fund to organizations other than hospitals,
including state agencies, amounted to about $53 million in fiscal
year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MCG received $1.7 million in contracts and a general ICTF
allocation of about $11.7 million in fiscal 1998, according to
state figures.
</P>
<P>
   Through the general fund, MCG was seeking to run a pilot
resource center in 12 counties for the Family Connection project,
an initiative of former Gov. Zell Miller's that focuses on
children's problems, such as teen pregnancy and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The resource center at MCG received about $1.4 million in
general trust fund money, according to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   MCG issued a statement late Friday saying that it cooperated
with the state's review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been concerned with the issues presented
regarding the expenditure of (Indigent Care Trust Fund dollars) for
the Family Connection project,'' the statement said. ``It is
unfortunate that the issues have not yet been fully resolved, but
we will pursue them with DMA until they are resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   MCG declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, lawmakers, health industry officials, and consumer
advocates have called for more scrutiny of the trust fund's
contracts and hospital spending.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a standoff between four large charity hospitals and
DMA about the trust fund held up money going to dozens of hospitals
in Georgia, including some rural facilities that have been losing
money overall.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eddie Madden (D-Elberton) has introduced a resolution in
the General Assembly calling for a study committee on the trust
fund. And state Rep. Mickey Channell (D-Greensboro) said his House
Medicaid study committee expects to hold a hearing on the fund next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Even DMA officials concede the trust fund is a complicated
matter. Basically, the ICTF gathers money from participating
hospitals, as well as state funds. That sum is matched by federal
dollars, which are sent back to the hospitals _ at an amount higher
than their original contribution _ to help cover the care of the
uninsured, along with any Medicaid shorfall.
</P>
<P>
   Trust fund money goes to about 88 hospitals. In return, the
hospitals are required to spend 15 percent of the net proceeds on
primary care. The rest is designed for uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital compliance with trust fund regulations has been
inconsistent,'' said consumer health advocate Linda Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   And at a recent budget hearing, DMA Commissioner William Taylor
said the agency plans to audit the trust fund program, established
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   DMA said Friday it is reviewing the report on MCG. ``We know
that there is potential for abuse within the ICTF system, and are
taking appropriate steps to curb these abuses,'' said Margaret
Taylor, chief deputy commissioner at DMA.
</P>
<P>
   The MCG inquiry is not related to a research scandal that hit
the institution two years ago and ended with two former MCG
professors being sentenced to prison. Richard Borison and Bruce
Diamond pleaded guilty to a scheme in which they set up an
off-campus research operation that allowed them to divert more than
$10 million in research dollars to their own private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Richards, director of the state health fraud unit, wrote
the MCG report after a 10-month investigation. He said that because
MCG was the only institution probed, he would not generalize on
trust fund monitoring by the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Richards added: ``If this is typical of how DMA administers
this program, they need to tighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' allegations were investigated by MCG last year, and no
evidence of wrongdoing was found, an MCG official told the Augusta
Chronicle last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the fraud unit's report said Woods' supervisors concluded
she was a ``problem employee,'' and that they ``devoted their
energy to making that case.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report concluded, ``Ms. Woods was a conscientious
employee trying to raise unpleasant but important questions in an
increasingly contentious and adversarial work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report details inappropriate expenditures of ICTF money by
the program in 1997 and 1998. The report recommends:
</P>
<P>
   _ MCG repay Medicaid about $4,500 for food and beverage charges
_ ``an impermissible expenditure of ICTF funds.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MCG repay about $10,200 for spending on puppet programs. Only
seven of 33 puppet performances related to topics linked to the
mission of the Family Connection Resource Center, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   _ The repayment of $37,500 for technology purchases, including
computers and televisions. ``Only a small portion of this equipment
was ever actually provided to the community partners'' of the
Family Connection, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repayment of about $22,400 over a consultant's Web page for
the Family Connection Center when, the report concluded, it could
have been created by regular MCG staff.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that more than $234,000 in project funds
were turned over to the Augusta-Richmond County Community
Partnership, a social services organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for me to envision what the Augusta community
partner could have done to earn the entire contract amount,''
Richards reported. The report recommended MCG obtain an audit ``so
that there can be a full accounting for the trust funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, another $219,000 was turned over to a professor at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was being
recruited to run the Family Connection project at MCG.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Dr. Dorothy Browne, told Richards she probably
would not come to Augusta unless she was offered a tenured position
at MCG. She had not arrived as of mid-January, when the report was
completed. MCG said that as of Friday, Browne is not an employee of
MCG.

 &HT;    Saturn's 3rd door opens possibilities
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the proliferation of trucks with three and four
doors and the constant addition of doors to vans, it's hardly a
surprise to find a three-door car coming to showrooms. What is
pleasantly surprising is to find it's from Spring Hill, Tenn., with
Saturn badging.
</P>
<P>
   So there. Let the big boys with their myriad of sport-utilities,
sporty, high-performance and luxury cars take that. Score one for
the pesky little General Motors manufacturer that hasn't had
bragging rights to much of anything since wowing the market in 1990
by arriving with a policy of charging buyers just what the window
sticker says.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, it's another whole new deal for folks looking
for sensibly priced transportation with some flair. Even better, as
a few entrances and exits of the Saturn three-door will prove, is
the fact that it's a new wrinkle that really works.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a briefcase, a bag or two of groceries and bring along a
child or other rear-seat occupant, and the value of Saturn's extra
door on the driver's side is gratefully appreciated. Just remember
all the times you've tried to wedge something through the opening
behind the driver's seat or fumbled in the near-dark for a latch to
flip a seatback forward.
</P>
<P>
   The third door, measuring 19-plus inches wide and opening to the
rear at a right angle with a front-edge latch, isn't a seamless
addition. But its presence on the red SC2 tester, a $15,005 car
gussied up enough to total $18,730, turned very few heads.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience currently is available only on Saturn's SC1 and
SC2 coupes. They're priced at $12,445 and $15,005, respectively,
and are set apart by the SC2's extra interior and exterior
equipment and tweaked drivetrain. Saturn's five other models range
from the $10,595 SL coupe to the $14,255 SL2 sedan.
</P>
<P>
   With its optional alloy wheels, fog lamps and tacked-on rear
spoiler, the test SC2 had enough visual spunk to merit its
``sporty'' label. Its 1.9-liter, 124-horsepower dual-overhead-cam
engine (the 100-hp SC1 version has only one cam) quickly worked up
enough of its maximum 122 pounds-feet of torque to give the
2,500-pounder some zip. A reassuringly effective traction control
system is standard, but the added security of anti-lock brakes is
optional ($695).
</P>
<P>
   For everyday driving, the performance and fuel mileage _ 27 mpg
in the city and 38 on the highway _ are very satisfactory.
Enthusiast drivers who don't mind testing the four-cylinder's
redline of 6,500 revolutions per minutes and its five-speed manual
transmission may even decide Saturn's claim of zero-to-60 mph in
under nine seconds seems conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The ride and handling are good, although the steering doesn't
have a lot of feel in the straight-ahead mode. Occupants aren't
going to be upset by body roll, and while vigorous acceleration
quickly boosts the level of noise in the cabin, it's far from
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The test car's interior seemed better visually and physically
because of the optional leather ($700) and good-quality, CD-playing
stereo ($510). The SC2 had good basic equipment with front and rear
drink holders, token door pockets and a good view of the
instrumentation and road in most directions. Weak points include
short and stiff control stalks for the turn signals and wipers.
</P>
<P>
   Seating is good, and it's no chore to adjust the driver's seat,
although the driving position is going to feel low to some. Front
headroom still may seem less than its 38.5 inches because of the
raked windshield and curved roofline.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seat remains the same as in many other cars: useful
mainly for cargo, children and adults who aren't going far. The
obvious good thing, though, is how amazingly easier it is to
utilize the rear because Saturn saw the logic of a third door and
acted.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Saturn SC2 front-drive, three-door coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $18,730 (base: $15,005)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, optional power anti-lock
brakes with front discs and rear drums ($695), traction control,
side-impact beams, daytime running lamps
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.9-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (124
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with power locks and
keyless entry system, power windows and right side mirror, cruise
control, 15-inch multi-fin alloy wheels, $1,320; leather interior,
$700; AM/FM stereo with CD player and premium speaker system, $510;
carpeted floor mats, $60
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 27 mpg regular unleaded city, 38 mpg highway

HOUSE MEMBERS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MEND FENCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 31) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House members are scheduled for a bipartisan
retreat in March to discuss how they can be more civil toward one
another. A number of Democrats already are talking about boycotting
the event in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the more uncivil periods in the nation's capital
unfolds, the politicians' grousing over the retreat is one example
of how difficult it may be for Democrats and Republicans in
Congress and the White House to return to routine business after
the presidential impeachment process ends.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Democrats are smarting from what they view as the
heavy-handed approach by Republican leaders in pushing through the
articles of impeachment against President Clinton last year. And
they remain skeptical that their Republican colleagues who labored
to oust the president can work with them on future legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said hard feelings remain about how
the Republican majority imposed its will on the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to slam dunk me as a majority, that's fine. But
don't expect me to work with you when you do that,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the yearlong scandal may be felt in the coming
months as lawmakers are forced to grapple with such thorny issues
as overhauling Social Security and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Reverberations also might extend through the 2000 presidential
election year, particularly if voters are determined to punish
Congress for its handling of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the political risk is greater for Republicans, who
have alienated much of the public for pushing so hard to oust a
popular president. National polls repeatedly have shown that the
public does not approve of the extended impeachment push.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats could also be tinged by the trial as the public
grows weary of partisan bickering. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll
released Friday found that support for Senate Democrats handling of
the trial had slipped in recent weeks, with the public now split,
45-45, on their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, Senate Republicans fared worse in the same survey, with
57 percent disapproving and 33 percent approving of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledge that they have taken a beating in public
opinion but say that they can rebound if they move quickly to pass
legislation in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., appeared aware of
the problem last week when he assured a Chamber of Commerce
audience that lawmakers would soon be working on issues of interest
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a burst of activity to show that we are
attending to the people's business,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the same day, the GOP-controlled Senate, voting
largely along party lines, rejected a Democratic effort to dismiss
the impeachment trial. Instead, they moved to depose witnesses,
meaning the trial will extend into February.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the Chamber, Lott said that despite the trial,
Congress was still tending to other business. He noted that on one
day alone last week the Senate held 10 hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But the perception outside of Washington is that Congress is
obsessed with impeachment and is doing little else, said outgoing
Florida GOP chairman Tom Slade.
</P>
<P>
   He likened the Senate trial, about to enter its fourth week, to
``overnight house guests that have stayed two weeks. You're just
ready for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the impeachment has hurt the Republicans, who are
being viewed as obsessed with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly has not been our political friend up until now, and
I don't see it turning into an asset for us,'' Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome this negative image, he said the Republicans must
quickly develop an agenda and then vigorously sell that plan to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Congress returns to its regular business, the
Republicans still face an uphill battle. Party leaders have vowed
to push a 10 percent tax cut, as well as work with the president to
strengthen Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But with a slim majority in the House, the Republicans will have
to rely on at least a handful of Democrats to muscle through their
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, however, are likely to see no political
advantage in working with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Some party strategists believe the best way to win back the
chamber in 2000 is for Congress to be unproductive over the next
two years. That would allow Democrats to campaign on a platform
that the Republicans did nothing but go after the president.
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP has been investigating the president, the White
House and Democrats have been winning the public relations war on
which party has the best ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press, Democrats scored better not only on traditional
Democratic issues such as Social Security, health care and
education, but also on the bread-and-butter GOP theme: taxes.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans contend that their new speaker, Rep. Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill, will better be able to forge bipartisan coalitions
than his controversial predecessor, Newt Gingrich. They argue the
Democrats will be blamed if they don't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of agenda items Speaker Hastert is going to work
through and reach out to Democrats and get them solved,'' said
Hastert spokesman John Feehery. ``They are going to find it hard to
turn that hand away.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process has not only strained relations between
the two parties but has also increased tensions between the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators have resented that the House Republicans dumped
the controversial issue in their laps and then lectured them on how
to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the senators have heard enough of the
self-pitying and maudlin speeches by the House managers,'' said Tom
Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mann said the impeachment ordeal could result in a
productive Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think Republicans understand that they have damaged
themselves and they will look to achieve some kind of legislative
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hope to run on that legislative record, rather
than impeachment, in the next election. That is especially true in
the Senate, where Republicans will be defending 19 seats, 13 of
them in states carried by Clinton in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say it is too early to tell whether the
residue of ill feelings from impeachment will spill over into the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Republicans is that while they have shored up
the support of their most conservative supporters by pushing
impeachment, they have alienated the independent voters they must
attract to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans insist that these swing voters will forget
events of the past few months when the presidential candidates
shift into high gear next year.
</P>
<P>
   And they believe if they field popular mainstream presidential
candidates such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Elizabeth Dole,
outgoing American Red Cross president, they can recapture the
middle of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the recent Pew poll showed that Bush and Dole bested the
likely Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a potential downside for Gore in the presidential
campaign if voters link him too closely with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has aggressively defended the president, at
one point calling him a moral leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, so far, has successfully distanced himself from the
unpleasant events that have tied up his party in Washington. When
asked recently about impeachment, he responded, ``We're all sick of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has boasted of bipartisanship in his workings
with the Legislature, drawing a contrast to the partisan bickering
in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, if he is to win party primaries dominated by
conservatives, Bush eventually may be forced to wade into the
impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush should also know that voters sometimes have long
memories.
</P>
<P>
   His father lost to Clinton in 1992 in part because of
conservatives' anger that he broke his pledge not to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are gambling that people are going to
forget,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew poll. ``Sometimes
they do and sometimes they don't.'' &QL;

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ How many cow ponies does it take to drive 15
longhorn steers from the Fort Worth Convention Center up North Main
Street to the historic Stockyards? About 1,000 horses, if it's for
``The Last Great Trail Drive of the Century,'' organizers of the
June 12 event say. Plans for the 23rd annual Chisholm Trail
Round-Up have been folded into Fort Worth's 150th anniversary
celebrations and the scheduled debut of the taxpayer-funded Fort

or so, it has been a sin more of omission than commission, with
even movies with large casts, such as the current ``Playing by
Heart,'' relegating minority characters to small parts _ when
they're included at all. As far back as the silent era, however,
African-American filmmakers were taking matters into their own

 &HT;    Moderate Republicans may make impeachment case by moving for
quick conclusion
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since independent counsel Ken Starr first delivered
his findings against President Clinton to Congress five months ago,
Clinton's impeachment and trial have been driven by Republican
conservatives convinced of his guilt and determined to remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's fate and the course of his Senate trial may now
rest with a handful of Republican moderates who are equally
determined to conclude the trial as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these moderates have voted lock step with the more
conservative members of their party to continue Clinton's trial
with the deposition of Monica Lewinsky and two other key players in
the impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   But the era of solidarity may be at an end. Some moderates have
already said they oppose allowing witnesses to testify live on the
Senate floor, as House prosecutors have insisted they need to do to
prove their case. Some are also extremely skeptical of _ if not
outright opposed to _ deposing additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At least two moderate senators from the northeast, Olympia Snowe
(R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), are already working on
alternatives that would condemn the president's conduct without
convicting him on the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders acknowledge that they can no longer predict
how their members will vote on such key points as the public
release of the videotaped depositions, the appearance of witnesses
on the Senate floor and, most importantly, the guilt or innocence
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Republicans, I would believe, would vote against one or
other or both of the articles (of impeachment),'' said Sen. Larry
Craig (R-Idaho), a member of the Senate Republican leadership. ``We
are not in lock step over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Senate moderates have already exercised
considerable influence over the framework of the trial. These
moderates, for example, insisted to their leaders that House
prosecutors call for no more than three witnesses, said Sen. James
Jeffords (R-Vt.), who was skeptical of the need for any witnesses
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said that he and five other senators also insisted that
the deposition procedures adopted Thursday also include a separate
vote to release the videotape depositions to the public. Jeffords
said he won't vote to release the videotapes unless ``there is
something new and startling in there.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether the witnesses should testify live on the Senate
floor, Jeffords said, ``We don't think there is any need for
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining to identify others by name, Jeffords said there were
10 or 11 GOP senators who ``really want to get this thing over.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial procedures adopted last week puts the Senate on course
to vote on the articles of impeachment no later than Feb. 12, the
beginning of the president's day recess. Two factors could extend
the end date: a decision by Clinton to call and depose witnesses of
his own, and another request from House prosecutors to call more
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers are waiting to see what comes out of the
depositions of Lewinsky, White House aide Sidney Blumenthal and and
Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan before making a decision about
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On whether the Senate permits House prosecutors to call more
witnesses, Senate moderates will have a deciding voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to vote for any witnesses ... unless their
testimony will be explosive testimony that will change the dynamics
of this trial,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a conservative
Republican with a strong penchant toward pragmatism. ``If coming
out of this there was something so significant, I would consider
it. But this on and on _ no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee (R-R.I.), another northeast moderate who stands
for re-election in 2000, said he has already decided that House
prosecutors should not be allowed to call more witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't start down that path,'' Chafee said. ``I've got it
firmly in my mind that we are voting on the 12th (of February).''
</P>
<P>
   Following the three depositions this week, the Senate will turn
to the thorny question of whether or not to make the videotaped
depositions part of the impeachment record, thereby making them
public.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, the Senate will likely consider whether to call
the witnesses to the floor. House prosecutors have made no secret
of their desire to have Lewinsky testify in person, but it is
Lewinsky who worries some Republicans the most.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said some Republicans might not vote for her to testify
in person for fear that the testimony might devolve into the
``sordid details'' of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who are worried that once you get a Monica
Lewinsky on the floor of the U.S. Senate, this thing could go from
bad to worse,'' Hatch said. ``They are just worried about the
Senate being denigrated by this type of testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said much will depend on what House
prosecutors get out of the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong prevailing view that the evidence would come
to the floor in some way,'' said Coverdell. ``But no one has made a
decision, short of wanting to see what the House produces in the
depositions, and those depositions could result in members saying
there is nothing there that I think needs to come before the
Senate. All those decisions are very much unclear.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five years of using the same credit card to buy gasoline
and paying the entire balance each month, Michael Lamar got a rude
awakening from his card issuer, First USA Bank: a $29 late fee on
charges of $21.66.
</P>
<P>
   True, he had missed the July 26 due date on his Visa card by
seven days, but he thought the penalty was excessive. He called
First USA to complain, and the bank, a unit of Banc One, rescinded
the charge, though it cautioned that it granted only one waiver a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, another late fee of $29 showed up, this time on
a $48.15 bill that had been paid six days late. Lamar, a
40-year-old software programmer from Felton, Calif., cut up the
card and demanded that the account be closed. It remains open,
however, and is accruing monthly late fees as the dispute
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar said that in more than five years he was never hit with a
late fee until the recent flurry. He thinks the company has changed
its policies on late-payment penalties, making it hard for him to
make on-time payments. For example, he says, his November bill
arrived on Nov. 12 with a Nov. 24 due date _a tight deadline for
him because he is paid every two weeks. He also considers the $29
to be excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Unkle, vice president for corporate affairs at First USA,
said he could not discuss details of Lamar's case, citing
confidentiality concerns. He did say, however, that the case was
being examined to determine whether Lamar had been treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Unkle said customers must pay bills on time for the bank to
maintain low interest rates, that the bank urged customers to mail
payments seven to 10 days before due dates and that all card
holders received written copies of credit agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition among credit card issuers in recent months
has indeed pushed down interest rates on unpaid balances. But to
make up for the lost income, consumer advocates say, the companies
are increasing their late fees and applying them more rigorously
than in the past. They also say banks are raising penalty rates,
and in some instances confusing card holders with due dates that
change month to month.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so much money to be made, banks are taking advantage of
every loophole, nook and cranny in the law to mislead, deceive and
gouge consumers,'' said Edmund Mierzwinkski, consumer program
director at the Public Interest Research Group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ness Judy, consumer affairs manager at the American
Bankers Association, acknowledged that the industry was taking a
stricter line. But she denied that it was misleading or gouging
customers. ``It is now a pay-as-you-go system,'' she said. ``Rather
than having high interest rates and high fees for everybody, the
fees are being applied to the people who use the services.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have cash-flow problems or are just absent-minded,
though, watch out. In a 1998 survey of 117 bank cards from 74 banks
nationwide, Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based education and
advocacy group, found that credit card companies had increased
their late fees about 75 percent since 1995, to an average of
$21.82 from $12.53.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action said that in the last two or three years some
companies had been charging penalty interest rates on overdue
accounts that were on average 4.5 percentage points higher than
standard rates. The survey also found that banks had raised
penalties for exceeding credit limits, had shortened grace periods
for interest-free balances and had become stricter about imposing
late fees. In the past, most customers got five to 15 days beyond
the official due date to make payments, but nearly two-thirds of
the banks questioned said they now imposed late charges
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America, recommended that consumers keep only one or two credit
cards and pay balances quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judy also urged consumers to scrutinize monthly statements
for changes in late fees, interest penalties or billing procedures.
While she acknowledged that companies were being more rigorous
about late payments and might be charging higher penalities, she
said she knew of no companies that were shortening their grace
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judy encourages consumers who believe they have been wrongly
penalized to talk to representatives at card companies.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't worked for Lamar, though, in his fight over his
bill, which had grown to $58.59, comprising two late fees and a 59
cent finance charge, on his December statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do we decide enough is enough?'' he asked. ``When it gets
to the point you have to use Fedex or they'll charge you a $50 late
fee?''

RX FOR A HEADACHE: HIGH RATES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ When financial crisis strikes and a
currency plunges, the Clinton administration and the International
Monetary Fund press the suffering country to raise interest rates.
Sometimes the currency recovers, but the higher interest rates
always produce a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this remedy, ever more vociferous, are suggesting
that high rates are akin to the 18th-century medical practice of
bleeding patients to try to cure disease. George Washington's last
illness was a bad cold; doctors bled him, and he died within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been staked on high interest rates as the treatment of
choice for sick economies, but evidence is accumulating that
suggests it is the wrong prescription, capable of turning a global
financial crisis into a global recession reminiscent of the 1930s.
The high rates applied in East Asian countries, Russia and now
Brazil were supposed to restore confidence in each nation's
financial system and draw foreign investors and lenders back in.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies would then stabilize, interest rates would fall,
borrowing and investment would resume and, most important of all,
the damaged economies would revive.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what has happened in South Korea and Thailand, the
first countries to be caught in the financial panic that started in
East Asia 19 months ago. Rates have indeed fallen and their
currencies are now stronger, but recessions continue in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``High interest rates are harmful, not helpful; they signal that
debtors are in danger of defaulting on foreign loans,'' said
Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for
International Development, who is making the critics' case at the
World Economic Forum, an annual gathering here of political,
cultural and economic leaders from many countries. ``You put up
rates to 35 percent, and that makes investors nervous about a
nation's currency. By insisting on higher rates, the Treasury and
the IMF have helped to create economic contractions all over the
developing world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flexible interest rates that are allowed to find their own level
are more to the liking of critics like Sachs. He would leave
interest rates alone even in a crisis, a tactic that in his view is
more likely to keep an economy out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show investors that you have economic growth and a way to
get out of a financial crisis, and they will come back,
strengthening the currency as they come,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   He subscribes to a recent World Bank study that found no
correlation between the movements of interest rates and exchange
rates in a number of cases. Too many other factors besides interest
rates affect currency values: Political upheaval, for example, or
too much capacity in manufacturing, which drives down profits and
thereby discourages investment.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank study reflects the views of Joseph Stiglitz, the
bank's chief economist, who signed the preface. He, too, has argued
that high rates are viewed as a signal that borrowers in the
nations offering the high rates are likely to default.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who see the issue his way say high rates can be
counted on to stabilize a currency only in a fanciful world that
somehow has no risk, no bankruptcies, no defaults. Only in such a
sure-fire, risk-free world could foreign investors be counted on to
respond to higher interest rates, certain they wouldn't lose their
money.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Treasury and the IMF, speaking pretty much as
one voice, have disagreed. They have argued, for example, that if
Korea and Thailand had not raised interest rates when disaster
struck, the devaluations of their currencies would have been even
steeper. Debtors would have had much more difficulty repaying
foreign lenders in hard currency, and excessive devaluations would
eventually accelerate inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of the recessions that high rates have
generated, the Treasury appears to be moving toward a middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a balance needed,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy
Treasury secretary, said in an interview here on Friday. ``High
rates have important costs that have to be recognized. At the same
time, too much liquidity'' _ rates that, in effect, are too low _
``can be a prescription for disaster. A balance has to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   That compromise view appears to reflect current thinking on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Securities investors are effectively lenders, so the
institutions that reflect their views are eager to keep exchange
rates in developing countries as calm and predictable as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors recognize the political and social costs of trying
to keep interest rates too high for too long,'' said Robert D.
Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs. ``When a good-faith
effort to sustain a currency with high rates turns sour, you have
to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the harsh medicine of high interest rates that has put a
half-dozen emerging economies into recession over the last 19
months may be losing favor _ perhaps in time to soften the damage
to the Brazilian economy in a world that starts putting economic
growth first, with exchange rate stability to follow.

IN BID TO SURVIVE, HONG KONG RETAILERS TRY CUSTOMER LOYALTY CLUBS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMY WU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The keys to retail success in boom times are well
known: attracting new customers, identifying their needs and
satisfying them with new stores and new products.
</P>
<P>
   When the going turns rough, though, those bets are off, and
retailers often find themselves under pressure to slash prices to
maintain volume, a tactic that can set off price wars that
obliterate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with just such a prospect, retailers in Hong Kong, where
the economy is slumping, are flocking to try a different tactic:
setting up clubs for customers to join. And the early signs are
that the method is working.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Oakden, general manager of the Pacific Coffee Co., &UR;  &LR; a
rapidly growing chain of coffee stores here, calls customer loyalty
clubs the secret to survival in Hong Kong's prolonged economic
downturn. Members of his company's club do not pay dues, go to
meetings, take pledges or learn secret handshakes; they simply fill
out a card that entitles them to a free coffee after they have
bought 12.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp-card method of encouraging frequent customers with
discounts or free goods after a certain number of purchases is not
new, of course, though it was not widely used in Hong Kong before
Pacific Coffee started its club seven years ago. But the gimmick
has become the hottest thing in Hong Kong retailing, to the point
that consumers are demanding them everywhere they shop.
</P>
<P>
   And retailers like Pacific Coffee are going further than just
rewarding repeat purchases; they are building useful customer data
bases of the kind associated with airline frequent-flyer programs
but rarely seen in small-ticket retailing, using data that
customers supply when they fill out their membership, or ``chop,''
cards (the card is nicked, or ``chopped,'' with each purchase).
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Coffee's data base yields useful insights into regular
customers' coffee drinking habits and demographics: 85 percent of
club members are college-educated, most are 25 to 35 years old,
about three out of five are non-Chinese, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Pacific Coffee does its best to make its 14,000 club
members feel as though they are privileged insiders, sending them a
quarterly newsletter and e-mailing updates with news about in-store
events and discounts on beans and coffee machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a loyalty program,'' Oakden said as he sipped a
mochaccino in one of the chain's 13 stores. ``We want them to feel
like they are our livelihood.'' Members respond by stopping in at
least twice a week, on average, and often go through two or three
chop cards a week by buying coffee for co-workers and friends _
just the kind of consumer behavior the company says it needs to
survive the recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough climate _ people are easy about switching
choices,'' Oakden said, so businesses must attract and keep what he
calls ``royal'' repeat customers. ``You can't rely on one-time
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Hong Kong's retail climate is dire.
Retail sales in November 1998 were 20 percent lower than in
November 1997. Hundreds of stores, ranging from mom and pop shops
to Japanese giants like Daimaru, have closed their doors here in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Local retail tycoons like Dickson Poon and Joyce Wong have
announced steep losses, and consumer prices fell 1.5 percent in
1998. But successful customer-club marketing has allowed some
companies, like Pacific Coffee, to thrive and even expand.
</P>
<P>
   City Super, a gourmet supermarket in the Causeway Bay commercial
district, operates a huge food-court-like deli popular with workers
and shoppers in a city where eating out is as popular and
commonplace as wine-drinking is in France.
</P>
<P>
   When the onset of economic trouble last summer seemed to be
spurring a trend toward eating at home more often, the company
started a chop-card club that entitles diners to a free meal after
they buy 20. In less than a year, City Super has given out nearly
100,000 cards, and the expected slide in food court sales has not
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to keep customers loyal,'' said Natalie Chan, marketing
officer at City Super. ``We can keep our sales quite steady, and we
have to keep up with the retail market.'' City Super will replicate
the program at an immense new market it opened this month in Tsim
Sha Tsui, a bustling commercial area in the Kowloon district.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Woo, general director at City Super, said the company set
up the program not to draw new customers but to keep existing
customers in the habit of going to the deli by offering them the
fun of occasionally earning a reward. ``Customers like to collect
them,'' Woo said of the chop cards.
</P>
<P>
   The club craze goes beyond food and coffee. HMV, the
international music retailer, began offering a buy-25-CDs,
get-one-free chop card here after a similar plan proved wildly
popular in Japan, where retailers are also struggling to maintain
sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Fraser, HMV's commercial director for greater China and
Southeast Asia, said the stores' predominantly young customers are
very enthusiastic about getting their cards chopped even though the
effective discount they earn is only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who have forgotten their cards and started new
ones, and later they ask to transfer the chop,'' said Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Oakden of Pacific Coffee says the customer-club concept works
best with moderate-priced items that are bought often, like food
and beverages, recorded music or dry-cleaning service. But many
other types of retailers are trying it as well.
</P>
<P>
   David Tang, a well-known clothier here, is marketing one of his
brands, Shanghai Tang, through a card club program aimed at
customers who buy more than 30,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $3,850)
worth of merchandise. The 1,500 card holders get discounts on
clothes and tailoring, and are invited to promotional events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it can be used as a promotional took and as a gimmick,''
said Vikki Wong, public relations manager for Shanghai Tang. ``But
businesses all need to really expose themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread consumer acceptance of the clubs and cards may
reflect the almost obsessive popularity of collecting in Hong Kong,
Fraser of HMV said, recalling the long lines, stampedes and even a
black market that developed last summer when local McDonald's
outlets gave away Snoopy toys with meals for a month. ``People here
want to get the complete collection,'' Fraser observed.
</P>
<P>
   And if their favorite shop does not have a club, they are
starting to complain, Ms. Wong said. `` `Why don't I get a discount
here?' _ we've been asked that many times,'' she said. ``Hong Kong
is one of those places where everyone has a bargaining and
bartering mentality.'' So retailers are hurrying to oblige. ``It's
not because they want to jump on the bandwagon,'' she said. ``Not
having one is just not acceptable.''

LEWINSKY SCHEDULED TO BE DEPOSED MONDAY AT MAYFLOWER HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky will be the first witness in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton to give her videotaped
deposition when she testifies under oath Monday in the plush
downtown Mayflower Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   She will have a lot of company.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., a former U.S. attorney in Tennessee who
has taken a leading role as one of the 13 House prosecutors, will
be asking the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Senators in the room will include Republicans Mike DeWine of
Ohio, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
Democratic senators monitoring the questioning include Patrick J.
Leahy of Vermont, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and John Edwards
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the room will be a video cameraman, two court reporters,
staffers for Senate leaders and lawyers for the prosecution and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The videotaping by the Miller Recording firm will roll again
Tuesday and Wednesday in a high-security room on the fourth floor
of the Capitol, where top-secret meetings on national security,
intelligence and ethics are normally held.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's confidante and Washington super-lawyer Vernon Jordan
will be grilled Tuesday at the Capitol by House prosecutor Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former U.S. attorney. On Wednesday,
Blumenthal will be questioned by Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif., a
former Los Angeles County prosecutor who was California's youngest
judge at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions can last up to eight hours each. After the
depositions, the tapes and the written transcripts will be viewed
in a secure location by the senators and Chief Justice Rehnquist,
who is presiding over the trial, according to Senate Democratic
Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said Lewinsky had asked that her deposition be held
at the Mayflower, the hotel where she met with House prosecutors
last weekend. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, has an office
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Byrant was hunkered down in his Henderson, Tenn.,
home preparing for the deposition after spending several days
visiting constituents who were hit by 15 tornadoes that raged
through his district last week, killing nine people.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant ``has had a lot more on his mind than the Monica Lewinsky
situation,'' said his spokesman Steve Susens.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee spokesman Sam Stratman said the House
prosecutors will focus in their depositions on the obstruction of
justice charge against Clinton. The depositions will include
questions relating to whether the president tried to hide gifts he
had given Lewinsky, if he coached anyone to lie, lied to his aides
or the grand jury and what the job search for Lewinsky entailed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, subpoenas were faxed to Lewinsky and Jordan's lawyers
and hand-delivered to Blumenthal and his lawyers, Czwartacki said.

THIS EXPERT SEES HIGH-SCORING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Super Bowl musings:
</P>
<P>
   The guy I respect most in this business when it comes to
dissecting a football game before the kickoff likes Denver to win a
high-scoring match. ``As a team, Denver has a little edge,'' says
John Madden, the best analyst in any sport. ``But if Atlanta can
get a few turnovers in the game, I think they will win. That will
tell the story in this game. Turnovers. I think it's going to be a
high-scoring game even though both teams like to run the ball. One
team will get behind and start throwing. Then the other team will
start throwing. Both teams are vulnerable in the secondary. Neither
team rushes the passer well. So I look for a high-scoring game.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden sees no more dynasties in the NFL and says Denver and
Atlanta are good but not great. ``Those teams of the past _ Green
Bay, the Steelers, the 49ers, who dominated over a period of time _
had great players all over the field. Dallas had a chance a few
years back to be (a dynasty), but then free agency got them. I
don't think they are going to get back to being a top team for
years. The Cowboys are like the Golden Gate Bridge. Each year they
paint it. It takes a year. They start at one end and when they get
to the other, they start all over. The Cowboys are like that now.
With their older players using up so much money under the salary
cap, by the time they get to the other end of the bridge, they will
have to start all over again. Before free agency, you could keep
your team together until they all got old together. Now when you
get a good team, someone else moves in in free agency and starts to
take your players away. It's happening in Green Bay. They had a
little run. And now teams are coming after their players.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden on the rash of coaching firings: ``In the old days, seats
cost $10 and the owners wanted to keep fannies in the seats. Now
owners talk about luxury boxes and keeping fur coats in those
seats. It's all about money. They don't have patience with coaches
anymore. What bothers me is that they fire a coach and then they
don't have a plan on who the next guy is. Well, if you don't know
who the next guy is, how do you know he's a better coach than the
guy you just fired?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who has been very close to John Elway for years said
this week that the quarterback told him within the last month that
if the Broncos win, he will play next year. Elway knows that no
quarterback has won three Super Bowls in a row. If his family goes
along with it, Elway is thinking right now that he would come back
in 1999 for another shot. He sort of let it slip this week in the
midst of an answer about this season: ``1998 was a great year. A
lot of exciting things happened to us. There's a lot of highs and
lows. It was a crazy year but an exciting year. I wouldn't mind
1999 being like '98.'' Then he added, ``Sometimes you run out of
physical ability before you run out of mental desire. If you run
out of mental desire before you run out of physical attributes,
then it makes it a little bit easier. So it just depends on what
you want to do. I don't want to leave too early, but I don't want
to leave too late, either.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the only thing that would separate Elway from all
other quarterbacks would be winning three Super Bowls in a row, and
he evidently is thinking hard about trying that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Atlanta coaches say the Falcons are going to
surprise by throwing early against Denver. But Falcons linebacker
coach Don Blackmon, the former Patriot, thinks Denver will do the
same thing against his team. ``When we played them a year ago in
our place,'' he said, ``they started out with all wide receiver
sets and spread out our defense. It worked well for them. They kept
moving the ball down the field and scoring. When they built up a
big lead, they started to run the ball with Terrell Davis and sat
on the lead. Somewhere along the line, we know they are going to
try to do the same thing and see if we can stop it this time.'' . .
. Some around the NFL had a good chuckle when the Patriots put out
a release this week stating they didn't have any interest in hiring
Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell. The next thing we'll hear
from Foxborough is that they don't have any interest in going to
Hartford, either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The late Norm ``Dutch'' Van Brocklin had an intense dislike for
sportswriters when he coached the hapless Falcons years ago. When
his career ended, Van Brocklin underwent brain surgery. Shortly
thereafter, he encountered a sportswriter who inquired about his
well-being. ``I'm doing fine,'' said Van Brocklin. ``I've got a new
brain. The doctor told me I could have any kind of a brain I wanted
before he did the surgery, so I told him I wanted one like a
sportswriter. He asked me why. I told him because I wanted a brain
that was never used before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch was no easier on his players. One time at the half, he was
so upset with running back Paul Gipson that he said, ``Your heart
is so small, you could put it in a thimble and still have room in
it to feed a family of four a good meal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The string of firings the past three years that resulted in 75
percent of the head coaches being changed has been a blessing in
disguise to some assistants who've gotten in the middle of bidding
wars. Not too long ago, it was unheard of to pay an offensive
coordinator more than $250,000 a year. Reportedly, Marc Trestman
now gets $500,000 a year to do that job in Arizona. Brad Seely, the
Patriots' new special teams coach, reportedly is getting $260,000
annually, triple what that job paid just 10 years ago. Larry
Beightol, formerly of the Dolphins, reportedly turned down a ton of
money to become the offensive line coach of the Patriots, opting to
go to Green Bay. One head coach has the theory that the owners are
trying to boost assistants' pay to stem the movement to have them
unionize, which could happen in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves, whom everyone now credits with turning the Falcons
around, almost didn't get hired in Atlanta. The Falcons interviewed
Reeves but then told him they had to speak with Florida coach Steve
Spurrier before making a decision. Spurrier would have had the job
if he wanted it. When he said no, the Falcons went back to Reeves.
Reeves had a year left on his Giants contract and could have sat
out, but he wanted to get right back into coaching _ just as he did
when he was fired in Denver and landed in New York _ so his
assistants wouldn't be out of jobs . . . New Browns coach Chris
Palmer would have tried to hire fired Patriots offensive line coach
Paul Boudreau, but Miami's Jimmy Johnson beat him to the punch.
Palmer also had a spot for Dante Scarnecchia in Cleveland if he
wanted it, but Scarnecchia decided to stay in New England and
switch to offensive line coach when Seely took over the special
teams. Scarnecchia, friends say, had been reluctant to do that
because he did not think Boudreau should have been fired . . .
Bumped into University of Miami basketball coach Leonard Hamilton
on the flight here just after his team beat Boston College, and he
said of the Eagles, ``They are going to be very good in the next
two or three years. They are starting to turn that program around
even though it doesn't look that way yet.'' . . . No one had it
worse than the Buffalo Bills when it came to officiating this
season, so for his Super Bowl Eve party here, owner Ralph Wilson
sent out replicas of yellow penalty flags with invitations printed
on them. The flags, complete with little weights sewn into them,
read, ``We have the Final Call.'' . . . Former Falcons player
personnel director Ken Herock says that in the last 15 years, 26
quarterbacks have been drafted in the first round and 13 have been
complete busts who were out of football in a hurry.

BLACK FILM LEGACY BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN TWO SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From D.W. Griffith's 1915 classic ``The Birth of a Nation'' to
last year's awful ``Krippendorf's Tribe,'' racism sometimes rears
its ugly head in the movies. For the past 40 years or so, it has
been a sin more of omission than commission, with even movies with
large casts, such as the current ``Playing by Heart,'' relegating
minority characters to small parts _ when they're included at all.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the silent era, however, African-American
filmmakers were taking matters into their own hands, writing,
directing and producing black-cast films that reflected the
African-American experience. In keeping with Black History Month,
several organizations are offering a look at obscure and
semi-obscure African-American movies from as early as 1929. These
movies have a historical significance that should make them of
interest to any film buff.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the film series are in Dallas; the other two are on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesdays during February, Dallas' USA Film Festival will
offer ``Treasures of the Tyler Collection,'' four movies from the
Dallas-based film archive. Southern Methodist University is the
home of this collection of restored black-oriented films, and
members from SMU's cinema department will be on hand for
question-and-answer sessions after the screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The four films being shown are:
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: ``Where's My Man Tonight?,'' a 1943 film about an
unwilling draftee who becomes a World War II hero. Spencer
Williams, who would later star in the '50s TV series ``Amos and
Andy,'' directed.
</P>
<P>
   FEB. 9: ``Juke Joint,'' a 1947 comedy about two drifters who try
to get free room and board by helping a young woman prepare for a
beauty pageant. Williams directed and stars.
</P>
<P>
   FEB. 16: ``The Blood of Jesus,'' a 1941 blues-infused movie
about a woman who, after being accidentally killed by her husband,
hovers between a honky-tonk hell and a holy heaven. Williams
directed.
</P>
<P>
   FEB. 23: ``A Miracle in Harlem,'' a 1948 murder mystery with
musical numbers, pitting a kindly candy-store owner against the
owners of a candy-store chain.
</P>
<P>
   All films are at 7:30 p.m. at the Loews Theatres Cityplace, 2600
N. Haskell Ave. (just east of North Central Expressway) in Dallas.
Tickets are $7 and go on sale at 6:30 p.m. Call (214) 821-FILM.
</P>
<P>
   African-American movies have long been the mission of Black
Cinematheque Dallas, which frequently runs contemporary nonfiction
films. On Feb. 19, Black Cinematheque will run two short
documentaries: ``Ready for the Revolution'' (1998) and ``Kwame
Toure: Get Organized'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Both films are about the same person: 1960s black revolutionary
Stokely Carmichael, who later changed his name to Kwame Toure (the
former Black Panther died Nov. 15). ``Revolution'' is a compilation
of Carmichael's work with the Panthers and the All African People's
Revolutionary Party; it also includes footage of his funeral. ``Get
Organized'' recalls the civil rights and black-power movements, and
encourages the current generation to be involved in the black
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The program is at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 19 at South Dallas Cultural
Center, 3400 S. Fitzhugh St., Dallas. Tickets are $5. Call (214)
426-1683.
</P>
<P>
   Another one-shot program happens at the Black Academy of Arts
and Letters, which will screen the 1978 movie ``Roll of Thunder,
Hear My Cry'' at 8 p.m. Sunday at 650 S. Griffin St. in Dallas. The
film, based on Mildred Taylor's book about a family's struggle to
hold on to its land during the Depression, features an early
appearance by Morgan Freeman. Tickets are $2; call (214) 743-2449.
</P>
<P>
   On cable TV, Turner Classic Movies, which has usurped American
Movie Classics as the premier old-movie network, also pays tribute,
dipping far into its incredible library. On Mondays during
February, the network will air the 19-movie Black History Month
Festival, honoring six decades of African-American movies.
</P>
<P>
   Each Monday has its own theme, starting at 7 p.m. Feb. 1 with
``On-Screen Heroes.'' The night kicks off with a Sidney Poitier
double feature: 1963's ``Lilies of the Field'' (for which Poitier
became the first African-American to win the Best Actor Oscar), and
1967's Best Picture winner, ``In the Heat of the Night.'' Later in
the night (early Feb. 2) is a fascinating western triple bill,
beginning at 12:30 a.m.: ``The Bronze Buckaroo'' (1939), ``Trailin'
West'' (1936) and ``Renegades of the West'' (1933).
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 8 theme is ``Spirituality,'' and among its noteworthy
offerings are Spencer Williams' aforementioned ``The Blood of
Jesus'' (7 p.m.), and the classic 1929 melodrama ``Hallelujah'' (9
p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 15 sees the other side of the coin with ``Sensuality,''
including Harry Belafonte and Inger Stevens in the post-apocalyptic
1959 drama ``The World, the Flesh and the Devil'' (10:30 p.m.), and
Poitier and Paul Newman as jazz musicians in 1961's Duke
Ellington-scored ``Paris Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 22's theme, ``Small-Town Struggles,'' brings 1920's
``Within Our Gates,'' directed by pioneer black filmmaker Oscar
Micheaux, who began making movies as a response to the
stereotypical representations of blacks in white-directed movies.
The movie, which TCM calls the oldest surviving black film, deals
with lynching, racism and the rape of blacks by whites. White
``and'' black civic leaders tried to block screenings when the film
was originally released. It airs at 10:30 p.m. Also on the night's
program are the moving 1972 classic ``Sounder'' (7 p.m.), and
Gordon Parks Jr.'s groundbreaking 1969 effort, ``The Learning
Tree'' (midnight).
</P>
<P>
   TCM's rival, American Movie Classics, will air a one-day,
24-hour festival on Feb. 9. It kicks off at 5 a.m. with the 1924
silent ``Body and Soul,'' featuring an early screen performance by
the great Paul Robeson in a dual role as an evil preacher and his
good brother. Also of interest: ``St. Louis Blues,'' with Nat King
Cole as W.C. Handy (3:30 p.m.); 1960's ``Sergeant Rutledge,'' a
John Ford film about a black U.S. cavalry officer on trial for rape
and murder; and ``Black Like Me,'' a fact-based 1964 film about a
white reporter who took pigment-changing drugs in order to
investigate the black experience.

<P>
   EXP-SCHIZOPHRENIA-COPE (New York) _ Schizophrenia afflicts an
estimated 2.7 million Americans. It is an illness notable for its

members who often can do little but watch helplessly. The public,

lurid headlines, like those that followed Goldstein's arrest. And
sensational news coverage reenforces the mistaken belief that
violence frequently accompanies the illness. By Erica Goode.

 &HT;    Shanahan: The goal was repeat
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With the week of preparation and media scrutiny over,
the Denver Broncos profess to be appropriately prepared to defend
their championship. And they'll be ready Sunday in the Super Bowl
against the Falcons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could play today,'' coach Mike Shanahan said Friday.
``We have to wait, but I think our preparation has been excellent.
Our concentration has been there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does not expect it to waver in the interim. Shanahan went
to great pains to establish continuity in the arrival of players'
family members by lining up three Fort Lauderdale hotels in close
proximity.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego Super Bowl last year, Shanahan said the
players' family and close friends stayed at a hotel far from their
La Jolla location, which caused a bit of distraction. In Fort
Lauderdale this time, the players are at the Hyatt, with two hotels
within walking distance serving others close to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition with the families coming in worked out better
than it did a year ago,'' Shanahan said. ``Last year, we went
through a couple of stumbling blocks.... I'm very comfortable with
the plan this year.'' Shanahan believed his team would be in this
position after upsetting the Packers last year because of the
players' commitment to winning. Most of the players spent a
significant portion of the offseason in Denver, working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one goal after the Super Bowl last year,'' he said.
``And that was to win this game.''
</P>

 &HT;    On with the game
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It began to dawn upon me, being a slow learner, as I
walked through the falling snow in Minneapolis and the score from
Denver settled in, that we were faced with the inevitable. That we
would be having a resumption of Dan Reeves-Broncos hostilities. The
Reeves-Elway-Shanahan troika, head coach double-teamed by an
assistant and the spoiled star. A festering wound would be
reopened. It shouldn't be happening to a man as solid as Dan
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm happy to report that it hasn't been nearly as much a
hassle down here as I'd thought it would. There hasn't been a
single black-type headline trumpeting an old family squabble.
Probably, Reeves gets credit for that, indirectly. When the subject
was brought up at a news conference back on the Falcons base in
Suwanee, he met it head on and honestly. Said his piece, then
announced that that would be the last of that. No mas.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been, and so we get on with the matter at hand. The
fact that the Falcons are here pretty much qualifies as the upset
of the decade. There is a story going around about the denizens of
hell waking up one morning and discovering that the place was
covered with a sheet of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ye gods,'' said one, ``the Falcons must have gone to the Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is that they're so happy to be here they'll
forget their lines. One Denver columnist wrote the other day that
the Broncos would win a laugher _ 56-9 I think he wrote. Read like
he'd been feeding some of Denver's past Super Bowl scores into his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   A voice attached to one probably known as a radio personality in
Denver told Jeff Hullinger the other day, ``You have a coach we
discarded, couldn't use him any more.'' Amazing, what winning one
Super Bowl in a row will do to bring out the bully in a town.
</P>
<P>
   I liked something Reeves said in his last news conference Friday
morning, tidily dressed this time in a gray suit, white shirt and
patterned tie. ``The less you say before the game, the less you
have to take back.''
</P>
<P>
   He had just taken his audience back to preseason, when the
Falcons were shaping up. ``The Super Bowl wasn't in our plans. You
have to be realistic. After a 7-9 season, you don't say you're
going to the Super Bowl. We were just working to improve to 10-6.''
</P>
<P>
   He began putting pieces together, like building blocks. He had
the main part of the puzzle; he needed to fit in some missing
parts. He'd drafted Keith Brooking from Georgia Tech the first
round. He would be a slow starter but a fast finisher. Tim Dwight,
the daredevil from Iowa, filled more than one need, kick returner,
pass catcher, tailback. Just point him in the right direction and
sic 'em. He's the kind who jumps from bridges on a string, dives
out of planes, goes over Niagara in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the above,'' he said, ``except the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Salaam is probably the jewel of the draft, a young man
coming out of San Diego State and winding up a starting tackle in
the Super Bowl. When Dwight was injured, the Falcons picked up an
unemployed receiver named Ronnie Harris. He was about as anonymous
as Aesop. He first fielded punts tentatively. Then he came on with
big catches in the past three games, all-star speed out of the
University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   He had been released by Seattle. ``After a Sunday night game,''
he said. ``We'd had five turnovers, one of them mine. That week
they let me go. I was the example.''
</P>
<P>
   Some example: From release to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any position in which the Falcons have been
short-changed, it's at quarterback. Stories are written of the
Falcons and Chris Chandler isn't mentioned. John Elway's badge is
on every story of the Broncos. Thing is, Chandler has been playing
on a higher plane than Elway lately. He carries no heavy load of
ego. He is fearless. He has the team by the hand and led it to the
Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be left standing Sunday night, for the Broncos are
vicious and without mercy. But I have this feeling that he will
survive, and so will the Falcons. Who knows, hell may freeze over
one more time.

 &HT;    Center gets time to shine
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He has unwittingly been a center of attention for
severals seasons now and Broncos snapper Tom Nalen will get some
more time in the spotlight on Sunday night. It is anticipated that
the blocking scheme installed by assistant head coach Alex Gibbs
calls for Nalen to provide double-team assistance for right guard
Dan Neil on Falcons left tackle Travis Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Nalen, who was selected for a second straight Pro Bowl
appearance, is one of the most athletic centers in the game but is
overly modest about his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are other guys like Dermontti Dawson (of
Pittsburgh) who do all of the things I do and do them better,''
Nalen said. His teammates, however disagree. ''With all apologies
to Dawson,'' said left tackle Tony Jones, ''our guy is the best in
the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson will start for the AFC again this year and Nalen will be
his backup. There are some personnel scouts who feel the New York
Jets' Kevin Mawae was more consistent than Nalen in '98, but Gibbs
insisted his guy graded out high again. Because he moves so well
and gets out in front of plays, much as Dawson does, Nalen is a key
to the Denver running game and the Falcons must try to occupy him
and keep him from pulling.
</P>
<P>
   On alert
</P>
<P>
   Miami Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong, who is president
of the NFL Players Association, said the union will file a
complaint with the league about the Bronco's ''cut-and-roll''
blocking techniques. ''It's dangerous (stuff),'' Armtrong said.
''They have to do something about it before somebody gets a knee
blown out.'' Some players have complained that the Denver linemen
roll up the backs of defensive linemen's legs on purpose, Armstrong
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Practice report
</P>
<P>
   In their final practice of the season, the Broncos spent 95
minutes fine-tuning their game plan and working on some red-zone
offense. Backup tight end Dwayne Carswell dropped a pass in the end
zone, prompting coach Mike Shanahan to remark, ``Come on, we've got
to concentrate just like in the game.'' A few snaps later,
quarterback John Elway suggested that they repeat the play to
Carswell, and the five-year veteran made the catch, with teammates
cheering him. In keeping with a Denver tradition, the Friday
session was ``hat day,'' with players permitted to wear some
headgear other than their helmets. Wide receiver Rod Smith sported
a Broncos' doo-rag. The team had simulated crowd noise provided by
large speakers, and Shanahan said that also is standard for his
Friday practices. The team will spend about 15-30 minutes on
Saturday with a brief walk-through at Pro Player Stadium. The four
''early'' inactives for Denver were listed as wide receiver Justin
Armour, offensive tackle Trey Teague, guard Chris Banks and
defensive end Cyron Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Under the knife
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mark Schlereth soon will add to the souvenir bag of
bone-chips he carts around with him. The 10-year veteran already
has scheduled his 23rd sugery -- this one on his left elbow -- for
next month, after he returns from a vacation in Hawaii. The elbow
has been sore for more than a month, and doctors have diagnosed the
source of the pain as floating bone fragments. ``The thing is, we
haven't played the game yet, so 23 might be an understatement,''
Schlereth said. ``There could be something else that comes up.'' Of
the 22 previous surgeries, 17 have been on his knees. ``I'm not
playing to establish a legacy, but I know that no one ever got more
out of his body in the history of this game than I did,'' he said.
``I can't say I'm proud of that, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bubster
</P>
<P>
   Because of his colorful quotes, Bubby Brister might have been
the most interviewed No. 2 quarterback before a Super Bowl. ``I
just speak my mind, and guys come running with their notebooks,''
Brister said. ``I guess they're aren't a lot of guys who are as
honest as I am. But I'm going to tell you what I'm thinking, and
that's a constant.'' Brister was 4-0 this season as a starter and
is expected to win the starter's job for the 1999 season if Elway
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Martin-izing
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Greg Robinson is impressed with the
Atlanta running game and acknowledged that his defense must stop
Jamal Anderson to contain the Falcons. But the man that Robinson
thinks has made the biggest difference in the Falcons passing game
is wideout Tony Martin. ``He really helped them because he
complements (Terance) Mathis nicely,'' Robinson said. ``Their
scheme really plays well into the strengths of their guys. They've
evolved. They are committed to the running game but, at the same
time, they can throw the ball and they're very confident doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anniversary time
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will mark the fourth anniversary of Denver owner Patrick
Bowlen hiring Shanahan. Bowlen, who dismissed Wade Phillips after
the 1994 season, talked with then-Miami offensive coordinator Gary
Stevens before settling on Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day
</P>
<P>
   The Denver offense had no turnovers in its first two playoff
victories. The Broncos defense forced nine takeaways in the wins
over Miami and the New York Jets, and Neil Smith returned a fumble
recovery 79 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Derek Loville, the backup to Terrell Davis, was
recruited to Oregon by Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks
and played for him there 1986-89. . . . The Broncos list 17 players
on their injury report but all are rated as ``probable'' for the
game. . . . Punter Tom Rouen, who has chronic problems out-kicking
his coverage, might angle the ball toward the sidelines on Sunday
to try to keep it away from Tim Dwight. . . . Word is that the
Broncos might have worked on some unusual three-man fronts, with
Keith Burns as a fourth linebacker. . . . Strongside linebacker
Bill Romanowski is taking 50 dietary-supplement tablets every day.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)

 &HT;    Falcons defense just has to control its gaps
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Attention, Falcons: There is only one sure way to stop
running back Terrell Davis. Plunk Ray Goff on the sideline Sunday.
That seemed to work well when both were at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this grim duty will fall to a Falcons defense that
was second-best in the NFL this season at discouraging the run. If
you can make it through the jungle of pregame shows, if you survive
the bean dip up until game time, then this might be an actual
physical matchup worth study.
</P>
<P>
   A few more words from Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, and we
promise they will have nothing to do with the personal peccadillos
of the league's defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee Terrell Davis will carry the ball 25 times,''
Sharpe said. ``And I guarantee our chances go up at least 85 to 90
percent that, if he gets 100 yards, we win the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, football does not require advanced math. The
Broncos win by addition, the Falcons by subtraction. Davis, who
felt so suffocated by Goff at Georgia, is now the 2,000-yard
difference-maker. He has to be right up front, maybe even on the
dust jacket, of the Falcons' defensive game plan.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer attitude, no one enters the challenge better armed
than defensive end Chuck Smith. Such was to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we held him to 79 yards,'' Smith said, referring to
a September regular-season meeting. ``There's no super back in the
league. Anybody can be stopped. Anybody can get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, just how to downgrade Davis on the field?
</P>
<P>
   I've heard so much about gap control this week, I feel like
David Letterman's dentist.
</P>
<P>
   That Falcons defense just has to control its gaps. But isn't
that advice any of us could profit from? We'd all be a little
better off if only we controlled our gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to penetrate and force him to make a cut he doesn't
want to make, and then have someone there waiting for him,'' tackle
Travis Hall said. The least crack in the wall and Davis gets as
unstoppable as rainwater in a leaky basement.
</P>
<P>
   Kindly, Davis says the Falcons can be a major annoyance. ``They
play gap control very well, and it's the type of team I hate to
see. I like to see people a little more undisciplined than that,''
he muses. Confusion is one of his great friends.
</P>
<P>
   In their scheming against the run, of course, the Falcons make
themselves vulnerable to other forms of football propulsion. Can
they afford the presumption that John Elway has enough mileage on
him that he can't win this thing on his own? They're just trying to
choose the most palatable poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting a lot of advice from other players on how to
stop Terrell,'' safety Eugene Robinson said. ``James Hasty (of
Kansas City) and I were talking about it the other day. You have to
try to cut out the running lanes and play an eight-man front. I
know that puts a lot of pressure on the pass defense. The
cornerbacks have got to come up big against John Elway because we
have to stop Terrell Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Should these well-laid plans begin to break down, then they'll
just have to find a way to rush Goff to the field for the second
half, at least.

 &HT;    Waging bull market
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the latest line: Sunday will be a record day for sports
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   That prediction comes from Las Vegas, where sports wagers are
legal.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta, where they're not.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is, by far, the top sports betting event in the
world, according to gaming and law enforcement authorities. The
NCAA men's basketball tournament is close behind, but it's spread
over three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada alone, gamblers bet $77.3 million on the 1998 Super
Bowl, according to Caesar's Palace casino. That figure has risen
steadily during the '90s, from $40 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the nation's legal sports gambling, outside horse
racing and other parimutuels, operates in Nevada. Anywhere else,
bets placed over the phone, the Internet, through local bookies or
even in office pools are against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone agrees that legal betting is just the tip of the
iceberg. The size of that berg is incalculable because bookies
don't report to the Internal Revenue Service and friendly wagerers
don't report to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you cut it, the Super Bowl generates a lot of action. So
how do you get in on it?
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question ... is why would you want to? Gamblers say
it makes the game more interesting, that it makes the spectator a
``player.''
</P>
<P>
   But like lots of temporary pleasures, it can be a slippery
slope, gaming opponents say. And big betting days, like Super Bowl
Sunday, can spark an initial interest that can lead to lifelong
problems, says Frank Quinn, a psychologist who testified in
November before the National Gambling Impact Study Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for most people _ the switch that flips them into
gambling out of control _ is that early win,'' he said.

AGENCIES ESCHEW HANDOFF FOR SUPER BOWL ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just before dawn Thursday, Ben Raynes headed for Logan
International Airport with a ticket to Los Angeles and a lead-lined
bag whose contents were worth well more than $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat entrusted with state secrets? A courier carrying
crown jewels? No, the mission here was to deliver the final copies
of a TV ad that will air during Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The ad for the Hartford Financial Services Group could have been
sent by overnight delivery, but Raynes' employer, ad agency Arnold
Communications of Boston, was taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   For getting the ad to the Fox network on time and never letting
the bag leave his sight, Raynes is regarded as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him Ben-Hur now,'' says Arnold creative director Kathy
Kiely. ``We joked about handcuffing him to his briefcase _ and told
him not to fall asleep on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Such precautions may seem over the top, but perhaps Kiely
recalled an ad on last year's Super Bowl, one that evoked an ad
agency's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   That ad was all test patterns and static with a caption running
across the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   According to the caption, an unidentified sponsor had prepared a
great ad with ``dancing kangaroos and a Garth Brooks soundtrack,''
but the ad never got to the network because some ``boob'' at the ad
agency had used a fly-by-night delivery service instead of Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the star of The Hartford ad is a kangaroo who
once had his own TV show and who is known to his public and many
young fans as Skippy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Flipper of Australia,'' says Arnold vice president
Karen Riordan, whose Super Bowl duties included getting to know
Skippy, and what made him mellow and what made him skittish.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has learned kangaroos like tea. Forget puppy treats. You
want a star turn, then ply Skippy with Earl Grey.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to the tea lover, the Super Bowl ad is aptly titled
``Kangaroo,'' and after its finishing touches were applied
Wednesday night in Boston, Raynes headed west with copies of the ad
stowed in a lead-lined bag, one designed so X-rays at airport
security checkpoints couldn't spoil the film.
</P>
<P>
   Why such precautions? Consider this: Fox is charging an average
of $1.6 million for 30 seconds of Super Bowl airtime.
</P>
<P>
   As for Arnold, the new ad campaign that ``Kangaroo'' will kick
off represents 11 months of planning and 12,000 man-hours of work,
much of it logged on location in the Down Under outback where
kangaroos roam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first time in the Super Bowl, as well as the first
time for our client,'' Riordan said, explaining why Raynes was
dispatched to the West Coast in lieu of a hired courier. ``We'd
rather be safe than sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the ad began in February. Research showed that The
Hartford was perceived as a car-insurance company rather than as
one offering a broad range of financial services. To correct that
impression, The Hartford decided to run a high-profile TV ad
campaign, which would debut during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   By May, Arnold was ready to show key Hartford executives its
idea for a kangaroo ad on a storyboard, a series of hand-drawn
sketches presenting the ad's plot and punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to the next stage of the process, the ad's concept
had to be approved by various Hartford executives and its legal
department, as well as its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ad relies heavily on humor, it was also run by focus
groups to ensure that viewers would find the ad as funny as
Arnold's copywriters did.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Arnold also first contacted Fox, the network
airing the Super Bowl. As the script of the ad underwent revisions,
Fox was regularly updated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted preclearance from Fox,'' Riordan says. ``We didn't
want issues to come up in December after we'd already spent a lot
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Fox had given the green light, Skippy and a director were
hired in October. Actors were auditioned in early November, and
several weeks of filming yielded about 30 hours of footage, which
had to be edited into a 30-second ad.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes like this: Skippy escapes from the zoo and wreaks
havoc. As he hops over a fence, he upsets an ornamental lion that
seems destined to damage a car before the action is frozen in
midframe.
</P>
<P>
   Skippy's next hop seems about to crush a hot dog stand, and his
third imperils Aunt Edna, who's out walking her poodles. Always,
the action is frozen just before Skippy lands, and viewers never
see the consequences of his mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's voiceover says of Skippy: ``Possibility One. He
flattens your car. Your Hartford auto policy covers the damage.
Possibility two. He flattens your hot dog stand. Your Hartford
small-business insurance helps you rebuild. Possibility three. He
flattens your great-aunt Edna. Might we suggest investing your
inheritance in one of our top-selling annuities? Whatever life
brings you, bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   To create the illusion of a kangaroo rampage, the spot makes
extensive use of computer imaging to make it appear as if Skippy is
recklessly bounding through a throng of people.
</P>
<P>
   During the editing process, Arnold rented a video fax machine so
it could view in Boston every change made in a Sydney studio.
</P>
<P>
   By Riordan's count, she and other Arnold staffers also made 36
trips to Hartford by car during December to update the client on
every tweak and edit made to the kangaroo ad.
</P>
<P>
   When the ad was finally finished, Raynes was sent to Los
Angeles, not only to deliver the finished product to Fox but also
to screen it in the network's presence to ensure no glitches mar
its Super Bowl airing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a baby in less time,'' Riordan says of the
Super Bowl ad process.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, making such an ad mixes some of the industry's most
sophisticated techniques with many Hartford road trips _ and, says
Riordan, some Ben-Hur ``low-tech hand delivery.''

RENO REJECTS INDEPENDENT PROBE OF FOR FORMER CLINTON AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday rejected the
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that
a former senior aide to President Clinton lied under oath in
testimony to a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno waited until the last minute to make her decision about an
independent counsel to investigate Harold M. Ickes, filing nearly
40 pages of documents explaining her reasons to a special
three-judge panel only minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which followed months of deliberation, drew
immediate criticism from Republicans who accused the attorney
general of trying to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno has defied the spirit and the letter of the
independent counsel statue for so long and has so defiantly ignored
the advice of the FBI director and her chief prosecutor that her
investigation has become a sham,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, chairman
of the House Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, who asked not to be named, said
the decision was delayed in part because Reno's advisers were
divided.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Ickes, a former White House deputy chief of
staff, lied in a Sept. 22, 1997, deposition to the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee complained in a
report last year that Ickes had misled its investigators about his
actions on behalf of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters had been frustrated in their efforts to end a
labor dispute at a Diamond Walnut processing plant in Stockton,
Calif., and had discussed the issue with Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ickes met with Teamsters leaders about the strike. A memo
prepared for him by the Teamsters noted that the union gave $2.4
million to Democratic candidates in 1992 and suggested that the
Clinton administration should consider helping the labor group if
it wanted continued support.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition before the Senate committee, Ickes was
asked, ``What did the administration do regarding the Diamond
Walnut strike?''
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``Nothing that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   However, committee lawyers said Ickes' statement appeared to be
contradicted by witnesses and documents.
</P>
<P>
   White House documents indicated that Ickes had asked then-U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to intervene in the strike. At
Ickes's request, Kantor phoned Diamond Walnut's president.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor testified to a congressional panel last year that he
phoned the president of Diamond Walnut, but knowing almost nothing
of the facts, simply asked for a ``benign'' status report on the
likelihood of a strike settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor said he did not pressure William Cuff, the Diamond Walnut
president. Cuff said at the same Senate hearing that he had not
felt threatened, but that he did regard the call as part of a union
effort ``to bring us to our knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have argued that the evidence warranted an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, who chairs the Governmental Affairs
Committee, has criticized Reno's handling of the Ickes matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demise of the independent counsel law when it expires this
year may be the most notable `achievement' of her tenure as
attorney general,'' Thompson, R-Tenn., said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dismayed by the attorney general's decision,'' said Rep.
Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of the House Education and
Workforce Committee's oversight and investigations panel, which
conducted a 16-month investigation into the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation uncovered substantial information indicating
that Mr. Ickes may have provided false and misleading testimony to
Congress,'' he said, adding that his subcommittee shared its
information with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In November, Reno put off her decision on a special prosecutor
to investigate Ickes by invoking a provision of the independent
counsel law that allows her a one-time 60-day extension.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some officials within the Justice Department have
expressed dismay over Reno's indecision on the Ickes matter. They
said the Justice Department had evidence relating to the case for
nearly two years. And, they noted, Reno had four months to weigh
the issue, beginning with a one-month initial review period,
followed by the three-month preliminary investigation that ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, the legal issues were familiar. Reno has
decided similar issues in two of the seven cases she has referred
to independent counsels. Those investigations center on whether
Henry G. Cisneros, the former Housing Secretary, lied to the FBI
about the extent of his payments to his former mistress and whether
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt lied about a decision to deny an
Indian casino permit.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reno found insufficient evidence for seeking an
independent counsel to investigate whether the president and his
aides violated federal election law by directing a massive
advertising campaign for Clinton's re-election financed with
Democratic Party money intended for party use.
</P>
<P>
   Election auditors had questioned the financing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno came to the same conclusion in November on whether Vice
President Al Gore had lied to investigators about his 1996
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Republicans have attacked Reno over her repeated
refusal to seek independent counsels in campaign finance cases. But
on Thursday, Reno said she was unfazed by the criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I'm uncomfortable with myself is when I think
I've not been as thorough as I could in terms of trying to
understand what the issues are,'' she said.

CLINTON WANTS $48 MILLION IN AID FOR N.E. FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is proposing a $48 million
program to help New England fishermen and communities that have
been hurt by restrictions on fishing, Massachusetts lawmakers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money is available under current law and some will
be included in Clinton's federal budget for fiscal year 2000, which
he is scheduled to unveil Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been working for years to rebuild groundfish
stocks in New England waters, using stringent harvesting
restrictions and other techniques. While these efforts have had
some success on Georges Bank, concern has risen recently over
scallop fishing and about collapsing cod stocks in the Gulf of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, managers of New England fisheries tentatively
backed a series of closures to cod fishing areas in the Gulf of
Maine. They also voted to cut the daily cod catch limit to a level
some fisherman said is too low for them to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward Kennedy has warned that the cod restrictions
could idle 700 boats and put 2,500 fishermen out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The president is proposing:
</P>
<P>
   --$25 million for job retraining and related assistance for
workers who lose their jobs as a result of the depressed fishing
industry in New England. The money is available under current law.
</P>
<P>
   --$5 million to assist Northeast communities with planning
grants, public works construction grants, and other economic
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   --$2 million this year and $5 million next year for fishery
management projects that employ both scientists and fishermen.
These might include surveys of the fishing stocks and development
of new management techniques.
</P>
<P>
   --$3 million this year and $8 million next year for vessel
buyout programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal follows an effort by at least five
Massachusetts lawmakers to win $100 million for the local fishing
industry. The lawmakers included Kennedy and Senator John Kerry,
and Representatives Barney Frank, John Tierney and William
Delahunt, all Massachusetts Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called Clinton's plan ``welcome news,'' but added,
``It's not everything we wanted, and we'll continue the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Kerry said he would continue to press
for money to give fishermen affordable health insurance, as well as
other assistance.

   NEW YORK _ He says he hears voices now. Telling him what to do.
How to handle different situations. Encouraging him.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis says this with a smile these days. A laugh even.
That's what happens when you have a Top 10 team, a legitimate
contender for the Big East title.
</P>
<P>
   When you are 17-4, you can talk about hearing voices inside your
head and people think you are crafty, not crazy.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, after a career up and down the Northeast
corridor that began at Cambridge Ringe &AMP; Latin High School, that
included an undergraduate stay at Northeastern and coaching stints
at NU, Harvard, Boston University, and George Washington before the
move to St. John's last summer, you are now in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a doubt, check out the attention the Red Storm are
suddenly receiving in New York. Sellout crowds at Madison Square
Garden are no longer limited to Knicks and Rangers games.
</P>
<P>
   Take this week: No. 2 Duke (last Sunday) and No. 1 Connecticut
(Saturday) coming to the Garden to take on the Red Storm in an
atmosphere that is evoking memories of the golden days of college
basketball in New York City, when sellout crowds were the rule
rather than the exception.
</P>

   Check out the praise that has been heaped on Jarvis as he
watched St. John's rise steadily in the polls to its present No. 9
ranking.

   The word on Jarvis before he came to St. John's was that he had
one more major move in him. At 53, he had established himself in
eight seasons at GW as a guy who knew how to win, knew how to
coach, knew how to recruit _ although the critics hinted that it
might be nice if he did some recruiting in the continental United
States instead of across the pond in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The word was that Jarvis had his eyes on the NBA. That he would
like nothing more to crown his career than to come back to Boston
and take over the rebuilding Celtics. That was BP, however _ before
Rick Pitino filled that job.
</P>
<P>
   Things change. So do ambitions. At GW, Jarvis was . . .
comfortable, as well as restless. He had established himself in the
Atlantic 10. Never had a losing record in eight years, keeping his
career record intact in that department. Never a loser at GW. Not
at BU. Not at Cambridge Rindge &AMP; Latin, where a kid named Patrick
Ewing made him a better coach.
</P>
<P>
   But GW was a mid-major school. The Colonials might make the NCAA
tournament, but realistically, would they ever do more than that?
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis's name always came up when coaching vacancies occurred.
GW athletic director Jack Kvancz, who had made Jarvis comfortable
with a package that paid him more than $600,000 a season, laughed
about it.
</P>
<P>
   If it was March, the calls would come. Last year the Virginia
job opened up. Jarvis's name came up. Kvancz shook his head and
doubted his coach would leave. He didn't, as Providence's Pete
Gillen took over the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Then St. John's became involved in a messy public situation
when, after a 22-10 turnaround, Fran Fraschilla was fired for
offending the powers that be who felt the school was still the
mecca of the college basketball world. So the call came to Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Jarvis initiated the conatct, reportedly calling St.
John's legend Lou Carnesecca to recommend Drexel coach Bill
Herrion.
</P>
<P>
   But those around Jarvis said he was also doing some personal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to Mike that the NBA was probably not going to
happen,'' said one source who had followed Jarvis's career for
years. ``St. John's was a nice alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a new pope seemed easier than picking a new St. John's
basketball coach. Or at least that's the way it appeared as St.
John's loyalists, longing for the days when the Red Storm were a
player on the national scene, watched anxiously for signs of white
smoke coming from the inner sanctum of the administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after what were described by both sides as some
contentious negotiations, Jarvis reached agreement on a $5 million,
seven-year package.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately started mending fences, reopening lines of
communications that had broken down during the short reign of
terror of Fraschilla, who was from the tough-love school of
coaching, getting into the faces of his players and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was in control, but he did it differently. ``Go out and
play,'' he told his new team, ``and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   There were doubters. St. John's was coming off a 20-win season,
but its two best players, Zendon Hamilton and the star-crossed
Felipe Lopez, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis didn't know what to expect. ``The only way,'' he said,
``was let them play.''
</P>
<P>
   The players recognized that quickly. ``The first practice we
had, he told us to run through some drills, and we were so used to
being, quote-unquote, robots,'' said center Tyrone Grant, one of
only two seniors on the roster. ``He told us to to just do the
drill and then said, `You don't play like that, so practice the way
you would play in the game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they have done that. And then some. Jarvis said he learned
quickly what he had.
</P>
<P>
   In a Preseason NIT game against old Atlantic 10 rival
Massachusetts, Jarvis found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a game we had to win to move us forward,'' said
Jarvis, who saw his team eke out a 73-69 triumph over the more
highly regarded Minutemen. ``It was a game we needed to go out and
play some of the teams in the country. The UMass game got us in the
position where we could really find out (how good they were).''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm now know, taking on all comers and not backing
down.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they are more than an NCAA tournament team. They are a
club with potential to cause some ripples in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Kvancz is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good players,'' Kvancz said from his Washington
office. ``And he's an excellent coach. More importantly, he's an
excellent man. He's real. Those kids see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvancz, who hired Tom Penders to replace Jarvis, perceives a
sense of satisfaction as well as expectation in Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he stayed here, we would have been very good,'' Kvancz
said. ``But St. John's could be a Final Four program. That's what
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say they can't do that? The Red Storm have the skills.
From Grant, who has had to deal with a knee injury, to budding
stars like sophomore Ron Artest, who has emerged as a team leader,
St. John's has proven it can deal with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has shrugged off losing players such as Lopez and
Hamilton, who combined for more than 3,700 points during their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose players,'' said Jarvis, ``there are players
waiting to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis likes the new challenge, which is why he is in New York:
``The timing was right.''
</P>
<P>
   At 53, after all those stops, he knows this may be his last.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not Boston. It's not the Celtics. But it's Prime Time,
and that isn't bad, either.

&HT;        SPECTER AGAIN TAKES CENTER STAGE IN HIGH PROFILE NATIONAL
LEGAL CASE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 -- Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was
tapped by Republicans Friday to oversee the questioning of White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal in President Clinton's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said Specter was one of the three Senators
they chose for a role in the deposition process because of his
legal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Specter was a natural choice,'' said John Lundy, a
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``Not only
was he chosen for his legal skills and talent, but we have relied
on his expertise throughout the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter is known for his cross-examination of Anita Hill in the
Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into whether she was sexually
harassed by Clarence Thomas, and for his work as assistant counsel
to the Warren commission. He also gained national recognition when
he helped block the appointment of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy said Specter won't be able to ask questions himself, but
will mediate and preside on behalf of Senate Republicans at the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Specter would not comment on his new role. He took and oath of
public silence about the trial after being sworn in as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans chose Ohio Sen. Mike DeWine to represent them for
Monica Lewinsky's deposition and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson for
Vernon Jordan's questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats selected Patrick Leahy of Vermont, John Edwards of
North Carolina, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut. However, they
have not yet been assigned to oversee questioning of a particular
witness.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition process could lead to videotaped or live
testimony on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, a Yale-educated attorney and former assistant attorney
general of Pennsylvania, has appeared on countless national
television talk shows touting the impeachment trial as the ``Trial
of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Specter, didn't think Clinton should face charges
until after his term. But he became one of the Senate's most
outspoken members in favor of questioning witnesses -- a move the
White House vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sworn in as juror, Specter said witness testimony
was necessary because, unlike some of his colleagues, he thinks
there are facts ``in dispute'' in the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy said he wasn't sure whether Specter asked to be considered
for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, Specter was on everyone's short list,'' Lundy
said. ``He's the perfect choice.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, a monthly fashion
magazine published by Conde Nast, assembled her staff for a meeting
in early December. The magazine, she said, would be changing its
direction, placing more emphasis on celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Then she lowered the boom: ``Nobody cares about models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wells' frankness is a sign of the changing times in the
modeling industry, as women's magazines take the cue from other
magazine categories and shift their focus from the placid, youthful
beauty of models to the expertly pancaked visages of movie stars
and talk-show hostesses. Whether the woman in question is a mere
co-star in a feel-good Robin Williams vehicle (Monica Potter, an
actress in ``Patch Adams,'' who poses on the January cover of Self)
or the first lady of the United States (who appeared on the cover
of Vogue in December), it is the newly held belief of women's
magazine editors that she will sell a cover better than any model.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years ago, RuPaul's pop paeon ``Supermodel'' was at
the top of the charts and the singer George Michael's videos
featured famous models lip-synching the lyrics to his music as they
crawled across concrete floors. The elite clique known as
supermodels _ a rambunctious, publicity-happy group of five or six
women that included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy
Crawford, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and, depending on
your mood, Kate Moss _ stared out from the cover of every women's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   As Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue magazine, puts it:
``They were celebrities. The paparazzi were chasing them. Everyone
cared what they were having for breakfast and who they were having
affairs with.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the covers of women's magazines are any barometer, 1998
and early 1999 proved that little public interest remains in those
breakfast or boyfriend habits any more. The fashion and life-style
magazines that once deified these Amazons _ Cosmopolitan, Harper's
Bazaar, Marie Claire, Elle, W., Vogue, Mademoiselle, Allure,
Glamour, Self and even Seventeen _ are giving the supermodels and
their latter-day counterparts the cold shoulder. Since January
1998, the monthly Vogue has featured celebrities, not models, on
eight covers. Neil Gabler, a cultural historian who has written
about the phenomenon of celebrity, said that models have
disappeared from the covers of women's magazine because people grew
bored with the one-dimensional nature of models. Celebrities, he
said, at least offer the illusion of substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of the public, models are unidimensional,'' he
said. ``They are purely visual, whereas celebrities have these
lives we can attach to and they seem more fully dimensional to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Braudy, author of ``The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its
History,'' said he had been observing the waning supermodel
phenomenon and attributed it to the fact that celebrities may be
less physically perfect, and older, than models.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ego ideals and body ideals for consumers,'' he said.
``Hardly anyone thinks they can look like a supermodel, whereas a
movie star, as unrealistic as it sounds, offers some sort of
attainability.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Kates, the president of Next Management, a modeling agency
in New York, said the trend had ended the supermodel era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly affects the girls who were dominating the covers,''
she said. ``They're just not visible in magazines in the way they
used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogue has featured only one model on its cover since August. Ms.
Wintour said the magazine expected final numbers to show a huge
jump in its usual newsstand sales of about 500,000 for its covers
of Oprah Winfrey and Hillary Clinton. Allure, in a move to increase
its flat circulation and bolster advertising pages, will feature
more celebrities than models in 1999, said Ms. Wells.
Cosmopolitan's editor in chief, Kate White, said she will go half
and half in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in October, Marie Claire featured in quick, breathy
succession, the ``E.R.'' actress Juliana Margulies, Sandra Bullock,
the ``Friends'' and ``Scream'' star Courteney Cox and Susan
Sarandon. Rosie O'Donnell, the talk-show host, and the actress
Ashley Judd were photographed for their coming Marie Claire cover
earlier this month. Even though it is still largely confined to
American magazines, Conor Kennedy, a booker at Company Models,
which represents many up-and-coming models, called the trend cause
for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating right now,'' Kennedy said. ``If
magazines are making such an effort to feature Gwyneth Paltrow over
and over again, well, what happens to the next generation of Linda
Evangelista's? That generation just isn't coming into its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara Buxbaum, a publicity agent at PMK, a firm that handles the
public images of dozens of movie stars, said that putting a star on
the cover always represented a straightforward exchange: the star
lends her image for no fee, and the magazine becomes a billboard
for her new movie or special project.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put a client on the cover of a magazine, it's clearly
only because they're promoting a film,'' Ms. Buxbaum said, adding
that celebrity covers may sell better because the reader is
promised an article about the celebrity, not a usual accompaniment
to a cover model.
</P>
<P>
   One editor at a Conde Nast magazine, who insisted on anonymity,
said that she was ``fed up'' with models and what she characterized
as their spoiled-brat behavior; she said that movie stars, because
their studios want the publicity, are often easier to deal with
than models.
</P>
<P>
   But do celebrity covers really deliver the quick fix of robust
newsstand sales? In 1997, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan's best-selling cover featured Jennifer Aniston,
Harper's Bazaar's was Courtney Love and for Mirabella, Michelle
Pfeiffer sold best on newsstands, according to the publisher's
statements submitted to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. (Final
figures for the latter half of 1998 are not yet available.) In
1998, publishers reported that celebrities were among their
best-sellers: among them the actress Neve Campbell for
Mademoiselle, and Leonardo DiCaprio for Seventeen.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity covers, however, do not guarantee a magic burst of
activity at the newsstand. Allure's newsstand sales have dropped
over the last two years, and its recent celebrity covers have not
been remarkable sellers. A March 1998 cover featuring the actress
Jennifer Aniston sold 257,047 copies, according to Allure's
publisher's statement to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, not much
higher than the six-month average of 242,244.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the exception. Vogue, with robust sales for Ms.
Winfrey and the First lady, had ``an exceptional year'' with
celebrity covers in 1998, Ms. Wintour said. The Spice Girls and the
actresses Claire Danes, Sandra Bullock, Elizabeth Hurley and Renee
Zellweger vanquished the models the magazine did use, like the
exquisitely blonde but arguably bland Carolyn Murphy. Still, the
record wasn't perfect: Ms. Hurley sold slightly less than the
average on the newsstand.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the models?
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that the great success of In Style magazine, Time
Inc.'s recent celebrity-laden entry into the women's magazine
field, has inspired mimics. Another is that the fashion to shoot
models as gaunt, depressed and unglamourous waifs in the early
1990s denuded them of personality. Michael Gross, the author of
``Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women'' (Morrow, 1995) said
that magazines ``need a personality on the cover. And when models
lost their personalities and Hollywood created this bumper crop of
ingenues, the models lost the covers. And the models are angry.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Evangelista blames the press for the label
``supermodel'' in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `supermodel' is a press-induced word,'' she said
through a spokeswoman. ``We have never called ourselves
supermodels.'' She pointed out that if models are not appearing on
American covers, they can still be found on the majority of
European and Asian magazine covers. (Ms. Evangelista appeared on
the January covers of German and British Vogue.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the modeling agencies are branching out. In
anticipation of potential celebrity/cover-girl synergy, Wilhelmina
International Ltd., a modeling agency that generally bills about
$40 million annually, formed an alliance eight months ago with
Atlantic Records, a division of Time Warner Inc. Dieter Esch, the
owner of Wilhelmina, said the pairing had already proved
profitable. The teen-age pop singer Brandy has signed a contract to
become the new spokeswoman for Cover Girl cosmetics, reinforcing a
trend that has already become apparent in the advertising industry,
where celebrities, including Ms. Hurley for Estee Lauder, have
displaced models from their highly paid positions as commercial
spokeswomen.
</P>
<P>
   Sante D'Orazio, a photographer who shoots covers regularly for
many of the women's magazines, said that shooting celebrities was
good for his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a rough five years there,'' he said. ``Because glamour
was out. And I wasn't willing to shoot that way, that not-beautiful
way. Depressed girls who looked like they were high. And so I
started photographing celebrities, because they wanted to look
glamorous. So I made those movie stars look like the supermodels
once did.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Orazio, who recently shot Julia Roberts for the cover of In
Style, added: ``But you know, it's fashion. In two years, it will
all change again.''

GDP SOARED 5.6 PERCENT IN FOURTH QUARTER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year of pleasant surprises ended with the biggest
one of all: a last-minute burst of growth that surpassed even the
most bullish predictions.
</P>
<P>
   America's gross domestic product _ the total of goods and
services produced _surged at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the final
quarter of 1998. This marked the fastest pace in two years and made
1998 the third consecutive year that the economy expanded at a pace
of nearly 4 percent. For all of 1998, the GDP increased 3.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the go-go growth, inflation was somnolent. After running
about 1 percent earlier in the year, it slipped to eight-tenths of
a percent _ the lowest in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep getting stronger growth and less inflation pressure,''
said John Williams, chief economist at Bankers Trust Corp. ``At the
moment there seems to be nothing to get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, the talk was about a possible recession.
At that point, financial markets were quaking, growth in many parts
of the world was slowing or nonexistent, and America's farm and
energy industries were slumping.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, American corporations were pouring
billions into new technology, consumers were buying cars and other
expensive products, and exporters, who had been struggling all year
as markets languished in Asia and Latin America, saw their overseas
sales snap back.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of last fall's strength reflected one-time
events _General Motors Corp. catching up after its strike last
summer, Boeing Co. making year-end aircraft deliveries,
construction crews taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather _
and most economists expect the latest figures to be trimmed a bit
when more data become available and the GDP report is revised next
month. But with sales soaring, inventories lean and no sign of
inflation, there seemed little question that the economy barreled
into the new year with terrific momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything that could trigger recession in 1999,''
said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation
for Independent Business, who noted that business spending and
hiring plans remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Low, the chief economist at First Tennessee Capital
Markets, said: ``Typically, when we have inventories weaker than
expected and demand stronger than expected, that portends stronger
growth down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, American consumers accounted for most of the growth
last year. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.4 percent in the
fourth quarter and 4.8 percent for the year, despite the fact that
unseasonably warm temperatures meant lower heating bills. Purchases
for cars and big-ticket items for homes soared at a annual rate of
21 percent. Earlier this month, GM, Ford Motor Co. and other car
makers reported that December sales ran at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 17.3 million cars and trucks a month, up 7 percent
from a year earlier. New home construction rose at a 10 percent
annual rate. Consumers and home buyers have not spent this freely
since the early '80s, right after the deep recession of 1981-2.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign that they are flagging, either. Unemployment
and interest rates at the lowest level in decades, after-tax income
jumped 4 percent last year after inflation, and a rebounding stock
market is swelling household balance sheets once more.
</P>
<P>
   Such trends have consumers feeling good. The University of
Michigan reported on Friday that its consumer confidence index rose
to a lofty 103.9 at the end of January from 100.5 in December. Any
reading over 100 is great news for retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Less expected was the big bounce back in business spending for
new equipment, especially computers and other high-tech products.
Capital goods spending, which had leveled out last summer, soared
at a 21 percent annual rate as businesses, which are facing the
tightest labor market in a generation, scrambled to improve
efficiency and keep costs under control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, businesses accumulated inventories at a slower rate
than in the third quarter as they struggled to keep up with sales,
a favorable development that suggests they would not be cutting
production in the months ahead to liquidate excess stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The drag from America's $263 billion trade deficit proved less
potent than one might expect. A rebound in exports nearly offset a
surge in imports, making the trade deficit no higher than it had
been last summer. As a result, it subtracted just 0.2 percent from
growth in the quarter. Even though the November trade deficit hit a
new high in dollar terms, the average for the fourth quarter turns
out to have been no higher than in the third.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seems clear that the economy's surprising
stamina _ particularly the strength in consumer spending _ reflects
at least three developments that very few forecasters could have
predicted a year ago: a sharp decline in inflation from 2 percent
to 1 percent; another big runup, more than 25 percent, in the stock
market; and, finally, the Fed Reserve's willingness to reduce
interest rates last fall in response to global financial turmoil at
a time the domestic economy was showing few signs of slowing down.
All three factors bolstered income and spending power. ``We were
getting this injection of adrenalin,'' said Robert Gordon, an
economist at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   Investors agreed, sending stock and bond prices higher on
Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.5 points, to
9,358.83, while the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index hit a
new high of 1,279.64 after climbing 14.27 points.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, speaking at a meeting of the nation's
mayors, cited the strong economy, noting that it continues to defy
conventional economic wisdom and that even his own advisers had
once again proved too pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Shapiro proclaimed these ``the
best economic times in living memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in December the economic recovery that started in April
1991 became the longest in peacetime history. The only expansion to
last longer was the '60s boom, from 1961 to 1969, which coincided
with the Vietnam War buildup and which was accompanied by large
federal deficits and mounting inflationary pressures. Both of those
conditions are absent now.

POWERS GIVE KOSOVO COMBATANTS THREE WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As Serb police killed at least 24 more ethnic Albanians
in an attack in Kosovo, the Western powers and Russia met here
Friday to unveil an ultimatum that gives the combatants in the
troubled Serbian province three weeks to reach a political
settlement or face NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government responded by rejecting talks with the
ethnic Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army until the
KLA renounced violence, while the KLA said it would not sit down
until Serb forces withdrew from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that rebuff, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
chaired the meeting of the six-nation Contact Group comprised of
the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, is
expected to personally deliver the ultimatum to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cook will tell the Serbian strongman that his government must
consent to the talks that are expected to begin next Saturday in
France, and come up with an agreement within three weeks, or face
NATO airstrikes and the possible deployment of NATO ground forces.
It is unclear whether US troops would be part of the ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that after his visit to Belgrade, he would travel to
Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, to deliver the same
take-it-or-leave-it offer to ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of Kosovo's 2 million population.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, however, may not be in the mood to compromise after
Friday's Serb attack near the village of Rogovo in southwestern
Kosovo. More than 2,000 people, most of them ethnic Albanian
civilians, have been killed in the fighting in the past year, 45 of
them two weeks ago in what international observers say was a
massacre by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police said a Serbian officer also was killed when the
security forces stormed Rogovo. International observers said some
of the dead wore KLA uniforms and had weapons, but it was unclear
whether others were civilians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Yugoslav armed forces shelled the village of
Ljupce, a KLA stronghold north of Pristina. The shelling created a
new wave of refugees, a situation that the Contact Group's plan is
aimed at averting. The United Nations says that about 30,000 people
have been displaced by fighting in the last month, and some 300,000
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, police said a home-made explosive was thrown into
a Serb-owned cafe in downtown Pristina, wounding at least seven
Serbs. The KLA claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group, which was formed in 1994 to respond to the
various conflicts in the Balkans, is trying to prevent Kosovo from
escalating into something as deadly and devastating as the war in
Bosnia. The proposed Kosovo negotiations are modeled on the talks
that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   With strict deadlines and a general outline for a settlement,
the plan unveiled Friday calls on the combatants to immediately
stop fighting and agree to return Kosovo to the autonomous status
it had before Milosevic unilaterally ended it a decade ago. It
calls for a local assembly in Kosovo and an independent police
force that would be made up mostly of ethnic Albanians, but
stresses Kosovo would remain part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the last concession is supposed to appease the Serbian
government, which considers Kosovo the spiritual birthplace of
Serbs, the other measures are aimed at getting the KLA to stop its
war for independence. The KLA has been on the offensive, in what
some NATO officials regard as an attempt to goad the Serbs to
overreact and draw NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
   While no one here would say it publicly, the Americans want the
Europeans to take most of the responsibility for policing a
settlement, if one emerges. With President Clinton impeached, and
with many in Congress wary that Kosovo could become another
long-term US troop commitment as in Bosnia, the White House has
little leverage in calling for ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques
Chirac have committed ground forces to police a settlement.
Speaking here privately, British officials said they believed that
the credibility of the peacekeeping mission depended on the
Americans contributing ground forces, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here after the Contact Group meeting, US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the White House is considering
various options, including the use of ground forces. But Albright
stressed that American troops would be sent to Kosovo only in what
she called a ``permissive environment'' where both the ethnic
Albanians and the Serbian government accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature at this stage to speculate on what if any
international security presence might be necessary in connection
with the settlement, since we don't have one yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the US government was ``ready to act'' if Milosevic
spurned the offer presented by Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has sent a clear message to the
authorities in Belgrade: the time for denial and delay is past,''
Clinton said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the French government agreed to host the talks in the
chateau of Rambouillet. Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian political leader in Kosovo, said he was willing to take
part and called on the KLA to do the same. Speaking here in London,
however, KLA representative Pleurat Sediu was less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Serbian forces are shelling our villages, killing our
people, our children, we will not discuss anything,'' he said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31)  
 (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While serving as vehicle line director, supervising the
development of the 1999 Ford Windstar, Mary Ellen Heyde was struck
by the unusually large number of women with young children who were
working on the redesign. She thought it made sense to tap the
maternal expertise of these 30 ``Windstar Moms,'' most of them
engineers, and she consulted them routinely as the design
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of making the minivan more family-friendly, the
mothers offered suggestions for innovations and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Martha McMahon, a lead electrical systems
engineer, noted that her sleeping baby often awoke at night when a
door was opened, switching on bright overhead lights. So she
developed lighting that can be turned to ``sleeping baby mode,'' in
which the opening doors activate only footlights. These dimmer,
lower lights provide some illumination, but are less likely to
disturb sleeping infants.
</P>
<P>
   Another convenience feature is a storage bin for a diaper and
wipes in the front seat area for easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the mothers suggested cup holders that pull down from
the edge of the rear seats, where children can easily reach them
without stretching, as they must when cup holders are farther away
on the doors. That should cut down on spills.
</P>
<P>
   The door handles are designed for women's smaller hands, yet
provide ample room for jewelry and long fingernails. The manually
operated sliding doors glide smoothly in their tracks so that women
and children can open and close them better.
</P>
<P>
   The new Windstar will also be the first minivan to include a
reverse parking aid that warns drivers, with a beeping sound, if
they are close to hitting an object.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Zobel, a Windstar engineer, said that the emphasis on
comfort and convenience was bound to win over women, who account
for 75 percent of the Windstar's regular drivers. And the company,
recognizing the public appeal of mothers as designers, is featuring
some of the Windstar moms in corporate advertising that began this
month.

EAMON COLLINS: FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS, BUT NO HYPOCRITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWRY, Northern Ireland _ Eamon Collins was many things, but he
wasn't stupid. He knew that chances were when he came back to this
old border town he called home, his erstwhile comrades in the IRA
would eventually kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, then, he put himself, his wife, and their four
children at such risk when a life in exile would be much safer and
more comfortable, Collins sat in a pub here last year, stroking his
unkempt beard thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he finally said, folding his arms and turning to
face his questioner with his eyes closed, ``if I didn't come back
I'd be a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   For Collins, an idealist who joined the Irish Republican Army,
set people up to be murdered, then renounced the IRA and what he
had become, bearing witness to the human cost of the Troubles was
his penance. Like a missionary who casts himself into harm's way
seeking redemption, Collins put himself in the lion's den with
those who swore to kill him, almost daring them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally caught up with him, before dawn Wednesday
after he whitewashed graffiti on a wall that denounced him as a
traitor, they battered him so badly that the police had to use
fingerprints to identify him.
</P>
<P>
   In life, Collins was, like the peace process itself, a jumble of
contradictions. He abhorred violence, but was well practiced in it.
He hated informers, but became one. He praised some fellow IRA men
as principled and brave, but could not resist belittling most
others as ``pot-bellied psychopaths.'' He wrote a best-selling book
that held up a mirror to everyone, challenging them to look into it
and not see a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   And now his brutal death has shown just how much hypocrisy has
become the foundation on which the peace process is built.
</P>
<P>
   Those who defend the peace process for all the right reasons are
engaged in what many would call benevolent hypocrisy. As British
Prime Minister Tony Blair tacitly acknowledged in the House of
Commons, just hours after Collins's mutilated body was found, while
the political settlement in Northern Ireland stipulates that the
various paramilitary groups must refrain from violence, the
government is willing to overlook some infractions for the greater
good. Under this reasoning, machine-gunning people in pubs
constitutes a violation of the cease-fire; the torture and murder
of those like Collins who run afoul of the IRA and their loyalist
counterparts do not.
</P>
<P>
   But if the government is willing to engage in some artful
dodging, the howls of indignation coming from the green leather
benches of the Tory-led opposition reek of hypocrisy, too,
according to many in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched Conservative politicians rise to demand that the
release of IRA and loyalist prisoners be halted until paramilitary
groups end their practice of beating and shooting dissidents and
petty criminals, Reggie Moore felt his blood pressure rising.
Moore, a Protestant, lived in West Belfast, the epicenter of the
Troubles, for 24 years, driving a truck for a living in a virtual
war zone. The sight of Tory politicians who were indifferent for
years suddenly acting put out by vigilantism in Belfast was too
much for him to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those boys don't give a toss about people like us,'' said
Moore, who now lives in the quiet Belfast suburb of Helen's Bay.
``Of course there shouldn't be punishment beatings and punishment
shootings. But they've been going on for 30 years, and it won't
just stop overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The request from paramilitary groups and their political
representatives that the Irish and British people forgive and
forget the suffering they inflicted for three decades also strikes
some as breathtakingly hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA never forgave or forgot Eamon,'' said Jason McCue, a
lawyer and friend of Collins. ``They harassed him, vandalized his
home, burnt his family's house down, firebombed his car, knocked
him down in the road. Now they've finally killed him, and they have
the audacity to tell us all it's time to move on, to forget what's
happened in the past?''
</P>
<P>
   The police don't know who killed Collins, although they presume
it was some of his former friends in the IRA. The absence of proof,
however, has not stopped various sides from seizing Collins' murder
as a reason why the peace process needs to be accelerated, slowed
down or abandoned altogether. That people can have such divergent
reactions shows that while there is a political agreement in place,
there is little agreement on how to create the politics that could
propel Northern Ireland out of an era of fear and loathing.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the new Northern Ireland assembly, said
Collins' death showed how imperative it is that the paramilitary
groups, especially the IRA, turn in guns and explosives before the
peace process can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   But no guns were used to kill Collins _ just iron bars and
knives. They ran him over with a car for good measure, leaving him
to die on the country lane where he walked every day with his two
cocker spaniels. The method of killing, say police, was a cruelly
cynical attempt _ not technically violating the cease-fire because
they weren't using guns _ to eradicate a long-time irritant without
technically breaking the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians bickered and sanctimoniously proclaimed
themselves more noble than the next, Bernie Collins was left to
bury her husband and comfort their four children. She always bore
some guilt for her husband's plight, because it was a threat to her
safety that led him to recant the confession he had given police in
1985. Collins broke under interrogation, admitting he set up five
people to be murdered. He also named 50 other IRA comrades, leading
to their arrests. Later, a judge threw out his confession and
Collins walked free.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the IRA had promised him he could stay in Newry
with his family, but they reneged and he was given seven days to
leave town or be executed. Collins left, ever defiant, on the
eighth day.
</P>
<P>
   After working with the poor in Dublin for a few years, he
returned to Newry and lived fairly anonymously until a 1995
documentary in which he recounted his life in the IRA. His book,
``Killing Rage,'' which was unsparing in its criticism of the IRA,
followed in 1997. He became a pundit, much sought after by
newspapers and television. His verbal attacks grew more scathing
and personal on irridentist republicans who refused to accept the
desire for compromise democratically expressed by the people, north
and south.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find anyone in the Barcroft housing projects where
Collins lived to say they liked him. Bernie Collins says people are
too afraid to publicly say her husband was a decent, if flawed,
human being. Such reticence is not surprising, given that the local
Sinn Fein councilor, Brendan Curran, appeared on television,
practically gloating over his death.
</P>
<P>
   Had he kept his mouth shut, Eamon Collins would have been
departed this world a hero, elevated to the pantheon of great Irish
rebels. As it was, his funeral Friday was a subdued, relatively
small gathering in a town that had mostly shunned him.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't something, however, that would have bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who my friends are,'' he said last year, nodding as if
to reassure himself. ``I used to have more. But I like the ones I
have now.''

 &HT;    `America's Most Wanted' to delve deeper into case of Georgia
police officer's death
 &HT;    By Mike Morris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The television show ``America's Most Wanted,'' which
last Saturday aired a brief segment on the man charged with killing
Villa Rica, Ga., police Capt. Robbie Bishop, will feature a longer
story on the fugitive this week.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are still looking for Jeffrey McGee and are hoping
that the expanded coverage, to be broadcast today, will generate
more tips on McGee's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The tip line operated by ``America's Most Wanted'' received
about 60 calls after last week's show, according to Mike Molnar, a
spokesman for the show.
</P>
<P>
   McGee, 32, of Schenectady, N.Y., is accused of shooting Bishop
on Jan. 20 after the officer stopped him on Interstate 20 in west
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   McGee is thought to have boarded a flight to Los Angeles from
Birmingham, Ala., the day of the slaying. The plane made a stopover
in Houston. Authorities would not say where they were concentrating
their search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know for an absolute certainty that he got on the airplane
in Birmingham,'' said GBI agent Joe Jackson. ''We are certain he
has gone beyond the boundaries of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is heading the search in Los Angeles. Agent Ramiro
Escudero said authorities believe McGee is still in the United
States. Jackson said that many of the pictures of McGee in
circulation are outdated and that McGee recently shaved his head.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information is asked to call the Carroll County
sheriff's office, 770-830-5888.

HOUSTON ANCHORMAN TELLS VIEWERS HE HAS CANCER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Austin and San Antonio, Texas) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Longtime Houston newsman Sylvan Rodriguez said Friday
that he has incurable cancer and temporarily will leave his anchor
duties at KHOU-TV, a CBS affiliate, to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a dedicated journalist who last fall narrated his own
knee-replacement surgery, Rodriguez chose to inform Houston viewers
of his condition at the close of Friday's 6 p.m. newscast, rather
than keep his illness to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now about to tackle a new assignment,'' he said. ``It will
be the toughest battle of my life: a battle with cancer. ... I have
a rare form of cancer called neuro-endocrine islet cell carcinoma.
It is a mouthful. It is a cancer of the pancreas, which has now
mestatasized to the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was born in San Antonio but has called Houston home
for 23 years. He is a graduate of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Off the air, Rodriguez traced his illness to two years ago,
describing a period of episodic vomiting that would keep him from
eating some days, then would go away. His weight dropped from 185
to 159 as the vomiting episodes became more frequent. After
consultations with several doctors here, he and his wife spent a
week at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was diagnosed with
cancer Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a shock,'' he said. ``Thank the Lord I had my
wife next to me, because as my mind reeled off in so many different
directions, she could then talk medical terms. She's been a real
trooper.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been married to Dr. Shelley Sekula, a dermatologist, for
3 1/2 years. He has five children _ ages 14 to 20 _ from his
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 50, said his condition ``is serious. I wish I could
tell you we had this bad boy under control right now, but it's
going to take a lot of prayers and God's grace. It is incurable,
but it is treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of his condition filtered out Friday, colleagues and
friends from around the city flooded KHOU, Channel 11, with phone
calls, showing their concern and love. His roots in Houston include
professional stints at ABC-affiliate KTRK-TV (1975-1986) and KHOU
(1987-present), as well as involvement in numerous community
organizations and charities, especially those involving Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the station is in shock about the news,'' said
Channel 11 general manager Peter Diaz. ``But we're very supportive
and confident that he will be returning in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told viewers Friday that he hopes to be back on the
air ``in a couple of months'' and said off the air that he'd like
to file reports on his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I respond to these treatments all right, we'll send a
photographer out there (to the Medical Center),'' he said. ``The
reason I'm going to do it is because cancer is something that
affects everybody. I would like to show people that we can say the
word `cancer,' then after getting over saying the word, we can go
on with the next stage of battling this bad boy. That's my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He will begin treatments Monday at University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

BACK FROM THE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ There are still pockets of inner-city despair
here that have that bombed-out look, with the
plywood-instead-of-glass window treatment of the crack house.
</P>
<P>
   But for every rotten tooth that stares out of the jaw of this
city-on-the-mend, there is another spanking new molar, or a salvage
effort that is turning decrepit housing back into good homes for
solid citizens. This is a town that is small enough, rich enough,
and sufficiently galvanized to come back from the despair and the
middle-class flight that have blighted dozens of urban enclaves
from the swath running from south of Washington to north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders heap generous praise on the one-time mayor of
Pittsfield, Mass., Evan Dobelle, who arrived here four years ago as
president of Trinity College, an 1,850-undergraduate private school
whose elegant, traditional campus was locked in an inner city that
was going down fast. Since we can't move the campus, reasoned
Dobelle, we better do something about the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   First move: persuade the trustees to write checks for $600,000
to buy a half-dozen run-down buildings nearby that served as
unofficial headquarters for the kinds of vice that breed crime.
Next step? A master plan. What is now happening around the Trinity
campus is a textbook example of bootstrapping initiative. Trinity
has put up $6 million, and the city, the state, a couple of
hospitals and some of the big corporations that call Hartford home
have combined to amass a $210 million pot of dough, which is fixing
up a 15-acre downtown site into a complex that should revitalize
the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the executives Dobelle brought in are Jim King, the
longtime Bay State political activist who has been a vice president
at Harvard and Northeastern, as well as head of the National
Transportation Safety Board and the federal government's Office of
Personnel Management; and Jim Mullen, a vice president who
previously worked at Middlesex Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city was at rock bottom,'' says Mayor Mike Peters, an
affable former firefighter first elected in 1994. Morale was shot.
The white middle-class executives who were downsized in the
early-90's recession left. Population dropped from 170,000 to
little more than 100,000. Poor blacks and Hispanics populated the
public schools; the 30 percent of city residents who were white
were largely elderly homeowners whose kids were long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be the first major northeastern city to a majority
Hispanic population,'' says Eddie Perez, a Trinity administrator
who previously worked for the diocese. ``The city will be 51
percent Latino in about 2007.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as Trinity's attempt to stabilize its neighborhood
grew and grew, as civic and corporate leaders coalesced. Gov. John
Rowland, a Republican, and the Democrats of the Legislature, began
pulling in tandem. Hartford, an 18-square mile urban landscape with
98 percent of the school students from minority groups, has a
smaller scale and more cohesiveness in civic leadership that does
bigger, brawling Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neighborhoods bordering Trinity is called ``Behind
the Rocks.'' But ``Behind the eight-ball'' is where the renewalists
began. The town is being brought back the old-fashioned way: block
by block, house by house. If the college can't buy a run-down
building and rehab it, the city can conddemn the property, clear
the title, and turn it back into usable housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   The community kids need some recreation? Trinity buys a shabby
strip mall; that'll be a new skating rink. The rural Puerto Ricans
who came initially to pick tobacco in Enfield now live downtown and
need jobs? Trinity sets up a job training center with computer
hookups to state job data, and counselors to steer the job-ready to
entry level jobs on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   A neighborhood lunch counter had been in business for 28 years,
but the owner couldn't get a mortgage. The college co-signed a note
at 6 percent interest, installed a walkway, a set of stairs and
some lights, and now students can meander over to Timothy's for a
snack that will support a small business that stabilizes the
neighborhood. Another side of the campus is worried about street
crime? Trinity builds a police substation and supports neighborhood
crime watch efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the campus is a $100 million public
school school complex that Gilbane Const. Corp. is putting up to
hold a Montessori elementary school, a middle school, and a magnet
high school. Hundreds of college students will be mentors, reading
teachers, athletic coaches, and otherwise useful to a couple of
thousand inner-city kids whose education will be a lot richer for
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen different banks participate in a homeowner-training
effort that has a waiting list of 300 trained buyers who lined up
for a chance at one of 50 houses created by rehab or new
construction. There are 8,000 medical workers at the adjacent
complexes of Hartford Hospital and Connecticut Children's Medical
Center. Just up the street is the Institute for Living, and not far
away is the first Boys and Girls Club built on the campus of a
private college. Nearby is a new AIDS hospice.
</P>
<P>
   All of this development is percolating in a small and
concentrated area. The effect on real estate values, as well as
morale, is immediate and apparent. The city is coming back, at warp
speed, it seems. ``We've seen the bottom,'' said Arthur Anderson,

BANISHING THE BLARNEY AT MEDIA LABS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 31, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No unit of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suffers a
more dubious reputation within the scientific community than its
all-too-famous Media Lab, the victim of its persistent tendency to
overstate its claims. There was its birth in a burst of big-name
corporate funding. A breathless book by Stewart Brand. Its
association with the supernova that is Wired magazine. The style of
its founder, the larger-than-life magazine columnist and
fund-raiser Nicholas Negroponte. Its determination to refer to its
remarkably ill-designed home as ``the Wiesner Building'' (after the
sainted MIT president who created the lab) instead of calling the
building by its designated number, E-15, like everyone else at
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, an embarrassingly small stream of products has
issued from an organization that had promised to ``invent the
future.'' The firesale last year of Patty Maes' Firefly Network
Inc. to Microsoft was only the lastest in a string of
disappointments. Media Lab's most familiar product so far has been
a blue streak of high-tech blarney.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, however, things have begun to change,
according to people outside the lab. Negroponte, though still very
involved, has ceded on-site leadership to others. The young people
who have been hired, promoted, and tenured within the lab have been
selected along different lines: stronger backgrounds in traditional
disciplines are the rule. Instead of being governed exclusively by
the principle ``Demo(onstrate) or Die,'' a new role has been found
for an older imperative designed to weed out those who simply talk
a good game: ``Publish or Perish.'' The quality of students has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   The single most persuasive piece of evidence of this subtle
transformation of the Media Lab is the appearance of a new book by
one of its faculty, Neil Gershenfeld. Not his trade book, ``When
Things Start To Think,'' which is slowly climbing onto the
best-seller lists. That in itself will make him heir-apparent to
Negroponte as celebrity-in-chief. Instead, I mean a 344-page tract
on the nature of mathematical modeling.
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld, 39, is Exhibit A among the lab's next generation. A
Cornell physicist, veteran of Bell Labs, a former junior fellow of
the Society of Fellows at Harvard, Gershenfeld moved to MIT five
years ago and loved it. He now rhapsodizes about the lab's
extra-disciplinary approach as happily as Negroponte ever has.
Indeed, the back of the jacket of ``When Things Start to Think''
illustrates to near perfection what it is about Media Lab-speak
that chafes.
</P>
<P>
   Negroponte writes, ``Gershenfeld gets it. He was the first
person to introduce me to the relative merits of bits and atoms.
This book elaborates his vision in the narrative tone of a native
of, not a visitor to, the future. It is an important story about
why and how computers will disappear, when and where your things
will think.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn Jillette, half the high-brow magic act of Penn &AMP; Teller,
writes, ``Hey, I know Neil personally. I've gotten to hang at the
Media Lab. I was part of a stupid showbiz gag that turned into a
way to make air bags safer for kids (don't blame me, I was just
going for laughs). He's a smart guy who thinks, and that's so much
rarer than I used to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can find the time to put a silly little show together,
have it play in Boston, meet some of the MIT cats, invite them to
your show, get in good with them, meet Neil, do a project with him,
bring him to Vegas, and sit up all night at a coffee shop talking
about the future _ do it! If you have better things to do, read
this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the funny thing is, if you do read ``When Things Start To
Think,'' you'll be startled by how much deeper in spirit it is than
its blurbs. The story of the magic trick into car seats turns out
to be a lucid meditation on the nonlinear process by which basic
science is applied to practical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have taken funding for automobile seat safety
development _ it's too remote from what I do, and too narrow,''
writes Gershenfeld. ``NEC Corp. would never have supported magic
tricks internally _ it's too remote from what they do, and too
crazy.'' Yet the result of the collaboration in the free-play zone
of the lab will arrive on the market this spring: a sensor that
automatically switches off the air bag for rear-facing infant
seats. In the future: air bags automatically adjusted for
passengers' weight and positions in all seats.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a chapter called ``The Nature of Computation''
provides an introduction to the mechanics of quantum computing _ an
enormous increase in power that apparently is suddenly a realistic
possibility. It is much easier to read than Gershenfeld's paper on
the topic in Science magazine, or even the Scientific American
popularization of it, for that matter. The chapter on ``The
Personal Fabricator'' describes an act of the imagination by which
the tool currently at the center of Gershenfeld's course called
``How To Make Any Thing'' _ a three-dimensional printer consisting
mainly of a computer-controlled glue-gun _ eventually might be
turned into a machine that would make all others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information and Education'' explains that the Media Lab is
really a front for a more interesting project: Jerry Wiesner's
long-cherished dream of an institution designed to diminish the
power of university departments to dictate the shape of education.
The pressure for specialization within disciplines often led to a
lack of awareness of common problems and alternative approaches to
them, Wiesner believed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, for example, the two undergraduate courses that
Gershenfeld devised to make certain that students in the otherwise
unstructured Media Lab program had the tools to understand both the
physical world outside of computers and the logical world within.
``The Nature of Mathematical Modeling'' is one result; a second
soon-to-be-published book, ``The Physics of Information
Technology,'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``My students loved them,'' he writes of the lectures. ``Some of
my peers hated them.'' The reason: each week he would cover in a
relatively few strokes material that a specialist ordinarily might
take a semester to teach. Reducing whole disciplines to 10 pages or
so apiece of essential ideas make for a remarkable guidebook.
Virtually every present-day technique for modeling systems is
displayed, like so many tools hung on a pegboard.
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld writes, ``How would you describe the flickering of a
flame? The texture of an oil painting? Highway traffic during rush
hour? Twinkling stars? Breaking glass? A bowling ball hitting pins?
Melting ice? The flight of a paper airplane? The sound of a
violin?'' Different processes require different tools, he says, and
there are many posssible levels of description.
</P>
<P>
   So old college warhorses such as differential equations and the
calculus of variations are presented side-by-side with more recent
techniques of describing dynamic systems such as neural networks
and simulated annealing.Cellular automata and genetic algorithms
are explained, along with time series and state estimation _ all
pitched to the level of an as-yet-inexperienced practitioner. There
are appendices devoted to math packages and graphics tools, to
network programming and benchmarking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   None of these tools is required for newspaper discourse _ nor do
I possess any skill in their use whatsoever. But anyone who wants a
sense of how the language of mathematics has changed in the last 50
years will marvel at Gershenfeld's concise map; most persons will
be reassured by its existence; and some may even work their way
through various applications. It remains to be seen where the
various paths lead from the Media Lab, but pedagogic innovations
such as this one are likely to be judged a considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``When Things Start To Think,'' Gershenfeld
acknowledges that operating the Media Lab in the environment of MIT
is a little like driving a bumper car in an amusement park. There
is steady jostling, he says, but it would be impossible to function
without the institutional setting.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited competition is underway within MIT between the more
traditional Laboratory for Computer Science and various affiliates
and the Media Lab. Both are planning new buildings; as architects
they have engaged rivals who are contending to be known as the best
of their day, Frank Gehry and Fumihiko Maki. The buildings will
stand only a couple of blocks apart. And so it goes. Only good can
come of it.

<P>
   It had all the makings of a fairy tale. A small company in an
obscure corner of Finland discovered a natural substance that could
lower cholesterol levels. The company devised and patented ways to
extract it from wood pulp, make it flavorless and dissolve it in
food. A new margarine made with the magic ingredient was an
instant, runaway hit.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Cinderella company bumped up against a slow-moving
American partner and a stubborn Food and Drug Administration, a
combination that may have cost it a chance to profit happily ever
after beyond its home market.
</P>
<P>
   The sky seemed to be the limit for Raisio Group in 1995, when
its Benecol margarine was introduced in Finland. The
cholesterol-fighting properties of the magic ingredient, stanol
ester, promised to transform the quiet maker of margarines, french
fries and flour into a food-processing powerhouse. Plans were made
for worldwide marketing of Benecol and stanol ester, which could
also be used in ice cream, hamburgers, cookies, pasta and a host of
other foods.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to crack foreign markets with its own limited
resources, Raisio signed a deal last year with the McNeil Consumer
Products division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson to market Benecol outside
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to enlist McNeil's worldwide marketing muscle,
freeing Raisio to concentrate on a crash program to build new
plants in Finland, France and South Carolina to keep up with
sharply climbing demand. Enthusiastic investors bid Raisio's stock
up from $1.21 in early 1996 to $20.63 last May, adjusted for a
10-for-1 split last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with McNeil has cost Raisio precious time. McNeil
has done little with the marketing rights it owns in Europe, where
Raisio could have moved ahead without a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the United States, McNeil pondered whether to
market Benecol as a conventional food or as a dietary supplement.
As a food, it could go on sale quickly, but with no health claims
allowed. As a supplement, Benecol could trumpet its main selling
point, the cholesterol effect, in ads, but only after a longer and
more rigorous review by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil eventually chose the latter, but it failed to win
approval and wound up settling last week for what it could have had
last year: approval as a food. Disappointed investors hammered
Raisio's stock, which closed at $7.98 in Helsinki, Finland, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us say we've had a rough time,'' deadpanned Stan Von
Helles, Raisio's information director, last week in a telephone
interview from his home in Turku, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The delays may undo Benecol's advantage. Unilever has announced
its own cholesterol-fighting margarine, Take Charge, using a
different active ingredient. And Kellogg plans a whole product line
using psyllium, a component of oats that also lowers cholesterol,
in cookies, breads, pasta, cereal and snacks, according to industry
analysts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brian Cornelisse, a London-based analyst at Merrill Lynch, said
Raisio, whose future is wrapped up in Benecol, is paying the price
for tactical mistakes made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for which Benecol
is just another product. ``They have wasted all this time,''
Cornelisse said in a phone interview. ``Now, when Benecol comes out
in three months or so, Unilever will be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil is confident that it can meet the challenge because
Benecol is a proven, superior product, according to Ron Schmid,
McNeil's vice president for communications. ``It has been on the
market since 1995, and more than a million people have consumed
it,'' he said. ``Unilever started talking about their margarine
last year. We've got the experience in Finland; they do not. We can
bake and fry with it; they cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow Johnson &AMP; Johnson, like Vivien Wohl of
Merrill Lynch, say J&AMP;J's huge marketing machine _ 3,300 sales
representatives in the United States and 5,300 overseas _ can use
its contacts with doctors to spread the word that two or three
months of Benecol on toast every morning can lower cholesterol by
15 percent, even if the benefit cannot be advertised directly to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Benecol story is unlikely to reach quite the
spectacularly happy ending that Raisio had in mind three years ago.

   A Wealth of Charity That Eludes Most Counts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has a reputation as one of America's stingier
metropolises. But a survey financed by the California Community
Foundation suggests that the area's residents are more charitable
than Americans over all.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys show that about 68 percent of people give. In
Los Angeles County, however, the figure was 73 percent, according
to a survey of 611 residents conducted for the foundation by Field
Research at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   And these figures do not include a form of giving that is
flourishing in Southern California _ particularly among Latinos. In
the Los Angeles survey, 55 percent of Latinos reported that they
had sent money, clothing or food to friends or relatives in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   This type of giving is not picked up in most surveys because
they ask about gifts to organized charities eligible for tax
deductions, said Michael Latner of Field Research in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To get a broader picture of charitable activity in cities with
large immigrant populations, said Jack Shakely, the foundation's
president, ``we may need to rethink our traditional definition of
philanthropy.''

   Bowing to complaints that it was luring customers into taking
out unintended loans, Summit Bank, the largest New Jersey-based
began last week to provide clearer receipts for its customers'
transactions at automated teller machines. The designation
``available balance'' now applies only to money on deposit in a
checking account, with the amount available on an overdraft credit
line listed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, with these amounts combined in a single figure, some
customers wrote checks or made withdrawals for more than their
deposited balances and unwittingly touched off costly overdraft
loans.

SWEDEN SHOWS WIDE ACCEPTANCE OF FORD-VOLVO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOTEBORG, Sweden _ Having heard and read rumors for months that
Volvo AB was in merger talks with one big car company or another,
Bengt Persson was almost relieved to finally know that his employer
would soon be Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it wasn't Fiat,'' said Persson, who has worked in the
automobile assembly plant here for more than two decades. ``If the
company had to be sold to someone, this was probably the best
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Car companies are often objects of national pride, and few have
been more attached to a country's self-image than has Volvo in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Friday, as Swedes digested the news that Ford had reached
an agreement to buy Volvo's car business for $6.45 billion, there
were few signs of shock or remorse. Instead, reactions among people
both inside and outside the company ranged from pragmatic
acceptance to outright optimism.
</P>
<P>
   That marks a huge change from six years ago, when Volvo's plans
to merge with Renault SA of France led to widespread protests. The
deal eventually collapsed in a boardroom coup that also toppled the
company's then-chief executive, Pehr Gyllenhammar.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Swedish political leaders were immediately supportive
of Ford's plan to buy the Volvo car business. Prime Minister Goran
Persson called it ``a good solution for Volvo,'' and Finance
Minister Eric Asbrink boasted that it spoke well for Sweden's
attractiveness for international business.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish Shareholders' Organization, which led a bitter and
successful campaign to kill the deal with Renault, called the Ford
agreement ``very interesting'' and said it looked forward to seeing
the details of Ford's purchase proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The comparatively calm response reflects broader changes within
Swedish industry as well as the global automobile industry and
Europe's political environment.
</P>
<P>
   If this had happened five or six years ago, you would have had
quite a noise, said Hans-Olov Olsson, president of Volvo's North
American unit, in an interview at company headquarters Friday.
``Back then, each citizen of Sweden felt that they owned Volvo,
that even though I might not be a shareholder it still belongs to
Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Volvo and Europe have gone through major changes
since the Renault deal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning its efforts to build a highly diversified
conglomerate, the company has refocused on its roots and sold off
major holdings in areas like pharmaceuticals and beverages. At the
same time, it has put its car and truck businesses through a broad
restructuring, streamlining production and cutting costs. Volvo
today is far more profitable and tougher. In December, it announced
plans to reduce its work force by more than 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the automobile industry has become increasingly
dominated by a few big players _ and every company was electrified
by the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.

   With the worldwide car market swamped in excess capacity, the
only way car companies have been able to generate strong growth is
by bringing out attractive new models at an ever-faster pace. But
the development costs of doing that have been high, bearable only
if companies could spread them over very large numbers of cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Goteborg, Volvo's headquarters and home to 20,000 of its
employees, most people had come to expect some kind of change in
ownership. Though Volvo is one of Europe's more profitable
carmakers, it accounts for only about 1 percent of the world market
and has a limited range of models.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People here had also taken note of other takeovers around
Europe. General Motors has for years held a controlling stake in
Sweden's other main car company, Saab. Ford acquired Britain's
legendary but deeply troubled Jaguar and invested billions of
dollars in turning it around. Last year, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was
divided up between the German companies Volkswagen and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   What people here wanted to avoid was a repeat of the disastrous
near-merger with Renault. Long before the merger was supposed to
have been consummated, Volvo executives took offense at what seemed
to be high-handed behavior by incoming French managers from
Renault.
</P>
<P>
   As resistance grew, shareholders became hostile as well. The
shareholders' organization, which represents small investors, was
furious that Volvo would be paid in shares of Renault, which is
controlled the French government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volvo would have gotten shares in a state-owned company that
could never really be sold,'' said Gunnar Ek, who is in charge of
monitoring corporate activities for the shareholders' group.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Ford proposal looks far better. Ford will
pay in cash, and it is far bigger and much healthier than Renault.
And many Swedes say they are more comfortable with Americans than
with the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, Swedes are more Americanized mentally than the
French,'' said Christer Mardbrant, news editor for Dagens Industri,
a daily business newspaper in Stockholm. ``Most Swedes feel
comfortable speaking English, but most are not at all comfortable
in French.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedes have also been comforted by Ford's willingness to let
Jaguar operate independently.
</P>
<P>
   Most political leaders reacted favorably to the proposed deal,
though they wanted to look at the details.
</P>
<P>
   Even Swedish union leaders were cautiously supportive. Bertil
Johnson, head of Sweden's umbrella organization for unions, said
unions would wait for more information. Back at the plant, few
workers betrayed signs of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is worried about losing their jobs,'' said Lenny
Stoltz, a 23-year-old worker on the assembly line that makes the
Volvo S-80. ``Ford is a huge car manufacturer, and we know they
want to make more luxury cars. They also know that Volvo will
always be a Swedish company.''

<P>
   Diego Espinosa, the co-manager of the Scudder Global Fund, is
not interested at the moment in Brazil or most of the rest of the
world's major emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   His $1.59 billion fund, which he runs with William Holzer, has
cut back its exposure to emerging markets to 1 percent from 5
percent in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the global financial environment is as it is now,
he said, ``it is going to be hard for us to make the case to invest
in emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment is bad because it is harder and more expensive
for emerging market countries and companies to borrow, there is
downward pressure on the prices paid for goods from emerging
markets and the overall world economy _ especially the markets of
Europe and the United States _ appear to be headed for a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hands-off view, Espinosa has begun to consider an
exception _ Argentina. Since Brazil devalued its currency on Jan.
13, raising new questions about the world's emerging markets,
Argentina has done several things to get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   One, its government has renewed, in a convincing way, its
determination to keep its currency, the peso, pegged directly to
the dollar. The government is even considering junking the peso in
favor of the dollar itself. ``That shows a lot of commitment from
the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the performance of the country's foreign debt. While
it was sold in the wake of the Brazilian devaluation, it has
performed better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, the difference in yields between United
States Treasury bonds and 30-year global bonds from Mexico and
Argentina were 5.41 percentage points and 5.61 percentage points,
respectively, while Brazil's was far higher at 9.86 percentage
points. Argentina was being treated like less risky Mexico, though
many investors had always linked its outlook to Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
   The spread on the same bonds jumped to 7.20 percentage points
for Argentina compared with 5.75 percentage points for Mexico after
the devaluation. But it did not take off like Brazil, which rose to
12.47 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And since then, the Argentina spread has narrowed to 6.61
percentage points, while Brazil has fallen only to 11.47 percentage
points, according to Bloomberg News data.
</P>
<P>
   All this may signal that investors are beginning to distinguish
between Brazil and Argentina, though their economic fates are still
tightly tied because of their trade dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Two other factors also figure in Espinosa's thinking. One is
that Argentina borrowed heavily in global bond markets last year
and, therefore, has much of the money it needs to meet its foreign
debt payments this year. And the Argentinian stocks he likes are
not very sensitive to overall economic growth and are at very
attractive valuations right now.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not allowed to name his favorites, but stocks
that appear to meet his definition are YPF, the oil and gas
company, and the Argentine telephone companies, Telefonica de
Argentina and Telecom Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time to think about delinking'' Argentina, he
said. But he is still only thinking. Asemerging markets continue to
be very volatile, he has not bought anythintg yet.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been few reverberations in the world's
developed markets since Brazil's renewed crisis, there were shocks
throughout emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International
index, these markets are down 3 percent since Jan. 12. The index
for Asia is off 5.7 percent, while Latin America is down 0.9
percent, in dollar terms, after a nice rebound last week.
</P>
<P>
   And turning around Brazil will not be easy. Raising interest
rates could help stop the decline of the currency, already down 41
percent in value. But higher interest rates could also push the
economy deeper into recession. But a weakening currency could
reignite inflation. And the spending cuts needed to cut the
government deficit will mean laying off state workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging markets need periods of global stability to grow,''
Espinosa said, because their fragile political systems cannot
adjust to the current environment.

   As Maurice R. (Hank) Greenberg, chief executive of American
International Group, was being feted as the insurance leader of the
year on Thursday night, one speaker quipped that he might just as
well be honored as ``the insurance father of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Greenberg family is beginning to look like an
insurance dynasty. At Greenberg's right at the head table at the
College of Insurance dinner was his son Evan Greenberg, 44, who
serves as president and chief operating officer of the company his
father has built into a global giant. To his left was Jeffrey W.
Greenberg, 47, who left his father's company three years ago and
has just been named president and chief-executive-to-be of Marsh &AMP;
McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker.
</P>
<P>
   When it was his turn at the microphone, the elder Greenberg
poked fun at the concentration of influence in one insurance clan.
``We're going to have to have an antitrust lawyer when we get
together,'' the 73-year-old patriarch cracked, adding, ``I'm trying
to get my third son to join Aon,'' the No. 2 insurance brokerage in
the world.

   Alice Hector, a Miami lawyer who lost primary custody of her
children to her ex-husband because of her long hours, has quit her
job as a partner at a high-powered law firm. Ms. Hector said she
decided to open her own firm with three other lawyers from Miami's
Steel, Hector &AMP; Davis because she wanted to be able to leave work
early a couple afternoons a week to be with her two young girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me more flexibility,'' Ms. Hector said of her new
firm, Hector &AMP; Harke. ``I think it will be exactly what I need.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, a Florida appeals court awarded primary custody of the
two girls to their father, Robert Young. The appeals court said
that Young, who had been unemployed for several years, had become
the main provider of care for the children because of Ms. Hector's
late hours. Ms. Hector has appealed that decision. &QL;

   Jeff Reifman thinks one reason Microsoft hired him when he was
20 was the ``Calvin and Hobbes'' cartoon on his resume. Eight years
later, he's still operating in a humane, slightly offbeat way,
splitting his time between the software giant, where he is a
manager, and Giving.org, a nonprofit group he created to funnel
profits back to the Seattle community. Its cornerstone is Habitat
Espresso, a cafe that opened in the city in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Customers vote on which local charities will receive half the
profits from the cafe; the other half goes to a fund to start other
nonprofit businesses. In July, the group bought the Four Angels
Cafe, another Seattle spot that now donates its profits, and in
October it started Myfirstweb.com to offer affordable Internet
services. Giving.org now has about 15 employees and has contributed
more than $40,000 to Seattle charities.
</P>
<P>
   Reifman spent his early years in the exclusive Brentwood section
of Los Angeles. Growing up surrounded by so much wealth, he says,
``helped me see that was not the way I wanted to live my life.''

   The people who run hedge funds _ those highflying but arcane
investment vehicles that touched off a financial panic last year _
want you to know they care. In fact, they are holding a charity
banquet on Feb. 9 at the Pierre Hotel at Fifth Avenue and 61st
Street in Manhattan, and it is called Hedge Funds Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the hedge fund industry are feeling as though they
have been prosperous and lucky in life, and are trying to do
something good,'' said Rob Davis, managing director at Montgomery
Prime Brokerage Services, a division of Nationsbanc Montgomery
Services, who is organizing the benefit to aid victims of child
abuse. He hopes to raise at least $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge fund managers and the brokers, lawyers and accountants who
serve them will pony up $12,000 a table to take part in the event,
which will feature an auction of sports memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Luminaries who plan to attend include Charles Schaffran, who
oversees the hedge funds at Alliance Capital, and Joel Press, a
senior partner at Ernst &AMP; Young. So far, though, Davis says, he
hasn't gotten around to calling the folks at Long-Term Capital
Management, the Greenwich, Conn., fund that was taken over by a
group of 14 banks and securities firms last year after its $4.8
billion of capital was nearly wiped out. &QL;

 &HT;    Shaw remembered in words, song
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first words after the invocation were spoken by a
husky male voice reading ``Winnie-the-Pooh'' to a child.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pooh,' said Piglet nervously, `how would it be if we went
home now and practiced your song and sang it to Eeyore tomorrow?'''
And then the reader went on to sing ``The more it snows,'' complete
with ``tiddly-poms'' and a light but definite rhythm, skipping
along with the two stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the voice of Robert Shaw, recorded in 1948. And it was a
lovely beginning to the memorial concert given Friday afternoon by
the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, honoring the conductor
four days after his death Monday at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was filled with music, sung by three local choirs
and a pair of international soloists and played by the orchestra he
led for 21 years. For all the musical grandeur, however, it was
just as moving to hear the gentle singsong of Shaw's own voice in
the hall where it resounded for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The very first to arrive Friday morning at Symphony Hall were
three vocal performance majors from Covenant College in Lookout
Mountain, Tenn. ``We consider him one of the greats of the 20th
century,'' said James Richardson, 21, who arrived at the hall at
7:45 a.m. with classmates Shannon Kiser, 21, and Matthew Kickasola,
23.
</P>
<P>
   They had gotten up at 4:30 a.m. to make the trip from
Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the queue stretched around the hall to the MARTA Arts
Center station, with people lining up four abreast at the Woodruff
Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left my job for this,'' said Earle Clowney, chairman of the
Department of Foreign Languages at Clark Atlanta University, who
had a pile of French papers to occupy him from 11:40 a.m., when he
got in line, until he was rewarded with a seat in the third row.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity audience of about 1,800 people seemed to be divided
between people such as Clowney, listeners who took time out of the
day to remember the late conductor, and music professionals who
came to pay their respects to a revered colleague.
</P>
<P>
   The event was also a reunion of Shaw's extended family: the
singers and choral directors he trained over his 50-year
international career.
</P>
<P>
   It ranged from Greg Smith of Duluth, Ga., conductor of the choir
at Parkway Baptist Church, who sang in the ASO Chorus in the fall
of 1997, to Paul Salamunovich, music director of the Los Angeles
Master Chorale.
</P>
<P>
   The audience also included some 50 orchestra administrators and
orchestra board members who are in Atlanta for an American Symphony
Orchestra League conference, led by ASOL President Neil Williams.
Carnegie Hall, National Public Radio, Telarc Records (which
produces and distributes the ASO's recordings) and the Westminster
Choir College sent representatives, as did the New York
Philharmonic and the orchestras of Cleveland, Baltimore, Dallas and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Five rows of seats, marked off by enormous rosettes of navy
satin ribbon, were filled with the family and friends of the late
conductor. Two of his children spoke: stepson Alex Hitz of Atlanta,
who read from one of Shaw's best-known speeches, in which he called
the arts ``the only workable program of conservation for the human
race,'' and Shaw's youngest son, Thomas, who read William Butler
Yeats' poem ``Sailing to Byzantium.'' Shaw was visiting Thomas, a
senior at Yale University, when he had his fatal stroke last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO Chorus, 175 strong, sang under the direction of Shaw's
longtime assistant and accompanist, Norman Mackenzie, and were
joined by 65 members of the Robert Shaw Institute Singers, directed
by Ann Howard Jones. Also on the program was the 85-member
Morehouse College Glee Club, led by Shaw protege David Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   The music was reflective but not weepy. The choirs sang
selections from Brahms' ``German Requiem,'' Mendelssohn's
``Elijah,'' Rachmaninoff's ``Vespers'' and Vaughan Williams' ``Dona
Nobis Pacem,'' featuring soprano Areitha Lockhart, a teacher at
Medlock Elementary School in DeKalb County, singing the final
``Grant us peace'' in an angelic voice.
</P>
<P>
   British soprano Sylvia McNair, who made her first recording with
Shaw and the ASO, sang ``At the River,'' an American revival hymn.
During the applause at the concert's end, she raised her arms and
face to the ceiling, as though Shaw were looking down on the stage.
In this, she echoed chorister Reagina Bunton, who said that during
the concert, ``I just saw him standing there. It was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo Marietta Simpson, who made her Carnegie Hall debut with
Shaw, sang the most overt expression of grief, the African-American
spiritual ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,'' with the
Robert Shaw Institute Singers. The last words, ``Cry, cry,''
brought the audience to tears.
</P>
<P>
   After the musicians had taken their bows, Mackenzie brought out
Nola Frink, Shaw's longtime administrative assistant. ``That was
when I teared up,'' said Baltimore's Tom Hall, president-elect of
Chorus America, who studied with Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Shaw is a true genius,'' said Charles Yates, president of
the ASO board of trustees from 1962 to 1965 and the man responsible
for hiring Shaw as the orchestra's music director.
</P>
<P>
   Yates said Shaw had been initially reluctant to take the job
because of his lack of formal musical training. Still speaking of
Shaw in the present tense, Yates said: ``But we're mighty glad he
did come.''

   ATLANTA _ The first words after the invocation were spoken by a
husky male voice reading ``Winnie-the-Pooh'' to a child.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pooh,' said Piglet nervously, `how would it be if we went
home now and practiced your song and sang it to Eeyore tomorrow?'''
And then the reader went on to sing ``The more it snows,'' complete
with ``tiddly-poms'' and a light but definite rhythm, skipping
along with the two stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the voice of Robert Shaw, recorded in 1948. And it was a
lovely beginning to the memorial concert given Friday afternoon by
the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, honoring the conductor
four days after his death Monday at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was filled with music, sung by three local choirs
and a pair of international soloists and played by the orchestra he
led for 21 years. For all the musical grandeur, however, it was
just as moving to hear the gentle singsong of Shaw's own voice in
the hall where it resounded for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The very first to arrive Friday morning at Symphony Hall were
three vocal performance majors from Covenant College in Lookout
Mountain, Tenn. ``We consider him one of the greats of the 20th
century,'' said James Richardson, 21, who arrived at the hall at
7:45 a.m. with classmates Shannon Kiser, 21, and Matthew Kickasola,
23.
</P>
<P>
   They had gotten up at 4:30 a.m. to make the trip from
Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the queue stretched around the hall to the MARTA Arts
Center station, with people lining up four abreast at the Woodruff
Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left my job for this,'' said Earle Clowney, chairman of the
Department of Foreign Languages at Clark Atlanta University, who
had a pile of French papers to occupy him from 11:40 a.m., when he
got in line, until he was rewarded with a seat in the third row.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity audience of about 1,800 people seemed to be divided
between people such as Clowney, listeners who took time out of the
day to remember the late conductor, and music professionals who
came to pay their respects to a revered colleague.
</P>
<P>
   The event was also a reunion of Shaw's extended family: the
singers and choral directors he trained over his 50-year
international career.
</P>
<P>
   It ranged from Greg Smith of Duluth, Ga., conductor of the choir
at Parkway Baptist Church, who sang in the ASO Chorus in the fall
of 1997, to Paul Salamunovich, music director of the Los Angeles
Master Chorale.
</P>
<P>
   The audience also included some 50 orchestra administrators and
orchestra board members who are in Atlanta for an American Symphony
Orchestra League conference, led by ASOL President Neil Williams.
Carnegie Hall, National Public Radio, Telarc Records (which
produces and distributes the ASO's recordings) and the Westminster
Choir College sent representatives, as did the New York
Philharmonic and the orchestras of Cleveland, Baltimore, Dallas and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Five rows of seats, marked off by enormous rosettes of navy
satin ribbon, were filled with the family and friends of the late
conductor. Two of his children spoke: stepson Alex Hitz of Atlanta,
who read from one of Shaw's best-known speeches, in which he called
the arts ``the only workable program of conservation for the human
race,'' and Shaw's youngest son, Thomas, who read William Butler
Yeats' poem ``Sailing to Byzantium.'' Shaw was visiting Thomas, a
senior at Yale University, when he had his fatal stroke last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO Chorus, 175 strong, sang under the direction of Shaw's
longtime assistant and accompanist, Norman Mackenzie, and were
joined by 65 members of the Robert Shaw Institute Singers, directed
by Ann Howard Jones. Also on the program was the 85-member
Morehouse College Glee Club, led by Shaw protege David Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   The music was reflective but not weepy. The choirs sang
selections from Brahms' ``German Requiem,'' Mendelssohn's
``Elijah,'' Rachmaninoff's ``Vespers'' and Vaughan Williams' ``Dona
Nobis Pacem,'' featuring soprano Areitha Lockhart, a teacher at
Medlock Elementary School in DeKalb County, singing the final
``Grant us peace'' in an angelic voice.
</P>
<P>
   British soprano Sylvia McNair, who made her first recording with
Shaw and the ASO, sang ``At the River,'' an American revival hymn.
During the applause at the concert's end, she raised her arms and
face to the ceiling, as though Shaw were looking down on the stage.
In this, she echoed chorister Reagina Bunton, who said that during
the concert, ``I just saw him standing there. It was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo Marietta Simpson, who made her Carnegie Hall debut with
Shaw, sang the most overt expression of grief, the African-American
spiritual ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,'' with the
Robert Shaw Institute Singers. The last words, ``Cry, cry,''
brought the audience to tears.
</P>
<P>
   After the musicians had taken their bows, Mackenzie brought out
Nola Frink, Shaw's longtime administrative assistant. ``That was
when I teared up,'' said Baltimore's Tom Hall, president-elect of
Chorus America, who studied with Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Shaw is a true genius,'' said Charles Yates, president of
the ASO board of trustees from 1962 to 1965 and the man responsible
for hiring Shaw as the orchestra's music director.
</P>
<P>
   Yates said Shaw had been initially reluctant to take the job
because of his lack of formal musical training. Still speaking of
Shaw in the present tense, Yates said: ``But we're mighty glad he
did come.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Longtime Houston newsman Sylvan Rodriguez said Friday
that he has incurable cancer and temporarily will leave his anchor
duties at KHOU-TV, a CBS affiliate, to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a dedicated journalist who last fall narrated his own
knee-replacement surgery, Rodriguez chose to inform Houston viewers
of his condition at the close of Friday's 6 p.m. newscast, rather
than keep his illness to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now about to tackle a new assignment,'' he said. ``It will
be the toughest battle of my life: a battle with cancer. ... I have
a rare form of cancer called neuro-endocrine islet cell carcinoma.
It is a mouthful. It is a cancer of the pancreas, which has now
mestatasized to the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was born in San Antonio but has called Houston home
for 23 years. He is a 1971 graduate of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Off the air, Rodriguez traced his illness to two years ago,
describing a period of episodic vomiting that would keep him from
eating some days, then would go away. His weight dropped from 185
to 159 as the vomiting episodes became more frequent. After
consultations with several doctors here, he and his wife spent a
week at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was diagnosed with
cancer Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a shock,'' he said. ``Thank the Lord I had my
wife next to me, because as my mind reeled off in so many different
directions, she could then talk medical terms. She's been a real
trooper.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been married to Dr. Shelley Sekula, a dermatologist, for
3 1/2 years. He has five children _ ages 14 to 20 _ from his
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 50, said his condition ``is serious. I wish I could
tell you we had this bad boy under control right now, but it's
going to take a lot of prayers and God's grace. It is incurable,
but it is treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of his condition filtered out Friday, colleagues and
friends from around the city flooded KHOU, Channel 11, with phone
calls, showing their concern and love. His roots in Houston include
professional stints at ABC-affiliate KTRK-TV (1975-1986) and KHOU
(1987-present), as well as involvement in numerous community
organizations and charities, especially those involving Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the station is in shock about the news,'' said
Channel 11 general manager Peter Diaz. ``But we're very supportive
and confident that he will be returning in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told viewers Friday that he hopes to be back on the
air ``in a couple of months'' and said off the air that he'd like
to file reports on his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I respond to these treatments all right, we'll send a
photographer out there (to the Medical Center),'' he said. ``The
reason I'm going to do it is because cancer is something that
affects everybody. I would like to show people that we can say the
word `cancer,' then after getting over saying the word, we can go
on with the next stage of battling this bad boy. That's my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He will begin treatments Monday at University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The lights glistened, the stallions pranced and
the Lyndon Baines Johnson High School Band played ``Jingle Bells''
and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' Here, at the opening parade
for the annual Trail of Lights Festival, Austin's proudest
Christmas tradition, a refreshment stand served hot chocolate and
nachos fragrant with jalapeno peppers and melted cheese. And waving
with his family from a horse-drawn carriage, thanks to a $120,000
contribution from his company and his own growing celebrity, was
Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Did Dell, one of the nation's five wealthiest people ($19
billion-plus, and counting), ever imagine that running Dell
Computer Corp., the fastest-growing personal computer company in
the world, would involve a stunt like this? Dell just rolled his
eyes, silently acknowledging that until recently he would sooner
have been caught buying a Compaq computer.
</P>
<P>
   To the builders of America's high-technology hegemony,
philanthropy and civic-mindedness used to be the sort of
distractions tolerated only by the corporate dinosaurs their own
companies were supplanting. By devoting all their attention to
their businesses, many members of the new elite figured that they
were creating enough employment and wealth to answer those who
called them aloof _ or downright stingy. They had to give their
jobs their every waking minute, they believed, or their fledgling
companies would perish.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, even as global markets and mergers make many older
corporations less likely to tend the grass in their own backyards,
companies like Dell and Microsoft Corp. are becoming more involved
with their communities than ever. Even as they give familiar causes
like United Way their due, the entrepreneurs behind these companies
are seeking novel ways to bring their talents and wealth to bear on
broader challenges.
</P>
<P>
   This new philanthropy grows from a recognition that their
companies' size and permanence bring new responsibilities. On
corporate campuses where the construction never ceases, technology
executives are looking up from their screens to see that their
hometowns, and often the nation, expect more.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are accused, like Microsoft, of building a
rapacious monopoly or, like Dell Computer, of aggravating traffic
jams and urban sprawl, they are often on the defensive by the time
they begin serious philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives say they began giving before they had to. ``It
is nice to be getting down this philanthropy road before there's
some definite reason to do it _ not to speak ill at all of
Microsoft's efforts or even of a Philip Morris','' said Tom Green,
Dell Computer's general counsel and chairman of the Dell
Foundation. ``But it's hard to identify why Dell would be doing
this other than because it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell himself, the 33-year-old chairman and chief
executive, describes much of the giving as enlightened
self-interest. With hiring having become so competitive, corporate
leaders are seeing that they must keep their hometowns primped,
educated and entertaining. ``To us,'' said Dell in an interview,
``the quality of life that our employees enjoy is a competitive
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropists of decades past might have begun their giving as
early. Even as a bookkeeper embarking on a career, John D.
Rockefeller Sr. tithed to his church and gave to other causes. But
never has a generation of business leaders so young had to begin
weighing what to do with such great riches, much less imagine how
their decisions will shape the world and their reputations decades
after they are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Their announced aim has been nothing less than to reinvent
philanthropy. Rather than simply writing checks to institutions,
they often begin by defining one of society's woes, then finding
out how and with whose help their money can do the most.
</P>
<P>
   For the new philanthropists, charity balls, United Way rallies
and layers of review are out. Quick decisions and e-mail
solicitations are in. ``Some of the checks I've written have been
after one-and-a-half-minute conversations,'' Green said. ``We don't
run it through a bunch of committees or go to a bunch of cocktail
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Although five Dell Computer executives, including Michael Dell,
donated $13 million last October toward building a new Austin
Museum of Art, Green added, ``I don't think a majority of them have
ever met the museum's director.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the new philanthropy represents a total rupture with
the old. In making computers and the Internet available to the
nation's libraries, Microsoft founder Bill Gates was inspired by
Andrew Carnegie's original support for public libraries. Older
philanthropists like the financier George Soros have taken the lead
in treating charity as an investment that should have measurable
results. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology that the newer business leaders have
nurtured has created global villages, much of their charity is
resolutely local. Gates, 43, is backing the Seattle Public
Library's building campaign and providing subsidies for young
Seattle residents to help the city's poorest children and
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina's Research Triangle, James Goodnight and John
Sall, co-founders of SAS Institute Inc., the big privately held
software company, have spent about $15 million building a private
school for grades six through 12 that emphasizes computer
technology. Sun Microsystems gives hundreds of thousands of dollars
a year to schools and youth programs in areas of California,
Massachusetts and Scotland where its employees are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that give schools or charities their hardware or
software are sometimes accused of turning philanthropy into
marketing. The donors respond that corporate giving should have
corporate benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Dell subjects his company's giving to the same evaluation as any
other expense, he said, ``to make sure our resources are going to
sources that are not only aligned with our employees' interests but
are going to be productive and meaningful investments for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest technology executives, however, are giving far
more as individuals than through their businesses. Some, like Peter
Norton, who sold a business that included his Norton Utilities
software to Symantec Corp. in 1990, have already made philanthropy
their second careers.
</P>
<P>
   Though education, especially as it involves computers, ranks
high with them, they also pursue more personal causes. Norton
donates contemporary art to museums and gives curators grants to
buy more. Michael Dell's earliest prominent gift was 40 acres,
worth $2.5 million, in 1994 to the Jewish Federation of Austin as a
site for a Jewish community center. Paul Allen, co-founder of
Microsoft, is spending $100 million to give Seattle an interactive
museum for rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Still decades from retirement, many technology plutocrats have
so far allocated only a sliver of their fortunes. Accusations of
stinginess linger. But some are planning to donate on the scale of
a Rockefeller or Carnegie: Gates has pledged to leave most of his
wealth to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has just begun pondering. He has sought guidance from
Thomas Luce, a Dell board member and long a lawyer for the Perot
family, and from George Kozmetsky, a former Dell board member,
co-founder of the Teledyne Inc. conglomerate and former dean of the
University of Texas business school, who is regarded as a father of
high-technology philanthropy. Dell has also commiserated over
dinner with Gates about the challenges of giving away such huge
sums.
</P>
<P>
   But at Dell Computer, organized philanthropy has a shorter
history than the Pentium chip.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wright, an Austin writer, was raising money a few years
ago for a statue to honor three founding fathers of Texas
literature. ``We couldn't get a hearing from Dell,'' he said. ``The
word in the philanthropic community was the Dell Corporation just
wasn't very openhanded. Now there is a whole different ambiance.
The Dellionaires were slow to catch on, but now they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, Dell Computer had designated no one to
handle donation requests. Until last year, it had never issued a
press release about its giving. As it moved many operations from
Austin to a suburb, Round Rock, starting six years ago, the company
was often accused of turning its back on the city. A 1995 survey of
community leaders confirmed what Dell executives sensed. Though
admired for its success, Dell was regarded as uncaring. ``You
remember that report card you get in school? `Needs improvement, or
satisfactory or excellent'?'' asked Pete Winstead, Dell's personal
lawyer. ``Dell got some `needs improvements' on how the community
saw their role.''
</P>
<P>
   The company soon set up the Dell Foundation, and Michael Dell
named Green, one of the company's five top executives, as chairman.
The foundation now has an annual budget of about $1 million. ``It
gave us a central point, a focal point in the organization to think
through what kinds of things we wanted to be involved in,'' Dell
said.
</P>
<P>
   For young technology companies like Dell, philanthropy has grown
apace with political activity. Dell had no Washington lobbyist
until roughly three years ago, about a year after Microsoft arrived
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's corporate donations go to causes with direct payoffs in
publicity and goodwill. For the Trail of Lights Festival, which
lines the Colorado River and Barton Creek with Christmas figures
and scenes, Dell executives offered Austin Mayor Kirk Watson
$120,000 a year beginning in 1997 for upkeep and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards for Dell included getting its name in lights on the
arched entryway to the milelong trail and on signs in front of
several displays, as well as a speech of thanks from Mayor Watson.
At the opening reception and parade last month, swarms of Dell
publicists ordered one another around over cellular phones and
walkie-talkies, and a company photographer and a video cameraman
preserved every handshake and grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it's a way of fostering and deepening our
relationship with the city,'' said Peter Scacco, the company's
director of public relations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making nice with civic leaders has had evident benefits. Last
February, the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, then led by
Winstead, named Dell and his wife, Susan, the Austinites of the
Year in honor of their civic contributions and achievements.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Dell executives were panicking over the imminent
prospect of outgrowing their factories. In Austin, winning permits
and zoning and building new roads can take two years. ``We work at
one speed and the community works at another,'' said Cathie
Hargett, who, as manager of public affairs, has been expanding
Dell's philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, newly educated in politics and the virtues of
civic life, promptly accepted suggestions from the city to put a
new factory in East Austin, a depressed but not environmentally
delicate area. In return, permits were granted, fees were waived
and a two-lane country road was turned into a four-lane divided
highway, all within eight months.
</P>
<P>
   And Dell Computer has learned how to say ``thank you'' as well
as ``please.'' In opening the plant last November, Dell's senior
executives announced $500,000 in personal gifts toward the building
of a new East Austin YMCA, including a computer lab.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, seeking to spread the habit of giving, regularly
relies on senior executives and their spouses to suggest causes.
The art museum donation came at the urging of Green and his wife,
Deborah, reviving a plan that had been stalled ever since Austin
voters approved $11.4 million for the purpose in 1984. The Dells'
$1 million donations for a new radiology center at the Children's
Hospital of Austin and the Dell Discovery Center at the Austin
Children's Museum reflect Ms. Dell's as well as Michael Dell's
interests in children's causes.
</P>
<P>
   The spouses of Dell Computer's senior executives also pursue
projects on their own. Last summer they gathered at least two
truckloads of beds, clothing and food for victims of the South
Texas floods.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are employee efforts. United Way officials routinely
recommend that companies raise contributions with meetings and
rallies, pledge cards and face-to-face solicitations. ``But we're a
Web-based culture,'' Ms. Hargett, the public affairs manager, said.
And so the Dell Direct Giving campaign, with solicitations and
donation forms online, raised $2.7 million last year, triple the
1997 total.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the donations or Dell's status as the area's largest
private employer, with a work force of about 15,000, buy universal
respect. The Dells are still contesting the appraisal of their
recently completed house. Local officials value it at $22.5
million. Dell, saying that Austin has no market for such expensive
homes, puts the plausible sales price at only $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Social Venture Partners of Seattle, a sort of Project Head
Start for junior philanthropists, decided last year to donate
$65,000 to a program that gives local children from poor families
tutoring, computer training and social skills, it did more than
just send a check. One member of the group, a seasoned real estate
agent, negotiated new leases for the project. Another member took a
jumble of outdated computers, added some newer machines bought with
donations and wired together an up-to-the-minute network.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing what they call ``venture philanthropy,'' new groups
of donors like these have set about applying to charities the
skills they apply to their companies. They are also pressing
nonprofit organizations to become more efficient and businesslike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with a generational shift,'' said Paul Brainerd,
who founded Social Venture Partners after he collected $150 million
from the sale of his software company, Aldus Corp., to Adobe Corp.,
in 1994. ``These are people in their 30s and 40s who have more to
give than just their money. They have their intellects, their
minds. Their idea is more than just charity. It's investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Venture Partners has 135 members drawn from a rising
generation of philanthropists known around Seattle as the Baby
Bills, in emulation of Bill Gates. Individuals or couples who are
members donate at least $5,000 a year each. Last year, about 50
members donated a total of about $300,000. This year, in all, the
group plans to give away almost $1 million _ an indication that the
effort is growing as rapidly as some of the members' companies.
Board members include William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice
president for law and corporate affairs, and Scott Oki, a former
Microsoft executive who is now a venture capitalist and
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Gates himself, in giving $200 million to send the Internet into
the nation's libraries, likewise provides more than machines and
software. As Patricia Stonesifer, a former Microsoft executive who
serves as chairman and president of the Gates Library Foundation,
said, ``I've now got 100 trainers and technical support people out
in Louisiana and Mississippi making sure that the technology isn't
just deployed but becomes a part of the librarians' knowledge and
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Gates and his wife, Melinda, announced plans to
donate $100 million for speeding the delivery of childhood vaccines
to developing nations. There, the follow-up will include helping
governments and private health agencies improve their own
distribution of vaccines. That effort came together over dinner at
the Gateses' home with more than a dozen experts in world health.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gates, the new philanthropists often seek to answer
challenges from those who say their products are widening
inequality, leaving behind those without computer access or
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   To interest high school girls in exploring careers in computer
science, Katrina Garnett, founder and president of Crossworlds
Software in Burlingame, Calif., has committed $1 million to the
Backyard Project. It includes a Web site, www.backyard.org,
brochures advising girls to study science and technology, and an
annual computer camp where girls learn the C programming language _
and networking skills that don't necessarily involve electronics.

   ``Walter is the coach, he makes the decisions, and I respect
that,'' Jair said Friday. ``I'm looking forward to showing him I
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Jair provided a dynamic spark in midfield as the
Revolution compiled an early-season winning streak. But he broke
his left ankle in May, and the Revolution sank into a nine-game
losing streak. When Jair returned, then-coach Thomas Rongen kept
him in a high-profile role. But after Rongen departed, Jair lost
his starting position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has a different mentality,'' Jair said. ``Everyone has
to understand what he wants us to do from the start. Of course,
it's different this year, because Walter is different. With his
experience and his mentality, we have to expect things to change
and we have to work together as a team to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to develop friendships within the team and do
everyting we can to make the Revolution a better team. The last
game of the season is the MLS Cup at Foxboro Stadium, and we want
to be playing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a youngster playing in Boston, Jair has been known
for his offensive prowess, his knack for making the precise pass,
maintaining his poise in scoring situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter wants something different from me, and I am willing to
do what he wants me to do,'' Jair said. ``We will defend more. He
wants every player to sacrifice themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely what Jair was doing when he was injured in the
fifth minute of a 3-1 loss to Kansas City May 16. His attempted
tackle resulted in a ``dislocated fracture,'' which kept him out
for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I was injured, I was playing well on both sides of the
game,'' Jair said. ``I came back and I was a little afraid. It was
a psychological thing, but that is in the past and I don't think
about it anymore. I'm 100 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new season and Walter knows me better than before.
He knows what I can do for the team. I am very motivated and I want
to show that I have improved over last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer officials were skeptical of Jair when he was
being recruited by the Revolution, despite his experience playing
in Bulgaria, Portugal, and Spain. He quickly proved himself,
though, scoring the tying goal against D.C. United in his second
MLS game.
</P>
<P>
   He might have helped open the way for others, such as his
younger brother, Luis Ribeiro, who has drawn the interest of the
San Jose Clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he needs is a chance,'' Jair said. ``He's left-footed,
with good skill and a good attitude, and he's a little stronger and
a little faster than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ribeiroses' talents were recognized while they were
teenagers, and they were signed by Sporting in Lisbon. Luis
returned after a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very young, plus he got injured,'' Jair said. ``I was
sure that I wanted to be a professional. I learned a lot there
about being a professional, and that has made me the person that I
am. I would like to someday go back and play on the first team. But
first I want to play well here and make the Revolution a good
team.''

HOUSTON ANCHORMAN TELLS VIEWERS HE HAS CANCER 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Longtime Houston newsman Sylvan Rodriguez said Friday
that he has cancer and temporarily will leave his anchor duties at
KHOU-TV, a CBS affiliate, to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a dedicated journalist who last fall narrated his own
knee-replacement surgery, Rodriguez chose to inform Houston viewers
of his condition at the close of Friday's 6 p.m. newscast, rather
than keep his illness to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now about to tackle a new assignment,'' he said. ``It will
be the toughest battle of my life: a battle with cancer. ... I have
a rare form of cancer called neuro-endocrine islet cell carcinoma.
It is a mouthful. It is a cancer of the pancreas, which has now
mestatasized to the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was born in San Antonio but has called Houston home
for 23 years. He is a 1971 graduate of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Off the air, Rodriguez traced his illness to two years ago,
describing a period of episodic vomiting that would keep him from
eating some days, then would go away. His weight dropped from 185
to 159 as the vomiting episodes became more frequent. After
consultations with several doctors here, he and his wife spent a
week at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was diagnosed with
cancer Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a shock,'' he said. ``Thank the Lord I had my
wife next to me, because as my mind reeled off in so many different
directions, she could then talk medical terms. She's been a real
trooper.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been married to Dr. Shelley Sekula, a dermatologist, for
3 1/2 years. He has five children _ ages 14 to 20 _ from his
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 50, said his condition ``is serious. I wish I could
tell you we had this bad boy under control right now, but it's
going to take a lot of prayers and God's grace. It is incurable,
but it is treatable.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of his condition filtered out Friday, colleagues and
friends from around the city flooded KHOU, Channel 11, with phone
calls, showing their concern and love. His roots in Houston include
professional stints at ABC-affiliate KTRK-TV (1975-1986) and KHOU
(1987-present), as well as involvement in numerous community
organizations and charities, especially those involving Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the station is in shock about the news,'' said
Channel 11 general manager Peter Diaz. ``But we're very supportive
and confident that he will be returning in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told viewers Friday that he hopes to be back on the
air ``in a couple of months'' and said off the air that he'd like
to file reports on his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I respond to these treatments all right, we'll send a
photographer out there (to the Medical Center),'' he said. ``The
reason I'm going to do it is because cancer is something that
affects everybody. I would like to show people that we can say the
word `cancer,' then after getting over saying the word, we can go
on with the next stage of battling this bad boy. That's my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He will begin treatments Monday at University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

AID WORKERS HERO TO SOME, ENEMY TO OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA TEBAIDA, Colombia _ Fernando Echeverry normally spends his
days as a government bureaucrat in this small Colombian city about
160 miles west of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   But since an earthquake leveled most of his hometown on Monday,
Echeverry no longer pushes papers. These days he sprints around a
sports complex that's been turned into an aid center handing out
bananas, counting boxes of donated food, and trying to keep his
neighbors from going hungry or giving up hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people's lives were destroyed in seconds,'' he said,
holding a clipboard thick with papers tracking the tons of
donations that have passed through this distribution hub this week.
``We're trying to get to everyone, but it's hard to know if you're
doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the anguish, chaos and destruction of a natural disaster,
the aid worker can be both hero and enemy.
</P>
<P>
   When enough supplies are delivered promptly to an affected area,
relief workers often are greeted with cheers and countless
thank-yous from victims. But when the milk runs out or the trucks
are slow to get to their destinations, the work can become as
difficult as it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing to do is to tell someone that you have no
more or that this food is for someone else,'' said Marta Lucinda
Calles, a local Red Cross worker whose job was to hand out bags of
groceries in the Alfonso Lopez neighborhood, the hardest hit in La
Tibeida. ``How can you say `no' to someone who has nothing left?''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian government officials say more than 240 tons of relief
supplies have been collected to help hundreds of thousands of
residents in this region who need food, medicine or shelter. Scores
of embassies, including the United States, have already delivered
bundles of goods or technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana said Thursday he would even consider
raising taxes or declaring an economic emergency for the country
even though such moves might undermine his administration's recent
attempts to reduce the budget deficit and reignite its sputtering
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Oviedo, a truck driver from La Tebaida whose apartment was
destroyed in the quake, said he wouldn't mind paying more money to
the government, so long as it brought him aid and helped him
rebuild his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana himself walked through here the other day and I told
him he could raise our taxes,'' Oviedo, 40, said from the shack he
and his wife, Solei, have made from corrugated tin, bamboo, and
pieces of baby furniture they pulled from their old home. ``But
that means bring us food, help us rebuild our houses and help me
make sure my daughter doesn't get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   An aftershock rippled through the area early Friday morning.
Although there were no immediate reports of additional casualties
or damage, the tremor complicated aid work even more by adding to
residents' anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Armenia, where assistance efforts have already
been hampered by congested streets, poor local coordination and
widespread looting by frustrated residents, 250 people stormed the
main Red Cross distribution center Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The angry mob burst through a chain-link fence, taking armfuls
of food, blankets and plastic tarps for tents. Soldiers and police
restored order by firing canisters of teargas into the crowd, but
they did not use direct force on the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't punish people this desperate,'' Luis Carvallo, a
25-year-old soldier said while watching another looting incident in
Armenia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pastrana ordered a heavy military presence around
Armenia to help aid workers distribute supplies quickly. He also
ordered that a census of survivors and their needs begin
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the tide of refugees who have left the
city in search of safer ground, something aid workers say is an
understandable reaction, but one that will make it harder for them
to keep track of those getting help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's danger, the mind says `go,' '' said Lucinda
Calles, the aid worker in La Tebaida. ``It's not a human instinct
to sit and wait for help.''
</P>

NO BLACKOUT OF PATRIOTS IN BOSTON MARKET, NFL CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue
said Friday that if the Patriots move to Hartford, all their games
would be televised in the Boston market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games would not be blacked out in Boston,'' said Tagliabue
during his State of the League address, given annually on the
Friday before the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to fan interest. It is important that we
serve our fans in big cities, including in the Boston area. They
have been fabulous fans of the Patriots for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said that personally, he has mixed emotions about the
potential Patriots move in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the state of Connecticut and Bob Kraft have worked out
makes a lot of sense from the perspective of the state of
Connecutciut and given Bob's frustrations in tying to get something
done in Massachusetts,'' he said. ``We haven't even begun
evaluating the proposal. So I don't want to get too far out in
front in terms of where we are. The process hasn't begun yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue touched on many points during his question-and-answer
sessions with the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --He has not decided whether to reinstate San Francisco 49ers
owner Ed DeBartolo Jr., whose sister will continue to run the
franchise, most likely through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said DeBartolo's legal problems, which caused him to
step aside from the 49ers, have nothing to do with gambling but
with being a victim of an extortion plot in Louisiana involving
former Governor Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   --Troubled former New York Giants star linebacker Lawrence
Taylor should be voted into the Hall of Fame Saturday. ``He should
be, and I say that without qualification,'' Tagliabue said of
Taylor, who has had drug problems during and after his career. ``He
was one of the greatest players. He changed the way the game is
played. The Hall of Fame is about performing on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   --He expects instant replay to return next season but doesn't
know in what form.
</P>
<P>
   --NFL game officials are as good as ever but are being ``held to
an impossible standard. They come very close to meeting it, but I
don't think we need to be wringing our hands about the quality of
officiating in the National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   --In March at their annual meeting, the owners most likely will
select either Los Angeles or Houston for the 32d franchise in a
two-step process, choosing the city first, then the owner.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: OPEN1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday rejected, 43-57, a Democratic proposal to
conduct debate in open session in President Clinton's impeachment
trial. In rejecting the proposal, the Senate decided to continue to
employ the secrecy rules established during Andrew Johnson's
impeachment trial in 1868. Supporters said the debates should be
held in public view because the public has a right to know what
their senators are considering when debating the impeachment
charges. Opponents said keeping the Senate open could delay the
trial because senators may feel inclined to use the full 10 minutes
allotted to each senator if they know the public is watching.
Supporters said they would reintroduce the motion before each
debate. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OPEN2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 41-58, a Democratic proposal to
conduct the Senate impeachment debates in public. In rejecting the
proposal for the second time in two days, the Senate decided to
continue to employ the secrecy rules established at Andrew
Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868. Supporters said the debates
should be held in public view because people have a right to know
what their senators are considering when debating the impeachment
charges. Opponents said keeping the debate open could delay the
trial because senators may feel inclined to use the full 10 minutes
allotted to each senator if they know the public is watching. A
``yes'' vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DISMISS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 44-56, a Democratic motion to
dismiss the impeachment charges against President Clinton. The
motion would have ended the trial. Supporters said it was useless
to continue the trial when it was obvious the prosecution would
never get the two-thirds votes needed to remove Clinton from
office. Opponents said the trial should not be short-circuited
until both sides have had the opportunity to present their case. A
``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: WITNESSES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 56-44, prosecution subpoenas
that would call former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal to be witnesses in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal were chosen because they
are alleged witnesses to six out of the seven
obstruction-of-justice charges against Clinton. Supporters said the
depositions are a fair process that should not be overlooked.
Opponents said witnesses will unnecessarily delay the trial. A
``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 43-55, a Democratic proposal to
immediately close debate and vote on the impeachment charges
against President Clinton. Supporters said the trial needs to end
because it is clear that the prosecution will never get the
two-thirds votes needed to remove Clinton from office. Opponents
said the trial should not be short-circuited. A ``yes'' vote favors
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: GOP PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 55-44, a Republican plan that
includes videotaped depositions by Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan
and Sidney Blumenthal. Unless more witnesses are called, the plan
also calls for the impeachment trial to end by Feb. 12 with a vote
on the perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges. The plan
required a majority vote before witnesses could testify on the
Senate floor or videotaped testimony could be played before the
whole Senate. Supporters said the depositions need to be videotaped
so that senators can watch the testimony if a majority agree.
Opponents said public viewing of witnesses, such as the possibility
of Lewinsky talking about sex on the Senate floor, would turn the
impeachment process into a spectacle. A ``yes'' vote favors the
plan.

UMASS CHIEF GETS RAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Having raised the endowment and standards at the
University of Massachusetts, its president, former state Senate
President William M. Bulger, has won himself a raise.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 1/2 years left in his original contract signed in 1995,
the classics-quoting former South Boston legislator has also
negotiated another 5-year contract that will extend his tenure to
2003. His pay rises from $189,000 to $238,000 retroactive to July.
</P>
<P>
   The salary for the UMass president has not risen since 1991, so
it was due for a sizeable increase, said Robert S. Karam, chairman
of the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from that, Karam said, Bulger deserved compensation
for significant accomplishments in the four-campus system.
Applications and enrollment are up, as are the SAT scores and grade
point averages of incoming students. Bulger's pet project, the
University Scholars program, this year attracted 145 high school
valedictorians to a public campus long seen as a poor second to the
region's better-known private schools, and an honors college will
open at Amherst in September.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fundraising is up 77 percent this year, and the
flagship campus at Amherst has risen 59 rungs on the widely-watched
US News and World Report rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The raise, voted in October, was the result of eight months of
debate that began in January 1998 after Bulger had been in office
two years. Karam assigned two trustees and Boston University
President Jon Westling to interview faculty, other college
presidents, and government and business leaders about how well
Bulger was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on a scale of one to ten, it was a ten,'' he said.
``There were no negatives, whatever group you talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   He expected, Karam said, to get positive feedback from the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the other stuff,'' he said, ``the fundraising, the
businesses, whether it be the Raytheons or the Fidelitys, making
the university one of their priorities. It's because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the survey, Karam said, the board of trustees looked into
how much other public university presidents earned. The salary
would have been increased when Bulger was originally hired, he
said, because it had gone so long without a raise, but doing so
then would have prompted complaints that it was only because Bulger
was so powerful in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's done his job unbelievably, and we have an obligation
to pay him what he deserves,'' Karan said, adding that the
trustees' vote to raise the salary was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's salary pales beside many private college presidents'.
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, 46 college
presidents earned upwards of $300,000 last year, three topped
$500,000, and ten topped $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among public college presidents, Bulger is between the average
and the highest paid, but his new salary is by no means the highest
among his peers. Many presidents of single campuses in public
systems have earned more in recent years: the president of the
University of Michigan-Ann Arbor earned $261,000 in 1994-95, former
UMass President Michael Hooker made $238,000 at his new job as head
of The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1995-96, and the
president of the University of California-Berkeley earned $237,000
that year. The president of Pennsylvania State University earned
$250,000 in 1995-96. And this year, the president of the University
of Connecticut will earn $255,000.

AN OVERSEAS STAKE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)  
(mk) 
 By JESSICA STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last May, Israel declared its currency, the shekel, freely
convertible, making it easier for citizens to own foreign bank
accounts and invest overseas. One unexpected result: Israelis with
spare cash are snapping up property in America.
</P>
<P>
   Land is something of an obsession in Israel, where desirable
real estate is scarce enough to be very expensive. So when the
shekel became convertible, Israeli real estate companies leapt into
action, setting up consortiums to buy New York apartment buildings
that look like bargains by Israeli standards.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Mishorim, is promoting detached houses with white
picket fences near Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., to Israelis
for $84,000 each, the price of a tiny apartment in a seaside
Israeli town like Ashkelon. ``In the '80s, the Israeli dream was a
Japanese car,'' said Amit Dobkin, a Mishorim broker. ``Now it's an
American home.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in New York. Elchanan Rosenheim, a Tel Aviv broker
for Re/Max, said he had sold 15 studios and one-bedrooms on
Manhattan's Upper West and East Sides and in Battery Park City, at
prices of up to $250,000 in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The homes are bought mainly as investments, with management
firms hired to rent and maintain them. American banks will rarely
lend foreigners more than 65 percent of the purchase price, but
buyers don't mind; putting a lot of cash in the deal is part of the
point. ``Israelis like to say they own real estate overseas,'' said
Rosenheim, ``and our clients have $50,000 to $100,000 that they
don't know what to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the homes' appeal than the expected 5 to 8
percent annual return, Rosenheim said: ``In the back of your head
you think, maybe one day I'll use this apartment for myself.''

GORE SEEKS TO PROTECT TRADE FROM GLOBAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Vice President Al Gore warned Friday that
the world had to ``prevent the financial crisis of 1998 from
becoming the trade crisis of 1999,'' and said the United States
would seek to negotiate the ``outright elimination'' of the huge
and politically sensitive subsidies that European nations provide
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement was his first detailed speech on the fragility
of the world economy. It came at his debut appearance at the annual
gathering here of the world's richest industrialists and the top
government officials who are trying to right the world economy
after 18 months of market plunges and currency upheavals on three
continents.
</P>
<P>
   While his audience was from all over the world, his message was
intended for farmers and others at home who have been demanding
that Washington relieve the effects of extraordinarily low
commodity prices that have depressed exports.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour speech that leapt from the economic tumult to a
new strategy for easing the debt of impoverished countries, Gore
sought to weave a middle ground that would anger neither the labor
unions suspicious of the Clinton administration's trade policies
nor the executives suspicious of Gore's relationships with
environmentalists and unions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore stopped well short of tackling the most divisive
questions being discussed at the conference, especially how
governments might stem the huge outflows of short-term investment
capital that destabilized Asia, Russia and now Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he declared that ``the global capital market itself
needs to be better and more cooperatively managed, not through new
global bureaucracies, and not through the laissez-faire approach
that has caused so many of today's problems, but through more
information, more openness, more cross-border reviews and
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   One executive whom Gore's staff consulted on the speech said
later, ``They couldn't decide where to come out on what to do, so
they came out in favor of doing more but not too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also met for 90 minutes on Friday with Russia's prime
minister, Yevgeny Primakov, discussing conditions that Russia must
fulfill before the largest Western industrial nations and the
International Monetary Fund will resume payments.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men appeared to have made little progress. A senior
administration official, describing the session, said the United
States and the IMF are still doubtful that Russia has a plan in
place to collect taxes and raise sufficient revenues to make its
new budget ``credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with recently resumed negotiations between
the fund and Moscow say it will be months before Russia receives
additional funding. And if further loans are forthcoming, the first
since Russia defaulted on debts last August, they may be designed
chiefly to allow Russia to repay debts on older loans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two leaders also addressed Russia's export of
missile-development expertise to Iran, with Gore reiterating the
United States' threat to suspend cooperation on commercial space
launches until Russia curbs technology sales to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore said the budget that the administration will
send to Capitol Hill on Monday will include ``significant new U.S.
funding'' to pay off the debts of poor and highly indebted nations,
many in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He was critical, however, of the subsidies European nations pay
their farmers, saying they ``cost the average European family about
$1,500 a year.'' He also attacked Europe's efforts to restrict
sales of beef raised using biotechnological products, a restriction
that European officials say is motivated by concerns about public
safety, and that Washington says is driven by protectionism.

MURDER SUSPECT HOLDS INFANT SON FOR FIRST TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Capital murder defendant John William ``Bill''
King held his 6-month-old baby for the first time Friday in the
room where 12 jurors will later decide if he will live or die, go
free or spend long years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional meeting between King, 24, and his son, Blayne
William King, girlfriend Kylie Greeney, 18, and King's 68-year-old
father, Ronald, came during a 30-minute break in the long process
of picking the jury.
</P>
<P>
   King is one of three white men accused of the brutal murder of
James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was chained to a pickup
and dragged almost three miles along back country roads east of
Jasper in the early morning hours of June 7.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was born premature Aug. 5, almost two months after
King, Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31,
were charged with killing Byrd. Berry and Brewer will be tried
later.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, King had only seen his infant son through the
thick glass of jail visitation rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King, sitting in a wheelchair and breathing bottled
oxygen because of emphysema, and Greeney had gotten to hug King a
couple of weeks ago during pre-trial hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something Bill and I could always do, we could always
hug,'' said the elder King. ``Don't ever forget to hug your boy,''
he said. ``He's my baby boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant looked fit and clean-cut Friday, a sports coat
covering his heavily tattooed forearms and dark hair obscuring the
tattoo of a pentagram at the base of his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said King got many of his tattoos _ some of them
emblems indicating white supremacist beliefs _ while he was in
prison serving a sentence for burglary from 1995 to 1997. While in
prison he also said he converted from Christianity to Odinism _ a
religion based on Norse mythology often adopted by white
supremacist prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the questioning of individual jurors by lawyers
this week, King took notes or sat quietly with a sober look on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   After the courthouse visit with his baby, King beamed with a big
smile. ``It was great!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the court session, which lasted less than half a day,
lawyers picked two more potential jurors. They plan to certify at
least 46 jurors of the 122 potential jurors who began the process
Monday. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will be able to strike 16
jurors from each side. The first 12 not struck by either side will
be on the jury to decide King's fate. The next two will be
alternate jurors.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of capital murder, King will be either sentenced to
death or life in prison. Defense attorneys also hope the jury will
be allowed to consider the lesser charge of murder, which has a
punishment range of five years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the jury pool includes two black men, three black
women, six white women and 11 white men. Most of the 27 jurors who
have been excused said they couldn't impose the death penalty on
any defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is to resume Monday afternoon. State District
Judge Joe Bob Golden said he expects testimony in the case to begin
Feb. 16.

COUNCIL DECIDES ON NEW FISHING RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vast sections of the Gulf of Maine from Provincetown to
Searsport, Maine, would be shut down to all groundfishing for 30 to
60 days at a time starting May 1 under a last-ditch proposal to
save the Gulf's severely overtaxed codfish from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And when the areas do open to fishing crews, daily caps of as
few as 5 pounds could be imposed on how much codfish could be taken
by each boat, under a plan to be sent to the US Commerce Department
for final approval as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   With federal scientists urging codfish catches be cut by 80
percent in the next fishing season, members of the New England
Fishery Management Council hammered out a plan late Thursday night
that tries to spread huge economic hardship for fishermen as
equitably as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of day-fishing boats in communities such as Gloucester,
Boston, New Bedford, and Portsmouth, N.H., could be put out of
business by the restrictions, which will hit Massachusetts hardest
in the spring months. Official estimates of regional economic
losses run to tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this will seriously impact small-boat fishermen,''
said Chris Kellogg, a senior technical adviser to the council.
``But unless there was a substantial reduction in fishing levels,
the cod stocks would have continued to drop'' to a point of near
collapse as has occurred on Georges Bank east of Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Already, numbers of cod big enough to be harvested have dropped
by more than 80 percent since 1994, to what may be their lowest
levels in three decades. The new restrictions will cut allowable
cod harvests by several million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, it seems certain that the price of cod will rise
next summer as dealers have to turn to foreign suppliers. The
rolling bans on groundfishing could also severely limit local
supplies of fish other than cod, such as hake and flounder,
contributing to price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little by little they're taking away all of our options,''
said Frank Patania of Ideal Seafood Inc. in Boston. ``We'll still
get the cod from places like Canada or Iceland. But that means
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But with council members declaring their backs were against the
wall, some said they were confident they had done the best job they
could.
</P>
<P>
   William Amaru, a Chatham-based commercial fisherman who serves
on the 17-member council, said, ``We think we've got the right
areas closed at the right times'' to protect the cod when they are
most likely to be found in each area being closed.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involved tough compromises between inshore, day-trip
fleets in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and Maine-based crews
that tend to make longer trips farther out to sea, and Amaru said
he believes ``this is the best job that any council could have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   One key restriction is that allowable daily catches of cod per
boat will be reduced from 400 pounds to 200. Once half the
government's total allowable Gulf catch has been landed, which
Amaru predicted will happen before the end of June, daily limits
could drop to as few as 5 pounds, depending on federal fisheries
regulators' analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Areas closed to groundfishing would remain open to some other
kinds of fishing operations, including lobstering, scallop
dredging, and some kinds of rigs such as pelagic hooks that are
drawn through waters close to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some trawling vessels will have to use slightly larger
mesh to allow more smaller fish to escape being caught, and new
restrictions are being imposed on use of roller and rockhopper gear
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Fishery Management Council puts the compromise plan
into an official proposal, the Commerce Department will have 95
days to take comments and make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Frady, a spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said the agency wants to have new restrictions in place
before May 1.

SURVIVOR FINDS NEW LIFE ELUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richarda Brodmann, a survivor of four Nazi concentration camps,
now fights for her life in a Munich hospital. At 80, she appears to
be rallying from an illness that left her close to death a week
ago, but her prognosis remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   She has declined rapidly in the past two years, since the end of
her brief sojourn in the United States. She came here seeking a
reunion with her family and solace from the burden of being a Jew
in postwar Germany. She went home in frustration and despair three
months later when her visa expired, defeated by the challenges of
starting over in a new country so late in life.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Aliana Brodmann, a technical writer who lives in
Wellesley, hopes to bring her mother permanently to the United
States. But she can barely contain her frustration with those she
hoped would be more help to her _ the social service agencies that
she believes have done much to educate the public about the horrors
of the Holocaust, but not enough to aid the dwindling number of
survivors of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was a young adult when Nazi troops took her from
Krakow, in her native Poland. She endured the horrors of Plaszow,
Ravensbruck, Malchow, and finally Auschwitz in Poland, before US
soldiers liberated survivors of that camp in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband also survived the camps. They each lost both parents
and other relatives to Hitler's final solution. The end of the war
found them in Germany, but they never intended to remain there.
Aliana attended an English school in Cologne, set up for the
children of British occupation forces, so she would be able to
speak English when the time finally came for the family to move to
America.
</P>
<P>
   Aliana emigrated. But as one decade blended into another, her
parents' plans to follow her never came about. Aliana Brodmann
believes they were like many Holocaust survivors, struggling to
survive in a world in which they were psychologically incapable of
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   They became part of a tiny minority. Only 75,000 Jews remain in
Germany, a nation of 80 million. Although the German government has
gone to lengths to display sensitivity to the legacy of the
Holocaust, Jews remain an embattled minority.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, overdue attention has been paid to some of the
long-neglected issues of the Holocaust, including the seizure of
assets and the plundering of art collections by the Nazis. Swiss
banks have agreed to pay reparations. Museums, in Europe and the
United States, are being pressed to return artworks looted from
Jews. But for many among the dwindling number of Holocaust
survivors, daily life remains a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Richarda Brodmann's support system collapsed within ten days in
1997. First her husband died, then her sister, the only one of her
siblings to survive the camps. So she came to the United States, to
live with her daughter and two grandaughters.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it was a trial for all concerned. Richarda
Brodmann needed major medical care, but her government-sponsored
insurance in Germany did not cover her here. Since she was here on
a tourist visa, she did not qualify for Medicaid (which covers
Holocaust survivors with permanent immigration status). Nor did she
qualify for refugee status, because she did not live in a country
in which her life was at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Aliana Brodmann turned for help to Jewish social service
agencies, including Jewish Family and Children's Services and the
Jewish Community Affairs Council. But, she says, her mother's
insurance and housing problems were unresolved when her three-month
visa expired, and with a heavy heart she returned her to Germany,
to an assisted living facility.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Friedland, executive director of Jewish Family and
Children's Services, said his group tried to help the Brodmanns. He
blamed immigration policy for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad case,'' Friedland said. ``The government doesn't
have provisions for a case like this where very quickly an ailing
parent can be taken into the United States and things like Medicaid
become available.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Aliana's efforts to get her mother a permanent visa and
social services have been unavailing. But one unexpected benefit
has come her way: Sunday she was to travel to Germany for a week to
visit her mother, courtesy of the Lufthansa, the German airline.
</P>
<P>
   As she goes, she cannot help but note the irony in US
immigration policy. ``My mother had to leave because she couldn't
be granted refugee status,'' she says. ``But she's been a refugee
since the end of the war.''

A NEW BIG-POWER RACE STARTS ON A SEA OF CRUDE
</HEADLINE>
 By STEPHEN KINZER c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ With the discovery of great energy reserves in
countries around the Caspian Sea, a vast new region has catapulted
onto the world stage. It not only offers oil companies the prospect
of great wealth. It gives outside powers a place to test their
strength.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is waging a strong campaign to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. So are Russia, Iran and other powers in
the region. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the beginning of what will be a massive oil boom,''
said Stanley T. Escudero, the United States ambassador to
Azerbaijan. ''It means that Azerbaijan and this whole region are
about to emerge as major players in the world energy game, and also
as a vitally important area for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the United States supports cooperation in the
Caspian, saying it wants every country except Iran to prosper. Some
American diplomats in the region, however, sense that they are
involved in a modern version of the 19th- century Great Game, in
which Britain and Russia competed for dominance there.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is where we prove we're still the big boy on the block,''
said one diplomat. ''China, Europe, Iran, Russia and all the others
want to see if they can take us down. All of our so-called friends
and all of our so-called enemies want control of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game is being played out in an intense competition for
oil and gas pipeline routes. The nations that win will be able to
help shape events in the region for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration is lobbying intensely for an oil
pipeline route from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the
Mediterranean. This would tie Azerbaijan and Georgia to the West
and be a boon to Turkey, a key NATO ally. American officials are
applying every form of encouragement and pressure they can muster
to persuade oil companies to choose it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are skeptical. They say the American-backed line
is far too expensive to build without a subsidy of $1 billion or
more. By their calculations, a line across Georgia to the Black Sea
would cost less than half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since oil companies will pay for whatever pipeline is built,
they are in the catbird seat, and governments in the Caspian area
are fervently wooing them. '' In a reversal of history,'' said
Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, ''the
industry today is showing its potential to drive geopolitical
events, rather than be driven by them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, some members of Congress warn that the
United States must be wary of anti-American forces in the Caspian.
They want the Clinton Administration to work with the American oil
companies to establish a stronger United States presence.
</P>
<P>
   These legislators support bills like the Silk Road Strategy Act
proposed by Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas; it would
finance programs in the region ranging from support for independent
newspapers to ''transfer of excess defense articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that the United States should not help Caspian
countries as long as they reject democracy, especially if a hidden
agenda is to smooth the way for big business. Senator Paul S.
Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, has suggested that the Silk Road
Act be renamed ''the oil and gas interests bill.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Back Yard
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders are highly suspicious of American ambitions in
the Caspian, which they view as a naked power grab. Russia has
controlled the region for more than a century and is angry at what
it sees as an aggressive American campaign to wrest it away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot help seeing the uproar stirred up in some Western
countries over the energy resources of the Caspian,'' President
Boris N. Yeltsin told a newspaper interviewer last year. ''Some
seek to exclude Russia from the game and undermine its interests.
The so-called 'pipeline war' in the region is part of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Small amounts of Caspian oil are now being shipped through a
Soviet-era pipeline that runs north from Baku, the Azerbaijani
capital, to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea.
Russia proposes that the main export pipeline be built along this
route, rather than across Turkey as the United States wants.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline across Russia would help keep Caspian nations under
Moscow's thumb. But leaders of new nations in the region are
determined to break free of Russian influence. To do that, they
must have an export route that Russia does not control. ''I want to
be the head of my family,'' reasoned Ahmed Zeynalov, an Azerbaijani
oil executive. ''Would you put your neighbor in the position of
being able to control your family?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this political problem, there are practical ones.
The Russian route runs through Chechnya, hardly known for its
stability. And even if Caspian oil can be brought across Russia to
the Black Sea, no one is certain how it would be sent on from
there.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, suddenly discovering its environmental conscience, says
it cannot bear more tanker traffic through the already crowded
Bosporus to the Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish officials say,
the only solution is to build a pipeline across their country. But
Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine are offering an alternative: send the
oil across the Black Sea to our ports and from there to Western
Europe. This option gives oil companies another card to play when
they ask Turkey for billion-dollar subsidies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lure of Iran
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, many American oil executives believe the best
export route for Caspian oil is through Iran. They cannot choose
that route now because sanctions imposed by Congress forbid large
investments in Iran. But they refuse to write off the idea,
preferring to stall in the hope that the sanctions will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanctions are a drag on our business position,'' said Cecil
Davidson, operations manager in Turkmenistan for Halliburton
International Inc., a supplier of oil and gas equipment. ''The
competition gains strength because of it. They can operate in Iran
and we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for American energy companies are pressing for an end
to the sanctions, and some prominent figures in the foreign policy
establishment support them. In a speech this month, former
Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance urged new overtures to Iran.
Graham E. Fuller, a Rand Corporation analyst and former C.I.A.
official, recently called for ''a process of reconciliation'' based
on ''a remarkable number of common interests,'' including Caspian
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have begun courting Western oil and gas
companies. ''The route through Iran is the most economical, and the
companies know this,'' said Alireza Bikdeli, Iran's Ambassador in
Azerbaijan. ''They know this region very well, perhaps better than
the U.S. Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Caspian nations do not share the United States' desire to
isolate Iran. They must live as Iran's neighbors, and would rather
cooperate than feud. ''We'll take into consideration that the
United States opposes routes through Iran,'' said Recepbay Arazov,
the oil and gas minister in Turkmenistan, ''but we're not scared
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives looking for a way to bring their crude out of
Azerbaijan have only three or four main alternatives. But huge
amounts of oil and gas will also be coming from two countries on
the eastern shore of the Caspian, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
Competition there involves a much wider group of players.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan has huge reserves of natural gas, but its only
export pipeline runs through Russia. Because Russia is itself a gas
producer, it refuses to accept competing gas at fair prices. After
a bitter argument in 1997, Turkmenistan turned off its spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Now Turkmenistan has gone more than a year without earning a
cent from its gas reserves, and it has nothing else to sell. The
Government is living on bank loans, mostly from Germany. So
President Saparmurat Niyazov is negotiating with Royal/Dutch Shell
to build a $4 billion pipeline across Iran to gas-starved Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy can't wait,'' said Omer Ertur, the chief United
Nations representative in Turkmenistan. ''He's in a financial
crisis. He's up to his neck in debt and he's paying for a series of
colossal projects. If there's no pipeline, there's going to be
instability here.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the new Caspian nations, Kazakhstan, is also
hoping to escape from Russia's shadow. Kazakh leaders have approved
the construction of an oil pipeline across Russia to the Black Sea,
but they also want a non-Russian option. They are pushing for a
line under the Caspian to Azerbaijan, from which their oil could be
shipped westward to Georgia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course Russia will not agree with this project, and will
try to block it,'' said Ermukahmet Ertsybaev, director of the
Kazakhstan Institute of Strategic Studies. ''It would have a huge
political impact. We have been isolated from the world system, and
this would be our link to Europe. It would make our independence
real, and also the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also pursuing the idea of
building pipelines eastward to China. These lines would be long and
expensive, but Chinese leaders remain intrigued by them. They know
that a pipeline would pull Central Asia into their sphere of
influence, and guarantee energy sources for continued expansion of
their economy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arms Bolster the Claims
</P>
<P>
   Some of the outside powers seeking influence in the Caspian
region are using armies to strengthen their positions. Russia
maintains bases in Georgia and Armenia. The United States has
established a much smaller but nonetheless palpable military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Army has held maneuvers in the region, brought
local officers to America for training, and donated patrol boats
and other military equipment to friendly regimes. In May the Army
and units of the National Guard will stage an international
disaster relief exercise, using computers, in Kazakhstan.
Azerbaijan has signed a defense cooperation agreement with the
United States, and others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Iran view these steps as part of a hostile plan to
establish American hegemony over the Caspian. Some American
experts, however, believe there is enough wealth in the region for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things go well, it would be a tremendous boost to all of
the surrounding powers, which are many and formidable,'' said S.
Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be the best thing that could happen to Russia,
because it would lay to rest their imperial hangover,'' he said.
''It would give Iran its traditional role as a trading state.
Turkey would find a position for itself among peoples with whom it
has a historical connection. China would have a new strategic
connection to the West. Pakistan and India would have chances to
integrate themselves into an emerging region, rather than consume
themselves with mutual hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If things don't go well, there will be a geopolitical vacuum,
which is everywhere dangerous. They invite intrusions, and this is
a highly nuclear neighborhood.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Subpoenas formally served to impeachment trial witnesses
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate formally issued subpoenas Friday for
next week's sworn interviews, the first step in a Republican-led
plan to finish President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House intern who
is at the center of Clinton's sex and cover-up scandal, will answer
questions from House prosecutors beginning at 9 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With answers from Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, the House prosecutors will try
to bolster their case that Clinton obstructed justice by trying to
conceal his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While weary senators either dispersed to their home states
Friday for a long weekend or tried to conduct other legislative
business, Senate staff put into action the resolution that the
Senate adopted Thursday to govern the remainder of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart complained that the
resolution, passed without Democratic support, appears designed
``to play out this process in a way that can inflict maximum
political damage on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   While the resolution sets Feb. 12 as a target date for ending
the trial, Lockhart said, ``The way the resolution is written, we
really don't know where we are going in this process after
Wednesday (when the depositions conclude) ... and there are enough
holes in this resolution that it can be opened up with a simple
majority, and we could be here for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) addressed the
fatigue that has set in at the Capitol after three weeks of the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize how really difficult it is, how extremely
exhausting it is for United States senators to sit in one place for
six hours at a time and listen to others speak? I mean, there's no
vent, no way to let off steam,'' Lott told the U.S. Conference of
Mayors. ``And so it's the most exhausting thing I've ever had to
do, and we feel like we're free at last, Mr. Mayor. We're able to
get out in our respective states and not be in session today.''
Subpoenas were sent by fax to lawyers for Lewinsky and Jordan,
while William McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer, received a subpoena in
person at the Washington law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly, said John
Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman. Jordan and Blumenthal will be
questioned in the Capitol on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Their depositions will take place in a room on the fourth floor
of the building that is used for classified military and
intelligence briefings.
</P>
<P>
   The location of Lewinsky's interview had not been determined
late Friday, but Czwartacki said the Mayflower Hotel, where
Lewinsky answered prosecutors' questions last week, was a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.), a former U.S. attorney, will lead the
prosecutors' questioning of Lewinsky. Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.),
also a former federal prosecutor, will try to match wits with
Jordan, and Rep. Ed Rogan (R-Calif.), a one-time Los Angeles
prosecutor and judge, will question Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions will last no more than eight hours, divided
between the prosecutors and White House lawyers. Under the
resolution the Senate adopted Thursday, questions must be ``limited
to subject matters reflected in the Senate record.'' But the
prosecutors and White House lawyers also may refer to media reports
that are not part of the Senate record.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators, one Republican, one Democrat, will jointly preside
over the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Lott named Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) to preside at Lewinsky's
testimony, Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) to oversee Jordan's and
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) to watch over Blumenthal's.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, John Edwards of
North Carolina and Patrick Leahy of Vermont will take turns
presiding over the depositions, with no specific assignments.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine and Specter are former local prosecutors, while Thompson
served as a lawyer for the Senate Watergate Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, Edwards is an accomplished trial lawyer who
made his living in the courtroom until his Senate campaign and
victory last year. Leahy also has served as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Those in attendance at the depositions are sworn to
confidentiality, unless the Senate should vote to make the
depositions public. But rules agreed to by Lott and Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) allow for roughly two dozen people to
be present at each deposition.

A CASE OF CHILD KILLER BECOMES PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the unprecedented handshake agreement forged to end
a bitter lawsuit, Deborah and Sunil Eappen may have extracted a
legally binding promise from their outcast au pair not to profit
from the death of their infant son Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   But Louise Woodward did not walk away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the final chapter of a two-year cross-Atlantic
saga that has been as much about public perception as
jurisprudence, Woodward gets another chance at redemption and image
reformation: from convicted child killer to proper philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to settle the Eappen's multimillion-dollar federal
wrongful-death suit against her by channeling any money from her
story to UNICEF, the international child-charity, Woodward gives up
control of the purse strings _ but not the public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks like Princess Di,'' said Tom Hoopes, a Boston lawyer
and former Middlesex County prosecutor. ``She can make as much
money as she wants, as long as she doles it out to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappen's lawyer, Fredric Ellis, said his clients were
willing to pay that price for a measure of peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than her in a few years driving around in a
Rolls-Royce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement comes amid a nationwide backlash against
criminals cashing in on their deeds, legal specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the US Supreme Court knocked down New York's ``Son of
Sam'' law, saying it violated free speech rights to automatically
bar criminals from telling their stories for pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, states have found a way to prevent convicts
from raking in the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court has upheld the
decision of a state judge to ban Katherine Ann Power, as a
condition of her probation, from making money off her crime: the
1970 killing of a police officer during a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis and other legal specialists said that the matter of
Sunil Eappen v. Louise Woodward may represent the first time
parties to a civil action have agreed on a non-profiteering
provision.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Eappens
last June was different from others. The Eappens said they were not
looking to be compensated for the death of eight-month-old Matthew
in February 1997, the result of Woodward handling him roughly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they said they wanted to prevent Woodward from a large
payday after her second-degree murder conviction was reduced to
manslaugher by Judge Hiller Zobel during tumultuous 1997 court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, legal specialists who call the deal a win-win for both
sides, wonder how it will be enforced _ particularly in light of a
clause that could allow Ellis' clients to seize any profits
Woodward might try to hide and donate them to the Mattie Eappen
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally an ocean between the plaintiff and
defendant,'' said Marc Perlin, associate dean of the Suffolk
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, who prosecuted Woodward as the
Middlesex District Attorney, Friday decried the legal
merry-go-round the Eappens had to ride before reaching a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To spare others, Reilly said he was supporting a reconstituted
version of the state's ``Son-of-Sam'' bill, filed by State Senator
Cheryl Jacques, D-Needham, that would let victims claim criminals'
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families and victims shouldn't have to go through what the
Eappens went through to prevent someone from profiting from their
actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's nothing stopping Woodward from clinching a movie
or book deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people look at her with mixed feelings,'' said Boston
literary agent Lane Zachary, who estimated such a tome might
attract a $200,000 advance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on British TV Friday, Woodward would
not rule out writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't had the time to think about it,'' she said.
``I don't know. But I want to prove my innocence . . . it's a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And many believe Woodward would cast herself as the innocent
lead in this continuing compassion play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act four is `What story does she tell,' '' said Hoopes. ``You
kill a baby . . . and make a substantial amount of money and become
a princess by giving it away.''
</P>

 &HT;    STEM CELLS COULD CHANGE THE TERMS OF 'LIFE DEBATE'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A presidential ethics commission and a Senate
subcommittee are working separately to sort out issues involved in
a new national debate that has begun almost abruptly over the
dignity and sanctity of human reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement in the fall that researchers at the
University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins University had
successfully isolated human stem cells and have been growing them
in laboratory dishes, arguments over ``pro-life'' and
``pro-choice'' took on vastly higher stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The primitive cells are collected so soon after fertilization
that they have not yet differentiated into specific types of tissue
_ heart muscle, skin or bone, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they divide and grow endlessly without ever becoming
anything other than a line of human cells _ essentially human
``stuff'' that can never become a human being.
</P>
<P>
   The undifferentiated character of stem cells is the reason they
have sent shock waves through scientific and religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   The research also has shoved a new term into the general
vocabulary to join ``gigabyte'' and ``chlorofluorocarbon'' and
``monoclonal'' and ``thermonuclear'' and the endless list of other
terms science constantly spews into the language we speak.
</P>
<P>
   The new word to watch is ``pluripotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so primitive and undifferentiated, stem cells
are sort of all purpose cells. In a mother's womb, a host of
hormones and enzymes guides an embryo's cells into ever-greater
differentiation and specificity.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are pluripotent because each has the capacity to
become almost any of the more than 200 different kinds of cells in
the body.
</P>
<P>
   When moved to laboratory vessels, they may within a few years be
manipulated into becoming whatever scientists want them to become.
</P>
<P>
   That capacity could contain the tools for developing specific
types of tissues to treat specific diseases _ diabetes,
Alzheimer's, leukemia, for example _ as well as other cures no one
can begin even to anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   But because their existence reaches into the central mystery of
life and involves the deliberate destruction of embryos and
fetuses, stem cells raise profound moral and ethical concerns for
many individuals and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some students of bioethics say there is no doubt where the
debate will end.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering medical promise of stem cell research gives it a
constituency of millions of health consumers who are desperate for
breakthroughs, says Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for
Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Such a constituency, he believes, will overwhelm any opposition
to continued stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this debate is going to end is a foregone conclusion,''
Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of embryos from which such stem cells might
be grown. According to some estimates, at least 50,000 ``spare''
embryos currently sit frozen in liquid hydrogen in American
fertilization clinics, discarded by the couples who produced them.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has passed restrictions on the use of federal money to
finance research on human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a controversial opinion released earlier this year,
the solicitor general of the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) declared that the law prohibited only research on
embryos _ not on ``cell lines'' developed and grown from those
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Since such cell lines can never become human beings, they are
not covered by the congressional ban, the legal opinion held.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that, Harold Varmus, director of the National
Institutes of Health announced two weeks ago that NIH would not
provide money for scientists to develop stem cell cultures from
embryos _ but would finance research on cell lines that were
developed without federal support. Thus, if approached by a
scientist who already had established a line of stem cells and
destroyed the embryo from which they grew, NIH would feel free to
consider financing further research, Varmus said.
</P>
<P>
   The institutes are a part of HHS. Varmus announced the decision
to entertain requests for financing stem cell research during an
appearance before the National Commission on Bioethics, a panel
created by President Clinton following the cloning of Scotland's
sheep ``Dolly'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus said stem cell research needed a federal presence, else
the emerging science would be privately financed and therefore
largely unregulated. He said he was consulting with members of
Congress before approving research grants and he asked the
commission to give him its advice on the matter by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was assailed by organizations that worry about
manipulation of human reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doerflinger, associate director of the Secretariat for
Pro-Life Activities of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
noted that Congress went beyond merely banning research on human
fetuses, as the government's legal opinion suggested.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a rider attached to the HHS 1999 appropriations
bill prohibits federal financing of ``research in which a human
embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded or knowingly subjected
to risk of injury or death. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Doerflinger predicted that the HHS lawyers' narrow reading of
that phrase to allow research on cells that exist because of
destruction of embryos would not hold up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress are urging HHS to back down from this
position,'' Doerflinger added.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there are at least eight other areas of research
that could be used to produce therapeutic tissues without having to
destroy human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a recent hearing by the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee responsible for the budgets of the departments of
Education, Labor and Health and Human Services, Douglas Melton,
chairman of the department of molecular and cellular biology at
Harvard University, provided a personal example.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research now means that the ``exciting potential''
that undifferentiated human cells can be induced to develop into
pancreatic islet cells that produce insulin and have been
destroyed, probably by an autoimmune reaction of some kind, in
persons with Type 1 juvenile diabetes, Melton said.
</P>
<P>
   Such cells, genetically engineered to eliminate problems of
foreign tissue rejection, might be transplanted into the pancreas
of a diabetic, effectively curing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here this morning because my 7-year-old son, Sam, has had
Type 1 (or insulin-dependent) diabetes since he was six months
old,'' Melton told the subcommittee. ``I can't recall a night since
Sam was diagnosed when we slept peacefully, free of the worry that
the balance between his food, insulin and exercise was not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   To the University of Pennsylvania's Caplan, the solution to the
moral dilemma posed by stem cells and the thousands of abandoned,
frozen embryos from which they can be developed may lie in a
recognition that ``not all embryos are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless some effort is made to address head-on the moral and
social issues that embryo stem cell research raises, it is very
likely that further advances in this area will be slowed,'' Caplan
told the subcommittee. ``The value of embryonic stem cell research
is simply too great to permit a policy stance of inaction . . . .''

   He suggested moral and legal solutions could be constructed
around the question of an embryo's original purpose. While it would
be unethical, he said, to deliberately create an embryo for
research or even therapeutic purposes, decisions about use of
``spares'' at in vitro fertilization clinics might be easier, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems appropriate to ask why continued freezing is not just
as disrespectful,'' he said.

BARBARA WALTERS COULD BE SCOOPED BY SENATE   INTERVIEW WITH
LEWINSKY
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH and IMPEACH-MANAGERS) 
(DW) 
 By BILL CARTER    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision by the Senate's Republican majority to require
Monica S. Lewinsky to testify in President Clinton's impeachment
trial means that Barbara Walters of ABC News may have lost her
opportunity to be the first to present Ms. Lewinsky answering
questions on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Under procedures that it adopted on Thursday evening, the Senate
might decide to play a videotape of the deposition Ms. Lewinsky
gives to House prosecutors (assuming she is not required to take
the larger step of testifying in the Senate chamber). As a result,
Ms. Walters says she now presumes that by the time she does her
Lewinsky interview, the Senate videotape already will have been
shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Walters said: ``Would I rather the
videotape hadn't been played? Yes. But there will still be so much
more to talk about, things about her life and her emotions. That
won't be asked in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters had hoped to do the interview two months ago. But
Ms. Lewinsky remains bound to public silence about the case under
the immunity agreement she struck last year with Kenneth W. Starr,
the independent counsel. Unless she prevails in a court challenge
she has brought, she must remain silent until Starr frees her to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said that although she had not conducted any kind of
preliminary interview with Ms. Lewinsky, she had had several
conversations with her in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to tell her story,'' Ms. Walters said, ``not because
she wants to say good things or bad things about Bill Clinton, but
because she wants to restore her credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said, as she had before, that the agreement for an
interview with Ms. Lewinsky provided for no payment to her. But Ms.
Lewinsky subsequently agreed to an interview with Channel 4 in
England for an undisclosed fee and has also signed a book deal with
St. Martin's Press.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking money to pay her legal bills, Ms. Lewinsky has asked a
federal court to lift that part of her immunity agreement that has
prevented her from speaking about the case. But a hearing on that
motion has been postponed until after she testifies in the Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said, Starr conceivably could keep Ms. Lewinsky
silent until after Clinton leaves office in 2001, when he could
face criminal prosecution. ``I know Ken Starr didn't like people
calling him the sex police,'' Ms. Walters said. ``I don't think
he'll want people walling him the speech police.''

 &HT;    Santiago glad he chose football over hockey
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As color weather maps paint his hometown varying tones
of purple _ read: cold _ O.J. Santiago is being bathed in South
Florida sunshine and fame seldom afforded Canadians the week of the
single biggest day in sports. The Maple Leafs are in first place,
curling is in full swing, and on the cover of the tabloid Toronto
Sun is a picture of a Falcons player flapping his arms, with the
headline, ``Whitby's Super O.J. Santiago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, I was just hanging out with guys down
the block, and now I'm a big deal there,'' said Santiago, the
Falcons tight end by way of Whitby, Ontario, just outside of
Toronto. ``In most areas, people are thinking this is a big week;
it's the Super Bowl. But back home, people are thinking about O.J.
Santiago and the Atlanta Falcons. It's flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   It's another improbable story in an improbable season.
Notwithstanding the importation ofRueben Mayes and Mark Rypien,
Canada hasn't exactly been a feeder league for the NFL. Children
grow up playing hockey. Football ranks a notch above shoveling
snow. Young Otis Jason Santiago might have gravitated toward
hockey, but, he said, ``When I was getting into different sports,
my mom said the ice time was too early. You know, they put the
little guys out there at 5 o'clock in the morning. So I just skated
for fun and I played ball hockey (outdoors). I was the Wayne
Gretzky of church parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago's evolution should be familiar to Falcons fans by now.
He played mostly basketball and ran track until the 12th grade,
when the football coach at St. Michael's High School recruited the
6-foot-5 teenager. In his first scrimmage, he made two catches.
Somebody identifying himself as a scout from the Big Ten approached
Santiago after that to tell him he could play in the conference.
Didn't happen. After graduating from St. Michael's, the only
scholarship offers came from Kent, Western Michigan and Hawaii.
Santiago had expected to go to Wisconsin, but he said the school
expressed interest then backed off. Hawaii was tempting _ ``It was
a nice recruiting trip'' _ but the Rainbows wanted to turn him into
a defensive end. He chose the school known primarily because of the
shooting deaths of anti-war demonstrators in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago had a nice career at Kent, catching 62 passes in four
years, but he still had ``project'' stamped on his forehead when
the Falcons drafted him in the third round. He is a huge target (6
feet 7, 267 pounds), but his hands weren't quite as soft as Kellen
Winslow's. His progress was further retarded his rookie season by a
broken leg in Week 11.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago hasn't reached the stature of his counterpart, Shannon
Sharpe, but he's far from the youth who once put his shoulder pads
on backward at a summer tryout camp in Oshawa. He had 27 catches
and five touchdowns during the season and improved as a blocker,
but his numbers would have been greater if not for at least a
half-dozen dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   No game illustrated Santiago's ups and downs better than the NFC
Championship Game against Minnesota two weeks ago. In the second
quarter, he caught a pass from Chris Chandler, gained 13 yards,
then was stripped of the ball at the Falcons 33. The Vikings drove
to a field goal and a 17-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset at halftime,'' tight ends assistant coach Ed West
said. ``I told him he had to put the experience behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago rebounded nicely. The Falcons rallied to tie the game,
then Santiago's two receptions covering 41 yards keyed an overtime
drive that resulted in the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago could be key against a Denver defense that ranked only
26th against the pass and is considered soft in the middle. The
tight end relishes his chance Sunday _ and plays down his drops
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has drops,'' he said. ``If it was something unique
to receivers, I'd have a problem with it. It's part of the game.
What you work on is accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago already has made a bigger impact than anticipated. They
are doing the Dirty Bird in Whitby.

 &HT;    Elway finds Reeves' way best after all
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Dan Reeves thought Mike Shanahan and John Elway were
drawing up pass plays behind the coach's back. Reeves fired
Shanahan. Elway seethed. Funny thing, though. In those days, Elway
thought the way to win was by him throwing the ball. Now, the
Denver Broncos have won one Super Bowl and are favored to win
another, and Elway's arm has increasingly little to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Elway notes that his numbers are better in the four years since
Shanahan became the Broncos' coach than in 10 seasons under Reeves.
Elway threw 158 touchdown passes against 157 interceptions with
Reeves; he has 101 touchdowns against 49 interceptions the past
four seasons. But Shanahan said: ``One thing we don't care about is
numbers. John's very unselfish. The one thing is his mind is
finding a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And how have the Broncos won? By placing less of the load on
John Elway. By doing, in sum, what Reeves wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint then was that Reeves' offense insisted on building
a running game even when the Broncos lacked big-time backs. That
Reeves bled 1,000-yard seasons out of Sammy Winder and Bobby
Humphrey and Gaston Green was deemed testimony to his stubbornness.
Why was Elway always having to win games in the fourth quarter?
Because Dull Dan's game plan inevitably got the Broncos behind.
</P>
<P>
   But the inherent daring that made Elway the NFL's best comeback
quarterback rendered him a liability in the first three quarters.
He'd try too much too soon. He'd force passes, take risks, get
impatient. Reeves wanted Elway to be the main thrust but not a solo
act. For this, Reeves earned Elway's lasting resentment. In
hindsight, it's apparent that Elway's way wasn't the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Elway no longer drives the Broncos. Terrell Davis does. Elway
passed for 123 yards in last year's Super Bowl defeat of Green Bay.
It was the lowest total for a winning quarterback in the past 22
Super Bowls. Davis rushed for 157 yards and was chosen the game's
MVP. Against the Jets in the AFC Championship Game, Elway completed
only 13 of 34 passes. Davis gained 167 yards. The Broncos won.
Elway hasn't had a 300-yard postseason game since Jan. 9, 1994. The
Broncos lost that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make the big play the way I used to,'' Elway said,
``but I'm probably a better quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway missed most or all of five games this season. The Broncos
won them all. Bubby Brister, Elway's understudy, ended the year
with a higher quarterback rating than the imminent Hall of Famer.
The one time Davis was shackled, on Monday night against Miami,
Elway couldn't move the Broncos. He was 13 of 36 for 151 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Much is being made of Chris Chandler's statistically better
season. ``You can compare quarterback ratings,'' Elway said, ``but
the bottom line is winning football games.'' And Elway has played
in more winning regular-season games than any quarterback ever. But
it wasn't until Davis arrived that Elway won his precious Super
Bowl. Asked how much smarter the presence of Davis has made him,
Elway paused theatrically and said: ``I'm a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   In the background, you could almost hear Reeves saying,
``Exactly.''

 &HT;    Game will help offensive tackle Tony Jones take a break from
family concerns.
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ The telephone in Tony Jones' hotel room rang early
Friday, and for the first time all week his heart didn't pound. His
wife, Kammy, was across the room, seven months pregnant with twins.
His mother, Marlene, who faces surgery because of heart problems
caused by diabetes, sat on a sofa nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare day of solace for Jones, a starting tackle for the
Denver Broncos. He had just had his best night's sleep in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess now,'' Jones said, ``I can finally exhale.'' Despite a
second consecutive trip to the Super Bowl and his status as one of
the NFL's premier left tackles, Jones spent most of the 1998 season
hyperventilating. The arrival of his wife and mother on Thursday
afternoon was tantamount to placing a brown bag over his face.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones still enters Sunday's game against Atlanta with a
heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a cousin with whom Jones grew up in Royston was
killed in a one-car accident. Two months ago, an uncle from
Hartwell, whom he regarded as an older brother, died of an
apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound under circumstances Jones
referred to as ``very, very suspicious.'' His mother's health has
deteriorated so that it is a daily concern for the entire Jones
clan.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the constant fear Kammy will lose the twins _ a boy
and a girl _ that would expand their family beyond 3-year-old Tony
Jr. The pregnancy has been difficult, with Kammy ordered to
complete bed rest a month ago. She already has had nine
miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of having Tony Jr. is bittersweet, Tony and Kammy said,
by the realization he should be surrounded by a brood of brothers
and sisters. To lose the twins at this point, Kammy said, would be
devastating for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been so wonderful with all this, but it's the last time
we'll try,'' Kammy said. ``We just put our faith in the Lord and
trust he's going to let everything be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   They met when Tony was with the old Cleveland Browns. She was
the city girl and he was the country kid whose biggest thrills as a
teenager came from driving to the mall in Athens. There were no
trips to Atlanta until his freshman year at Western Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always too scared to go into the big city,'' Jones
said. ``Nobody knew how to drive those streets of Atlanta. We grew
up (accustomed) to dirt roads.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the two traffic lights in Royston, birthplace of baseball
Hall of Famer Ty Cobb. One of those signals is just a couple of
blocks from the street named for Tony Jones. The town has no
streets bearing Cobb's name.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' earliest memories of Sundays in Royston include church
services in the morning, a church luncheon in the afternoon and a
prayer meeting at night. That kind of faith has been a touchstone
in his life and a bedrock in times of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times I'd come home from practice and Kammy
would be waiting for me with that look on her face,'' Jones said
quietly on Thursday. ``She wouldn't have to say anything. I'd know
we had lost another baby. Every time the phone rang this week, I'd
jump up, then say a silent prayer it wasn't her calling with bad
news. Nobody can imagine how that feels. Just talking about it, I
worry I'll jinx us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when she's been pregnant, I've been afraid to even
go home. If something goes wrong, it will kill her. I worry all the
time about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kammy likewise frets about Tony wearing down emotionally and
mentally, and she has told him he needs a vacation. Three years
ago, Tony nearly died when his heart stopped beating during elbow
surgery, and Kammy admits she doesn't know what she would have done
if he had died. ``He is,'' she said, ``the most humble man I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Jones, scheduled for surgery after the twins arrive,
said, ``If he wasn't my son, I'd still think he was wonderful. That
he is my son and is such a good man _ it just makes you proud. He
hasn't forgotten his roots or his upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   For three hours on Sunday, the family will try to put aside
their travails and enjoy the game. Kammy and Marlene will be in the
stands, with a doctor close by. Tony will be on the field, his safe
haven and place of sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place I can put everything else out of my
mind,'' he said. ``Or at least push it to the back of mind. After
the game is over, I'll go back to worrying about everything else
and keep the faith it turns out OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so much trouble, you'd think we're due a little
sunshine, wouldn't you?''

 &HT;    Coaches burning the midnight oil
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There's a good reason why offensive coaches could be
spotted out in front of the team hotel well after midnight at times
this week.
</P>
<P>
   They were busy working late on the game plan, and from time to
time they needed to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive game plan was finished last week, although players
didn't get all of it until Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive game plan, however, was completed and installed in
increments, and Reeves' improved health led to late nights this
week. He had quadruple heart-bypass surgery on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work is done in Reeves' adjacent suites. ``It is
much easier for me this week to watch film late at night than it
was the week before,'' he said. ``I don't get as tired as I
normally have gotten so I am getting closer to being
back.''Practice report
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a low-key day for the Falcons, at least on the
practice field, where they worked out one hour and 45 minutes in
helmets, shorts and ``shells.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no contact in their final true practice of the week,
and starting left defensive end Lester Archambeau and fullback
Brian Kozlowski, who missed Monday's light practice with sprained
ankles, went through all of it and will start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's session at the University of Miami, the team had
an outdoor barbeque for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The team will hold a very brief walk-through at Pro Player
Stadium at 11:30 a.m. today
</P>
<P>
   Roster news
</P>
<P>
   Reeves confirmed Friday that cornerback Ronnie Bradford will
return to the starting lineup, replacing Michael Booker. Bradford
missed six starts in the regular season with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the lineup late in the season, Bradford
suffered a slight shoulder separation in the last regular-season
game Dec. 27 against Miami. He dressed but did not play in the
playoff game against San Francisco and played only at nickel safety
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford probably will continue playing nickel safety, replacing
strong safety William White in passing situations, while Booker
moves to the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Booker also could see some action at regular cornerback, and
Devin Bush might see some action at nickel safety. He also will
play on the kickoff and punting teams.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Randy Fuller will play the nickel cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   Missing out
</P>
<P>
   The four players named to the early inactive list Friday were
center/guard DaveWidell, for the 17th game in a row; cornerback
Darren Anderson; rookie safety Omar Brown; and rookie tight end Rod
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Wish you were here
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl left tackle Bob Whitfield is having the time of his
life this week. ``Don't ask me to explain Whitfield,'' offensive
line coach Art Shell said. ``I have no idea what's coming out of
his mouth this week.''
</P>
<P>
   And Whitfield's mother, Eartha, is having a great time, too. But
they can't help but think of Bob's older brother, Paris. He's in
the fifth year of a 26-years-to-life sentence in California State
Prison-Sacramento for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris was always looking for a shortcut,'' his mother said.
``I ask how I could have changed their upbringing. The anger just
kept building in Paris for some reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, 27, said last month that he tried to hang out with
his brother sometimes when they were kids and the local gang was
running the streets. But Paris, 30, would literally push him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from the boys; 'Bring it home to the 'hood,'
`` Whitfield said. ``I represent and uplift my neighborhood (in
Carson, Calif.) by being in the Super Bowl. The guys live
vicariously through my glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous nellies
</P>
<P>
   Weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett and wide receiver Tony
Martin are two of several players who will begin dealing with their
pre-game anxieties tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wake up Sunday morning, my stomach is all shot to
pieces,'' Bennett said. ``I have to take medication twice a day for
a nervous stomach, so on Sundays it's twice as bad. Sometimes, I
have to take IVs to replenish my fluids, or sometimes I have a bad
bout of diarrhea.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said, ``I won't sleep hardly at all (tonight), and Sunday
I won't eat other than maybe an apple, or a banana. That's why I'm
starving after games. Thankfully, I get my rest during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Get on with it
</P>
<P>
   The tone of things has changed dramatically as the week has worn
on, as evidenced by wide receiver Terance Mathis' state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been said. All I can do is change the words.
That the only thing I can do,'' he said. ``I can sound more proper,
I can use Ebonics, . . . but it's all going to mean the same, exact
thing. The thing is, about this time, you're bored.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks has had plenty of time to
review Denver running back Terrell Davis on videotape the last two
weeks. He can't help but marvel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell Davis didn't play much at Georgia,'' he said. ``That's
probably why (Davis' former coach at Georgia) Ray Goff is doing
talk radio back in Atlanta right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Cornelius Bennett, free safety Eugene Robinson, wide
receiver Tony Martin and Fuller are the only Falcons with Super
Bowl experience. Problem is, they're a combined 1-7. Bennett was
0-4 with Buffalo, Robinson 1-1 with Green Bay, Martin 0-1 with San
Diego and Fuller 0-1 with Pittsburgh. . . . Right tackle Ephraim
Salaam will be the only rookie to start for either team. . . . For
the only time this season, the Falcons will stay overnight after
the game, an NFL rule. They will have an invitation-only party
11:30 p.m.-3 a.m. under tents in the parking lot outside the team
hotel. . . . The Falcons sent a load of equipment back to Atlanta
on Friday night, mostly practice gear and video equipment used in
preparation.

 &HT;    SUPER BOWL NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The election for induction into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame takes place this morning and the candidate expected to
generate the most debate is former New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Because of well-documented drug problems and a troubling lack of
remorse, the vote on Taylor, who redefined the positon during his
13-year career, could be close. A player needs 80 percent of the
votes from 36 selectors, so it takes only eight negative votes to
keep a candidate from induction. Several of the New York-area
newspapers have done polls with the electors and the latest
indicated at least six votes against Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   It may aid the linebacker's cause that commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, during his ''State of the League'' address on Friday,
endorsed the induction of Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON THE HALL
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of Marv Levy feel the candidacy of the former
Buffalo coach could be damaged by remarks earlier this week from
Cornelius Bennett. The Atlanta linebacker, who played the first
nine seasons of his career with the Bills, noted that the team lost
all four Super Bowl appearances because it partied too much. . . .
Former Georgia Tech guard Billy Shaw, who played nine seasons in
Buffalo, is the nominee of the seniors committee for the Hall of
Fame. Asked about Shaw, longtime NFL writer Paul Zimmerman, who
covered the old AFL, noted: ''There were two outstanding offensive
linemen in the league, Ron Mix and Billy Shaw. Some of us
old-timers will really have to fight for him, because people don't
know who he is. But he was a better player even than Gene Upshaw.''
</P>
<P>
   SONNY BOY
</P>
<P>
   Fans seeking the autograph of Hall of Fame quarterback Sonny
Jurgensen in the lobby of the media hotel here might want to have
their lungs tested when they get home. The former Redskins star
kept puffing away on his trademark foot-long cigar as the fans
mobbed him. Showing incredible persistence, not to mention lung
capacity, one young man of about 12 years old held his breath as
Jurgensen took his time signing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   NO, THANKS
</P>
<P>
   The game is being played in his own back yard, but Miami
quarterback Dan Marino will not be at Pro Player Stadium on Sunday.
''I'll watch, but that's it,'' Marino said. ''I went to the game a
couple years ago in New Orleans and it bothered me. I felt like I
should have been playing. In some ways, I wish it was in another
city.''
</P>
<P>
   ON THE MARK
</P>
<P>
   Mike Riley, the recently-appointed head coach of the San Diego
Charger, said Friday he is talking with former NFL quarterback Mark
Rypien about joining the club for the '99 season. Rypien, of
course, signed a two-year contract with the Falcons last spring but
opted to sit out the year after son Andrew, 3, succumbed to a brain
tumor. Rypien will need some minor shoulder surgery if he returns,
agent Ken Staninger said on Friday, but he is interested in the
Chargers' overtures. Riley and general manager Bobby Beathard are
seeking an experienced backup to the petulant Ryan Leaf. In a rare
bit of candor, Riley said it is not a given that Leaf will open the
'99 season as the starter. ''He's going to have to earn it,'' Riley
said.

WOODWARD, EAPPENS SETTLE CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, two years of transcontinental fury ended
with a 20-line press release announcing that au pair Louise
Woodward would not get rich off the British tabloids that had long
trumpeted her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The legal settlement announced Friday, which says simply that
Woodward cannot profit from the death of eight-month-old Matthew
Eappen, is the conclusion Matthew's parents had sought all along: a
guarantee that the woman who killed their son two years ago would
not make money from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that the Eappens would have sat back and in a
few years Louise Woodward would be driving around in a Rolls-Royce
because she killed their baby,'' their attorney, Fredric L. Ellis,
said at a news conference outlining the broad outlines of the
largely-secret agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Sky TV in England Friday night, Woodward
said she was ``very happy'' about the settlement. ``This is the
best result for everyone. It brings the civil action to a close,
which is the best for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``I have no message for the Eappens,'' she said with a
sigh. ``I'm always asked that. I don't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Worked out among lawyers behind closed doors _ in sharp contrast
to the worldwide media circus that accompanied Woodward's criminal
trial _ the civil settlement acknowledges the legal reality facing
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The sole job of the federal jury that would have heard the
Eappens' wrongful death lawsuit was to award damages, money that
presumably would have come from any future sales of Woodward's
story and money she was already barred by the court from spending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public interest and opinion, the forces driving her
marketability, have shifted since Woodward left Massachusetts last
June amid the flashing blue lights of her State Police escort to
Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman from Elton, England, once held as an 18-year-old
victim of American justice run amok and toasted with champagne when
her murder conviction was reduced to involuntary manslaughter, is
now routinely dubbed ``Killer Nanny'' by British headline writers _
and viewed as an emblem of an English child care system in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When a 26-year Australian woman admitted last week in a London
courtroom that she had shaken the infant in her care to death, a
story in The Guardian sneered, ``Unlike Louise Woodward,
(defendant) Louise Sullivan was a real nanny.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline pleaded, ``We must do better than this. Another
Nanny Scandal. Another child dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, now 21 and a law student at South Bank University in
London, has insisted all along that she never intended to profit
from Matthew's killing -- even as her parents took $60,000 from a
London tabloid for an exclusive interview after her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's settlement transforms her public promises into a
legal contract crafted with the help of experts in international
law.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's British lawyer, Paul Barrow, Friday issued a
statement reiterating his client's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise had always maintained she had no intention to profit
from her story and Louise continued to maintain her innocence and
hopes that one day scientific evidence will establish this
conclusively,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's father, Gary, told the Press Association, an English
wire service, said the tragedy ``will never leave us. We can try.
We've been through _ and everybody involved in this has been
through _ an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, which were not fully detailed
because of a confidentiality agreement, any money Woodward gets
from selling her story must be turned over to UNICEF, the United
Nations children's charity chosen by her to receive the money.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodward violates the agreement, the Eappens can seek to
legally enforce it in England or Boston. Any money will then go to
the Chicago-based Mattie Eappen Foundation, the non-profit
organization the family has established to fund education,
prevention and victim support in cases of shaken baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF officials said Friday that they had not been consulted on
the agreement but would be happy to receive any donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned for the first time today,'' said Kim Clausen, a
spokesman for the UN agency. ``UNICEF has not been involved in any
way in these negotiations. But we welcome the fact that the parents
of Matthew Eappen and Louise Woodward desire that some good emerge
from that tragic event.''
</P>
<P>
   Several literary agents contacted Friday said a Woodward
tell-all would not necessarily generate a big advance because she
is no longer widely viewed as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Rees, a Boston literary agent, said that given the intense
media coverage of the trial and Woodward's uncertain status with
the public, ``There is no way of knowing what the value of her book
was going to be unless you knew what she was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woodward's story to fetch a serious price, Rees added, ``It
would have to tell the story behind the story that we knew _ and it
would have to put her in a sympathetic light.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement closes the chapter on two years of court
cases, both civil and criminal, which began with Woodward's arrest
for the Feb. 9, 1997 death of Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal case against her ended last June 17, when
Massachusetts' highest court upheld the decision by Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel to reduce Woodward's conviction
from second-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter. He then
sentenced her to time she already served awaiting trial _ 279 days.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, as Woodward flew home to England in a first-class
seat, the Eappens filed a wrongful-death suit against her in US
District Court, seeking both compensatory and punitive damages.
They also asked for, and received, an order blocking Woodward from
spending any money she might get from selling her story.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming she could not afford a lawyer and ignoring the
suit for months, Woodward finally filed a response last November,
after the Eappens had won by default and had asked the judge to
award them several million dollars. Attorneys representing the
insurance carrier of EF Education _ the parent company of EF Au
Pair, which placed Woodward with the Eappens just months before the
baby's death _ began to represent Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Their first move was to challenge the Eappens' right to seek
punitive as well as compensatory damages, claiming that Woodward's
conviction for involuntary manslaughter did not amount to
``willful, wanton and reckless conduct.'' US District Judge William
G. Young disagreed. The trial was originally scheduled to begin in
early January but was postponed as the ``complex and difficult''
settlement negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis would not say if any money changed hands in the
settlement, citing the confidentiality agreement. He acknowledged
that he had no evidence that Woodward planned to sell her story but
said it was possible that her parents could make some sort of deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyers had tried to block future deals by
Woodward's parents during settlement negotiations, but were
limited. ``This was not a suit against the parents,'' Ellis said.
``We have achieved as much as we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said they had tried to trace the $60,000 Woodward's
parents received from the Daily Mail but could not. He said there
was no money left in her defense fund, which once held $500,000.
Law enforcement authorities here and in Britain are investigating
claims that money from the fund may have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis urged the Legislature to pass a law that would prohibit
felons from profiting from their crimes. Massachusetts had such a
law until 1994, when it was repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A victim should not have to go through what the Eappens have
gone through,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, who prosecuted Woodward when he
was the Middlesex District Attorney, said he was ``relieved'' that
the settlement spared the Eappens another trial. ``There's never
anything to feel good about after the loss of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward still insists she did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always maintain that I never hurt Matthew and I never
killed Matthew,'' she told the BBC. ``And I will always do
everything I possibly can to state that again and again and
hopefully one day to prove it.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: OPEN1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday rejected, 43-57, a Democratic proposal to
conduct debate in open session in President Clinton's impeachment
trial. In rejecting the proposal, the Senate decided to continue to
employ the secrecy rules established during Andrew Johnson's
impeachment trial in 1868. Supporters said the debates should be
held in public view because the public has a right to know what
their senators are considering when debating the impeachment
charges. Opponents said keeping the Senate open could delay the
trial because senators may feel inclined to use the full 10 minutes
allotted to each senator if they know the public is watching.
Supporters said they would reintroduce the motion before each
debate. A ``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OPEN2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 41-58, a Democratic proposal to
conduct the Senate impeachment debates in public. In rejecting the
proposal for the second time in two days, the Senate decided to
continue to employ the secrecy rules established at Andrew
Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868. Supporters said the debates
should be held in public view because people have a right to know
what their senators are considering when debating the impeachment
charges. Opponents said keeping the debate open could delay the
trial because senators may feel inclined to use the full 10 minutes
allotted to each senator if they know the public is watching. A
``yes'' vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DISMISS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 44-56, a Democratic motion to
dismiss the impeachment charges against President Clinton. The
motion would have ended the trial. Supporters said it was useless
to continue the trial when it was obvious the prosecution would
never get the two-thirds votes needed to remove Clinton from
office. Opponents said the trial should not be short-circuited
until both sides have had the opportunity to present their case. A
``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: WITNESSES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 56-44, prosecution subpoenas
that would call former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal to be witnesses in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal were chosen because they
are alleged witnesses to six out of the seven
obstruction-of-justice charges against Clinton. Supporters said the
depositions are a fair process that should not be overlooked.
Opponents said witnesses will unnecessarily delay the trial. A
``yes'' vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 43-55, a Democratic proposal to
immediately close debate and vote on the impeachment charges
against President Clinton. Supporters said the trial needs to end
because it is clear that the prosecution will never get the
two-thirds votes needed to remove Clinton from office. Opponents
said the trial should not be short-circuited. A ``yes'' vote favors
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: GOP PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 55-44, a Republican plan that
includes videotaped depositions by Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan
and Sidney Blumenthal. Unless more witnesses are called, the plan
also calls for the impeachment trial to end by Feb. 12 with a vote
on the perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges. The plan
required a majority vote before witnesses could testify on the
Senate floor or videotaped testimony could be played before the
whole Senate. Supporters said the depositions need to be videotaped
so that senators can watch the testimony if a majority agree.
Opponents said public viewing of witnesses, such as the possibility
of Lewinsky talking about sex on the Senate floor, would turn the
impeachment process into a spectacle. A ``yes'' vote favors the
plan.

<P>
   A spate of initial offerings of closed-end municipal bond funds
is hitting the markets, and that may spell opportunity for
investors hungry for tax-free yields.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Eaton Vance issued nine closed-end muni funds with a
total of $615 million in assets. Six more such funds, with more
than $450 million in assets, are expected from Merrill Lynch in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds are not likely to be the real bargains, however.
While investors who buy a closed-end fund at the initial public
offering can often purchase the funds at net asset value, many
older funds are trading today at discounts to their net asset
values. That gives older national muni funds an average yield of
about 5.62 percent, which the new funds will not be able to match.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have downgraded some funds based on the likelihood that
they will not be able to maintain their dividends; older,
high-yielding bonds they hold are being called and then replaced
with newer, lower yielding ones. But the selloff has been overdone,
some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many funds that were trading at premiums to their net asset
values are now trading at a discount. Thomas J. Herzfeld, a
closed-end fund manager in Miami, thinks dividend cuts are already
factored into current prices, and then some. ``When a closed-end
fund of any type cuts their dividend, investors overreact and sell
it at too deep of a discount,'' he said. ``Over the next couple of
months, the discounts begin to contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds issue a set number of shares that trade like
those of ordinary companies. The price can be at a premium or a
discount to the net asset value. Many closed-end muni funds are
leveraged, borrowing at low short-term interest rates and investing
the proceeds in higher-yielding long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably a good time to buy munis in virtually any format.
Top quality long-term municipal securities usually yield about 85
percent of the yield on the current 30-year United States Treasury
bond. But on Jan. 22, long-term munis yielded 4.84 percent, or 95
percent of the 5.10 percent yield of the 30-year Treasury.
Unleveraged closed-end muni funds yielded 5.36 percent and
leveraged ones 5.72 percent, or 105.1 percent and 112.2 percent,
respectively, of the long bond, according to Kristoph J.
Rollenhagen, head of closed-end fund research at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Which funds look good now? Mr. Rollenhagen said conservative
investors should look at the Nuveen Select Tax Free Income
Portfolios 1, 2 and 3. The funds are not leveraged, but still boast
yields ranging from 5.71 percent to 5.75 percent. Each fund will
liquidate at its net asset value sometime between 2012 to 2017.
Portfolio 1 was trading at $15.75 on Jan. 22, a slim 0.5 percent
premium, to yield 5.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld, by contrast, likes some of the funds that have been
beaten up the most.  &UR; Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust &LR; , an
unleveraged fund that recently announced a dividend cut, closed at
$10.6875 on Jan. 22, a 7.1 percent discount to net assets; on Dec.
1, it was selling at a 1 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   At Salomon Smith Barney, Dennis P. Emanuel, a senior analyst of
United States closed-end funds, likes Nuveen Premium Income II. The
bonds in the fund, which is leveraged, are not at risk of being
called, so the dividend should be stable. On Jan. 22, the fund
traded at $16.50, 2.7 percent above its net asset value, to yield
5.70 percent.

CARRYING ECONOMICS INTO RELIGION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga. )   By   PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last 300 years, religion and economics have come to
constitute distinctly different spheres, talking two conceptually
different languages. They may address each other, as when Pope John
Paul II called again in Mexico City for solidarity with the
hemisphere's poor. But economists, however sympathetic to such
appeals, bristle when morals get mixed up with economic analysis.
Theologians turn very nervous when someone like William James
begins to talk about the ``cash value'' of religious beliefs, as if
the sacred could be given a price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Piping up from the religious side of the chasm, however, Jon P.
Gunnemann has recently proposed that the migration of economic
metaphors into religion and theology can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnemann, who teaches social ethics at Emory University, spent
last fall at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at
the Harvard Divinity School, and his argument appears in the latest
issue of the center's quarterly publication, Religion and Values in
Public Life.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Gunnemann notes that the Bible is full of
economic metaphors, in talk of redemption, debt and bond, and, of
course, in many of the parables of Jesus. ``We cannot help but
think economically,'' Gunnemann concludes. Moreover, such religious
use of economic concepts can have a beneficial feedback on economic
thinking, or so he maintains in an inventive look at the concept of
``capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, capital was one of the three elements of
production, along with natural resources and labor. Capital was the
translation of wealth into machinery, buildings or other equipment
that increased the efficiency with which labor could transform raw
materials into products. Capitalism was the system under which the
accumulator of such capital controlled production and had first
claims on rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnemann traces the recent expansion of the concept of capital
among economists. Environmental economists, for example, have come
to talk about ``natural capital'' in reference to fossil fuels,
soil, plants, animals and ecological systems generally. Then there
is the even more widespread notion of ``human capital,'' a term
employed in analysis of how investments in education and training
increase productivity. This has given rise to talk of ``social
capital'' or ``cultural capital,'' referring to all the social,
communal and moral resources that hold a society together and make
it productive.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings Gunnemann to ``religious capital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be argued that much of the modern economy depends on
religious capital,'' on everything from the psychological renewal
that churchgoers get from their weekly worship to the legitimation
that religious teachings may provide for private property or
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   This interjection of the language of economics into religion
would seemingly be of little reassurance to those who suspect that
such a process merely blesses the economic status quo. But
Gunnemann proceeds to an analysis of just how different human and
religious capital are from the customary kind.
</P>
<P>
   The goods that human capital traffics in consist primarily of
people themselves and the relationships among them, he says, and
therefore ``cannot be sold.'' At least some of those goods,
consisting of cooperative practices and virtues, are unlike many
other goods in the sense that their possession by some people does
not preclude their possession by others. One could say that
sanctity may be a rare good but not a scarce one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the difference between religious capital and the
customary sort is made most striking when Gunnemann observes that
one source of the former ``lies in the grace of forgiveness, the
free canceling of debt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without forgiveness and the rituals connected to it, religious
capital and human cooperation could not be sustained,'' he says.
Such abundance of grace ``provides the symbolic and actual
practices that build, repair and maintain human communities.''
</P>
<P>
   What generates religious capital? Well, a whole range of
practices and institutions, from hymn-singing to prayer and
meditation, the professor says; and ultimately, believers ``name
the source God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunnemann draws some practical conclusions from this analysis,
and most are critical of the way that economic capital has been
``living profligately off its natural and social inheritance, not
bothering to inquire about its own sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, ``the ownership of capital can never be absolute,'' he
says. ``At the very least there is a strong justification for
seeing productive capital as a trust and taxing it in order to
protect and mend natural and social capital.'' He believes his
analysis may even point ``toward a more egalitarian distribution of
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gunnemann, at this point, sounds very much like John Paul
II, some people may ask what was the point of his whole complicated
exercise. His answer is simply that ``the migration of the metaphor
of capital'' to the worlds of nature, culture and religion opens
economics to unexplored truths about itself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he takes comfort in a remark by John Kenneth
Galbraith that economics always has been 95 percent theology and 5
percent science anyway. Galbraith, of course, did not make that
remark with the intention of complimenting either economics or
theology.

SENATE SUBPOENAS SERVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate delivered subpoenas Friday for Monica S.
Lewinsky and two of President Clinton's closest allies, as a wary
White House braced for the possibility that Lewinsky's entry into
the impeachment trial could ultimately turn momentum against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who has never been seen publicly discussing her role
in Clinton's sex scandal, is to be questioned Monday in a private,
videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, the videotape could be shown as early as
next week on the Senate floor. Lewinsky also could be summoned to
testify in person, if a majority of senators approves.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Senate Democrats, expecting Lewinsky's
testimony to elicit sympathy for her if it becomes public,
privately expressed concern about the possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that some of the moderates and women in the Senate
will get nervous'' about opposing the impeachment charges, said a
senior Democratic aide in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sergeant-at-arms, James Ziglar, handed the subpoenas
to lawyers for Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Sidney
Blumenthal, two days after a Senate vote that continued the
impeachment trial but demonstrated a lack of support for removing
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Washington power broker who helped Lewinsky find a job
in New York while she was a witness in a sexual harassment case
against Clinton, is scheduled to give a deposition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a White House senior aide, is to be questioned
Wednesday about his previous testimony that Clinton described
Lewinsky as a stalker who made sexual advances on him.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewinsky, the deposition will mark the first time she is
questioned under oath by Clinton's lawyers after a year of scrutiny
by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and congressional
impeachment investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal defense team and House managers who are
presenting the impeachment case in the Senate each will have to up
to four hours to question the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's lawyers Friday were preparing questions
that were expected to avoid appearing hostile to Lewinsky, other
White House officials were blasting the Senate's GOP majority for
opening the door to the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attempt here by the Republican majority to play
out this process in a way that can inflict maximum political damage
on the president,'' said Joseph Lockhart, White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On strict party lines, the Senate approved a GOP plan Thursday
for the remainder of the trial that permits possible testimony on
the Senate floor by Lewinsky and the other two witnesses. The plan,
which tentatively calls for the trial to end Feb. 12, also allows
the House managers to seek subpoenas for additional witnesses. Both
the Senate Republican and Democratic leaders would have to agree to
permit more witnesses. The Senate approved the blueprint after
lengthy negotations and a flurry of final changes that were made in
the well of the chamber minutes before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the Senate was ``making up the rules literally on
the back of an envelope. I think that raises some issues about
whether that's fair to all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, chairman of the Senate
Republican Policy Committee, said the White House was acting
``paranoid, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely pleased with the way the Republican majority
has handled themselves during this trial and that we, in most
cases, have worked hard with our Democratic colleagues to achieve a
bipartisan approach in this,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders Friday also chose the members of each party to
preside over the depositions in lieu of judges. Republicans
selected Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio for Lewinsky's deposition,
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee for Jordan's questioning, and
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania for Blumenthal's session.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic senators were asked to take turns presiding at
each deposition: Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, John Edwards
of North Carolina, and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, who does not believe Clinton's actions warrant his removal
from office, reluctantly accepted the role. Predicting the
experience ``could be very awkward and difficult,'' Dodd said, ``I
was hoping somebody else would be asked and I wouldn't have to go
through this. I don't really need this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he feels ``sympathetic to this woman, Monica Lewinsky,
and now there's one grinder on this thing for her. It's bothersome
to me. I'm offended the Senate couldn't have found a better way to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he will ask Senate leaders to place a ``gag order'' on
all the senators presiding over the depositions unless or until the
material is made public.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who is expected to return to Washington this weekend
from Los Angeles, will give her deposition at the Renaissance
Mayflower Hotel, where Representative Ed Bryant of Tennessee will
ask questions for the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials said Lewinsky will be reimbursed the government
rate of $250 for her round-trip airfare from California and $126 a
night for her lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions of Jordan and Blumenthal will be taken in an
office at the Capitol normally used by the Senate Intelligence
Committee. Jordan will be questioned by Representative Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Blumenthal by Representative James F.
Rogan of California.

CLINTON WANTS $48 MILLION IN AID FOR N.E. FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is proposing a $48 million
program to help New England fishermen and communities that have
been hurt by restrictions on fishing, Massachusetts lawmakers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money is available under current law and some will
be included in Clinton's federal budget for fiscal year 2000, which
he is scheduled to unveil Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been working for years to rebuild groundfish
stocks in New England waters, using stringent harvesting
restrictions and other techniques. While these efforts have had
some success on Georges Bank, concern has risen recently over
scallop fishing and about collapsing cod stocks in the Gulf of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, managers of New England fisheries tentatively
backed a series of closures to cod fishing areas in the Gulf of
Maine. They also voted to cut the daily cod catch limit to a level
some fisherman said is too low for them to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward Kennedy has warned that the cod restrictions
could idle 700 boats and put 2,500 fishermen out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The president is proposing:
</P>
<P>
   --$25 million for job retraining and related assistance for
workers who lose their jobs as a result of the depressed fishing
industry in New England. The money is available under current law.
</P>
<P>
   --$5 million to assist Northeast communities with planning
grants, public works construction grants, and other economic
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   --$2 million this year and $5 million next year for fishery
management projects that employ both scientists and fishermen.
These might include surveys of the fishing stocks and development
of new management techniques.
</P>
<P>
   --$3 million this year and $8 million next year for vessel
buyout programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal follows an effort by at least five
Massachusetts lawmakers to win $100 million for the local fishing
industry. The lawmakers included Kennedy and Senator John Kerry,
and Representatives Barney Frank, John Tierney and William
Delahunt, all Massachusetts Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called Clinton's plan ``welcome news,'' but added,
``It's not everything we wanted, and we'll continue the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Kerry said he would continue to press
for money to give fishermen affordable health insurance, as well as
other assistance.

 &HT;    SEC suspends trading on 5 Georgia companies
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Securities and Exchange Commission, citing
``public interest and the protection of investors,'' suspended
trading Friday in the shares of five over-the-counter companies.
All have a common denominator _ a storefront in downtown Madison,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Citron, Electronic Transfer Associates, Invest Holdings Group,
Polus and Smartek _ all based in Colorado, Idaho or Texas _ have
issued press releases datelined London and New York, but with a
Madison phone number contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are curiosities involved,'' said Robert Terry,
Georgia's chief securities regulator. He said there is not enough
information available yet to determine what the Madison link is to
the companies, other than the common phone number.
</P>
<P>
   The number is for a business at 115 S. Main St., according to a
report earlier this week by MSNBC, which raised questions about
some of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Mayor Bruce Gilbert said the address is a storefront
that used to be the Armour five-and-dime store. He said the store
was sold to a Peter Tosto, whom MSNBC identified as being at ``the
center of the controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Madison number were referred to a New York office
Friday. Executives of the companies could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Citron said in a statement that the MSNBC report
and others were based on ``unsubstantiated allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Citron said it ``is cooperating with regulatory and enforcement
agencies regardign the allegations against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC announced it ordered the trading suspensions ``because
of questions raised as to the adequacy and accuracy of publicly
disseminated information'' about the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of several of the five companies had spiked higher this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Chion, an assistant director with the SEC's division of
enforcement, said the information cited in Friday's suspension
orders was in the companies' press releases.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Citron, identified itself in press releases as an
Internet marketing company. In one release, issued Jan. 5, the
company said it ``recently experienced an impressive response from
potential clients/affiliates requesting the company's products or
participation in the company's services.''
</P>
<P>
   In other announcements, Citron said it planned to offer
``discounted holidays, hotel accommodations and airfares over the
Internet through its affiliates early in 1999,'' and said it would
launch a new Web site design in February.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Chion would not comment on what if anything the agency
might do next.
</P>
<P>
   The trading suspensions are in force until noon, Feb. 11. But
the rule permitting the suspension ``prohibits traders from posting
quotes on the securities until they have determined there is
adequate information available to the public about those
securities,'' said John D. Heine, an SEC spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies are required to file reports with the SEC.
Some publicly traded companies are not subject to the filing
requirements because of their size or the amount of money they
raised when going public, Chion said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not comment on any potential links between the
companies. But two of the suspension orders connect some of the
companies. One order mentions both Invest Holdings Group and
Citron. Another names both Polus and Smartek.

CARTOONIST KEEPS FRENCH POLITICIANS ON THEIR TOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ More than one French chief of state has felt the
felt-tipped sting of Plantu, a cartoonist who is one of the most
powerful political institutions not found in the 1958 French
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Plantu got his nickname in the 1960s from teachers and friends
at the Lycee Henri IV in Paris who found his real name, Jean
Plantureux, too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know what trouble was until he went to work for Le
Monde in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later President Jacques Chirac has to put
up with seeing his pointy-headed caricature almost every day on the
newspaper's front page, usually with a drop of sweat _ or is it
spittle? _ flying off his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editors tell me he complains about that little drop, and I
don't always put it in,'' Plantu said. ``It symbolizes his peevish
side.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Plantu insists, he himself is impervious to
criticism. Philippe Seguin, a Gaullist conservative, confessed that
his wife once asked him to pluck his eyebrows after seeing his
bushy-browed, corpulent figure caricatured in a Plantu cartoon. But
the artist continues to have fun with his furry features, anyway,
and Seguin has some of the drawings on display in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Leotard, another conservative lampooned with Seguin in
one of Plantu's cartoons, didn't protest but asked for an
autographed copy of the original, which was published last summer
in L'Express, the weekly newsmagazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't belong to any political party,'' the blue-eyed,
somewhat baby-faced cartoonist said in his cartoon-cluttered office
in a back corridor of Le Monde's main office in the Latin Quarter,
on the Rue Claude Bernard. ``I've always felt close to the left.
But when I look at my drawings I think I've been harder on the left
than on the right, perhaps because I've always expected better of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never been to the United States, often a juicy target,
and makes less fun of President Clinton's features than of the
trouble that the president got himself into with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of other subjects that are more worth doing in
America than this,'' he said. ``I wish I could do more about
America and its role in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Plantu comes from a long political tradition that started with
Honore Daumier in the 19th century and continued in the 20th with
the Belgian creator of Tintin, Georges Remi, who signed himself
Herge. Plantu has a good chance of leaving a mark on the 21st
century, as well, because he will not reach his 48th birthday until
March.
</P>
<P>
   Where did he acquire his drawing talent? ``My father has a
talent for drawing, but he used it in industrial design for the
French National Railways,'' Plantu said. ``I had started medical
studies in the early 1970s. But I wasn't doing well. So at the age
of 20 I told my parents I was giving up medical school, going to
Brussels to take up cartooning and getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents survived the shock, and young Plantu and his wife
went off to Brussels, where he studied drawing at the Institut
St.-Luc, whose patron was Herge. ``Herge was a big influence on me,
as was Asterix,'' Plantu said, referring to the pun-filled French
comic-book series on the Gauls in Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   Still the artist as a young man had to eke out a living for a
while as an assistant locomotive engineer before his persistence in
dropping off political cartoons at Le Monde finally paid off in
1972, when editors hired him part time.
</P>
<P>
   The wit of his drawings and the mordant quality of the
explanatory quips that Plantu plants in the mouths of his subjects
finally persuaded the managing editor at the time, Andre Laurens,
to make Plantu a full member of the staff and give his cartoons
daily placement on the front page, to illuminate and explain the
main news of the day. Le Monde now relies on drawings for most of
its illustrations and employs four full-time artists.
</P>
<P>
   Because Le Monde publishes in the afternoon, Plantu's mornings
are hectic. ``They tell me what subject they'd like me to do at
8:30 or so, and I do a half-dozen or more sketches by 10,'' he
said. ``I have to wrap up at 10:45.''
</P>
<P>
   The day former President Francois Mitterrand's death was
announced in January 1996 at 10:30, Plantu recalled, ``the editor
told me I had 15 minutes.'' That one showed Gen. Charles de Gaulle
welcoming his successor at the pearly gates with, ``Happy New Year
for eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   More often, there's more bite. One memorable drawing last
August, after the collapse of the ruble in Russia, showed President
Clinton with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin, both in their
underpants and the Yeltsin caricature apparently having just been
stripped to his shorts by a herd of card sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``An intern?'' the Clinton character asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, a devaluation,'' replied the Yeltsin figure.
</P>
<P>
   So far no complaints from Moscow or Washington. But in 1991,
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, summoned Plantu to his
headquarters in the middle of the night in Tunis, where the
cartoonist had an exhibition of his work, to complain about the
thuggish character of his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him three times, and he told me he was prepared to
negotiate a peace plan with the Israelis,'' Plantu said.
</P>
<P>
   Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, met Plantu the next
year and sketched out for him the outlines of a peace plan 10
months before the secret talks resulted in an accord in September
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me to stick to cartoons and not try to be a
journalist,'' Plantu said. ``I came back here with the story, but
nobody would believe me.''

CHANDLER'S THE ONE THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For 10 years, Chris Chandler was a vagabond, pitching
camp in the most forlorn outposts of the National Football League,
barely noticed. Year after year, even as the skill level of all but
the top nine or 10 quarterbacks in the league diminished to a
pitiful level, no one would commit to Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mirer was anointed the Seattle quarterback. Todd Collins
was given the Buffalo job. Andre Ware and Bobby Hoying and Jeff
Blake and Danny Kanell and a whole legion of imposters pretended to
be NFL QBs, but Chris Chandler kept bouncing from bad team to
worse. A fill-in, second-string, a backup. Unknown and unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But in this, Chandler's 11th season, this Season of the Reborn
Quarterback, he experienced almost the ultimate slap. While
Buffalo's Doug Flutie was flattered, Minnesota's Randall Cunningham
was praised, and the Jets' Vinny Testaverde was idolized, all three
stepping out of the football graveyard to become stars, Chandler
was ignored until he no longer could be overlooked. And he had
absorbed as many slings and arrows as any of them, perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Chandler who is in the Super Bowl. It is Chandler, now
entrenched as the Atlanta Falcons' starter, who many say will be
the more accurate passer on the Pro Player Stadium grass Sunday.
And it is Chandler, a few radicals suggest, who will be better than
Denver's John Elway in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about a lot of things,'' replied Chandler when
asked about the Elway comparison, ``and that's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The discard of all NFL discards then gave more thought to the
comparisons with the sure Hall of Famer and said, ``That amuses me.
I think it's crazy to say something like that. I've been playing
pretty well, but to say I'm the better quarterback in the game . .
. I find it funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Chandler said, ``Sometimes I think about what's
happened and . . . wow . . . and it's been a strange trip for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that doesn't begin to describe a journey that has taken
him from Indianapolis to Tampa to Phoenix to Los Angeles to Houston
to _ finally, he hopes _ Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Greg Robinson, the Broncos' defensive coordinator, for
some detail on what Chandler was like when this bizarre odyssey
started. Robinson was coaching at UCLA then, and UCLA had a QB by
the name of Troy Aikman. Chandler was the QB at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very talented player then,'' said Robinson. ``He had
a big arm, he was smart, and he could move and he was very tough to
defend against in college. I know this guy and have a lot of
respect for him. He's got dimensions to him, he's got movement,
he's got an arm, and he's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   A budding career ready to blossom? So it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was drafted in 1988 by the Colts in the third round _
keep that last fact in mind as you follow Chandler's travels and
travails, because ``third round'' is key. Chandler, much to his
regret, would learn that supposedly savvy NFL coaches, general
managers, and personnel directors will give first-round choices all
benefits of all doubts; third-rounders get relatively few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to popular belief,'' Chandler said, ``just because a
guy is a first-round pick doesn't mean the guy's going to be a good
player. First-rounder or fifth-rounder, I think you need the front
office people to see if a guy is a good football player, regardless
of where the guy was drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   In his rookie season, Chandler and the Colts won nine games. But
Chandler blew out his knee in his second year. And at that instant,
his itinerary through the NFL wasteland was laid out for him. He
would be labeled as fragile, fragile as a teacup, and he would be
labeled as a backup. And NFL people, wise as they are made out to
be, don't like to remove labels once they're pasted on a player's
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Colts decided to draft Jeff George and dispose of
Chandler. They got a first-round draft choice from Tampa Bay for
him, but when Chandler arrived in Florida, he learned the
Buccaneers already had a quarterback _ none other than Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Life and football were abysmal for Chandler in Tampa, and he was
promptly shipped off to Phoenix in 1991. But the Cardinals wanted
Steve Beuerlein as their starter. Chandler would be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   On to the Rams, where he played a few games in 1994, but Los
Angeles already had its mind set on Chris Miller as its starter.
Chandler next moved to Houston in 1995 and played well for two
seasons. But the Oilers already were fantasizing about their
quarterback of the future, Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler?
</P>
<P>
   Backup of the future.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst of all these stops?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa,'' Chandler replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Could he elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler conceded, ``I wasn't very mature'' in Tampa when he
whined loudly about his status. ``I got along great with Vinny but
I didn't handle the situation well there. I thought I should have
been playing and I wasn't. I got upset. I said things to the media
that I shouldn't have said . . . just all kinds of stupid things
that I did. It was just that I wanted to play and (Testaverde)
wanted to play. It was just two years of not knowing why I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was close to quitting football then, but with the
Cardinals, he met Jerry Rhome, the quarterback coach, ``and Jerry
taught me how to play quarterback and how to read defenses. He
taught me things about the game that I didn't know that I thought I
knew. I thought I had all the answers and I didn't have any at all.
Jerry Rhome brought back my competitiveness at a time when I really
wasn't high on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after meeting Rhome, Chandler met Diane Brodie, a public
relations executive from San Diego and, not insignificantly, the
daughter of John Brodie, a superb quarterback for the San Francisco
49ers for 17 years. The effect of the two Brodies on Chandler's two
lives, personal and professional, was immense. Chandler married
Diane Brodie, and John Brodie devoted his football wisdom to
improving Chandler's quarterbacking skills.
</P>
<P>
   On the first meeting with his future father-in-law, Brodie took
Chandler to a field and put him through a series of passing drills
while various members of the Brodie family watched from the side.
Brodie pointed out some mechanical flaws in Chandler's setup and
delivery, and Chandler took the words of advice from the mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much, though, John Brodie and the other Brodies
instilled confidence in Chandler. ``John really helped out with the
lack of confidence I had in myself,'' said Chandler. ``JB really
made me feel like I was a top-notch quarterback. He had been
telling me that for two or three years. Maybe he just pounded that
into my head so much that I believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, along came Dan Reeves. The Atlanta coach, unlike
all the other brilliant football minds who had seen Chris Chandler
and read only ``backup'' on his resume, gave the QB a team to lead.
And Chandler has responded superbly, making the Pro Bowl the past
two seasons _ and now the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has put five stars on my shoulder and made me
the general,'' said Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bartkowski, the longtime Atlanta QB of a generation ago,
looks at what Chandler has done this season with that leadership
and says bluntly, ``Chris Chandler is the best quarterback in
football right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And that includes John Elway.

SHANAHAN SAYS SHARPE IS SHARP WITH USE OF WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe
has talked a lot this week. And that talk escalated Thursday when
he called Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan ``ugly,'' and told him
to, ``take the lipstick off _ and the heels and the wig _ and go
play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he didn't mind all
of the talking from Sharpe, because he usually backs up his mouth
with his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon Sharpe,'' Shanahan said, ``came up to me when we were
playing in Kansas City and he said, `Coach, I'm really convinced
with some of the talk that has been going on that I can draw two or
three personal fouls during the game because people won't be able
to keep their poise.' And he did. So you know sometimes guys,
Shannon Sharpe is a pretty sharp cookie and he can get under
people's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said the only problem he had with Sharpe when he first
came to the Broncos as head coach in 1995 was that he didn't think
his tight end worked hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't practice at the level that I thought he should, and
he missed some practices,'' Shanahan said. ``After we had a talk,
he has done everything that I have asked him to do. Now, if we
didn't have Shannon Sharpe, everybody in this room would be
complaining that there was nothing to write about or talk about. So
you \Rmedia\S should be thankful that we've got a guy like Shannon
Sharpe on our football team.''
PRACTICE WAGES
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said part of the reason for his team's success is the
club's off-season conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to pay players $60 a day for a workout and all of
a sudden, you add that up and that is $240 a week that they never
tell their wives about,'' Shanahan said, laughing. ``You think
these guys got all this money and all of a sudden they don't care
about $60? This is mad money that they don't have to claim, so that
is one of the reasons why we get them in the off-season workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have guys that won't make a commitment to work out, to
me it is hard for them to make a commitment to each other once the
season starts,'' he said. ``I think it's very important to see guys
around during the off-season.''
WAY TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Broncos kickoff returner Vaughn Hebron knows a good collision
when he feels one. When he was returning kickoffs for the
Philadelphia Eagles a few years ago, he got hit by Bill Bates of
the Cowboys. Hebron said he was a little woozy, but remembers that
he still had the wherewithal to say, ``Good hit, Mr. Bates.''
ANOTHER ONE
</P>
<P>
   Broncos defensive lineman Mike Lodish tomorrow will become the
only player in league history to appear in six Super Bowls. He was
in four with the Buffalo Bills, and this is his second one with the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose four \RSuper Bowls\S in a row takes the wind out of
your sails,'' said Lodish of his time in Buffalo. ``Winning? Well,
I don't have any children, but the feeling is probably like seeing
your son or daughter born.''
ANOTHER ONE II
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griese, the Broncos' rookie third-string quarterback, won
a national championship last season as a senior at the University
of Michigan. Now, he's on the verge of getting a Super Bowl ring
with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just perfect,'' Griese said.

US ECONOMY PRODUCES SURPRISE SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US economy shook off the world's financial woes and expanded
beyond all expectations in the final three months of 1998, while
inflation was 1 percent, its lowest rate since 1959, the government
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an incredible quarter,'' said Ezra Greenberg, senior
economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington. ``This economy
seems to have more momentum than even the most optimistic of us
have said.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth, coupled with low inflation, means that Americans
in 1999 should continue to bask in the country's longest-running
expansion _ now in its 94th month _ since the Vietnam War,
economists said. Although the pace of growth may slow this year,
the unemployment rate, now 4.3 percent, is expected to remain low,
as are inflation and interest rates, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card is the stock market, which is vulnerable to shocks
that could knock it from its current heights. The weak global
economy may also dent US growth. Economists noted that it failed to
do so in 1998 _ as evidenced by Friday's report, which will be
fine-tuned in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the October-December quarter, gross domestic product, the
broadest gauge of the US economy, grew at a remarkable 5.6 percent
annual rate, adjusted for inflation, the US Commerce Department
said. Due to a surprisingly strong fourth quarter, GDP growth for
all of 1998 _ 3.9 percent _ matched 1997 growth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive year of blockbuster growth, a
pattern not seen since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But a taming of inflation made 1998 particularly outstanding in
the recordbooks. Such strong growth typically tends to drive up
wages and prices by increasing the demand for workers and for goods
and services. Amid scorching expansion _ consumer spending on
durable goods was up 21.4 percent in the final quarter _ inflation
was a cool 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed a swift bounce back from a debilitating strike
at General Motors Corp. and an economy in which ebullient consumers
spent furiously and businesses boosted investment in new computers
and other productivity-boosting technologies, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 is the year that came in like a lion and went out like a
cheetah,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial
Group Inc. The economy grew 5.5 percent in the first three months
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest report in mind, the Federal Reserve Board has no
reason to reduce interest rates when it meets next week for a
periodic assessment of the economy, Perna said. On the other hand,
``Will they raise rates? I doubt it _ but they're thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has said repeatedly he does not like
the ``exuberance'' of US stocks, concerns unlikely to be eased
weeks after the Dow Jones industrial average moved closer to the
10,000 mark. On Thursday, Greenspan compared the sky-high price of
Internet stocks to a ``lottery.'' The Dow on Friday rose modestly,
ending at 9358.83, up 77.50 points.
</P>
<P>
   Strong consumer spending in 1998, fueled partly by expanding
investment portfolios, was directed at autos and housing.
``Consumers were ready and able to buy all the cars _ and they
did,'' said Lawrence Horwitz, managing director of Primark Decision
Economics. Purchases of furniture and appliances were also strong,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the $36 billion increase in spending by
consumers in the fourth quarter on durable goods were purchases of
motor vehicles from GM and other automakers, as well as car parts,
Horwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.4 percent increase in consumer spending in the final quarter
of the year compared with an already strong 4.1 percent the prior
quarter. Spending on durable goods shot up 21.4 percent in the
quarter, and spending on new houses and renovations rose 10.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although exports surged by 18.8 percent in the fourth quarter,
the increase for the entire year was only 1.5 percent due to a
gutting of orders to manufacturers reliant on troubled markets in
Asia and other parts of the world. In 1997, exports grew by 12.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another spur to US growth was low oil prices _ at the pump and
for home heating _ which was the equivalent of an
``across-the-board tax cut,'' said Alan Sinai, also of Primark. The
resulting rise in Americans' disposable income ``is the major
reason for the consumer spending _ it's bigger than the stock
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are also in a buying frenzy, increases purchases of
durable goods in the fourth quarter by 21 percent increase. It
followed a slight contraction in the prior quarter when exports
declined due to economic turmoil abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Business spending on computers and other technologies was
stronger: Information processing equipment jumped by 32 percent
last year, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said that even though the price index
surged by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, it rose a modest 0.6
percent all year. ``In 1998 we had the lowest inflation since 1964.
Should it be any surprise we had the fastest growth in 15 years?''
said David Resler, US economist for Nomura Securities in New York.

&HT;        SPECTER AGAIN TAKES CENTER STAGE IN HIGH PROFILE NATIONAL
LEGAL CASE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 -- Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was
tapped by Republicans Friday to oversee the questioning of White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal in President Clinton's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said Specter was one of the three Senators
they chose for a role in the deposition process because of his
legal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Specter was a natural choice,'' said John Lundy, a
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``Not only
was he chosen for his legal skills and talent, but we have relied
on his expertise throughout the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter is known for his cross-examination of Anita Hill in the
Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into whether she was sexually
harassed by Clarence Thomas, and for his work as assistant counsel
to the Warren commission. He also gained national recognition when
he helped block the appointment of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy said Specter won't be able to ask questions himself, but
will mediate and preside on behalf of Senate Republicans at the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Specter would not comment on his new role. He took and oath of
public silence about the trial after being sworn in as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans chose Ohio Sen. Mike DeWine to represent them for
Monica Lewinsky's deposition and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson for
Vernon Jordan's questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats selected Patrick Leahy of Vermont, John Edwards of
North Carolina, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut. However, they
have not yet been assigned to oversee questioning of a particular
witness.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition process could lead to videotaped or live
testimony on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, a Yale-educated attorney and former district attorney
of Philadelphia, has appeared on countless national television talk
shows touting the impeachment trial as the ``Trial of the
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Specter, didn't think Clinton should face charges
until after his term. But he became one of the Senate's most
outspoken members in favor of questioning witnesses -- a move the
White House vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sworn in as juror, Specter said witness testimony
was necessary because, unlike some of his colleagues, he thinks
there are facts ``in dispute'' in the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy said he wasn't sure whether Specter asked to be considered
for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, Specter was on everyone's short list,'' Lundy
said. ``He's the perfect choice.''

A CASE OF CHILD KILLER BECOMES PHILANTHROPIST

<P>
   BOSTON _ In the unprecedented handshake agreement forged to end
a bitter lawsuit, Deborah and Sunil Eappen may have extracted a
legally binding promise from their outcast au pair not to profit
from the death of their infant son Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   But Louise Woodward did not walk away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the final chapter of a two-year cross-Atlantic
saga that has been as much about public perception as
jurisprudence, Woodward gets another chance at redemption and image
reformation: from convicted child killer to proper philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to settle the Eappen's multimillion-dollar federal
wrongful-death suit against her by channeling any money from her
story to UNICEF, the international child-charity, Woodward gives up
control of the purse strings _ but not the public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks like Princess Di,'' said Tom Hoopes, a Boston lawyer
and former Middlesex County prosecutor. ``She can make as much
money as she wants, as long as she doles it out to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappen's lawyer, Fredric Ellis, said his clients were
willing to pay that price for a measure of peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than her in a few years driving around in a
Rolls-Royce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement comes amid a nationwide backlash against
criminals cashing in on their deeds, legal specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the US Supreme Court knocked down New York's ``Son of
Sam'' law, saying it violated free speech rights to automatically
bar criminals from telling their stories for pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, states have found a way to prevent convicts
from raking in the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court has upheld the
decision of a state judge to ban Katherine Ann Power, as a
condition of her probation, from making money off her crime: the
1970 killing of a police officer during a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis and other legal specialists said that the matter of
Sunil Eappen v. Louise Woodward may represent the first time
parties to a civil action have agreed on a non-profiteering
provision.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Eappens
last June was different from others. The Eappens said they were not
looking to be compensated for the death of eight-month-old Matthew
in February 1997, the result of Woodward handling him roughly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they said they wanted to prevent Woodward from a large
payday after her second-degree murder conviction was reduced to
manslaugher by Judge Hiller Zobel during tumultuous 1997 court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, legal specialists who call the deal a win-win for both
sides, wonder how it will be enforced _ particularly in light of a
clause that could allow Ellis' clients to seize any profits
Woodward might try to hide and donate them to the Mattie Eappen
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally an ocean between the plaintiff and
defendant,'' said Marc Perlin, associate dean of the Suffolk
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, who prosecuted Woodward as the
Middlesex District Attorney, Friday decried the legal
merry-go-round the Eappens had to ride before reaching a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To spare others, Reilly said he was supporting a reconstituted
version of the state's ``Son-of-Sam'' bill, filed by State Senator
Cheryl Jacques, D-Needham, that would let victims claim criminals'
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families and victims shouldn't have to go through what the
Eappens went through to prevent someone from profiting from their
actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's nothing stopping Woodward from clinching a movie
or book deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people look at her with mixed feelings,'' said Boston
literary agent Lane Zachary, who estimated such a tome might
attract a $200,000 advance.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on British TV Friday, Woodward would
not rule out writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't had the time to think about it,'' she said.
``I don't know. But I want to prove my innocence . . . it's a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And many believe Woodward would cast herself as the innocent
lead in this continuing compassion play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act four is `What story does she tell,' '' said Hoopes. ``You
kill a baby . . . and make a substantial amount of money and become
a princess by giving it away.''
</P>

ELWAY CAN FINISH AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ John Elway may be at the end Sunday when they blow the
final whistle in Super Bowl XXXIII, but for those who have played
with him, it's always the start they remember best.
</P>
<P>
   They never can forget the first pass he threw them, the first
time they saw a ball explode out of his hand and come in their
direction, the first time he took them to an improbable victory.
Even now, even at what most of the football world believes will be
the end of a 16-year career, they remember the beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first experience with John's arm strength was the first
minicamp I was in Denver,'' recalled Broncos wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey. ``I ran about a 60-yard route and started to slow down,
thinking there was no possible way that he was going to throw me
the ball. He overthrew me by 10 yards. I tried to accelerate and
get it, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on, I realized it's never too late to get the ball
from him. If it's in his hands, you still have a chance of catching
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Never too late to get a ball from John Elway. Not even Sunday,
on maybe the last day. Never too late for him to reach you one last
time.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the last time, Elway has steadfastly refused to
confirm it. But if the curtain does come down Sunday, it will be in
the right place. It will be at the apex of pro football, in the
Super Bowl, a game that haunted him for 15 years until he finally
won it last season on a day when he played not like John Elway but
like, well, a mortal.
</P>
<P>
   In his first Super Bowl, Elway was 22 of 37 for 304 yards and a
touchdown, and his team lost. In his second Super Bowl, Elway was
14 of 38 for 257 yards and a touchdown but threw three
interceptions, and his team lost. In his third Super Bowl, Elway
was 10 of 26 for 108 yards with two interceptions, and his team
lost. In his fourth Super Bowl, Elway was 12 of 22 for 123 yards
and an interception, and his team finally won. He had no more to do
with that victory than with all the other defeats _ less, really,
because the Bronco teams he led into those first three games would
never have gotten anywhere near the Super Bowl had he not been
throwing passes for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was this victory that came on the shoulders of running
back Terrell Davis rather than the shoulder of John Elway that
finally lifted him to the status his play should have long ago
earned him.
</P>
<P>
   That one victory, that one game of handoffs and staying out of
the way, convinced people of what 48,669 passing yards, 278
touchdown passes, 3,913 completions, and 45 fourth-quarter
comebacks could not. It convinced skeptics of something that had
long ago been proven to anyone with eyes to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``John belongs up there with the Namaths, Staubachs, Starrs,
Bradshaws, Youngs, Aikmans, all those guys,'' said Falcons coach
Dan Reeves, who coached him from his rookie year through 1994, a
string of 12 seasons of growth, success, and, finally, feuding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed a guy strictly had to win a Super Bowl to be
a great quarterback, but that seems to be the criteria that
everybody looks at,'' added Reeves, whose Falcons will try to stop
Elway Sunday. ``He did everything you could ask of a quarterback.
He was a great leader, a great competitor, a great scrambler. He
could make more plays. I can't tell you how many times I watched
him and said, `No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes!' He would just make so
many plays by natural football instincts, and that is what he got
by on a lot early in his career until he started seeing things
better and anticipating things.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was incredible that we could accomplish all the
things that we did by going to three Super Bowls, yet John was
supposedly `not a great quarterback because he never won the big
game.' I think you've got to be a great quarterback to get to the
third (Super Bowl). We won some awful close games then, and his
record was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you coach somebody as long as I coached John, you realize
what a great quarterback he was. Then, by winning last year, he
left in nobody's mind a question whether he was great.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who watched Elway the past 16 years, it is difficult
to fathom that such a debate was ever going on. But it was right up
until the final minutes of Super Bowl XXXII, right up until the
Broncos drove 49 yards late in the fourth quarter, a drive that
ended with Davis rushing for his third touchdown and a 31-24 lead
over defending champion Green Bay that held up for another 105
seconds, long enough to put an exclamation point on Elway's career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after much soul-searching, Elway came back this season,
declining to leave the stage at the top of his game, and the wisdom
of that has been loudly debated.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a storybook finish had he simply retired with
the Lombardi Trophy held over his head, walking into the sunset
like John Wayne. That is how everyone wants to go out in life, but
few get the opportunity. Elway had it but did not take it, perhaps
because storybooks are not often written about real people. So
Elway did what they all seem to do. He came back to challenge the
fates one last time, and as he has so many times, he won again.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   If Elway leaves Pro Player Stadium without another Lombardi
Trophy, did he win his gamble? Will he be free to leave the game or
locked in the trap of trying one last time and one last time and
one last time to chase another Super Bowl victory until someone
finally has to do what he cannot and force him off the stage?
</P>
<P>
   Whether he fully understands this box he has built for himself
is difficult to know. But one thing he does know is that if this is
not the end, it is not far away now. Not far away at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever want to stop playing,'' Elway said.
``All football players physically eventually run out of gas. But
ever since I've been alive, Saturdays or Sundays in the fall have
always been circled around a football game, so the question of the
unknown and how I'm going to react to it is definitely a scary
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be scarier still if things don't work out the way he
hopes Sunday and he decides to try again to win a second Super Bowl
at a time when he knows his skills have begun to fade and his team
is relying more and more not on him but on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a pretty prospect because if he chooses that route,
it will surely end badly for him, as it did for Joe Namath and
Johnny Unitas and Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana and so many of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be an easy choice for Elway to retire if he loses,
though, because he remains a competitor above all else and will not
like the idea of leaving without a hold on the trophy he chased for
so many years. But the man who has led more game-saving drives (47)
than any other NFL quarterback in history and has won more
regular-season starts (148) than any other NFL quarterback in
history and has passed for more than 3,000 yards in a season more
times than any other NFL quarterback in history (12) is not likely
to see things end that well if he presses on beyond Sunday. You get
one chance at greatness in life if you're lucky, and Elway has had
his.
</P>
<P>
   You also get one chance to exit gracefully, and he got that,
too, but chose to ignore it. So now Elway faces a new ending to a
storybook career, and unless something very special happens against
the Falcons, it will be more likely an ending written by Stephen
King than Walt Disney if he presses on.
</P>
<P>
   Elway understands this intellectually because in 16 years, he
has seen the careers of many great players end with torn ligaments
and tattered pride. He knows, as all athletes do, that this is the
way of things. Yet like all special athletes, he also knows he is
different than the rest. He is the chosen one, and so he pressed on
this season and reached the season's final game against long odds,
perhaps knowing that regardless of what happens, the toughest thing
he will ever face on a football field is the moment he must walk
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at myself as being in the same situation as
Michael Jordan,'' Elway said. ``Here's a guy that won six
championships and had been everything to the game of basketball.
There was nothing else to prove. I don't compare my situation with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be back in this situation. I thought about it
last year. I thought that it would always be nice to go out on top
as he did and be able to walk away from this game winning the Super
Bowl. That was one of the thoughts I entertained, but the thrill of
winning the game is really hard to walk away from. That's a
problem. So if we can get a win this year, I'll have the same
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can still play. I'm not the scrambler I was. I can't
run around and do those type of things that I used to do. But I
think mentally, I'm a lot better and I'm throwing probably better
than I ever have. I don't think I've lost any arm strength. I can't
make the big plays but I think I'm probably a better quarterback
because I don't make the mistakes I used to make. The ball goes out
of bounds more than it ever has, but I never cared about my
quarterback rating, anyway, because the bottom line is wins and
losses, and there are a lot of things you do as a quarterback that
hurt your quarterback rating. So I don't think the diminished
physical skills are big enough factors themselves to make me
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   If not that, if not your body crying out, ``Enough!'' what then?
What else can make you go when it is time? Perhaps only what Elway
has always sought. Perhaps only one final victory can make him
leave.
</P>
<P>
   That or a tiny voice whispering over the crowd, whispering not
about the start this time but only about the ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have this game be the best I ever had,'' Elway
said. ``It's why I came back. I'll never want to retire, but I know
it becomes tougher and tougher (to play). Definitely, my goal is to
go out a winner. That would be great. But the bottom line is my
heart is going to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, with 16 years in the NFL and a lifetime in football, John
Elway knows his heart will be talking to him regardless of the
outcome Sunday. It will talk to him about the end this time, not
the beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   If he listens, he will know Sunday is the last time he should
play professional football.

<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Army and police units clashed repeatedly
with roving bands of looters in the heart of this ravaged city
Friday, slowing the delivery of relief supplies to tens of
thousands of residents made homeless by Monday's devastating
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs, composed almost entirely of young men, struck early
and often until the authorities were able to restore order early
Friday afternoon through a show of force and numerous arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The looters' first target, at about 9:00 Friday morning, was the
main office of the Red Cross here, where hundreds of people had
been standing in line since dawn in hopes of receiving parcels that
included milk, rice, instant coffee, toilet paper and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just swooped in, making lots of noise and pushing
everyone aside,'' said Luz Janet Savogal Romero, who had walked
halfway across the city of some 225,000 people in desperate need of
supplies for the old people's home that she and her sister
supervise. ``They took so many buckets filled with food that I
worry there is not going to be enough for all who show up here
today, and that some people will have to go home empty-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, the confrontations escalated as the
looters became bolder and bolder. In the downtown area, the gangs
struck not only at groceries, supermarkets and warehouses, but also
at jewelry, hardware and furniture stores, scattering only when
army and police detachments arrived in trucks and armored personnel
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, a pattern had emerged, that of cat and mouse. A
group of 40 or 50 men would attack a grocery, for instance, making
off with 110-pound sacks of rice, beans, wheat or corn. When
soldiers and police arrived, they would immediately disperse and
reassemble a few blocks away, battering down the door of a second
store, looting at will until security forces arrived again, and
then either moving back to their original target or onto yet
another.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to drive looters away from the commercial heart of
the city, the heavily armed army and police units launched
canisters of tear gas at the gangs, some of which drifted in the
direction of the long lines at nearby food distribution points. In
the end, though, the authorities were able to quell the
disturbances around midday only by firing their machine guns into
the air and surrounding and arresting the most aggressive of the
looters.
</P>
<P>
   When one man ran down the street carrying a mattress on his
back, for instance, police chased him down and took him into
custody, striking him when he resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him go, let him go,'' a crowd of onlookers, some of them
looters wearing masks to protect themselves against the tear gas,
chanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible, terrible,'' said Aminta Acevedo, who was
trying to return to her home with her two small children after an
unsuccessful expedition in search of food, and was caught in the
lingering tear gas. ``Since the earthquake, you don't know from one
minute to the next what is going to happen. It has become hell
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But away from the downtown area, which is scarred by dozens of
collapsed and smashed buildings, relief efforts appeared finally to
be moving into high gear, after four days of confusion and
complaints. Relief teams began distributing plastic sheets to be
used for constructing tents, an item at the top of the list of
everyone made homeless by the quake, and large tanker trucks were
delivering drinking water to residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have definitely improved in the past 24 hours,'' said
Nelson Gallego, one of nearly a hundred people who stood patiently
in line, buckets in hand, behind a water truck in a devastated
neighborhood on the city's south side. ``We're finally beginning to
get what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Official figures put the number of dead in Monday's quake at
922, although rescue workers predicted that the final toll would be
much higher. The Red Cross said nearly 4,000 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials estimate that as many as 200,000 people in
the five provinces struck by the earthquake had their homes
destroyed or severely damaged, the majority of them in this city.
To aid those victims, they said, 150 tons of food, plus the plastic
sheeting, medicine and mattresses, were distributed throughout the
region Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gallego, head of a household of 11 that includes his mother
and three brothers, said he was concerned about the outbreaks of
lawlessness that began here on Wednesday afternoon. Relatives in
Medellin, he said, had loaded up a truck with supplies and were on
their way here on Thursday when they were stopped by gunmen on a
highway and robbed of everything they had, including the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Another man standing in the same line, expressing a view widely
held here, complained that the looting was slowing down the
recovery and reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for these vandals, the delivery of food and
supplies would be much better, because the troops wouldn't be
distracted by all of these disturbances,'' said William Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The looters also claimed to be victims of the earthquake,
shouting ``Food! Food!'' at reporters as they ran wild on the
streets. But Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, commander of the national
police, described them Friday afternoon as ``professional bandits
whom we have to capture,'' adding that many were outsiders who had
flocked here after the earthquake precisely to take advantage of a
chaotic situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to act drastically against these people,''
Serrano vowed during an interview with the Caracol radio network.
He said the Colombian army and the national police would soon begin
``joint actions,'' which he declined to describe further other than
to say they may ``cause some inconvenience'' for ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the security threat, the government announced Friday
night that it was sending 6,000 troops to Armenia to supplement the
2,000 to 3,000 who arrived earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The security forces' increased presence was already evident
Friday on the highways leading into Armenia. At newly established
military checkpoints, soldiers were stopping cars, searching their
trunks and asking drivers and passengers to state their business in
Armenia, turning back those whose answers were deemed
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   No fatalities were reported Friday in the clashes between the
army and looters. Overnight, however, one man was killed, local
police said, by one of the officially sanctioned neighborhood
vigilante forces that have sprung up in recent days as a response
to what one radio station Friday angrily described as ``the utter
impotence of public security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A small aftershock struck at about 1:15 a.m. Friday, sending
many residents of houses damaged but not destroyed by the quake out
into the street. As one frightened group ran for safety, they were
mistaken by a neighborhood self-defense team for looters, and one
of their number was shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least 150 people were arrested in Friday's
lawlessness, Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said Friday night,
including some convicted criminals who escaped from prisons during
the earthquake. Nevertheless, he warned, ``It is possible that
there will be additional incidents'' caused by ``undesirables who
have come here from Cali, Medellin and other cities to loot.''

WOODWARD, EAPPENS SETTLE CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, two years of transcontinental fury ended
with a 20-line press release announcing that au pair Louise
Woodward would not get rich off the British tabloids that had long
trumpeted her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The legal settlement announced Friday, which says simply that
Woodward cannot profit from the death of eight-month-old Matthew
Eappen, is the conclusion Matthew's parents had sought all along: a
guarantee that the woman who killed their son two years ago would
not make money from the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that the Eappens would have sat back and in a
few years Louise Woodward would be driving around in a Rolls-Royce
because she killed their baby,'' their attorney, Fredric L. Ellis,
said at a news conference outlining the broad outlines of the
largely-secret agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Sky TV in England Friday night, Woodward
said she was ``very happy'' about the settlement. ``This is the
best result for everyone. It brings the civil action to a close,
which is the best for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``I have no message for the Eappens,'' she said with a
sigh. ``I'm always asked that. I don't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Worked out among lawyers behind closed doors _ in sharp contrast
to the worldwide media circus that accompanied Woodward's criminal
trial _ the civil settlement acknowledges the legal reality facing
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The sole job of the federal jury that would have heard the
Eappens' wrongful death lawsuit was to award damages, money that
presumably would have come from any future sales of Woodward's
story and money she was already barred by the court from spending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public interest and opinion, the forces driving her
marketability, have shifted since Woodward left Massachusetts last
June amid the flashing blue lights of her State Police escort to
Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman from Elton, England, once held as an 18-year-old
victim of American justice run amok and toasted with champagne when
her murder conviction was reduced to involuntary manslaughter, is
now routinely dubbed ``Killer Nanny'' by British headline writers _
and viewed as an emblem of an English child care system in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When a 26-year Australian woman admitted last week in a London
courtroom that she had shaken the infant in her care to death, a
story in The Guardian sneered, ``Unlike Louise Woodward,
(defendant) Louise Sullivan was a real nanny.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline pleaded, ``We must do better than this. Another
Nanny Scandal. Another child dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, now 21 and a law student at South Bank University in
London, has insisted all along that she never intended to profit
from Matthew's killing -- even as her parents took $60,000 from a
London tabloid for an exclusive interview after her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's settlement transforms her public promises into a
legal contract crafted with the help of experts in international
law.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's British lawyer, Paul Barrow, Friday issued a
statement reiterating his client's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise had always maintained she had no intention to profit
from her story and Louise continued to maintain her innocence and
hopes that one day scientific evidence will establish this
conclusively,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's father, Gary, told the Press Association, an English
wire service, said the tragedy ``will never leave us. We can try.
We've been through _ and everybody involved in this has been
through _ an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, which were not fully detailed
because of a confidentiality agreement, any money Woodward gets
from selling her story must be turned over to UNICEF, the United
Nations children's charity chosen by her to receive the money.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodward violates the agreement, the Eappens can seek to
legally enforce it in England or Boston. Any money will then go to
the Chicago-based Mattie Eappen Foundation, the non-profit
organization the family has established to fund education,
prevention and victim support in cases of shaken baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF officials said Friday that they had not been consulted on
the agreement but would be happy to receive any donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned for the first time today,'' said Kim Clausen, a
spokesman for the UN agency. ``UNICEF has not been involved in any
way in these negotiations. But we welcome the fact that the parents
of Matthew Eappen and Louise Woodward desire that some good emerge
from that tragic event.''
</P>
<P>
   Several literary agents contacted Friday said a Woodward
tell-all would not necessarily generate a big advance because she
is no longer widely viewed as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Rees, a Boston literary agent, said that given the intense
media coverage of the trial and Woodward's uncertain status with
the public, ``There is no way of knowing what the value of her book
was going to be unless you knew what she was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woodward's story to fetch a serious price, Rees added, ``It
would have to tell the story behind the story that we knew _ and it
would have to put her in a sympathetic light.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's settlement closes the chapter on two years of court
cases, both civil and criminal, which began with Woodward's arrest
for the Feb. 9, 1997 death of Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal case against her ended last June 17, when
Massachusetts' highest court upheld the decision by Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel to reduce Woodward's conviction
from second-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter. He then
sentenced her to time she already served awaiting trial _ 279 days.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, as Woodward flew home to England in a first-class
seat, the Eappens filed a wrongful-death suit against her in US
District Court, seeking both compensatory and punitive damages.
They also asked for, and received, an order blocking Woodward from
spending any money she might get from selling her story.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming she could not afford a lawyer and ignoring the
suit for months, Woodward finally filed a response last November,
after the Eappens had won by default and had asked the judge to
award them several million dollars. Attorneys representing the
insurance carrier of EF Education _ the parent company of EF Au
Pair, which placed Woodward with the Eappens just months before the
baby's death _ began to represent Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Their first move was to challenge the Eappens' right to seek
punitive as well as compensatory damages, claiming that Woodward's
conviction for involuntary manslaughter did not amount to
``willful, wanton and reckless conduct.'' US District Judge William
G. Young disagreed. The trial was originally scheduled to begin in
early January but was postponed as the ``complex and difficult''
settlement negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis would not say if any money changed hands in the
settlement, citing the confidentiality agreement. He acknowledged
that he had no evidence that Woodward planned to sell her story but
said it was possible that her parents could make some sort of deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' lawyers had tried to block future deals by
Woodward's parents during settlement negotiations, but were
limited. ``This was not a suit against the parents,'' Ellis said.
``We have achieved as much as we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said they had tried to trace the $60,000 Woodward's
parents received from the Daily Mail but could not. He said there
was no money left in her defense fund, which once held $500,000.
Law enforcement authorities here and in Britain are investigating
claims that money from the fund may have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis urged the Legislature to pass a law that would prohibit
felons from profiting from their crimes. Massachusetts had such a
law until 1994, when it was repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A victim should not have to go through what the Eappens have
gone through,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, who prosecuted Woodward when he
was the Middlesex District Attorney, said he was ``relieved'' that
the settlement spared the Eappens another trial. ``There's never
anything to feel good about after the loss of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward still insists she did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always maintain that I never hurt Matthew and I never
killed Matthew,'' she told the BBC. ``And I will always do
everything I possibly can to state that again and again and
hopefully one day to prove it.''
</P>

BENNETT SIMPLY GLAD TO BE BACK AFTER JAIL TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Atlanta Falcons linebacker Cornelius Bennett says
this trip to the Super Bowl means more to him than his four
previous trips, it's not because his other Super Bowl visits with
the Buffalo Bills ended in losses.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not only because he never thought he'd get another
chance at a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is thankful because at this time last year there were
questions about whether he would play again. He had pleaded guilty
to sexual assault and was awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett spent 36 days in jail. Meanwhile, the Falcons drafted
linebacker Keith Brooking in the first round, potentially to take
Bennett's place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett, who regained his starting spot and was the
Falcons' leading tackler this season, is here and very thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have so much happen to me in one year's time, to come from
where I come from and turn my life over to the Lord, putting my
faith and trust in him, to go from being on the bubble to starting
and having a fine season and now being back at the Super Bowl, is
the best feeling in the world,'' Bennett said.
ANDERSEN CAME A LONG WAY
</P>
<P>
   Falcons kicker Morten Andersen is regarded as one of the best
kickers in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   He holds seven NFL records, including most field goals of 50
yards or more (35), most game-winning kicks (36), most Pro Bowls by
a kicker (7) and most 100-point seasons (12).
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose career started as a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen came to the United States as an exchange student from
Denmark and happened to go a football practice with his host family
in Indianapolis to pick up their son. The rest is history. Anderson
earned a scholarship to Michigan State and has played 17 seasons in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has not forgotten his hosts, Dale and Lois Baker. He
has invited them to share the Super Bowl experience with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing them in because they deserve to be a part of
this,'' Andersen said. ``I'm also bringing in a lady from Michigan
who took care of me while I was in college. I want to remember
people that were good to me when I was living on $150 per month and
barely spoke English. It's payback time. That's how I feel.''
NOT ALL FALCONS HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Falcons safety Devin Bush's trip back to his hometown has been
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting ready to play in the biggest game of his
life, he is depressed and anticipating playing for another team
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The best season in Falcons history has been one of the toughest
for Bush, who lost his starting job before the season to Eugene
Robinson and now won't be used in the nickel packages at the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who played nickel safety all season, missed the NFC
Championship Game against the Minnesota Vikings because of an
injury he suffered in the divisional playoff game against the
49ers. He has been replaced by Ronnie Bradford for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing surprises me,'' said Bush, who starred in high school
at Hialeah Lakes and went to Florida State before becoming a
first-round pick of the Falcons in 1995. ``I don't know if this is
a signal. I just want other teams to watch film of last year so
they can see I'm a good player. I can be a great player.''

SENATE REPUBLICANS FIND THE HOUSE TRIAL MANAGERS UNGRATEFUL
GUESTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans say they have given Rep. Henry
Hyde just about everything he could ask for: an impeachment trial,
depositions from witnesses, even the possibility that Monica
Lewinsky may be summoned in person, or on videotape, to testify on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   And they have done so, they say, at great risk to the comity and
dignity that define their august institution. So what do they get
in return? A heap of abuse, in their view.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican managers who serve as prosecutors in the Senate
trial of President Clinton, who are led by Hyde, may be heroes to
their Republican colleagues in the House of Representative, but to
many in the Senate, they have become 13 angry men.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate Republicans asked Hyde this week, for example,
to pare his witness list to what he called ``a pitiful three,'' the
Illinois Republican said of his overseers, ``I'm glad those people
weren't at Valley Forge or the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers sounded just as grumpy on Friday about the
ground rules for depositions the Senate adopted Thursday night,
even though their Senate brethren trumpeted them as a hard-fought
victory for the managers' right to make their best case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are awkward and are another difficulty created by
the Senate for our presentation,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon,
R-Utah. ``The Senate is conveying the idea they are a superior
body. I'm offended that senators hold themselves wiser or better
than those of us from the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, led by the white-maned Hyde, are true
believers, men on a mission, and to friends and foes alike, they
just cannot be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they've been frustrated, some more than others,
with the format they've had to operate under,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican whose brother, Asa, a House
manager, has bit his tongue more than once to check his irritation
with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asa would like to have this over as much as anyone,''
Hutchinson said, ``but he has that trial lawyer's push. He wants to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans wonder if the House managers are not
acting just a bit like ingrates, given the holes in their
circumstantial case that might have been plugged by live witnesses
the House Judiciary Committee decided not to call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of time for discovery in the fall,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ``Maybe they thought their case was stronger
than it actually was.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem lies in institutional differences. The House
and Senate chambers are on opposite sides of the Capitol, but they
might as well be on different planets, given the baffled reactions
of many House managers to the arcane ways of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors complain that they have been left in the dark as
Senate Democrats and Republicans negotiate important details of
their proceedings, like what the order of the depositions will be,
how long they will last and what questions can be asked. The
frustration is especially acute with junior House managers who have
dealt less with the proudly deliberative Senate. Many are now
resigned to this weird dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from the House,'' said Rep. James Rogan of California,
who will interview Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, on
Wednesday. ``We just show up with our briefcases and announce,
`Ready to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is differing expectations. Hyde and the House
managers would prefer a bipartisan outcome, but they say the
pursuit of truth and duty is their ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   If only Senate Republicans would show some spine and not worry
so much about civility, the managers say privately, the prosecutors
could try the case  &UR; their &LR;  way and persuade all of America that
Bill Clinton really should be kicked out of office.
</P>
<P>
   That was Rep. Bill McCollum's double-barreled message to
senators this week when he criticized them for abridging the
witness list. ``We still do believe that 10 or 12 witnesses are
what we should have and should have been permitted to call to prove
our case,'' he said, demanding that senators allow flesh-and-blood
testimony. ``In real criminal trials,'' the Florida Republican
said, ``the witness is normally live.''
</P>
<P>
   But as many others have tried to remind them, this is not a
criminal trial; it is a political-criminal hybrid subject to the
caprices of public-opinion polls and impending elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has tried
to balance the public clamor for a speedy trial with the outraged
calls from his party's conservative base _ and their flag-bearers
in the Senate _ to let the House be the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott and his caucus know they do not have the 67 votes
needed to convict and remove Clinton. A prolonged trial probably
hurts Republicans more than Democrats, they fear. ``We need to give
the House managers maximum flexibility,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, a
Colorado Republican, ``but we don't want them to wander way off.''
</P>
<P>
   So the managers march on. In new dark suits, they argued more
thoughtfully and effectively on the Senate floor than their critics
ever expected. They continue to push their cause, on the talk-show
circuit and now in preparing for the depositions, even as they
perceive the Senate is hemming them in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crusade that is taking a steep personal toll, their
friends say. Asa Hutchinson, a witty, engaging man, does not smile
much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a spellbinding story
teller, sounds more strident these days. ``This is what his life
has boiled down to,'' Rep. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina
Republican, said of his friend, Graham. ``He told me last week,
`I'm ready to get a real life back.'''

PANIC EMERGES IN BRAZIL AS CURRENCY CONTINUES TO PLUNGE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Signs of alarm deepened across Brazil
on Friday, as former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
warned that Brazilian leaders appeared to be underestimating their
nation's financial crisis, and legislative employees lined up to
empty their bank accounts on rumors the government would freeze
personal savings,
</P>
<P>
   The national currency, the real, tumbled well past the
psychological barrier of 2 to the dollar. The currency, which lost
only 7.5 percent of its value last year, has plummeted 43 percent
in less than three weeks, after the government abandoned its policy
of defending the real's value by purchasing it with dollars in the
foreign-exchange market. That policy was costing Brazil billions of
dollars it could not afford to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The traumatic loss of value in the real has become the latest
symbol of a global financial crisis that began in Thailand 19
months ago and spread to East Asia, Russia and now, Latin America.
The currency plunge has threatened to return Brazil to an era of
hyper-inflation and economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly desperate attempt to stabilize the real by
making it more attractive to investors, the government raised
interest rates for the second time this week, to 37 percent from
32.5 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The currency's decline has helped the stock market. With many
Brazilian stocks now viewed as bargains, the Sao Paulo Bovespa
index rose 2.3 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation flew wildly that the government would announce a
bank holiday Monday, when it would unveil a new austerity program,
introduce controls on the movement of capital and perhaps seize
bank accounts. The rumors led congressional employees to crowd bank
branches at the Congress in Brasilia, the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are desperate, feeling that they won't be able to take
out their money,'' said one bank employee, who spoke by phone from
Brasilia on condition of anonymity. ``It's generating a tumult like
I've never seen.'' The employee said the bank started filling up at
2 p.m. and that by 6 p.m. the branch had sent for its third refill
of cash. No substantial runs on accounts were reported in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in an effort to counter the
rumors and skepticism about the country's ability to pay its debts,
promised Brazilians he would not unilaterally confiscate bank
accounts, as former President Fernando Collor de Mello did shortly
after taking office nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Collor barred the access of Brazilian businesses and
private citizens to all but a few hundred dollars of their bank
accounts and investment funds from one day to the next, as a shock
method of improving the country's financial position and stemming
inflation. People who had agreed to buy houses or cars, or to take
trips, had to cancel their plans. Unable to pay their bills, some
committed suicide. Brazilians only regained access to their money
in installments beginning in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Cardoso attempted to dispel fears of a rerun. ``There
will be no bank holiday, and no plan is being elaborated,'' Cardoso
said at a ceremony in Sao Paulo. ``I am not the kind of man who
does confiscations, who closes accounts all of a sudden. It would
be a betrayal of the Brazilian people, of my past, of the millions
of votes I received.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the sense of disconnect between the government and
reality is growing here. Investors inside and outside Brazil are
wondering when the government will take decisive measures to
restore confidence, while senior officials attempt to ward off
panic by promising there will be no changes. Friday night, Cardoso
and Finance Minister Pedro Malan both called for ``serenity'' on
the part of Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dollar will go to where it wants,'' Cardoso told reporters
in Sao Paulo on Friday. ``It will come back. This is speculation.
We're not going to be nervous because of speculation.'' While not
ruling out further spending cuts, Cardoso said Brazil would wait
for the Brazilian currency to find its ``normal bed, so that the
real will appreciate again.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk like that worried Volcker, who joined government officials
for a panel on Brazil's economic outlook at the Rio de Janeiro
Industrial Federation on Friday. ``How long can this turbulence
last, unassisted?'' Volcker asked the room full of businessmen.
``Forever, and it's getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that once Brazil showed how it would deliver what
investors see as essential _ further cutting spending, averting
hyperinflation, lowering interest rates and shrinking an 8 percent
budget deficit _ the currency would stop falling.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't wait for things to stabilize by themselves,'' he
said. ``That's why it's important for the political system and for
people to understand what's at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly gnawing concern is the government's failure to
explain how it will find $50 billion to service its foreign debt
this year, and refinance the lion's share of 320 billion reals in
domestic debt. At the same time, a looming recession that could
shrink Brazil's economy by 7 percent this year makes the government
shrink from further belt-tightening now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a strategy for doing nothing,'' said Walter
Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, a Greenwich,
Conn.-based firm that trades in Latin American government
securities. ``They feel time is on their side, but the reserves are
leaving each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Molano said that at the current rate of about $520 million a day
leaving the country, Brazil's foreign reserves would dwindle to
nothing within two months. ``Once these reserves go out, they're
going to lose all their ability to control the situation,'' he
said.

DOLE ONLY CONSIDERING BUYING LEWINSKY'S FORMER APARTMENT, AIDES
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Maybe Elizabeth Dole is staking out space for a
campaign office. Or perhaps Bob Dole is pining for a little elbow
room in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Or possibly the Doles just want to make sure they don't have
another next-door neighbor who attracts those pesky reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, the Doles are looking at the apartment
that Monica Lewinsky lived in recently.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to unattributed reports this week in The New York Times
and Chicago Tribune, an aide to Bob Dole said the Washington power
couple has not yet moved to purchase the condominium next to theirs
at the Watergate complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went over and looked at it,'' said Douglas MacKinnon, an
aide to the former U.S. senator from Kansas and one-time Republican
presidential nominee. ``But they're not buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. MacKinnon said the couple was considering whether to
buy the apartment as a way to expand their own place.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole moved into the Watergate late in 1972, just months
after the famed burglary of the Democratic National Committee that
eventually led to Richard Nixon's resignation. Elizabeth Dole
joined him there when the couple married in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis, eventually rented the
apartment next door. Lewinsky has since departed for her native Los
Angeles and her mother has gone to live with a new husband in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Barnhard, a real estate broker who has had an office at the
Watergate, said both apartments fall at the low end of condominiums
at the complex. Each is a two-bedroom townhouse of about 1,800
square feet facing north toward a fire lane.
</P>
<P>
   While some units at the Watergate fetch $600,000, she estimated
the former Lewinsky domicile would cost $250,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Doles could get a better bargain in the former senator's
hometown of Russell, Kan. A 2,000-square-foot, five-bedroom,
three-fireplace home there with an in-ground pool recently sold for
about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prices,'' said Russell real estate broker Nadene Albrecht,
``are more reasonable.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ was being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Ed O'Connor, a vice president for A.O. Smith, said he remains
convinced that the problem is very small _ less than one-tenth of 1
percent of the water heaters made during 1993-1996. Those who are
affected are being taken care of, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have acted responsibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some consumers say additional publicity by the water
heater companies would have saved them a lot of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Fink of Overland Park, Kan., had a dip tube replaced on
an A.O. Smith water heater last fall. She wasn't aware of the
defect and paid more than $200 for the repair. It wasn't until this
month, after finding out about the problem with the dip tubes, that
she called A.O. Smith and was told to send the company the repair
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't right,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Sutton of Stanley, Kan., had for months been noticing
plastic chips and a lack of hot water. She figured any repairs
would be expensive and decided to live with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then she read about the defective dip tubes and called American
Water Heater Group, the company that made her water heater. The
company paid for a new water heater and installation.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, Sutton enjoyed a luxury she hadn't had for months:
a full tub of hot water without any plastic chips floating on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' she said.

CYBERSALES MAY CHOKE OFF GROWTH IN TAX REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The tripling of Internet holiday shopping volume in
1998 compared with 1997 put states and municipalities on serious
notice that sales taxes are likely to become an increasingly iffy
future revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   First it was catalog-sales shopping, which has become a $48
billion-a-year business. Now shoppers are discovering the joy of
Internet commerce, which generated nearly $8 billion in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though sales taxes will dry up. Rather, the more
realistic prospect is that sales tax growth may hit a wall in the
not-too-distant future as home shopping by Internet becomes more
popular. This is a growing concern for state and local officials,
and their worries are more than justified.
</P>
<P>
   They want laws that will do a better job of enforcing sales tax
collections from at-home shoppers. A key ally in any such campaign
to enforce greater sales-tax compliance will be local business
operators and their lobbying organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's passage of the Internet Tax Freedom Act imposed a
three-year moratorium on new Internet sales taxes, which The Wall
Street Journal recently said ``effectively inaugurated a tax-free
Internet shopping spree.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, however, also mandated formation of an advisory
panel to forge a tax policy agreeable to all those with a stake in
the issue. Some state officials, however, have since complained
that the group is overweighted with Internet interests.
</P>
<P>
   A key sticking point since catalog operators began proliferating
as a major retailing force has been the practice of requiring
buyers to pay sales taxes but failing to require sellers to collect
such taxes unless the company has a physical presence in the state
where the sale occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if state and local officials are successful in expanding
their legal reach in the quest for sales tax collections, however,
getting their way will be an arduous process. This is because
translating expanded collection authority into real tax receipts
will be as challenging as changing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Friedman, the Nobel-laureate conservative economist,
predicts the Internet will become a major force in restraining
government growth by making tax collection much more difficult. If
so, sales tax revenue will become particularly vulnerable in this
regard. Even the most draconian laws will be difficult to enforce
if consumers opt against voluntary compliance. The sheer mass of
individual retail transactions may overwhelm the capability of
revenue officials to track the activity.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, this will force government officials to rethink
the traditional tax policy wisdom that has ruled for most of the
postwar era. This logic dictates that even though sales taxes are
horrendously regressive, they are popular because they're paid in
small, relatively painless increments.
</P>
<P>
   If governments are forced to look more to property and income
taxes to maintain revenue growth, it will be politically more
difficult because these taxes are paid in larger chunks. The
greater psychological effect creates a more dramatic reminder of
the size of the taxpayer's burden.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting political constraints may also, as Friedman
predicts, become revenue constraints.

FALCONS SAY THEY WILL CONTAIN ELWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With San Francisco quarterback Steve Young in their
division, the Atlanta Falcons are used to playing mobile
quarterbacks. They respect the ability of Denver quarterback John
Elway, but they say they are confident they can keep him from
making game-changing plays on the perimeter of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the toughest things to stop is when a
quarterback is scrambling and you only have four guys rushing,''
said Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith, who led the team with 8.5
sacks and 36 quarterback pressures in the regular season. ``John
has always been a great runner. But we have more lane discipline
than most teams do. We play Steve Young twice a year, and he runs
better than anybody in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, 38, does not run as well as he used to, but he can still
make plays. One of the most telling images from the 1998 Super Bowl
is of Elway throwing his body over three Green Bay Packers to get a
first down. This season, Elway rushed for only 94 yards on 34
carries, but he was nimble in the pocket and sacked only 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, meanwhile, had 38 sacks and 159 quarterback
pressures. Elway says he is confident he can make plays against the
aggressive Falcons defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the scrambler, and I can't run around and do those
type of things that I used to, but I think that mentally I'm a lot
better now, and I'm throwing the football better than I ever
have,'' Elway said.

RUSSIA AGAIN DELAYS SPACE-STATION PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Launching of the next section of the International
Space Station, a Russian-made module with laboratory and crew
space, will be delayed until at least September because of
technical problems with the component, NASA officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The often-delayed service module, a crucial component of the
space station, was to have been transported into space in July, to
be joined to the initial two sections already in orbit. But its
launching will be pushed back at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian effort has been repeatedly delayed by money
troubles, but officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration attributed this delay to the need for further ground
testing and to problems with computer software for the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a development program and they are having some technical
problems that have to be worked out,'' NASA's deputy associate
administrator for space development, Gretchen McClain, said in an
interview. ``I don't think we will see it before September.''
</P>
<P>
   No new launching date for the Russian module has been set, and
official announcement of the delay will await review meetings to be
held over the next two months among NASA, the Russian Space Agency
and other partners in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen nations, led by the United States and Russia, are
involved in building the space station, which is expected to take
five years to complete at a cost ranging from $40 billion to $60
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The project requires connecting more than 100 major components,
carried into space on 45 space-shuttle and rocket flights and
assembled in 162 planned space walks.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the space station is more than a year and a half
behind schedule, primarily because cash-strapped Russia has not had
enough money to finish the critical service module.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, NASA agreed to provide Russia with $60 million in
exchange for future services aboard the station to help in
completing the service module, which will provide living quarters
and research space in the early stages of the space station's
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McClain said the Russian Space Agency had distributed the
added funds by the end of last year, paying off subcontractors and
getting work on the module going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems they are having now are technical, not
financial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McClain added that the Russian government still must
come up with money for its space program's budget this year,
including continuing work on the space station.
</P>
<P>
   The first two segments of the station were launched last fall
and joined 240 miles above Earth on Dec. 6 by a crew aboard the
space shuttle Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   The station now consists of a Russian-made power and maneuvering
module and an American-made node to be used to connect future
segments. Another shuttle flight to the station, carrying equipment
and supplies to outfit the existing modules, is tentatively
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   The delay will mean more problems for NASA's shuttle-launching
schedule, which has been disrupted by delays in the space station
and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled launching of the Chandra X-ray Observatory aboard
the space shuttle Columbia in April was pushed into May last week
because of problems with that spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a supply flight by the shuttle Atlantis to the space
station in August, which was to follow the attachment of the
service module, will have to be delayed until the Russian service
module is launched.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials said they had been assured by their
Russian counterparts of their commitment to the space station.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though the Russian government last week approved a plan to
extend the life of its Mir space station if private investment
could be found, Russian officials said their priority was the
international program. The Russians had previously agreed to bring
the Mir down this summer and concentrate its resources on the
international project.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McClain said NASA was following the Mir developments closely
to be sure there would be no effect on the international station if
private investment could be found to keep the Russian station in
space.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg of Houston, a former NASA engineer who is an expert
on the Russian space program, said the newest delay with the
service module was not unexpected and would probably not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians still face huge financial problems that will
prevent them from keeping their commitments as a major partner in
the international space station program, he said Friday, and NASA's
leadership refuses to acknowledge the depth of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``After every delay, we are assured by our people in NASA that
we are on top of the problem,'' Oberg said. ``And that's never been
the case.''

TOP PRISON OFFICIAL DEFENDS TEXAS SYSTEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Despite inmates' claims that they were savagely
raped and beaten by fellow convicts, the state's top prison
administrator said Friday that Texas penitentiaries are adequately
supervised and staffed with well-trained guards.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, director of the institutional division of the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice, told senior U.S. District
Judge William Wayne Justice that the state exceeds national
guidelines for guard training and has won recognition for its
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said the guard-to-inmate ratio in Texas is slightly
less than the 1-to-6 ratio ordered by Justice in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The official was the first witness presented by the state in its
bid to convince Justice to end his oversight of the 140,000-inmate
system. Johnson followed dozens of complaining inmates and several
expert witnesses testifying on the inmates' behalf who collectively
portrayed the prison system as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Justice could retain jurisdiction over the 73-unit system if he
concludes that ``cruel and unusual'' punishment is ongoing in the
system, despite the volumes of operating rules he approved to
reduce overcrowding and to improve security, medical care,
recreation and other facets of prison life.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson conceded that it's been difficult to fill some staff
positions, a situation he attributed in part to Texas' robust
economy. But he insisted that aggressive recruiting efforts,
opening of more training centers and use of more part-time guards
has helped fill positions and maintain security.
</P>
<P>
   The official said guards receive 160 hours of pre-service
training, and 80 hours on-the-job training, far more than the 120
hours recommended by the American Correctional Association.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the system has suffered as a result of a
1995 legislative decision to eliminate more than 200 jobs related
to inmate classification _ a shortcoming that inmates claim results
in their being misclassified and endangered. Several inmates have
testified that they attempted to commit suicide in order to win
transfers out of threatening situations.
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson took the stand to begin the state's two-week
presentation, one inmate testified that his official pleas to be
moved away from gang-member enemies were not heeded, resulting in
his being raped in his cell by four inmates _ despite having paid
other inmates for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My manhood was gone,'' the inmate told Justice, adding that a
guard later told him to stop complaining and ``quit being a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The same inmate, with a history of self-mutilation, caused
Justice to grimace as he described repeatedly biting into his
forearm to sever a vein in a bid to win a transfer to safekeeping.
He also claimed that while he was in the depths of depression, a
guard ``gave me a razor blade and told me to get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inmate who claimed he was extorted by inmates described
futile attempts to be transferred away from threatening gang
members who pounced on him in a shower last year and sexually
assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to die right then,'' he told the judge. ``It's not
something a person is used to or ready for,'' he said. He added
that guards reminded him that ``this is prison'' and told him ``I
needed to grow up ... learn to fight ... deal with it'' on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever felt safe in prison, the inmate said ``about
the time it took me to walk from the bus to the first unit I was
assigned to.''

 &HT;    LaGrange camp wasn't for votes, officials say
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LaGRANGE, Ga. _ While being lobbied for votes on behalf of
Atlanta to host the Olympics, sports leaders in Africa were
reminded that Mayor Andrew Young had long ago organized a training
camp in Georgia for African athletes preparing for the 1984 Games
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There was no monetary commitment, nor even a guarantee of such a
similar camp for the Atlanta Games, but Young and his aides talked
up the possibilities prior to the vote. And, by late 1991, a year
after Atlanta was chosen, the ``I Train in LaGrange'' program
catering to African athletes was under way in LaGrange, a town
about an hour's drive southwest of the '96 Olympic city.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic bid cities helping out economically needy African
nations _ perhaps in return for votes _ is one focus of ongoing
investigations sparked by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
Atlanta has not been implicated for its wooing of African votes,
but John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, has
said he followed ``the Atlanta model'' in setting up an African
training program in advance of the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Coates and the Africans may have become
too cozy with his admission that, on the eve of the vote for
Sydney, he promised IOC members from Kenya and Uganda $35,000
apiece to support various ``Olympic sports projects'' in their
countries. Coates has declined requests by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution to clarify and provide specifics on his
references to Atlanta, which include a charge that Young dispensed
U.S. foreign aid commitments in exchange for support of Atlanta's
Olympic bid. Young and other Atlantans deny any such promises were
made, or even could have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrange program was launched as a community effort
supported by local sponsors and LaGrange College. Later, it
received about $20,000 in state funding. About a year prior to the
Games, the program was accredited by the IOC to receive money from
its solidarity fund to aid in the training of athletes from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange College president Stuart Gulley said an average of 25
track and field athletes, mostly Africans, attended each year. The
LaGrange Sports Authority paid to house and feed the athletes on
campus and funded 15 percent of their college tuition. The college
defrayed the remaining tuition in the form of Presidential
Scholarships. A few athletes studied at a local technical school
and a private high school.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials say they are unaware of any relative of
African sports ministers or officials being invited to train there.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a member of Atlanta's bid group, said no funds from the
city's organizing committee went toward the program. ``It was
LaGrange wanting to be a part of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reardon, another big group member and later an ACOG
director, said, ``There was no quid pro quo. It was one of the
things that happened after we won.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the program did get started ''basically through the
Atlanta Olympic organizing committee,'' according to Ron Davis, a
track coach who was with Young and Reardon when they visited
African sports leaders in Mauritius in December 1989. Davis had
helped run a training camp for prospective LA Olympic athletes from
12 of their nations that Young was involved in setting up at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   The program at Emory ``was one of the things that was really
successful during the lobbying period, because that was always
mentioned,'' Davis said. ``And I'm sure it helped with the African
vote. During the lobbying period, and while I was working overseas
and meeting various officials, it sort of came up that this would
be a good possibility if Atlanta won the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent 20 years working in Africa, including his last year
on a Fulbright Scholarship in the Congo, Davis used his connections
to pitch Atlanta. He arranged a dinner party at a wealthy friend's
house so Young could meet with African sports officials during his
trip to Mauritius. Later, he said, Atlanta officials invited him to
Morocco to lobby on their behalf at a meeting of the African
National Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, now a college coach in Maryland, is friends with
Jean-Claude Ganga, president of the group, and other African IOC
members who have become entangled in the Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the IOC, you have the wealthy and the others like
Jean-Claude Ganga who I think is really a Nelson Mandella type,''
Davis said. ''He was the one who really supported the boycott
against apartheid, and he's done a lot for the development of
sports in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he was the one who pushed for a training camp here
for developing nations. Reardon, who grew up in the LaGrange area
and had given a well-received speech about the Olympics to civic
organizations there, introduced Davis to the city's mayor then,
Chris Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give credit to that community; they were extremely
interested in doing something,'' Reardon said. ``Their whole deal
was to expose the city and improve their own athletic programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The city hired Davis to create a program. He worked there until
just prior to the 1996 Games, when he was forced out, and the camp
has since disbanded. Several athletes have relocated to the
Savannah International Training Center.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange officials say their work with African nations should
not be tied to the current scandal, which includes IOC members
soliciting scholarships for their sons and daughters from Olympic
bid cities.

<P>
   ''People can say, 'Oh, they were giving scholarships,''' said
James Minnihan, executive director of the LaGrange Sports Authority
since 1995. ''Heck, the University of Georgia gives scholarships.
If you're going to run a program, you have to have athletes.''

 &HT;    West Coast NFL official's preferred site for 2003 Super Bowl
site
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If Atlanta is to enter the rumble for the 2003 Super
Bowl site, the city faces a major uphill battle filled with
logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Friday indicated a clear West
Coast preference if the 2003 game has to be moved from San
Francisco, where a troubled stadium project has jeopardized the
city's bid. Tagliabue, whose comments came in his annual ``state of
the league'' address, placed San Diego as a front-runner for
relocating the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the (San Francisco) construction schedule
has to be. I do know we have to make a decision this year on that
Super Bowl,'' Tagliabue said. ``I want to talk with (San Francisco)
Mayor (Willie) Brown, and depending where we come out. I would
expect a number of cities in a number of areas, including South
Florida, would be contesting to hold that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which hosts next year's game, is considering whether to
pursue the 2003 game. The $525 million project for a new stadium at
Candlestick Point has lost momentum and might not be approved.
Tagliabue indicated that the issue would be resolved by the
league's March meetings, when host-city bidding might start all
over again. But with no West Coast city scheduled to hold the game
through 2002, Southern California becomes a target area.
</P>
<P>
   In other issues:
</P>
<P>
   _Talgliabue predicted the return of instant replay next season,
based on its near approval in recent owner votes, improved
technology for video replay and several high-profile missed calls
in the second half of the season that energized the move to restore
replay.
</P>
<P>
   _Although the league continues to employ three African-American
coaches among its 31 franchises, Tagliabue defended the NFL's
efforts to place more minorities in its coaching ranks. ``I think
we have made a lot of progress on this in the last couple years.''
he said. ``Are we satisfied with where we are? No. And I don't
think anybody in the league is. Do we think we're making real
progress? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   _The commissioner said 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo, facing legal
problems in Louisiana, probably would continue to be ``divorced''
from the running of the team this year. Tagliabue said he is
satisfied that the club will be run by Denise DeBartolo York. But
when asked if Eddie DeBartolo had played a role in Bill Walsh's
return to the franchise as president, the commissioner replied,
``I'm not naive or stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   _The addition of a 32nd franchise, to be decided between Houston
and Los Angeles, should be determined in the March meetings,
although the determination of who would own those teams could take
longer. Houston has a group in place with money for a new stadium.
The L.A. bid, pitched by two competing groups, represents a
television market of more than 16 million.
</P>
<P>
   _The league is continuing to investigate the $850 million sale
of the Washington Redskins to Howard Millstein. ``We want to make
sure we have a process that was fair to an incumbent owner,'' said
Tagliabue, referring to the failed bid of John Kent Cooke, son of
the late owner.

FLATLEY SELLS BAY STATE NURSING HOMES TO CENTENNIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ga.)    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Developer Thomas J. Flatley has sold his six
Massachusetts nursing homes to Centennial HealthCare Corp., a
nursing home company based in Atlanta, for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which was completed Jan. 1, was confirmed Friday by
Centennial officials in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Flatley could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes Kimwell Nursing Home in Fall River, Charlwell
Nursing Home in Norwood, Milton Health Care Center in Milton,
Kathleen Daniel Nursing Home in Framingham, Parkwell Nursing Home
in Hyde Park, and Hollywell Nursing Home in Randolph. The nursing
homes combined have 895 beds.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the sale represents further consolidation
in an industry squeezed by increasingly tighter reimbursement from
government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation of yet another small, local regional provider
selling in an era of tremendous consolidation,'' said Susan Bailis,
cochairman and cochief executive of Solomont Bailis Ventures, a
health care services company in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial, which has $320 million in annual revenue, is a
newcomer to Massachusetts. With its latest acquisition, the company
owns 107 long-term care facilities in 21 states, according to Alan
Cosby, a spokesman for Centennial. Most of its facilities are
concentrated in Michigan, Indiana, and North Carolina. The Flatley
homes are Centennial's first acquisitions in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   While the Flatley homes are said to be in good financial shape,
sources in the industry said Flatley may have sold them to avoid
impending cuts in government reimbursement and a tougher regulatory
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term care industry was plagued by losses in 1998.
Genesis Health Ventures Inc., which is based in Kennett Square, Pa.
and owns nursing homes in Massachusetts, last year reported a $24
million loss on $1.4 billion in revenue. And Vencor Inc., a large
nursing home company in Louisville, Ky. that also operates nursing
homes in Massachusetts, this week warned investors that its 1998
earnings would fall below expectations.

 REMOTE CONTROL IS LINKED TO ABORTION-CLINIC BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Emily Lyons had another operation last week,
fresh scars to mingle with the old ones. It was her 13th surgery in
the past year. It has been that long since a nail bomb exploded
outside a Birmingham clinic that performed abortions, since the
shrapnel put out one of her eyes, shredded her legs and coated her
face and body with slashes and deep puncture wounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, on the anniversary of the day Mrs. Lyons, a nurse,
was blown up, she had a quiet dinner with the doctors who put her
back together, and hoped that the day would fly by, that the horror
would begin to fade again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more day to go,'' and the anniversary and the rush of
ugly memories that it conjured would be over, she said. ``Thank
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanderson, an off-duty police officer trying to earn a
little extra money as a security guard, was hit by that same
explosion, point-blank, outside the New Woman All Women Clinic in
Birmingham's Southside neighborhood. A newspaper photograph, taken
minutes later, was so gruesome that the paper later apologized for
running it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, fellow officers placed a wreath on the city's Police
Memorial in Sanderson's honor. His widow, Felicia, could not bear
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events from the past year are like yesterday to me,'' Mrs.
Sanderson wrote in a letter read aloud at the ceremony. When she
hears people talk about things like ``closure,'' she said, ``I'm
not sure what they really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Robert Rudolph, the man charged in this bombing, the 1996
Centennial Olympic Park bombing and two others in Atlanta, has been
dubbed a folk hero by some in the anti-government and anti-abortion
movements because of his ability to elude hundreds of
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is a former soldier and self-employed carpenter who has
been featured on T-shirts and bumper stickers with slogans like
``Hide and Seek Champion, Eric Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday it was hard for many people here to see him as
anything except a coward and a cold-blooded killer, and new
evidence painted him as even more evil than before.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators continue to promise that they will find
Rudolph, and say they may be closer than ever to tracking him down
in a wild area of western North Carolina where he is believed to be
hiding, they also say the 32-year-old Rudolph did not kill
Sanderson and maim Mrs. Lyons by chance. Instead of a timed device,
like the kind he is accused of using in the bombings in Atlanta,
Rudolph used a remote control to trigger the explosion here, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, said Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge
of the Nashville, Tenn., division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, is that the man some people are calling a romantic
figure watched and waited as Sanderson and Mrs. Lyons walked into
harm's way. Then he set off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the same thing, investigators said, if he had
tied a long wire to the trigger of a shotgun and shot it in their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's saying, `Darn, I didn't kill her, too,''' Mrs.
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh announced the new findings at a news conference after
the ceremony to honor Sanderson. He said forensics experts
concluded after combining countless pieces of bomb fragments that a
remote control had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a cold-blooded killer,'' Chief Mike Coppage of the
Birmingham Police Department said of the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators speculated that Rudolph switched to a
remote-control bomb because he was disappointed at the results of
his bombs in Centennial Park and at a women's clinic and a
nightclub frequented by homosexuals, both in Atlanta in 1997. In
Centennial Park, 111 people were wounded but only one was directly
killed. In the other two blasts no one died.
</P>
<P>
   All three explosions _ Rudolph is also accused of setting two
bombs at an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs outside Atlanta _ were
from timed devices.
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, he seemed to be making sure that someone died,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're against what he is against, how can you feel
good for him?'' asked Mrs. Lyons, who still has metal fragments
embedded in her body. ``What does that do for you? What religion do
you believe in, that doing what he did is God's work? Garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``People out there should know he can do this to
them, too. There are groups out there who take it upon themselves
to deal out justice. This is what they think justice is. But it's
not any kind I studied in school.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When asked whether Rudolph, who has been called a survivalist by
some who knew him, had the sophistication to make such a bomb by
himself, investigators said he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Birmingham bombing that identified Rudolph, when
witnesses saw him leave the scene in his truck. He was later linked
to the other bombings and charged with them, and he is now on the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.
</P>
<P>
   But as a steady procession of law-enforcement officials took the
podium at Friday's news conference, they could only promise his
arrest; the promise is now well worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll find him,'' Mrs. Lyons said, ``someday.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not sound certain. She just sounds tired.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters, dogs, reward money and 200 agents combing the
woods, caves and houses around Andrews, N.C., have produced
nothing. Rudolph disappeared into the 500,000-acre Nantahala
National Forest the day after the Birmingham bombing, and surfaced
again only once, to get food at a friend's house last summer.
</P>
<P>
   While they do not rule out the possibility that someone may be
hiding him, investigators said it was more likely that Rudolph had
simply evaded agents in the rugged terrain. Woody Enderson, the FBI
special agent who heads the Southeast Bomb Task Force that is
coordinating the investigation, said he believed Rudolph could be
running low on food and might have to come out of hiding to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic that Rudolph is accused of bombing never shut down,
and lost none of its staff because of the violence, with the
exception of Mrs. Lyons, who is not physically able to return to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb deeply hurt the people who work there, but it did
nothing to stop the work itself, said Michelle Farley, 36, the
clinic's administrator. Ms. Farley was a block and a half away when
the bomb went off, and she got there in time to see Sanderson die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change anything,'' Ms. Farley said of the bombing.
Then, referring to Rudolph, she added: ``He killed Robert, and
there is nothing we can do about that. Emily will never be
physically the same, or emotionally the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what he did was turn a soft-spoken, politically silent
woman into a screaming, walking, talking picture of what violence
can do,'' Ms. Farley continued. ``Who can look at her and believe
that a bombing changes anything'' for the better?

 &HT;    Raring to return: Tech's Glover working hard to heal his injured
knee
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you're used to being ``the man,'' being courted
by all the major-college superpowers, being the leading freshman
scorer in the Atlantic Coast Conference _ and when it becomes
evident you're exactly as advertised _ it's not uncommon to don a
cloak of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   When that cloak is ripped away, the experience can be humbling.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Georgia Tech's Dion Glover when he tore
up his left knee Oct. 17 during the Yellow Jackets' first practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was dreaming,'' Glover said. ``I never thought I
would suffer such a devastating injury. I was so ready for the
season. I had worked all summer on the things I didn't have my
freshman year _ my jump shot, my defense, various techniques. But I
knew it was bad; I twisted it real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience was devastating not only to Glover, but also to
coach Bobby Cremins and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' Cremins said. ``I had never had something
like that happen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been worse. Glover and sophomore center
Alvin Jones were the only starters returning from last season's
19-14 team. All-ACC player Matt Harpring and senior Michael Maddox
had graduated. Freshman point guard Travis Spivey had transferred
to Iowa State. Backup center Pablo Machado had transferred to
Loyola-Marymount. An already-thin roster was suddenly threadbare.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, Tech was entertaining its top two recruits, Damien
Wilkins and Joe Forte. The pair didn't have the best visit, with
the Tech coaches and players distracted by the injury. Later,
Wilkins committed to North Carolina State and Forte to North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back from the injury hasn't been easy for the powerfully
built, 6-feet-4 Glover even though the rehabilitation has gone
well. He has progressed from making his way on crutches, to
limping, to walking with no trace of a limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a real good attitude about the rehab,'' Tech trainer
David Chewning said. ``He's working hard, and that's what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Glover said, ``Basketball is about the only thing I
really enjoy doing. I used to go home and cry. But I've been
patient, and that's something I didn't have before. My mom has
helped me a lot by talking to me. My brother has had two (anterior
cruciate ligament) operations and he's helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Glover plays for Life University. He has come back from his
two knee surgeries to become the team's sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dion's doing great now,'' his brother said. ``I knew what he
was feeling. One moment, you're accepting; the next moment you're
down and wondering, `Why me?' Now he's gaining confidence. He'll be
stronger than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happens has a purpose,'' Dion said. ``There
are a lot of people out there a whole lot worse off _ people that
are paralyzed and people that won't get well. I know that (UCLA
guard) Baron Davis had the same operation and so did Tim Hardaway
(of the NBA's Miami Heat), and they both came back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Glover sits and waits. He said he's not going to
attempt to come back this year, although he admitted he's thinking
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to get back,'' he said, ``but I've decided to
take the year off. I'll just keep cheering them on.''
</P>
<P>
   From his vantage point on the bench, Dion has acquired a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to see things when you're not playing,'' he said.
``I'll point out little things I notice. The games keep my mind off
the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover is not lacking for confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was heavily depended on this year,'' he said. ``I
think if I was playing, we would have lost two games _ Kentucky and
Duke. In the Florida State game, they missed a scoring spark. I
could have been that spark, shown leadership out there. They needed
me to energize the team, to keep them together. They needed someone
to take the ball to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech should have an excellent chance at a fine season when he
comes back, Glover said. The Jackets would start Tony Akins and
Stonehill College transfer Shaun Fein in the backcourt, 7-0 Jason
Collier at strong forward, Glover as a swing guard/forward and
Alvin Jones at center. Jon Babul, 6-8 Air Force transfer Michael
Isenhour, T.J. Vines and Darryl LaBarrie would come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can be a Final Four team,'' Glover said. ``I think
I can be college player of the year. We'll have two 7-footers.
Alvin will continue to grow (as a player). Tony is certain to grow.
Next year is the best shot for this program. I think we can have a
great year. I'm being realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Glover stay for his the full four years of eligibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't looked at it yet,'' the sophomore said. ``If I
hadn't been injured, I would have taken a hard look after this
year. But I'm definitely going to stay next year.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a tale of two earnings reports from Micron
Technology Inc., one of the world's largest makers of semiconductor
chips. Micron also happens to be a very hot stock.
</P>
<P>
   The reports detail the results for the company's first quarter,
which ended Dec. 3. One is a news release issued Dec. 23; the other
is the quarterly report, or 10-Q, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Jan. 5. The two reports differ in intriguing
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring discrepancy is in Micron's sales of
semiconductor memory products. The news release says these totaled
$428.1 million in the quarter. The 10-Q says they totaled $409.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Which number is correct? A Micron spokeswoman, Julie Nash, said:
``There was a $19 million reclassification of numbers that went
from semiconductor memory products sales into `other.' These were
sales that were relative to providing semiconductor revenues, but
they were actually service fees.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Micron, of Boise, Idaho, found the error and fixed it
in the 10-Q. But it did not publish a corrected news release. ``It
was not material,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it's immaterial that 4.3 percent of the company's
semiconductor sales weren't semiconductor sales at all.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would matter if investors relied on 10-Qs rather
than news releases for investment information. But that is not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Niles, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, has a
strong ``buy'' rating on the stock. The revenue number he has used
in recommending the stock is the $428.1 million from the news
release.
</P>
<P>
   Niles did not know the number was incorrect until a reporter
told him on Friday. He said the new, lower number would not change
his positive view of the company.
</P>
<P>
   There is another interesting difference in Micron's two reports.
The 10-Q states that net sales of semiconductor memory products
increased 10 percent over the previous quarter, a result of an 18
percent increase in the chips' average selling price being partly
offset by a 10 percent decline in megabits shipped. The news
release, however, is mum about the decline in shipments.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big deal to show a decline in megabits shipped. With
chip makers constantly improving the memory capacity of their
products _ also known as the yield _ a drop in megabits shipped is
not good news.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the news release not mention this? Ms. Nash again: ``The
press release is a summary document used to discuss what we believe
is of interest to shareholders and reflect company trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this passes the smell test is something Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the SEC, may want to ponder. Levitt is justifiably
concerned that companies make accurate disclosures to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Who uncovered the Micron discrepancies? Sleuths on the Internet
_ specifically, three people who post comments on the ``Ask Michael
Burke'' and ``Micron Only'' threads on Silicon Investor; and Larry
Woods, editor of the Tech Review newsletter in Stoney Creek,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Two footnotes: Since Micron's news release came out, its shares
have risen 49 percent. Not bad for a company that lost $46.2
million in the quarter. And on Wednesday, the company filed a
registration of 2.75 million shares to be sold to the public.

KAFELNIKOV TO FACE ENQVIST IN AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Shortly before Yevgeny Kafelnikov left
his newborn daughter and his wife, Mascha, in Germany to head for
the Southern Hemisphere, Mascha said to him, ``Don't go away for a
month and only make the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov has taken his wife's directive to heart here at the
first Grand Slam tournament of the year: He is in the Australian
Open final.
</P>
<P>
   He made it there Friday with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Tommy
Haas of Germany and will now face Thomas Enqvist of Sweden on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov is seeded 10th; Enqvist is not seeded at all. Neither
has the sort of high international profile that will put casual
tennis fans in a lather. This is not Pete vs. Andre, or even
Michael vs. Marcelo, but to those who have sat through their
matches at Melbourne Park over the last two weeks, it is clear that
Yevgeny and Thomas deserve to be the last men standing on the
Rebound Ace at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
   Both are approaching their 25th birthdays and are former members
of the top six who struggled last year, Enqvist because of a foot
injury that required surgery, and Kafelnikov because of wounds that
were largely self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Russian missed this tournament after injuring
his knee in a skiing accident (a year earlier, he missed it after
breaking his hand hitting a punching bag). He then split with his
longtime mentor, Anatoly Lepeshin, and spent seven months without a
coach and briefly considered retirement before hiring Larry
Stefanki. Surprisingly, Kafelnikov decided to go skiing in
December, but he emerged unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kafelnikov is clearly one of the most talented players in the
world,'' said the American Davis Cup captain, Tom Gullikson, in a
recent interview. ``With him, it's a matter of how his mind holds
up.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach his first Grand Slam final, Enqvist had to ignore the
ardent wishes of two large crowds in defeating the Australians
Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis. Kafelnikov, the 1996 French
Open champion, did not have quite as daunting a task, but he had to
defeat Jonas Bjorkman, Jason Stoltenberg and Jim Courier in early
rounds, survive a five-set struggle with the backhand-whipping
Romanian Andrei Pavel and beat Todd Martin, the towering American
who had won his last two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   That was just to get to Haas, the unseeded German who moved to
Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla., at the age of
12 and developed his game on the same courts as Andre Agassi,
Monica Seles, Anna Kournikova, Courier and no shortage of others.
The son of a tennis coach, Haas has been driven to succeed from an
early age, and he has long been precocious on court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed up at Nick's and he was always a challenging person,
really intense out there from day one, grinding in practice with
the guys,'' said his traveling coach, David ``Red'' Ayme, who was
at Bollettieri's when Haas arrived as a 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Haas still has to learn to hit the right shot at the right time
in a Grand Slam semifinal. Haas, 20, showed sparks of great
ability, often holding his own from the baseline with Kafelnikov.
But he would all too often go for a huge forehand or backhand from
an off-balance position.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times, he was up break points on me, and I felt
like he played stupid shots,'' Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a week for learning experiences in Melbourne. On
Thursday, after being upset by the French teen-ager Amelie Mauresmo
in the semifinals, the top-ranked Lindsay Davenport said that
playing Mauresmo made her think she was ``playing a guy.''
Davenport also commented repeatedly on Mauresmo's broad shoulders
and uncommon strength.
</P>
<P>
   None of Davenport's comments were made in an accusatory tone,
but in a month when Petr Korda's positive test for the steroid
nandrolone has often overshadowed what happens on court, such
references to a female player were loaded ones. On Friday, after
Davenport and her doubles partner, Natasha Zvereva, lost 7-5, 6-3
to Martina Hingis and Kournikova in the women's doubles final,
Davenport said she had never meant to imply that Mauresmo's
physique was a product of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing that at all; that didn't come into my thoughts
at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Serena,'' she added, in reference to the powerfully
built Serena Williams. ``It's never come up with her possibly
using. Some girls can get built like that, and that wasn't my
intention at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport also said she regretted the way her comments were
reported: Her quotes about Mauresmo made the front page of the main
Australian newspapers. ``Just a nightmare,'' Davenport said. ``If
you look at what I said, it was directly meant to be about her
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I said was nothing like, `Oh, she's a man,''' she
added. ``Basically, when I saw her play, it reminded me of a guy
and how they play. That's honestly what I meant, and unfortunately
it was taken the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said she would try to reach Mauresmo and express her
regrets but was unsure if she could do so before Mauresmo plays
Hingis on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she can still play well tomorrow,'' Davenport said.

SEVERAL CENSURE PLANS UNDER DISCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an ordeal centering on the relationship between
words and deeds _ and questions about the meaning of the word
``is'' _ it seems fitting that negotiations over how to reprimand
President Clinton have come to this.
</P>
<P>
   One plan would call him a liar. Another would say he is guilty
of telling a lie. Yet a third would say Clinton lied, but would
wait until after the Senate fails to convict him of perjury in his
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The various plans go by a variety of names, and as of Friday
were still being fine-tuned. A seven-member Republican impeachment
committee was debating two strikingly similar proposals, put
forward by Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins, that
would hold Clinton accountable before votes take place on the
articles of impeachment. Several Democrats, who also want to hold
Clinton accountable, were striving to censure Clinton, but later in
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike efforts to oust Clinton from office, the drive to
punish the president verbally appeared likely to succeed in some
form. Despite vehement objections to each other's proposals, no one
in either party has advocated simply forgiving Clinton and voting
to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all still in play,'' Senator Spencer Abraham, a
Republican from Michigan, said Friday. ``I think that's what the
votes (on Thursday) have accomplished. We haven't cut off any
possible course from this point on.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, like many Republicans, favors some sort of ``finding of
fact'' before the impeachment vote, rather than a censure plan
voted on afterward. In a party-line vote Thursday evening, the
Senate adopted a GOP road map for the rest of the trail that leaves
open that possibility. Democrats, who voted unanimously against the
GOP motion, had hoped to block that option.
</P>
<P>
   The ``finding of fact'' plan has been presented in two forms:
One by Collins, which would ascribe language of guilt, and another
by Snowe, which would simply state that Clinton did what he is
accused of doing _ perjury and obstruction of justice. Senators on
both sides of the aisle disagree over the constitutionality of
each, and, because neither plan has been presented in writing, most
Republicans are not entirely sure which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a battle from Maine here?'' joked Abraham, who was
unaware of more than one GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are, in fact, semantic and seemingly slight.
Collins's plan, being crafted with Senator Pete V. Domenici of New
Mexico, reaches a ``conclusion of law'' _ and might use criminal
vocabulary and such words as ``perjury'' or ``crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Collins plan, nicknamed the ``Son of Isenburgh'' after the
University of Chicago professor who tipped her to the idea of
splitting the impeachment vote, would be long and detailed. It
would also outline exactly what Clinton did and why it is wrong,
according to Senator Tim Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who is
a member of the special GOP impeachment committee.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, on the other hand, has suggested simply laying out
Clinton's actions. That process would be shorter, less specific,
and potentially more appealing to Democrats who are skittish about
accusing Clinton of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said the Snowe plan ``would not use legal terms such
as perjury, obstruction'' _ words some Democrats fear might lay the
groundwork for Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would reflect that the House managers satisfactorily
proved, on a factual basis, that which was alleged,'' Hutchinson
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is one of the primary reasons Republicans want to
take action before the vote on the articles of impeachment. If
Clinton is not convicted, which is widely expected, the White House
might claim total victory, saying there was no basis for facts
presented by the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A third plan, floated by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican,
would allow the Senate to take up a motion that Clinton did what is
alleged _ lying under oath and obstructing justice. It would be
joined by a motion to then adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you vote for conviction or not, he should not be able
to claim that he was exonerated,'' said Hatch, who has not spelled
out details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Democratic view, deciding on a verbal punishment
before the impeachment vote is unfair to Clinton. It would accuse
him of a crime without allowing him to mount a full defense. Some
Democrats believe it also would send the Senate down a slippery
slope toward conviction. For example, if senators find Clinton
guilty of perjury, would they be constitutionally bound to remove
him from office?
</P>
<P>
   To avoid those dangers, Democrats overwhelmingly have supported
censuring Clinton sometime down the road. Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry have decried the GOP plans as
unconstitutional, regardless of what language is used; the same
language applied later, troubles them far less.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, California Senator Dianne Feinstein is
crafting a censure proposal, which would be voted on after the
final votes on the articles of impeachment. Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, has worked with Feinstein
on the proposal, aides said _ an important signal, because
Lieberman has suggested he might cooperate with a Republican
fact-finding plan as well.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Democrat, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, has vowed
not to support a later censure plan. ``The Constitution does not
provide for that,'' Graham said last week, echoing many Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any statement of disapproval ought to come during the
trial, not after the trial,'' Graham said. ``The idea of doing it
through findings of fact appeals to me. But, like most things, the
devil resides in the details.''

WARRING SIDES IN KOSOVO SUMMONED TO PEACE TALKS IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-US) 
(JT) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In an unusual show of unity, the United States, four
Western European nations and Russia Friday summoned the warring
sides in Kosovo to a peace conference in France next Friday and
suggested that if they did not reach agreement within two weeks,
air strikes would follow.
</P>
<P>
   To put what the United States has called ``a credible threat''
of force behind the negotiations, NATO is expected to vote on
Saturday to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they do not
agree to a political settlement of autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, President Clinton's top national security
advisers determined that the United States should commit several
thousand ground troops to any eventual peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo. Britain and France have already announced their willingness
to send ground troops after a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The conference next Friday, to be held in Rambouillet, 30 miles
south of Paris, is to be modeled after the Dayton negotiations that
resulted in a peace settlement in Bosnia. But while the Dayton
talks were led by the Clinton administration, the conference on
Kosovo is notable for the absence of a top U.S. official as the
chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the French
foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, will be chairmen of the
conference, with an American, a European Union representative and a
Russian diplomat managing the day to day negotiations. The other
two countries involved are Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Cook announced that he would deliver the summons to the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade and to the ethnic
Albanian leadership in Kosovo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was taking a ``very fair offer'' to Milosevic and was
backed by an ``awful lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the announcement here, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright warned that ``showing up is not going to
be good enough.``
</P>
<P>
   The showing up will be only the first of many obstacles between
Friday and next Friday. Despite three months of shuttling between
Belgrade and Pristina, the Kosovo capital, by the American envoy,
Christopher Hill, who has been refining the terms of a political
settlement, the two sides have never met.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian authorities have refused to consider the possibility
of autonomy for Kosovo, a status that Milosevic stripped from
Kosovo 10 years ago. The ethnic Albanians insist on independence
for the province, where more than 90 percent of the 2 million
people are ethnic Albanian. The number of Serbs in Kosovo is
dwindling as many leave for fear of Albanian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Serbia, which is the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, said Friday that it would not consider attending until
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group that has the
support of the ethnic Albanians, stopped its ``terrorist''
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the ethnic Albanians have had trouble agreeing which
officials should represent them, but State Department officials
said they were confident that enough representatives of ethnic
Albanian factions could be mustered for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The administration warned the ethnic Albanians that it would not
allow them to become the ``spoilers'' of the conference. The Kosovo
Liberation Army was warned specifically that if it obstructed a
peace settlement, efforts would be made to cut off its arms
supplies with blockades of sea ports in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to past indecisiveness, the ``contact group'' of the
six nations, which coordinates international policy on the Balkans,
Friday laid out a fairly precise and strict timetable for the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs and ethnic Albanians were told to show up in
Rambouillet on Feb. 6 ``to begin negotiations with the direct
involvement of the contact group.'' The two sides would be given
seven days to conclude an agreement, at which point the negotiators
would decide whether progress justified further talks, which would
be limited to less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of that time,'' Albright said at the news
conference here, ``either the parties will have agreed or they will
not. If they have not, we will draw appropriate conclusions and
consider further steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Russia opposes the use of NATO air strikes against the
Serbs, it was not possible for Albright, or Cook, to make an
outright threat of air strikes at a meeting of the contact group,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright's message was unmistakable, and the Administration
has pushed hard all week for NATO to vote for the authorization of
air strikes as the enforcement mechanism at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous agreement in the contact group came after the
Russia decided to soften its usually stalwart support for the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the Russians did not want to be isolated in the
contact group on the issue and agreed with the United States and
Europe that Milosevic should stop the violence in Kosovo and grant
the province generous autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, was on the podium
with Albright and four other foreign ministers when the
announcement of the conference was made at the British foreign
office.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian diplomat, Boris Majorski, will join Hill and the
European envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch, who is the Austrian ambassador
in Belgrade, as one of the three day-to-day negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties fail to abide by the cease-fire and to reach a
settlement on the status of Kosovo, then a ``return to massive
violence in Kosovo _ and beyond it'' is all but inevitable,
Albright said Friday.

TORN LIGAMENT STILL HAUNTS POPEYE JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been more than 14 months since it happened, and still, as
hard as he tries, Popeye Jones can't forget. He can't forget the
pain, the feeling of utter helplessness, and, as time wore on, the
concern over his future in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing an anterior cruciate ligament is no longer an athletic
death sentence and hasn't been for years. Danny Manning has done it
three times. But try telling that to someone who has never had one,
who was simply trying to make a routine play and is still trying to
shake the memory and clear his head.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold: Ah yes, he
remembers it well. Too well. The knee is fine. He'd been told by a
lot of ACL victims, including Manning, that the mental healing
takes much longer. It does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let it bother me,'' the Celtics forward said
Friday night. ``Just because people say that doesn't mean it has to
happen like that. But I do still find myself thinking about it.
Thinking, `Don't twist that way because you might hurt it again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind remembers that feeling, how bad that pain was.
That's a big part of it, the mental part. You don't want that big,
hard pain to shoot through there again. They say it takes 18 months
to fully forget about it, and I'm at 14, 15 months. It's a slow
process. But it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He still recalls the entire sequence. How could he not? The
Raptors were in the Forum, playing the Lakers, and Jones had the
ball, 18 feet away, with the shot clock winding down. Robert Horry
came running at him, and Jones came to a quick stop, pump-faked,
and turned. Or, to be more accurate, tried to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like my left leg got stuck,'' he said. ``It didn't
turn, and everything else just went the other way. I heard a pop.
The first 10-15 minutes was brutal pain. Who knows what happened to
the ball? I sure don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He waited more than three weeks to have surgery. By the time of
the operation, he had thrown away the brace and the crutches and
was able to walk again. He was thinking, ``How can this be? This
must be something easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He had strengthened the knee with exercises in those three weeks
and been buoyed by talks with Toronto teammates Shawn Respert and
Reggie Slater, each of whom had torn an ACL and lived to tell about
it. Manning came in with the Suns and told him he had torn both
ACLs and was still playing. (Manning has since suffered a third
such tear and is still playing.) He suddenly empathized with those
who were in his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I had seen someone have one or read about it and I'd
think, `That's too bad; he messed up his knee,' '' Jones said. ``I
had never heard about them other than hearing it on the news. I
didn't know what it was. Now that I've been through it, I feel real
sorry for the guy 'cause I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he had the surgery, he put the brace back on, and he picked
up his crutches again and settled into the long, tedious,
exhausting, boring world of rehab.
</P>
<P>
   He credits the Celtics and Rick Pitino with restoring his career
and his hope. He commuted between Toronto and Dallas (his home)
while still with the Raptors and in rehab. The situation in Toronto
was deteriorating by the day. Isiah Thomas was trying to buy the
team, Damon Stoudamire was on his way out, the team was horrible
(it started out 1-19), and, well, Jones felt it just wasn't the
proper atmosphere. He was in Dallas when he found out he had been
traded to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino and his medical/conditioning people quickly set up a
program under which Jones lost weight and body fat while
strengthening the knee with a lot of stationary bike work. More
than the rehab and the commitment, however, Jones said it was a
sense of belonging to something again that had been missing since
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part about coming to Boston _ and I told Coach Pitino
this _ was that I was feeling depressed at home in Dallas,'' Jones
said. ``Because, yes, I was rehabbing, but I wasn't with a team.
And it almost felt like my career was over. I didn't have a team to
be around and I was used to being on an NBA team.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back on an NBA team. He's surviving a Pitino training camp,
no small achievement. He had 9 points, 4 rebounds, and a quadriceps
bruise in 24 minutes Tuesday, his first NBA game of any kind since
Nov. 30, 1997. He took a breather in the Celtics' exhibition game
against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   He still thinks about the quick stops and cuts. That's how it
happened before, and people who've been there tell him they think
about how they hurt it, too. It's natural, understandable, but
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want anything to go wrong,'' he said. ``Sure, I
can run, lift, play in pickup games. But training camp is
different. I'm praying it won't hurt, that nothing bad will happen,
that I'll get my career going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.

SALT LAKE CITY'S FINANCIAL CAMPAIGN TO WIN GAMES STARTED IN 1991  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JO THOMAS and KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The leaders of Salt Lake City's effort to win
the Olympics committed themselves as early as 1991 to a four-year
campaign that included financial assistance to people who could
influence the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games, planning documents
show.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which also called for the use of hired lobbyists
and payments to national Olympic committees around the world, was
outlined in a detailed blueprint presented in a binder in December
1991 to the board of business leaders, which oversaw the Olympic
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Documents maintained by the committee's staff, including minutes
of the committee's meetings and ledgers showing checks paid
directly to members of the International Olympic Committee and
their family members, clearly show how the effort was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The internal committee documents portray an aggressive program
to use money to secure votes by a city determined not to fail again
in its efforts to bring the Olympics to one of the fastest-growing
metropolitan areas in the West. In 1991, Salt Lake City, in a
bitter defeat its officials attributed to what they believed were
free-spending efforts of the Japanese, lost out by four votes to
Nagano, Japan, for the right to play host to the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Salt Lake's bid committee have professed
surprise and dismay in recent weeks at revelations of improper
payments and other inducements provided to members of the
International Olympic Committee or their families. They have
frequently said that they were aware only of a plan to provide
humanitarian aid to deserving countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But documents provided to the leaders of Salt Lake's committee
at the outset of their effort to gain the 2002 Games suggest that
the leaders were committed to a global courtship of potential swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   One budget summary, for example, presented at a meeting of the
bid commitee's board in December 1991, projects spending roughly
$500,000 on aid to national Olympic committees and ib contracts
with ``key individuals'' in three crucial parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key person,'' the document says, ``is one who would
influence an IOC member's vote,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   It has been disclosed in recent weeks that Salt Lake arranged
college scholarships for six family members of Olympic committee
members. Other family members were given jobs or other financial
assistance. And an investigation by the International Olympic
Committee discovered that Salt Lake made payments directly to
voting IOC members and not to their national sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was meticulously and openly detailed in the bid
committee's records, including American Express bills paid for the
daughter of one Olympic committee member, rent checks for another
relative of a committee member and hundreds of thousands of dollars
in gifts and favors for committee members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Those records, from 1991 until the selection of Salt Lake City
in 1995, were reviewed and approved by a national audit firm that
reported directly to the board. The financial records and the
spending blueprint provided to the board were shown to The New York
Times by a participant in the bid effort concerned that a fuller
version of the story be made public.
</P>
<P>
   G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of the bid committee, said
through his lawyers that the ``details of the bid's work'' were
handled by Thomas K. Welch, its president, and David Johnson, its
vice president. The attorney, Mark H. Tuohey, said the detailed
spending was not reviewed by Joklik.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of the ship was Tom Welch,'' Tuohey said. ``He ran
the show. No one else. Frank Joklik was not a CEO. He was a
volunteer, part-time chairman of the board. The executives were
paid handsomely to run the ship. The board had no other function
but to raise money and approve the budget each year and implement
initial financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board had nothing to do with the books and records of the
company,'' said Tuohey. ``They never looked at the books and
records.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuohey conceded Joklik and other board members did sign off
on the plan of action spelled out in the earliest budget documents
from 1991. He said those budget documents, however widely reviewed
and disseminated in an organization, are policy statements and not
for the most part detailed spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Johnson have said the board had access to
complete documentation of all payments and arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times attempted to reach every member of the bid
committee involved in the successful effort to secure the Winter
Games. John Ruger, a former Olympic biathlon competitor, said the
board had set ``broad policies'' and did not try to
``micromanage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' he said of the board, ``we were only in there
three or four times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is currently examining whether anything
done by Salt Lake officials or members of the International Olympic
Committee violated any laws. Last Sunday, an Olympic committee
investigation concluded there had been widespread wrongdoing in the
bid process and expelled six members of its own committee. Three
others had previously resigned as a result of the investigation
into the awarding of the Games to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the International Olympic Committee said bid
cities were permitted to make payments to national Olympic
committees around the world as long as they were not exchanged for
an IOC member's vote and as long as they were given to the national
committee, not an individual. Bid cities are required to audit
their expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents disclosed to The Times, along with dozens of
interviews with people who are or were close to the bid process
here, show that money was also only part of the machinery of
influencing IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lead lawyer for the bid committee wrote a letter to the
University of Utah urging it to admit the son of an International
Olympic Committee delegate even though his grades were not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ An employee of First Security Bank, whose chairman and chief
executive, Spencer F. Eccles, sat on the executive committee of the
Salt Lake bid organization, offered a summer job in 1995, in
writing, to the son of a delegate from Mali.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Olympic Committee also came to the city's aid. In a
letter to the IOC member Lamine Keita of Mali, the American
committee said it was giving Mali $5,000 worth of bicycles.

TESTIMONY IMPLICATES BEAR STEARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In court documents filed last week in U.S. District
Court in the Southern District of New York, a former executive of
Bear Stearns Cos. describes the role the firm played in the
violations of federal securities laws committed by a small
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony in the civil case, involving Sterling Foster, a
New York brokerage firm that failed in 1997, provides a glimpse of
what law-enforcement officials are examining as they investigate
Bear Stearns' role in the failures of Sterling Foster and another
brokerage firm, A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns' clearing unit is the subject of continuing
investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office, the U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the testimony, Bear Stearns declined to comment. The
company has denied wrongdoing in its clearing business. Sterling
Foster and its president, Adam Lieberman, agreed to pay $11.5
million in an SEC settlement last fall without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney has said that office
is continuing its investigation of Sterling Foster.
</P>
<P>
   In the A.R. Baron case, 14 of the firm's executives were
convicted of securities fraud by the office of Robert Morgenthau,
the Manhattan district attorney. In all, public customers of the
firm lost $75 million when it failed.
</P>
<P>
   The new case is being brought against Bear Stearns by Howard
Greenberg, a customer of Sterling Foster who lost $500,000 in his
dealings with the firm. Greenberg's complaint was first filed as an
arbitration case before the National Association of Securities
Dealers. But the NASD panel dismissed it on Nov. 20. Greenberg's
lawyer, Leslie Trager, has filed a motion to overturn the
arbitration's dismissal in District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the Greenberg case took testimony from Keith Brigley,
who was an associate director at Bear Stearns Clearing Corp. for
roughly seven years until last year. Brigley reported to Peter
Murphy, second in command in the clearing unit, which is headed by
Richard Harriton.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Brigley described behind-the-scenes dealings
that took place between Bear Stearns and Lieberman of Sterling
Foster surrounding an initial public offering of $7.2 million in
common stock and warrants in ML Direct Inc., a marketing concern.
</P>
<P>
   The offering took place in September 1996. According to court
documents, Sterling Foster aggressively sold ML Direct stock to its
customers as soon as trading in the new issue began. Sterling
Foster sold twice what was offered in the initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   This created what is known as a short position in the shares of
ML Direct on Sterling Foster's books, since the firm could not come
up with enough shares to cover what it had sold in the open market.
Such a position could create a huge problem for the firm that
clears the stock trades if the share price shoots up and it must
buy shares at a higher market price. That firm was Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brigley's testimony, when Lieberman of Sterling
Foster was asked how this potential liability would be covered, he
assured Brigley that an additional 2.3 million shares would be
delivered to Bear Stearns from insiders who were selling their own
shares of ML Direct stock. In Wall Street parlance, these people
are called selling shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But page two of the ML Direct prospectus stated that selling
shareholders had agreed to refrain from selling any shares for 12
months, an arrangement commonly known as a lock-up. Bear Stearns'
executives had copies of this prospectus. Brigley says in his
testimony that he does not recall reading the lock-up provision in
the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Trager, the lawyer in the case, says Bear Stearns' executives
are held by law to have read the prospectus. ``The evidence showed
that as a matter of law and fact, Bear Stearns knew of the material
misrepresentation in the prospectus,'' Trager said. ``For it to
clear what they knew was a fraudulent transaction creates a
liability against them, and it is rather surprising that they would
do such a transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Securities laws broadly state that it is unlawful for any person
to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud.
</P>
<P>
   What the testimony describes in the ML Direct offering parallels
descriptions of five other Sterling Foster offerings that were
included in an indictment of Randolph Pace, former owner of the
defunct brokerage Rooney Pace, by the U.S. attorney last November.
In all those offerings, which were underwritten by Sterling Foster,
the U.S. attorney alleges that insiders had publicly stated that
they would lock up their shares.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, according to the indictment, the selling
shareholders had a secret agreement with the underwriter to sell
shares during the initial offering. Pace has denied wrongdoing in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Manhattan district attorney nor the U.S. attorney
would comment on Brigley's testimony. Rob Khuzami, chief of the
securities fraud unit at the U.S. attorney's office, said, ``We are
continuing our investigation in all of its various aspects.''

 &HT;    Attack of Tigers is season's surprise
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Auburn's basketball team is a lot like those
Atlanta Falcons we've read so much about lately.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers came out of nowhere to reach a place of national
prominence and have refused to lose despite illness, adversity and
personal tragedy. You could even say they have a dirty bird, if you
count their brown-colored golden eagle mascot, nicknamed ``Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   To compare coach Cliff Ellis' recent bout with the flu with Dan
Reeves' heart surgery would be a stretch, but one comparison can't
be argued: Like the Falcons, Auburn is winning often and shocking
the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers bring a 19-1 record and No. 7 national ranking into
Georgia's Stegeman Coliseum this afternoon and, with a 7-1 SEC
record, are running roughshod over their Western Division
competition.
</P>
<P>
   That they're coming to Athens without their leading scorer and
rebounder doesn't seem to matter. Auburn is 2-0 since Chris Porter
began a three-game suspension for an unspecified ``team rules
violation'' a week ago and will be favored as it faces the reeling
Bulldogs (12-8, 3-5 SEC), losers of four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were expected to be competitive, but no one predicted
the runaway success that has characterized their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had a good starting five, so I thought we'd be
pretty good,'' said Ellis, who was just 12 games above .500 in his
previous five years on The Plain. ``We had four starters coming
back, and we had signed Chris Porter out of high school, so we knew
what we had in him. Depth was a concern because it was going to
have to come from young players. But the Mack McGadneys and Jay
Heards and guys like that have responded.''
</P>
<P>
   McGadney, a 6-foot-7 freshman from Mobile, started after
Porter's suspension and responded with 11 points and seven rebounds
in a win over Alabama after finding out earlier that day that the
grandmother who raised him had died. He went home and attended her
funeral, then returned for the Mississippi State game and recorded
a career-high 15 points, six rebounds and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack stepped up and played a tremendous game,'' Auburn senior
Bryant Smith said. ``He has so much heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' leading scorer last year, Smith had been
overshadowed by Porter, but he led Auburn with 16 points in its
latest victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of what they've done has to do with the players
they already had in the program,'' Georgia coach Ron Jirsa said.
``Mamadou N'diaye may be the most improved player in our league.
They've got an SEC all-defensive player in Bryant Smith, (Scott)
Pohlman's one of the top 3-point shooters in the league. ...
They've got it going.''

 &HT;    Harrison reverses course on Auburn
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Washington High quarterback Latrez Harrison's college
recruitment took another bizarre twist Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just five days before national signing day for college football,
Harrison, a Journal-Constitution Super 11 choice, took back his
commitment to Auburn and said he'll sign with Maryland on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm firm on going there,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is expected to be joined at Maryland by Washington
teammates Kennis Kennedy, a 6-foot-3, 170-pound wide receiver, and
Kenny Arnold, a 6-4, 205-pound safety.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he changed his mind after a visit Thursday from
Tigers coach Tommy Tuberville, who, according to Harrison,
indicated that Auburn would sign two quarterbacks on Wednesday and
two more next year. The Tigers already have two quarterbacks _ Ben
Leard and Gabe Gross _ on scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he was also told by Allen Tillman of Newton,
Miss., another highly regarded quarterback who has committed to
Auburn, that Tuberville planned on moving Harrison to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I was going to play quarterback, but I wasn't
sure that was going to happen at Auburn,'' Harrison said. ``I felt
like I was being lied to. ... If I don't have trust in the head
coach, why should I go to that school? I didn't trust Coach
Tuberville, so why should I go to Auburn?''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, rated among the South's top quarterbacks, was
considering Georgia Tech, but he eliminated the Yellow Jackets
after recruiting coordinator Lance Thompson left for Alabama
earlier this month. Harrison also considered Georgia briefly after
two quarterbacks transferred out of the Bulldogs' program.

NFL PROPOSAL COULD SPIKE HOUSTON'S BID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday that the
league may build a stadium in Los Angeles and select an owner for a
franchise there later, a move that could dash Houston's hopes of
getting the 32nd expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League did somewhat the same thing two
years ago for Cleveland's $285 million stadium when it put up about
$60 million, which was repaid by an ownership group chosen last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scenario NFL officials are considering, the NFL could
front the entire cost of a Los Angeles stadium, which could be as
much as $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider it as an alternative, and bring it up in
February,'' when league owners meet in Atlanta, Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Though conventional wisdom says Los Angeles will get the nod
because it is a much larger media market, it's not a sure bet, the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough competition. It is a tight race between
Houston and Los Angeles,'' Tagliabue said during his annual ``State
of the League'' speech during Super Bowl week. ``Los Angeles has
certain pluses. Houston has certain pluses. We're going to have to
strike that balance, but you couldn't say that television alone is
going to drive the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. stadium proposal doesn't end Houston businessman Bob
McNair's chances of getting an expansion team. But more and more,
it appears that if McNair wants a team, he will have to buy an
existing franchise, then figure a way to move it to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of that is that Tagliabue said the league could
first choose which city will be awarded the expansion franchise,
then decide later on an ownership group. He said the city could be
chosen sometime between March and May.
</P>
<P>
   If Houston were to get the franchise, it has only one bidder.
L.A. has two.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication is that Tagliabue discounted what has been
one of McNair's biggest selling points, that without a
tax-supported stadium, like the one proposed for Houston, a Los
Angeles team would be strapped with too much debt to be financially
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a big factor,'' he said. ``We have stadiums
like Jack Kent Cooke Stadium (for the Washington Redskins) that
were heavily paid for with private financing, and it worked.
Obviously, we've had stadiums with heavy public financing, like
Baltimore, which is two extremes 45 miles apart from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he saw a silver lining in Tagliabue's comments about
the NFL building a stadium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication to me, anyway, that what they see in Los
Angeles is not adequate,'' McNair said. ``If one of the two
proposals were adequate, they wouldn't be having this conversation.
In Houston, there is a solution. In Los Angeles, there isn't a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that might work in Houston's favor is the effect that
the league privately financing an L.A. stadium might have on
Arizona voters, who are scheduled to vote on a tax-subsidized
stadium for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might argue that the league is asking voters to subsidize
(Cardinals owner) Bill Bidwell so he can build a new stadium one
state over,'' McNair said. ``I'm not sure I could sell that in
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair also wondered why Tagliabue is not too worried about the
debt load of a team in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because Houston is providing $195 million in tax dollars for a
$310 million retractable-roof stadium, its team will have a lighter
financial burden than one in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that any owner would worry about it,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   While many in Houston have worried that the NFL has used their
city as a chase rabbit to spur Los Angeles from the starting gate,
McNair said he believes he's getting a fair shake because the
league wants to be in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that the NFL wants to ``keep the pot boiling
between the cities'' to drive the price up. He would not discount
the notion that discussions about an NFL-built stadium in Los
Angeles was a way for Houston to bid more for a team.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an apparent swipe at the two Los Angeles
proposals, Tagliabue said that having the right type of stadium
will play a major role in the choice between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has proposed the world's first retractable-roof football
stadium with natural grass. In Los Angeles, Ed Roski and Eli Broad
want to renovate the Coliseum, and Michael Ovitz wants to build an
open-air stadium on land being used now for a waste dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have the right kind of stadium, potentially in Los
Angeles, that will be another plus factor (for that city),''
Tagliabue said. ``We know that in Houston we have a
state-of-the-art stadium.''

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Emily Lyons had another operation last week,
fresh scars to mingle with the old ones. It was her 13th surgery in
the past year. It has been that long since a nail bomb exploded
outside a Birmingham clinic that performed abortions, since the
shrapnel put out one of her eyes, shredded her legs and coated her
face and body with slashes and deep puncture wounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, on the anniversary of the day Mrs. Lyons, a nurse,
was blown up, she had a quiet dinner with the doctors who put her
back together, and hoped that the day would fly by, that the horror
would begin to fade again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more day to go,'' and the anniversary and the rush of
ugly memories that it conjured would be over, she said. ``Thank
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanderson, an off-duty police officer trying to earn a
little extra money as a security guard, was hit by that same
explosion, point-blank, outside the New Woman All Women Clinic in
Birmingham's Southside neighborhood. A newspaper photograph, taken
minutes later, was so gruesome that the paper later apologized for
running it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, fellow officers placed a wreath on the city's Police
Memorial in Sanderson's honor. His widow, Felicia, could not bear
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events from the past year are like yesterday to me,'' Mrs.
Sanderson wrote in a letter read aloud at the ceremony. When she
hears people talk about things like ``closure,'' she said, ``I'm
not sure what they really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Robert Rudolph, the man charged in this bombing, the 1996
Centennial Olympic Park bombing and two others in Atlanta, has been
dubbed a folk hero by some in the anti-government and anti-abortion
movements because of his ability to elude hundreds of
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is a former soldier and self-employed carpenter who has
been featured on T-shirts and bumper stickers with slogans like
``Hide and Seek Champion, Eric Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday it was hard for many people here to see him as
anything except a coward and a cold-blooded killer, and new
evidence painted him as even more evil than before.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators continue to promise that they will find
Rudolph, and say they may be closer than ever to tracking him down
in a wild area of western North Carolina where he is believed to be
hiding, they also say the 32-year-old Rudolph did not kill
Sanderson and maim Mrs. Lyons by chance. Instead of a timed device,
like the kind he is accused of using in the bombings in Atlanta,
Rudolph used a remote control to trigger the explosion here, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, said Jim Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge
of the Nashville, Tenn., division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, is that the man some people are calling a romantic
figure watched and waited as Sanderson and Mrs. Lyons walked into
harm's way. Then he set off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the same thing, investigators said, if he had
tied a long wire to the trigger of a shotgun and shot it in their
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's saying, `Darn, I didn't kill her, too,''' Mrs.
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh announced the new findings at a news conference after
the ceremony to honor Sanderson. He said forensics experts
concluded after combining countless pieces of bomb fragments that a
remote control had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a cold-blooded killer,'' Chief Mike Coppage of the
Birmingham Police Department said of the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators speculated that Rudolph switched to a
remote-control bomb because he was disappointed at the results of
his bombs in Centennial Park and at a women's clinic and a
nightclub frequented by homosexuals, both in Atlanta in 1997. In
Centennial Park, 111 people were wounded but only one was directly
killed. In the other two blasts no one died.
</P>
<P>
   All three explosions _ Rudolph is also accused of setting two
bombs at an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs outside Atlanta _ were
from timed devices.
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, he seemed to be making sure that someone died,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're against what he is against, how can you feel
good for him?'' asked Mrs. Lyons, who still has metal fragments
embedded in her body. ``What does that do for you? What religion do
you believe in, that doing what he did is God's work? Garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``People out there should know he can do this to
them, too. There are groups out there who take it upon themselves
to deal out justice. This is what they think justice is. But it's
not any kind I studied in school.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When asked whether Rudolph, who has been called a survivalist by
some who knew him, had the sophistication to make such a bomb by
himself, investigators said he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Birmingham bombing that identified Rudolph, when
witnesses saw him leave the scene in his truck. He was later linked
to the other bombings and charged with them, and he is now on the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.
</P>
<P>
   But as a steady procession of law-enforcement officials took the
podium at Friday's news conference, they could only promise his
arrest; the promise is now well worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll find him,'' Mrs. Lyons said, ``someday.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not sound certain. She just sounds tired.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters, dogs, reward money and 200 agents combing the
woods, caves and houses around Andrews, N.C., have produced
nothing. Rudolph disappeared into the 500,000-acre Nantahala
National Forest the day after the Birmingham bombing, and surfaced
again only once, to get food at a friend's house last summer.
</P>
<P>
   While they do not rule out the possibility that someone may be
hiding him, investigators said it was more likely that Rudolph had
simply evaded agents in the rugged terrain. Woody Enderson, the FBI
special agent who heads the Southeast Bomb Task Force that is
coordinating the investigation, said he believed Rudolph could be
running low on food and might have to come out of hiding to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic that Rudolph is accused of bombing never shut down,
and lost none of its staff because of the violence, with the
exception of Mrs. Lyons, who is not physically able to return to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb deeply hurt the people who work there, but it did
nothing to stop the work itself, said Michelle Farley, 36, the
clinic's administrator. Ms. Farley was a block and a half away when
the bomb went off, and she got there in time to see Sanderson die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change anything,'' Ms. Farley said of the bombing.
Then, referring to Rudolph, she added: ``He killed Robert, and
there is nothing we can do about that. Emily will never be
physically the same, or emotionally the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what he did was turn a soft-spoken, politically silent
woman into a screaming, walking, talking picture of what violence
can do,'' Ms. Farley continued. ``Who can look at her and believe
that a bombing changes anything'' for the better?

TAYLOR BELONGS IN THE HALL, TAGLIABUE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Usually, commissioner Paul Tagliabue's annual Super Bowl
news conference produces few surprises. But Friday, Tagliabue
shocked many at his annual state of the league address by making a
passionate plea to elect former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence
Taylor to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Tagliabue's words changed the minds of some
voters, who will decide Taylor's fate Saturday. Some are
considering rejecting Taylor because of his off-the-field problems
in recent years, including several arrests for drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue disagreed, saying that what Taylor does off the
field should be kept separate from his accomplishments on it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Taylor should be elected, Tagliabue said: ``I
think he should, and I say that without qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame is about performing on the field. And there,
Lawrence Taylor was one of the greatest. I think the public
understands that by making a judgment of an athlete, you're not
condoning, or accepting, what he did off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue had a series of conversations this week with
Wellington Mara, the Giants co-owner who is in the Hall of Fame and
is an ardent supporter of Taylor's election. After speaking with
Mara about Taylor's nomination, and then doing his own
soul-searching, Tagliabue decided that Taylor should be inducted.
</P>
<P>
   The vote will be announced by Hall of Fame officials Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is one of 15 finalists on this year's Hall of Fame
ballot. The others are George Allen, who coached the Los Angeles
Rams and Washington Redskins; running back Eric Dickerson;
defensive end Carl Eller; punter Ray Guy; Marv Levy, the former
coach of the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills; defensive end
Howie Long; guard Tom Mack; tight end Ozzie Newsome; Dan Rooney,
owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; guard Billy Shaw; wide receiver
John Stallworth; wide receiver Lynn Swann; tackle Ron Yary, and
defensive end Jack Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   The voting committee is composed of news media representatives
from the cities with NFL teams, plus five at-large members and the
president of the Pro Football Writers of America.
</P>
<P>
   To be elected, a candidate must receive a minimum of 80 percent
of the vote (29 of 36 votes). But at least four candidates and no
more than seven must be voted in. In other words, the top four
vote-getters will be elected even if they fall short of 29 votes.
Since this is not considered an extremely strong class, Taylor has
a good chance of making it, as one voter said, through the back
door.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a player of Taylor's caliber would be a lock. No
linebacker in the history of football possessed his combination of
speed, power and determination. Since Taylor retired at the end of
the 1993 season, no defensive player has come close to duplicating
what he did on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as Taylor played on the field, he was just as
reckless off it. He was once suspended for four games after failing
a league-sponsored drug test.
</P>
<P>
   His most damaging problems have come since his playing days
ended. Taylor has been arrested three times since he retired. The
most damaging arrest was for purchasing $50 of crack cocaine from
an undercover police officer on Oct. 19, 1998, in a hotel room in
St. Petersburg Beach, Fla. Police said 15 crack pipes were in the
room. Taylor asserted that he was set up.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Taylor was arrested in Myrtle Beach, S.C., for
allegedly trying to purchase $100 of fake crack cocaine from an
undercover officer. His record in that case was wiped clean after
he performed 60 hours of community service and submitted to drug
counseling and random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the arrest last fall, Taylor entered a drug
rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey. Mara picked up the $7,000 tab
for the stay. Taylor said Friday that he was in an outpatient
rehabilitation program, but he would not give details.
</P>
<P>
   ``If guys are asking me to apologize or be remorseful for what
I've done, I can't do that,'' Taylor said in a conference call with
representatives of the news media earlier this week. ``There are
some things I'd like to change, but I can't change them, so I'm not
going to worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing Taylor's possible selection, Mara said: ``I don't
really want to comment, but I was asked by someone, `If Lawrence
got into the Hall of Fame, how would I feel?' I told them I would
feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's wide-ranging news conference, Tagliabue
addressed other issues that concerned the league, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The lack of African-American head coaches. In the last three
years, there have been 24 openings for a head coach and only one
has been filled by an African American, with Ray Rhodes going from
Philadelphia to Green Bay. Tagliabue has implemented programs to
try to change the situation, including videotaping interviews to
bring newer faces into the mix. ``Am I satisfied with where we
are?'' Tagliabue asked. ``No. Do I think we are making progress?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Eddie DeBartolo, the San Francisco 49ers owner who stepped
down after a federal investigation revealed his involvement in a
Louisiana gambling casino, will most likely remain divorced from
the team for next season, Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The expansion committee will recommend to the owners at their
March meetings whether the league should establish its next
expansion franchise in either Houston or Los Angeles. The latter
city is ahead because the NFL hates not having a team in a market
where 16 million people live. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ALREADY, FALCONS ARE BIG WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The time has come to lay the cards on the table. We've
done a week's worth of storytelling, laid out all the Super Bowl
nuances, explored the peripheral issues. Now there is a
championship to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Who will prevail? The Denver Broncos, defending champions, led
by John Elway, possibly in his final game? Or will it be Atlanta, a
team no one expected to get here, still wondering, even now, how
they got here?
</P>
<P>
   Players always talk about the quest for respect. Usually the
talk is gamesmanship, designed to place the burden of proof on the
opposition. In the Falcons' case, the sense of not being respected
is not paranoia, but an accurate perception. In fact, the national
attitude toward Atlanta runs deeper than mere disrespect. This
season Atlanta was the National Football League's Invisible Man.
The Falcons fought, they scraped; sometimes they led from the
beginning, sometimes they came from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Each time they won, the reaction was the same: ``Let's see you
do it again.'' They would win. ``Can you do it again? And again?''
And when they finally stumbled against the Jets, skeptics said,
``Ah ha! Just as we thought. Overrated.'' When the Falcons roared
to a playoff victory over San Francisco, it was because San
Francisco was an empire in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Robinson, the Falcons' 35-year-old safety, said the
doubting intensified the Falcons' appetite for greater success. ``I
think hungry is a word that has characterized us all year long,''
he said. ``We have an appetite to prove to everyone how good we
are. The theme all year has been to win a game every week, and a
lot of that has to do with our own hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   There were doubters, and I was leading the chorus, anticipating
the dream Super Bowl matchup _ Minnesota, definitely, and with any
luck, the Jets. On the surface, that seemed like a great Super
Bowl: you would have Dennis Green and race, Randall Cunningham and
religion, Randy Moss and atonement, Bill Parcells and the Imperial
Coach. Of course, that is precisely what is wrong with these Super
Bowls _ things on the periphery drown out the heart and soul of why
we're here, to see two great teams fight for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the Falcons-Vikings game, maybe when Chuck
Smith stripped Cunningham, the Vikings' quarterback, of the ball,
maybe as the Falcons' offensive line quietly ground the Vikings
into powder, I finally saw Atlanta for what it was. Not a novelty,
not merely a story. This is a great team. Not fancy, not flashy,
but relentless, aggressive, fast and strong. More than anything,
Atlanta is determined. The Falcons hit harder, longer and with more
sustained fury than their opponents. They are better, more solid
from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team is invincible. Each relies on hard work and focus.
For two games this season, Denver lost its focus. Just as the
Broncos were on the precipice of an undefeated season, they became
full of themselves, lost humility and their sense of purpose.
Atlanta hasn't lost focus all season. The Falcons march into Miami
with a sense of mission that is unusual for a team that has won 16
games and lost only 2.
</P>
<P>
   I like Atlanta for reasons that have very little to do with X's
and O's. The franchise's evolution from expansion team to Super
Bowl team mirrors my transition from teen-ager to adult. The
Falcons came into existence in 1966, my junior year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   From the time I was 16 to the time I was 27, Atlanta enjoyed two
winning seasons. That dismal track record permanently skewered the
way I regarded Atlanta. For the next two decades, there was
absolutely nothing the Falcons could do to change my opinion of
Atlanta as a franchise forever stuck in the NFL's underclass.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons still carry a heavy burden of proof. They will have
to beat Denver to be recognized as great team, not a novelty. Then
they will have to come back next season and prove it again.
</P>
<P>
   Not to me. The Falcons have shown character. Their coach, Dan
Reeves, who underwent quadruple bypass surgery and returned to the
sideline four weeks later, gave new meaning to devotion and
tenacity. Reeves is stubborn, too proud, too unyielding. But he
stands for something.
</P>
<P>
   He turned the Giants around, turned Atlanta all the way around,
got out of the hospital, joined his team on the sideline and led
the Falcons into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I'm picking Atlanta because it can't lose. Regardless
of what happens Sunday, the Falcons have already achieved at least
one victory: they have won me over. &QL;

ANALYSIS: POPE CAN'T CLOSE GAP AMONG U.S. CATHOLICS ON DEATH
PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When Pope John Paul II condemned capital punishment
during his brief pastoral visit here, the 100,000 people gathered
before him in an indoor stadium roared with applause, not once but
three times, during that section of his homily.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cheering crowds, in reality the pope faces a tough
challenge in getting American Catholics to fall into line behind
him, a pontiff whom they show every sign of deeply admiring, but
whose teachings many of them treat as advisory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a life, you lose a life,'' said Charlie Allen, 44, a
highway inspector in Boston, expressing an opinion that was
repeated in dozens of interviews in cities around the country
Friday. In fact, polls show that lay Catholics support the death
penalty by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The division over the death penalty reflects an implicit rift
between the popular pope _ who has completed what some think could
be his final visit to the United States _ and his often
independent-minded American flock.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since his first visit to the United States, John
Paul has put his stamp firmly on the American hierarchy, filling
vacancies left through the retirements or deaths of moderate
bishops with conservative men who reflect his own views.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these changes, based on interviews here and
elsewhere, with lay people, politicians and academic experts,
American Catholics at the close of the 20th century are a people of
many opinions, sometimes at odds with Vatican, often divided among
themselves, on issues ranging from abortion to the death penalty,
from gay rights to the place of women in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cuneo, a sociology and anthropology professor at Fordham
University in New York, said this week's events in St. Louis offer
``a powerful teaching moment'' for Catholic leaders, and are likely
to be discussed from pulpits and in parochial schools for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuneo also said many American Catholics hold a paradoxical
view of papal teachings on major societal issues. While they are
often ``deeply respectful'' of the pope's statements, many
Catholics ``use the teaching of the pope as a resource, but not the
only resource'' in forming their own views, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a similar theme, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, an
opponent of capital punishment, said he was ``delighted'' by what
the pope had to say about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will he persuade people?'' Cuomo asked. ``He will certainly
make some people think again about the issue.'' But the former
governor also predicted the church teaching on capital punishment
``will receive even less compliance'' than its teaching on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, a Democrat from Buffalo
who voted in favor of death penalty legislation in 1995, said, ``My
sense is the Old Testament sense, an eye for an eye and a tooth for
a tooth.'' He added that he has ``more than respect'' for the pope.
But on capital punishment, he said, ``It's my conscience, but it's
also my constituency, and the overwhelming position of my
constituency is that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Tokasz also said of the pope's anti-death penalty
statements, ``When someone that great takes that kind of position,
we all have to take notice.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's host here, St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali, said
John Paul is under no illusions about the task the church faces in
propounding this message. ``He's very cognizant of the fact there's
a great deal of support for the death penalty,'' the Archbishop
said. ``That's why he preaches against it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope realizes he must propose truth, he cannot impose
truth,'' Archbishop Rigali added. ``But he's convinced that truth
has a very attracting power,'' aided, he said, by God and the human
capacity to reason.
</P>
<P>
   When the pontiff preached against the death penalty Wednesday,
he summoned the toughest language he had yet used on this subject
in the United States, calling capital punishment ``cruel and
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more dramatically, he put a personal request to Gov. Mel
Carnahan, after an interfaith service at St. Louis Cathedral, to
spare the life of Darrell J. Mease, a convicted killer of three
people who was scheduled to be executed on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, who has approved the executions of 26 death row
inmates as Missouri's governor, said he was ``very greatly'' moved
by the pope's appeal, enough to sign a commutation order Thursday.
But the governor said he still supports the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the cathedral's steps, Diane Gorman, 39, a
homemaker from nearby Glendale, expressed wonder at the turn of
events. ``That someone could actually change the governor's mind!''
she said. ``Being a lifelong Catholic, I've always been against the
death penalty,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another person at the cathedral, Henry Clever, 69, said he
became a death penalty opponent after he and his wife looked into
the eyes of the man arrested for the murder of their
daughter-in-law a decade ago. ``Through the grace of God, we
changed,'' said Clever, who serves on a public policy committee for
the St. Louis Archdiocese. ``If you're pro-life for the unborn,
you're pro-life until natural death.''
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, there is disagreement among Catholics. Candy
Jones, 17, a palm reader in Los Angeles, said she was ``totally
against'' abortion, but not capital punishment. ``I feel, God
forgive me for saying this, that it may be common sense to have the
death penalty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the issue touched off an internal debate. In Boston,
Scott Powers, 34, a software salesman, asked, ``If someone were to
rape my daughter, would I want them killed? That's where your
Catholic beliefs start to falter.'' His wife Diane, 30, a sales
representative, said she supported the death penalty. ``Someone who
has no regard for human life has no regard for his own life,
either,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to the United States five times over the past two
decades, and in publishing 13 encyclicals, the pope has received
considerable news coverage in this country. In St. Louis, Catholic
officials said there were more than 2,500 reporters, camera people
and assorted technicians registered to cover a visit that lasted
only a day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   It should seem that the pontiff was guaranteed saturation
coverage, even with the competition of President Clinton's
impeachment trial. Or did the spectacle of a papal visit threaten
to drown out the complexities and nuances of the message?
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Cunningham, a professor of theology at the University
of Notre Dame, said, ``I wonder how much or how deeply what he has
to say actually penetrates into the consciousness of people apart
from whatever sound bites they happen to pick up?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the pope's teachings, taken together, show
``a deeper vision of humanity'' than what the most controversial
issues, such as his opposition to abortion and the death penalty,
suggest when taken on their own.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontiff speaks against the death penalty, Rigali said,
the pope is also denouncing violence. ``I have met with the
relatives of victims,'' the archbishop said. ``The pope
understands, I understand, the church as a whole understands, the
immense suffering that has been inflicted on these families.'' But
he added, the church is also concerned ``that the protection of
society does not run into vengeance.''

RULING BACKS RELEASE OF MICROSOFT TRIAL MATERIAL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the all the deposition
transcripts and videotapes in the Microsoft antitrust trial must be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   The material includes the entire 20 hours of taped deposition
testimony of William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp., as
well as about 100 other depositions taken by the government or the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy portions of the Gates tape, amounting to nearly eight
hours, have already been shown in court and released to news
organizations. Some of his pretrial testimony, showing Gates to be
evasive and forgetful when facing hostile questioning, has been
shown on television and posted on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft objected to showing the taped excerpts at the trial,
but the judge allowed them with the provision that the Justice
Department and Microsoft could each designate sections to be shown.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, where the trial is being held, ruled that the remainder
of the pretrial deposition testimony must be released because of a
little-known statute called the Publicity in Taking Evidence Act of
1913.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 1913 law, The New York Times and five other news
organizations filed a motion in the fall seeking to enable the
press and the public to be present for the pretrial questioning of
Gates and other industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1913 statute, passed during the peak of trust-busting
sentiment, states that in government antitrust cases the taking of
depositions must be ``open to the public as freely as are trials in
open court.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft opposed the motion by the news organizations, saying
the law was a throwback to the days when travel was difficult and
depositions were the equivalent of witnesses appearing in court
today. Back then, judges often simply read the deposition testimony
and ruled, with few witnesses appearing before the court in person.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over
the antitrust case in U.S. District Court, acknowledged Microsoft's
objections but ruled in favor of the news organizations, saying the
language of the old law was clear even if the law was little used.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft then appealed and the appeals court stayed Judge
Jackson's order, pending the company's appeal. But the appeals
court allowed the deposition-taking to go forward in closed
sessions, and Gates was questioned over three days in October.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appeals court compared the 1913 law to
``Tithonus to whom Zeus gave eternal life but not eternal youth.''
The law ``may well be with us longer than most anyone would wish,''
it added, but ``in our system of separated powers, it is for the
Congress, not the courts, to jettison outdated statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft can appeal to the Supreme Court, but that move seems
unlikely. The depositions probably will be released in several
weeks, after testimony deemed to involve trade secrets has been
deleted.

 &HT;    Buchanan makes his Mark
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Quick, somebody make sure Dan Marino's not in the room.
The following hypothetical question might be offensive, even
emotionally crippling, if it hit Miami's mythological quarterback
flush in the psyche.
</P>
<P>
   What if Mark Clayton had been talked into playing defense early
in his career?
</P>
<P>
   What if all that intensity and athletic brilliance and
helmet-swelling confidence, the same crazy chemical reaction that
consistently bubbled within Clayton's 5-foot-9 frame at Miami, were
devoted to the destruction of passes rather than their certain
completion?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is before us at Super Bowl XXXIII, a player of
similar size and sizzle, with the bonus bond of having played
college football at Louisville, just like Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   He's Ray Buchanan, Pro Bowl cornerback, and if the Atlanta
Falcons upset Denver on Sunday for the NFL title, he will be doing
Clayton one better. Not an easy task, as longtime Dolphins fans
remember, but Big Play Ray is accustomed to getting what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   And what he wants is the football. It was the same at
Louisville, where he flirted with transferring because Howard
Schnellenberger switched Buchanan from running back to the
secondary. It was the same in Buchanan's first full season as an
NFL starter at Indianapolis, in 1994, when he returned three
interceptions for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   One of those scoring plays came on Buchanan's first game playing
cornerback for the Colts rather than safety, and Marino was the
quarterback he victimized. Dolphin Dan might as well have locked
onto Clayton, so sudden was the end-zone celebration.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Dan Reeves got a look at that play in his video review
of the best NFL free agents available in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into his stay as Atlanta coach, Reeves made two major
moves to fuel the franchise's renovation. The first was a trade for
quarterback Chris Chandler, who became the offense's instant
leader. The second was the signing of Buchanan, a four-year, $13
million contract that at the time seemed outrageously rich for any
cornerback but Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came to Atlanta and tried to evaluate, they were
last in almost every category defensively,'' Reeves said. ``We felt
like we had to improve defensively, and that was the reason for the
Ray Buchanan deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging teams defensively, in Reeves' mind, meant charging
every available player at quarterbacks and stationing a select few
downfield to handle the escapees. Buchanan's specialty is single
coverage on the opponent's top receiver, daring John Elway or
anyone else to put one past him.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times in 1998 that gamble resulted in a Buchanan
interception. Four of those picks came in the season's second half,
when the Falcons were driving toward a 14-2 record and the NFC West
title.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a Super Bowl trip on the line, Buchanan and rookie
cornerback Michael Booker jammed Randy Moss and Cris Carter early
and often in the NFC title game. Moss caught just one pass for 4
yards after halftime and the Falcons scored a stunning upset.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Buchanan was the first to bite at the Falcons'
underdog status in the Super Bowl, guaranteeing a victory on
national television before the teams had even arrived in Miami,
then wearing a silver-studded dog's leash at the Pro Player Stadium
photo day to emphasize the canine categorization.
</P>
<P>
   During the week's otherwise dull Super Bowl media sessions,
Buchanan snapped in direct opposition to Denver tight end Shannon
Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, according to Buchanan, is as ugly as Mr. Ed. Generously,
he declined to specify which end of the talking TV horse he had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can't speak for the whole team,'' Buchanan said,
``but I tell you the spirit of this football team right now is the
belief that we can go out there and win. It's not a slap in
Denver's face. This is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In deference, then, to the facts, Buchanan will spend his time
Sunday covering Denver's wide receivers, home-run threat Rod Smith
and sneaky, third-down target Ed McCaffrey. The feud with Sharpe is
good theater but an actual collision with the Broncos' muscular
mouthpiece would be bad physics for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for the possibility of meeting Terrell Davis
downfield. If Denver's 2,000-yard rusher makes it that far,
Atlanta's front four and linebackers won't be doing their most
basic job. Of course, Buchanan doesn't see that, or anything else
remotely negative, happening to the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my confidence as a football player that I think will help
us win this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't hurt. Neither would letting Big Play Ray himself go out
for a pass every now and again. That, too, would be right on the
Mark.

 Super Audience for TV Ads  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Only one thing can make a young company like Monster.com blow 15
percent of its annual advertising budget in 90 seconds: the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers throw out the rule book when it comes to the Big
Game. The audience is unparalleled _ 133 million viewers, almost
half the population of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, a Super Bowl spot is viewed almost as corporate
ginseng _ a one-shot panacea that not only sells product but
burnishes the corporate image, puts smiles on the faces of clients,
boosts employee morale and maybe even lifts stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, dropping out of the Super Bowl ad fest can be
a downer. When Intel pulled its Super Bowl spot this week, it
provoked speculation that the company is retrenching because of
privacy concerns about the Pentium III chip featured in the ad.
(Intel, which ran Super Bowl ads in 1997 and 1998, says the two
events are unrelated).
</P>
<P>
   In total, about 20 companies are spending an estimated $93
million on 29 minutes of ad time during Super Bowl XXXIII, which
airs tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The game marks the return of veteran advertisers such as Visa,
Budweiser, Federal Express, Pepsi, M&AMP;M/Mars and Frito-Lay.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes are higher for small concerns like Monster.com,
an online job-posting service that bought two 30-second game spots,
which go for about $1.6 million each, and one pregame slot costing
several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, created by Mullen Advertising, features children talking
about what they want to be when they grow up: ``I want to claw my
way up to middle management,'' ``I want to have a brown nose,'' and
``I want to be unde- appreciated.'' The idea is to remind viewers
that there may be a better job out there than the ones they have.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com chief executive Jeff Taylor says the spot has
already started paying for itself in workplace morale. ``For
employees this is a big pride thing,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable
the internal mileage you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, whose company is a division of publicly traded TMP
Worldwide, said he also expects the ads to impress Wall Street
financiers and investors, as well as open doors for the company's
100 salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ADS30 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``It's a marketing power play for us,'' said Taylor. ``This
establishes us as a leader'' in a year when Web recruiting is going
to take off, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor expects the Super Bowl to be '`the kicker'' that will
help Monster.com triple, rather than merely double, its sales this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com isn't the first little-known tech company to
advertise on the Super Bowl. A visually arresting Apple Computer ad
that ran in 1984 is widely credited with launching the ad frenzy
that surrounds the Super Bowl today. It also established the
Macintosh as a rival to the then-dominant IBM personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-by-Tel, an Irvine Web company that helps car buyers find
the auto of their dreams, also got a lot of mileage from its
advertisements on the Super Bowl in 1997 and 1998. Now it is
preparing for an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Although Auto-by-Tel won't be on the Super Bowl this year, the
earlier spots ``were a way to make a statement that we're serious
and to increase awareness,'' said Anne Benvenuto, senior vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, based in Cupertino, is returning to the Super Bowl this
year for the first time since 1985 with an ad claiming that Apple
will be the only computer brand not affected by Year 2000
technological problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple ad, created by TBWA Chiat /Day of Venice, (Los Angeles
County), features HAL, the computer protagonist of the movie 2001:
A Space Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The Web should get some additional mileage from a Victoria's
Secret Super Bowl ad which directs viewers to
 &LR; www.victoriassecret.com  &LR; for a lingerie fashion show. (57 percent
of Super Bowl viewers are men while 43 percent are women, according
to Carat ICG, an ad-buying service.)
</P>
<P>
   Just for Feet, a fast-growing footwear superstore chain, is also
using Super Bowl ads to get people to its Web site. Viewers can try
to win a Humvee by logging on to  &LR; www.feet.com  &LR; or calling an 800
number during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just for Feet, which operates in 27 states, will open its first
Bay Area store in September. It already has 10 locations in
Southern California. ``We're trying to achieve national name
recognition,`` said Mike Traphagan, a vice president with Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi's Rochester, N.Y., office, which created the ads.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ADS30 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One company that is competing against the Web _ the Yellow Pages
Publisher's Association, which is locked in a battle with Web phone
directories _ has also bought time on the Super Bowl for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot created by the Martin Agency of Richmond, Va.,
comedian Jon Lovitz re-enacts the sleepless nights and tortuous
days he spent coming up with the idea for his new book _ the Yellow
Pages.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the last Super Bowl for the Budweiser lizards, Frank
and Louie, and their three frog enemies. Anheuser-Busch executives
said last week they may phase out the critter campaign in the next
six to 12 months because it could be getting stale.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created by San Francisco's Goodby, Silverstein &AMP;
Partners, consistently ranks at the top of ad popularity polls, but
has raised the ire of anti-alcohol advocates because it is popular
among children.
</P>
<P>
   In one of this year's spots, the frogs use their powerful
tongues to avenge last year's attempted electrocution by the
lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch pays a premium _ reportedly as much as $2 million
per 30-second spot _ to be the exclusive beer advertiser on the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Other Super Bowl highlights include:
</P>
<P>
   _The introduction of new ``crispy'' M&AMP;Ms by the brand's talking
spokescandies.

   _A family argument over the features to be included in a Honda

   _Pandemonium engulfs the headquarters of the World Wrestling

 Heart Drug Gets Closer To Market  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Mountain View biotech firm cleared a key regulatory hurdle
yesterday, but has one more test to pass before it wins final
approval to sell a new drug to treat acute congestive heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's 5-to-3 vote by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration means Scios Inc. can now seek final
permission to sell Natrecor.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which is administered intravenously, widens the veins
and arteries of people whose hearts are so weak that they can't
push blood through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Although final FDA approval isn't automatic, Scios chief
executive Richard Brewer expressed confidence that the agency,
which normally follows the lead of its advisory panel, would do so
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that we'll have final approval in time to start
commercial sales in July,'' Brewer said..
</P>
<P>
   Natrecor would be Scios' first drug approval after more than 15
years of research. Up to now, the company has licensed and resold
other companies' drugs for psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Analyst Evan Sturza of Sturza's Medical Research in New York
said Natrecor is aimed at a $250 million market to treat the 5
million Americans who have congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   To sell the drug, Scios has allid itself with the German firm
Bayer AG, which will market the drug in a deal that will net Scios
about a third of future sales of Natrecor. Sturza said he expects
sales to build gradually over the next two years and make Scios,
which has been intermittently profitable, a steady money-maker by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Scios shares was halted at $9.88 yesterday while the
FDA panel deliberated. The stock hit a 52-week-high of $13.63 last
March.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Abraham, a cardiologist at the University of
Cincinnati, was one of the researchers who spent the past four
years testing Natrecor on 505 patients with acute congestive heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in patients with this condition, the heart becomes
such a weak pump that blood backs up in the veins leading to the
heart. The plasma in the veins leaks out of the bulging blood
vessels and fills the lungs, sending patients into the hospital
gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   Natrecor, which can be administered intravenously over a period
of several hours to several days, relaxes and widens the blood
vessels, easing the backup near the lungs so patient can breathe
more easily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once patients are stabilized, they can be sent home to take
existing pill-form drugs that stimulate the pumping action of the
heart and drain the lungs of unwanted fluids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to research work, Abraham allayed concerns of some
panel members that Natrecor could cause hypotension, commonly known
as low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said Scios convinced the panel majority that hypotension
could be controlled by taking blood pressure readings of the
patient while Natrecor was being administered, and discontinuing
treatment if blood pressure dropped alarmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Packer, a top heart failure specialist at Columbia
University and chairman of the panel, called the decision a ``close
call.'' While the company's studies leave some questions about how
the drug works and how it should best be used, he said it does
appear to be effective.

 California Says Cheese   By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Americans from Pensacola to the Puget Sound associate California
with quality wine, vegetables and movies. Now California cheese
makers want a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the California Milk Advisory Board, the sponsor of
the ``It's the Cheese`` advertising campaign that has helped
popularize California-made cheese here at home, is taking the
campaign outside the state for the first time _ to Denver, where
per-capita cheese consumption is twice as high as in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Coloradans will be the only people outside of California to see
a cheesy television ad during the Super Bowl tomorrow (the ad shows
astronauts disappointed to discover the moon is made of cheese
inferior to California's).
</P>
<P>
   Print ads and billboards (``It's from California, but we mean
that in a nice way'') will also appear in and around Denver. The
campaign was created by McCann-Erickson San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the expansion of the campaign, which was launched
in California in mid-1995, to one new out-of-state market each
year, covering the western United States first and moving east of
the Mississippi in about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Financed by fees levied on dairy farmers, the campaign's goal is
to give California cheeses the same cachet as comestibles such as
vegetables, chocolate and wine.
</P>
<P>
   While California surpassed Wisconsin as the leading milk
producing state in 1993, and is &LR;   &LR; gaining in the cheese department,
dairy products are not typically associated with the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The wry ``It's the Cheese'' ads, which attribute California's
allure to its cheese _ and indulge in an occasional dig at ``the
Wisconsin stuff'' _ appear to be having their desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CHEESE30 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Last year, sales of cheese in California grew three times as fast
as sales in the nation as a whole (3.7 percent compared to 1.2
percent), according to supermarket scanner data from A.C. Nielsen.
Prior to the campaign, rates were about equal.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness of the Real California Cheese logo, which appears on
about 95 percent of California cheeses, has also made strides.
Two-thirds of Californians now say they have noticed the seal and
90 percent of those people reported buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a Real California Cheese logo on everything we make in
our (Turlock) plant,'' said Philippe Surget, a vice president of
Besnier USA, a division of France's largest cheese maker.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Besnier has the option of playing up its French
roots, '`Clearly we want people to know these cheeses are made in
California because we feel it's a selling point,'' Surget said.
</P>
<P>
   While the California ``brand'' grows stronger, cheese from rival
Wisconsin is taking a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Gallop tracking polls taken since the campaign started have
found that the number of consumers who mention California when
asked about cheese has risen by 14 percent, while the number
specifying Wisconsin has dropped 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty strong showing for a product that, while high in
quality, even its promoters admit isn't appreciably tastier than
cheese made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying our cheeses are better than other states',
we're just saying you should have a preference for California
cheeses,'' said milk board chief executive Adri Boudewyn, employing
the logic of a marketer.
</P>
<P>
   While most Californians have seen the ``It's the Cheese'' ads
and Real California Cheese seal, much of the California Milk
Advisory Board's salesmanship takes place behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The organization lobbied 15 major supermarket chains operating
here to persuade them to use California cheese in their private
label lines. (Private label is a retailer's own brand of products,
like Safeway Select.)
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the milk board push, only three of the major chains
included California cheese in their private label lines; now all of
them do.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets' support of California cheese is attributable
partly to the It's the Cheese advertising, which drives sales and
other promotions such as in-store samplings sponsored by the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board has also hosted tastings for chefs and food writers on
the East and West coasts to familiarize them with California
cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   On the supply side, the board is encouraging production of
cheeses not currently made here. Specialty cheese is the fastest
growing segment of the market and ``retailers demand the full
line-up'' of varieties, said Boudewyn.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CHEESE30 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Ten years ago, California's cheese production was mostly confined
to low-margin, low-status ``commodity'' cheeses such as mozzarella
and cheddar, which are sold largely as ingredients in foods such as
frozen enchiladas or fast-food pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The number of styles and varieties of cheeses sold in California
has grown from 70 to 130 in the last two years, but there are still
some gaps. Next month, for example, the first Swiss cheese plant
will go online.
</P>
<P>
   Through ads in trade publications, the board is recruiting
specialty cheesemakers from places like Italy, Utah and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Swiss and Muenster and we got that,'' said Boudewyn.
``Now we're looking to manufacture some others like blue cheese,
Gorgonzola, Limburger and Romano.''
</P>
<P>
   California's dairy families, most of whom sell their milk to
processors and miss out on the higher margins of cheese, are also
getting into the act.
</P>
<P>
   The board sponsors cheese-making classes for these families to
learn to make ``farmstead'' cheeses, meaning the cheese and milk it
comes from are produced on the same farm. Five families have begun
production and Boudewyn hopes that number will increase to about 20
in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Boudewyn says California is on track to surpass Wisconsin as the
largest cheese-producing state by 2004 or 2005. Production has
burgeoned from a tiny 17.5 million pounds in 1970 to 702.2 million
in 1990 and an estimated 1.25 billion pounds last year.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top national security advisers
decided Friday that the United States should commit several
thousand ground troops to an international force in Kosovo to
monitor an eventual cease-fire there, according to administration
officials and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were promoting the plan around Capitol
Hill on Friday before discussing it with Clinton on Monday.

   At the same time the United States and its allies, meeting in
London, on Friday ordered the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo to
sit down to a tight schedule of peace talks. NATO is expected to
vote on Saturday to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they
do not agree to a political settlement of autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative plan, as outlined by administration and
congressional officials, would involve 2,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops
in a NATO force of more than 20,000 ground troops to monitor a
cease-fire in the separatist province of Kosovo, which has been
torn by warfare. Those troops could remain in Kosovo for as long as
three years under one of the proposals, according to a
congressional official.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the French and the British announced that they
would send ground troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case the administration is making is to say the Europeans
can't handle this themselves,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
``The larger question is whether we should commit troops. They want
to commit, but the mood of my colleagues is extremely skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   More meetings are scheduled through the weekend to refine
details of a possible NATO air strike and of the components of a
NATO ground force that would enforce a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of another troop commitment in the Balkans,
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the new chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said he gave his full support to the
administration's plans when the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, telephoned him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we have no choice but to commit
ground troops, and I'll have to lead that effort to convince the
Senate,'' said Warner, who added that he had been urging the
administration for weeks to make such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made an enormous investment in Bosnia,'' he said, ``A
continuing destabilized Kosovo will put our people at risk and
bring to a halt the creeping progress being made there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong meeting Friday, the president's senior advisers
also discussed the immediate problem of how to persuade the two
warring parties in Kosovo to accept a cease-fire, according to P.J.
Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are 700 unarmed monitors operating under the auspices of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on patrol
now in Kosovo. They will be especially vulnerable to being taken
hostage or being attacked during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an administration official, the monitors could
be removed from the region within eight hours in the event of a
decision to carry out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovo continued unabated Friday. In the town of
Rogovo more than 24 ethnic Albanians were found shot, according to
the OSCE. Monitors said it appeared that the killings were in
revenge for the shooting of a Serbian policeman by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern was behind the massacre at Racak two weeks
ago, where 45 ethnic Albanians were shot at close range by Serbian
forces after the Kosovo Liberation Army killed four Serbian police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition of such attacks, with the Serbian forces having
far superior weapons and numbers of policemen and soldiers, pushed
the NATO allies into seeking a speedy solution and backing it up
with the threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was not impressed with the bombing proposals
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that the kind of air strikes that are being
contemplated would convince Milosevic to sign a cease-fire,'' he
said. ``They are not strong enough or sustained enough to inflict
significant damage on Milosevic's military capability.``
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to formally present its plans for
troops to Congress once the president agrees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seven senators sent the president a letter Friday urging that
the United States, in concert with NATO, take military action
against Milosevic. It was signed by Evan Bayh of Indiana, Bob
Graham of Florida, Charles Robb of Virginia, Dianne Feinstein of
California, and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, all Democrats; and
by Richard Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter warned that a delay in action ``may result in more
innocent civilian casualties and in the questioning of NATO's
ability to preserve peace in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But those sentiments will be challenged by other senators who
remember the administration's earlier promises that the
peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, begun after the signing of the
Dayton accord, would have a definite ending _ a promise that was
repeated twice but has yet to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton accords, will not
take part in the coming talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say Holbrooke has been heavily
involved in helping shape U.S. policy in response to the recent
crisis in Kosovo, even as he has struggled to reach a settlement
with the Justice Department to end an ethics investigation that has
sidetracked his nomination to the position of chief delegate to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, Dick has been an important participant _
at least by phone _ in every major conversation on this subject
over the last two weeks,'' a senior administration official said.
``That cell phone is glued to his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they know of no plans for
Holbrooke, who is as close to Milosevic as anyone in the
administration, to travel to Belgrade to deliver an ultimatum. But
they say it is an option that will be considered if NATO gets much
closer to a military strike against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who lives in New York, where he is vice chairman of
the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston, was
traveling Friday in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on private
business. Friends said he had no immediate plans to travel to the
Balkans and was expected back in the United States this weekend.

WHITE HOUSE TAKES SHOT AT SENATE REPUBLICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House accused Senate Republicans on
Friday of trying to ``inflict maximum political damage'' on
President Clinton by adopting a plan that could extend the
impeachment trial indefinitely and lead to the public airing of the
videotaped deposition of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his daily briefing for reporters, presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart attacked the Republican majority for making up the
impeachment rules ``on the go'' without regard, he said, for a fair
and constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attempt here by the Republican majority to play
out this process in a way that can inflict maximum political damage
on the president,'' Lockhart charged. ``That was the game plan in
the House (impeachment proceedings), and I think we're seeing some
of that in the Senate now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the 54-44 vote Thursday along party lines by which
the Republicans passed their own procedural blueprint for the
balance of the trial, Lockhart said the rules were being written
``on the back of an envelope`` that could be ripped up at any time
if things don't suit the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some understandable anxiety among the White
House team that the resolution is constructed in a way that
provides a series of escape hatches so that the rules can be
changed at any time, opening this up to new witnesses, new
evidence, and allowing this trial to go on endlessly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, insisted that their plan would likely lead
to a final vote by Feb. 12 on whether to convict Clinton of the
perjury and obstruction of justice allegations filed against him by
the Republican-controlled House and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., told reporters there was ``better
than a 50-50 chance'' that the trial would be over within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also reiterated his
view that, barring any new evidence in the case, that the trial
would end by noon, Feb. 12, as outlined in the Republican
procedural plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan passed Thursday without any Democratic
support sets forth the rules for taking depositions from Lewinsky,
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney
Blumenthal. Once the depositions have been taken, the Senate will
decide whether to make excerpts of the videotapes of their
testimony public or whether to allow them to testify in live
proceedings on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas ordering the three witnesses to appear for depositions
next week were sent out Friday by the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
Lewinsky will be deposed Monday by both House prosecutors and
Clinton's lawyers. Jordan is scheduled to be deposed Tuesday and
Blumenthal on Wednesday. Each deposition is expected to take eight
hours, with the time divided evenly between the prosecution and
defense teams.
</P>
<P>
   The trial plan also calls for one senator from each side of the
aisle to sit in on the depositions, to be taken in a secure Capitol
room normally reserved for intelligence briefings. The Republicans
announced Friday that Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio would attend the
Lewinsky proceeding. Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee will sit on
the Jordan deposition, and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania will
be at Blumenthal's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will be represented by Sens. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and John Edwards of North
Carolina. But the Democrats have not decided which deposition each
senator will attend.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' role will be to make sure that the depositions are
carried out on schedule and in a fair way.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to reconvene its court of impeachment,
the first of a president in 131 years, on Feb. 4. At that time, the
senators will consider any motions that either side may offer as a
result of the witness depositions. At some point, the Senate may
consider a motion from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would
allow senators to approve by a majority vote a ``finding of fact''
against the president without requiring him to leave office.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins proposal would allow senators to register their
disapproval of the president's behavior without bucking public
opinion, which is running against any vote that would force Clinton
to give up the office to which he was twice elected.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has angered not only the White House and Democratic
senators but also constitutional scholars who insist that
impeachment rules outlined in the Constitution call for only one
vote on guilt or innocence. A conviction on either of the two
articles of impeachment would require a two-thirds majority vote
and would automatically strip Clinton of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that approving the Collins plan would amount to
tinkering with the Constitution, which can only be amended by a
two-thirds vote by both chambers of Congress and a majority of
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution is fairly clear on this issue about
what the Senate's role is. The Senate's role is to handle
impeachment and to convict and remove. There's nothing in the
Constitution that says you can do half or two-thirds,'' Lockhart
said.

U.S. WEIGHS TOUGHER SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A month before a U.S. deadline for Libya to hand
over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988,
administration officials &UR;  &LR; say they are planning to seek tougher
economic sanctions against the country. After months of diplomatic
maneuvering, Col. Moammar Gadhafi has given no sign that he will
accept a compromise from the United States and Britain on trial
arrangements in the case.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced in December that the United States
would push for tougher U.N. sanctions if Libya failed to hand over
two intelligence agents for trial in the Netherlands by the end of
February. But London and Washington have ruled out their
imprisonment, if convicted, in a third country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a memorial service marking the 10th anniversary of
the bombing, Clinton said the compromise offer to have the case
heard by a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands was a
``take-it-or-leave-it offer.'' If the Libyans failed to hand over
the suspects by the time the sanctions came up for review, the
president said, the United States would ask the Security Council to
approve tougher sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intervention of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
met with Gadhafi in December, administration officials say the
Libyans seem no closer to accepting the deal. Gadhafi seems to fear
that if he hands over the agents, investigators will pursue
evidence further up the Libyan chain of command, the officials
said. The two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, were indicted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is trying to determine how best to shape
sanctions that would be more stringent, but not so onerous that
they failed to gain passage in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that international fatigue
with open-ended sanctions against Libya, coupled with pressure from
Saudi Arabia and others, prompted the administration to propose the
compromise. Saudi Arabia has regularly pushed the United States to
find a way out of the impasse over Pan Am 103, and has intensified
its lobbying on the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has also tried to prod Gadhafi. President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa, who is a longtime ally of Gadhafi, has
also tried to mediate. Gadhafi has tried to use other nations as
middlemen, offering money or the promise of aid in return.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic pressure on the United States came as the Clinton
administration concluded that the sanctions could not be kept in
place indefinitely without an erosion of international support.
U.S. officials say that some African countries were already
allowing Libya to violate air travel sanctions in return for aid.
</P>
<P>
   If Gadhafi does agree to the trial, the sanctions would not
immediately end. Under U.N. resolutions, they would be suspended,
but would not end permanently until the secretary-general certified
that Libya had cooperated fully in the trial, and had severed all
ties to terrorism.

 &HT;    When blocking is bad
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The coach was in the hospital, his heart needing help,
the rigors of his job perhaps playing a part. He underwent more
than 5 1/2 hours of surgery, and would ultimately return to his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   So when that coach, Falcons offensive coordinator George Sefcik,
was asked to quantify the stress of coaching, he simply
straightened his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quadruple bypass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons assistant had that surgery on May 21, 1997, and Dan
Reeves sat with Sefcik's wife, Lorie, in Piedmont Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, 1998, Reeves was lying down in that hospital,
undergoing quadruple bypass surgery, one day after experiencing
chest pains, lightheadedness and a burning sensation in his throat
during a road win over the New Orleans Saints. Reeves had undergone
angioplasty procedures in 1990 and early 1991 to clear artery
blockages, and when he started feeling lousy again in 1998, he
decided to keep it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the symptoms were more intense than before, so
he mentioned them to team physician Charlie Harrison, and was
coaxed into checking into Piedmont early Monday morning for an
angiogram to see if there were blockages. Harrison later said
Reeves was lucky the game wasn't Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were pretty close to some major event,'' said Dr.
James Kauten, who performed the bypass surgery. ``He might not have
made it through another night.''
</P>
<P>
   The angiogram showed two arteries more than 80 percent blocked,
and one blocked entirely. Dr. Kauten used veins from the inside of
one of Reeves' legs and from the back of his chest wall to bypass
the blockages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cool, calm,'' Kauten said. ``It was a shock, but he and
his family discussed it, and I think they had their moment, and
they he approached it in a very calm manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been through so many surgeries,'' Reeves said.
``I think we figured that was the 20th surgery that I've been
through, most of them were football related. I think you always go
into it just like you do a game _ you expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves couldn't keep his mind off games. He held a news
conference five days after surgery and one day after his release,
and had to return to the hospital because of an accelerated heart
rate. Most of the 300,000-plus people who undergo bypasses miss at
least four weeks of work, but Reeves is younger (55) than the
average and in good shape. He says he's at about 85 percent for the
Super Bowl, his third game back on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what role stress plays, but I don't see him
as a Type A personality,'' Kauten said. ``If we kept him away from
the game, he might be under more stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly my coaching routine has changed,'' said Reeves, who
will let backup quarterback Steve DeBerg relay plays in to starter
Chris Chandler. ``I don't have all the energy to do all the things
I would like to do as far as time is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   His adjustments include a new diet (``anything that tastes good,
you have to spit it out''), and a new attitude about pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had too many friends that got hooked on prescription drugs
when I was a player,'' Reeves said. ``So I have always been scared
to death of any kind of drugs. Now I have gone from a guy that, you
know, took no vitamins, no nothing to _ I must be taking about 10
pills a day _ and somebody just said, you get those things in your
hand, you throw them in there, you just hope they're going to the
right place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't cut back,'' Burns said. ``They cut him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches seem pleased to have Reeves back. ``The
silence was deafening,'' said center Robert Tobeck, of news of the
surgery. ``He comes in, and I got a nervous stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people made out like if Dan went down, we might go
down,'' offensive tackle Bob Whitfield said. ``But Dan did his best
work early . . . in laying the foundation of our team, and what we
needed to do to win a game. So we as players knew that we were
going to win regardless. So Coach could get himself healthy, and
we'd be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership was present,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik says Reeves earned his players' respect by being
demanding _ ``insisting everything be done not right, but exactly
right'' _ but also fair. Tobeck said many Falcons were visibly
moved when Reeves returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scary feeling when they were telling us about it, and
then he had the surgery that week and he made it out to see us off
to Detroit,'' Tobeck said. ``You could just tell the pain he was
in. But he wanted to be there and be part of us and send us off.
What an amazing thing. He was getting on somebody at practice
yesterday, and I heard the comment, `Coach Reeves is back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler knew it when Reeves ``yelled and screamed like an old
pro'' at officials in the NFC Championship, because he felt the
Vikings were holding receiver Terance Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Kauten watched that game. ``The announcers were nervous,'' he
said. ``But I knew he could handle it. I would have been more
concerned if some middle linebacker had knocked him over.''
</P>
<P>
   So Reeves is back at his stressful job, for an indefinite term,
vowing only that he won't make his wife of 33 years, Pam, move
again. ``And I'm not planning on leaving her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's glad to leave behind other things: worrying about sneezing
or coughing, tiring while watching film at night. The stress he
probably can't escape. ``There's a tremendous amount in our
business, whether we want to admit it or not,'' said Burns, a coach
for 23 years. ``Lack of sleep, your diet gets ratty during the
season, couple that with the schedule and pace and the travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the coaches who called Reeves in the hospital, Mike Ditka
and Bill Parcells, have had their own heart problems _ Ditka a 1988
heart attack and 1993 angioplasty, and Parcells four heart
procedures including a bypass in the early 1990's. Parcells decided
not to coach next Sunday's Pro Bowl to rest.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday's Super Bowl is goal that leads to the stress.
``There's only one winner in the whole game,'' Sefcik said. ``You
may win a couple, you may win some games, but until you win this
game, you're not anything. That may be harsh, but that's the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   And Reeves will coach this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of people in Atlanta with whom I'm a
sentimental favorite,'' Reeves said. ``But I don't know far it goes
past Atlanta.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending an inquiry that has haunted her for months,
Attorney General Janet Reno declined on Friday to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate whether the former White House
aide Harold M. Ickes lied to a Senate committee two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision represented a significant step toward bringing the
Justice Department's long-running campaign finance inquiry to a
close, leaving virtually no investigation open that could lead to
an independent counsel's examination of President Clinton's
re-election fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable basis to believe that any additional
investigation would discover additional evidence sufficient to
prove that Ickes' testimony was knowingly and intentionally
false,'' Ms. Reno found in a legal analysis of the case.
</P>
<P>
   With the cloud of potential criminal prosecution lifted after
nearly a year of inquiry into whether he testified falsely about
his activities on behalf of the Teamsters union, Ickes said: ``I
feel very pleased and very relieved. There is no question in my
mind that she reached the right conclusion. I was hopeful and
confident that she would.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was pleased by the outcome. ``I have always
had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and
appropriately,'' Clinton said in a statement. Ickes' lawyer, Robert
S. Bennett, said he was ``gratified'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, who in the past had savagely denounced
Ms. Reno for repeatedly deciding against the appointment of
independent counsels, had mixed reactions to the final rebuff that
left the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation
sputtering to a close with a record of about a dozen prosecutions
against lower-level campaign fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., expressed dismay. ``I don't see
how she could determine there wasn't a violation,'' he said. ``She
was willing to have Judge Starr look into the president's sexual
activity, but she has consistently refused to look at something at
the very center of the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of
the Governmental Affairs Committee, which investigated the
Democrats' political fund raising and referred Ickes's case to the
Justice Department, said the decision would hasten the death of the
independent counsel statute. ``The demise of the independent
counsel law when it expires this year may be the most notable
achievement of her tenure,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAFS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed disappointment. ``I don't
wish Harold Ickes any harm,'' Hatch said in an interview Friday
night on CNN. ``Frankly there's enough evidence that should have
triggered the independent counsel statute. It's a very grave
disappointment and spells the death of the independent counsel
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who headed a House
committee investigation of campaign financing, said: ``The attorney
general is once again protecting the president and his friends.
Janet Reno has defied the spirit and the letter of the independent
counsel statute.'' He added, ``Her investigation has become a
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPITONAL GRAFS
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Ickes's truthfulness had confronted Ms. Reno with a
difficult decision. She weighed the matter for 90 days before
seeking a 60-day extension, which expired on Friday. Ms. Reno
deliberated until late in the afternoon as the time for
consideration ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations about Ickes focused on a single question and
answer during a three-day deposition in September 1997 about the
efforts of the Clinton administration on behalf of the Teamsters
union during a strike against Diamond Walnut Co., a California nut
processing company. The teamsters had supported Clinton during his
first presidential campaign in 1992 and Democrats wanted their
support in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate investigator asked, ``What did the administration do
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes replied, ``Nothing that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses testified that Ickes had urged Mickey Kantor,
then the U.S. trade representative, to telephone the company about
the strike, and Kantor acknowledged calling the Diamond Walnut
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee uncovered a Teamsters union memo related to
a 1995 meeting between Ickes and union officials. The memo said
that the union contributed $2.4 million to Democratic candidates in
1992 and suggested the administration consider helping on issues
like the strike if it wanted continued support.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he had asked Kantor to
urge Diamond Walnut officials to settle the strike. Later, Kantor
said he had asked only for a status report.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials and Charles G. La Bella, the former head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance unit, had urged Ms. Reno to
refer the Ickes case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Ms. Reno said she reasoned that Ickes did
not break the law. ``The questions asked of Ickes were ambiguous,
and his answers were truthful under a reasonable interpretation of
the question,'' Reno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The serious defects in the questioning, the relatively
insignificant nature of the underlying event, the extended lapse of
time and the absence of any perceivable motive to conceal create an
insurmountable barrier to the proof of any potential criminal
violation,'' Ms. Reno concluded.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ When last seen riding in a race, Mike Smith
was hurtling through the air from the saddle of a horse at Saratoga
on Aug. 31. He crashed through the hedges lining the rail,
fractured two vertebrae in his upper back and began an agonizing
five-month exile from his career as one of the leading jockeys in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The exile ends in the first race at Gulfstream Park on Saturday
when Smith climbs aboard a colt named Close Up. But his return
takes on dramatic significance nine races later when Smith rides
the 30-1 shot Trulock in the Donn Handicap on national television
against Silver Charm, Sir Bear, Puerto Madero, Behrens, Frisk Me
Now and six other senior stars.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he may have clues on whether his old verve has been
eroded by new fears, or whether at the age of 33 he can rely for
now on muscle memory, the instinct that guided him when he was
riding Sky Beauty, Holy Bull and Skip Away to championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith knows that he spent seven months on the sideline last
year with two major injuries: he also fractured his collarbone
during a spill at Gulfstream Park on Florida Derby day last March.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to hold his weight at 114 during his latest absence
by working out three or four hours a day, and that is crucial in a
business in which jockeys have eaten their way into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost nearly half a year's income before deciding to get
back to the races earlier than predicted. So, what was the biggest
change that drove him back to the saddle?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hungrier,'' Smith said with a laugh and a double meaning.
``I feel great, but I realize it's always different getting on a
horse. I missed riding. But I know it will take time to get
everything back. And if you don't have some fear riding horses,
you're not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys do not usually make comebacks in Grade I stakes like the
Donn, with all kinds of built-up hoopla and promotions proclaiming
that the race kicks off a series of championship events for
handicap horses.
</P>
<P>
   They also do not usually test their mended bones and fears
against big horses imported from California for the race: Silver
Charm, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1997 and the Dubai World Cup
in 1998 for his trainer, Bob Baffert, and Puerto Madero, who ran
second to Skip Away last summer in the Massachusetts Handicap and
the Hollywood Gold Cup for his trainer, Dick Mandella, who also
trained the champion Gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Star jockeys followed their horses East, too. Gary Stevens will
ride Silver Charm, the 8-5 favorite; Kent Desmormeaux will ride
Puerto Madero at odds of 6-1. And Mike Smith, who has won riding
titles at Belmont Park, Aqueduct, Saratoga, Keeneland and
Gulfstream Park during his 17-year career, will ride Trulock, a son
of Conquistador Cielo who has won three of his nine races and will
start from the No. 3 post position.
</P>
<P>
   Smith started the countdown to his comeback about two weeks ago
by riding in morning workouts for Shug McGaughey, for whom he also
rode Coronado's Quest, last year's brilliant and speedy head case.
What does a sidelined jockey do to stay current?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough at times,'' Smith said, ``but I spent so much
time concentrating on getting back that I really didn't follow
racing. I read the newspaper to see who won. But I missed it. I
really wish I could have been on Coronado's Quest in his last
races. But at least I was on him for his last win, in the Travers.
That was his best race. I was injured a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sit and brood, and I didn't worry about my mental
approach to coming back. I did lots of physical therapy. The big
thing I did was keep the weight off. I didn't want to be completely
healed and then have to wait another month to lose the weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fit now, and I've been working horses for Shug McGaughey
and Todd Pletcher. I hope to get my better mounts back, and maybe
pick up a 3-year-old. That may be reaching, but I'm really trying
to get back into riding. The rest will come.''

TRADE BODY RESOLVES BANANA BATTLE, FOR NOW AT LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ After five days of intense wrangling, members of the
World Trade Organization reached a compromise Friday night in the
politically charged banana dispute, which appears to have averted,
at least for now, a major rift between the United States and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The issue confronting the trade group's two largest members is
an accusation that Latin American producers have been illegally
thwarted in efforts to sell their fruit on the European market. The
trade group originally ruled against the 15-nation European Union,
requiring changes in a banana import policy that favored Caribbean
countries, many of them former European colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union revised the banana policy Jan. 1, but the
United States, acting on behalf of its banana marketing companies,
rejected the new measure as equally discriminatory _ even though
the United States does not export bananas. Washington then asked
for sanctions within the 30 days specified under World Trade
Organization rules. The European Union countered that the U.S. move
was unilateral and outside the consensus-based way the 133-nation
trade body does business.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night a deal was struck that ended the impasse, which had
ground the trade body's core work, dispute resolutions, to a halt.
The trade group's top official, Renato Ruggiero, praised the
compromise arrangement as ``a great success for the rule of law
that is at the basis of our system.''
</P>
<P>
   It allows Washington to lodge its request for 100 percent
tariffs on $520 million in European goods. But the stop-the-clock
arrangement delays any European Union retaliation by allowing a
world trade body official to first determine the amount of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is supposed to be equal to the losses suffered from
the European Union banana import policy, and could be imposed as
early as March 12, said Rita Hayes, a U.S. trade diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was ``exactly what we wanted. It was a big win for
us,'' Ms. Hayes told reporters. But it came after a bruising week
of acrimonious finger-pointing, repeatedly postponed meetings, and
public suggestions that the four-year-old world trade body was
foundering.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the trade tensions was the announcement this week by
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that the Clinton
administration would issue an executive order restoring ``Super
301,'' a process in which the United States imposes sanctions on
countries it considers to have protectionist barriers against U.S.
exports.
</P>
<P>
   The action, disclosed during Ms. Barshefsky's testimony before
the Senate Finance Committee, came amid a considerable rise in the
United States trade deficit, fueled by American consumer purchases
of inexpensive foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
   Brussels and Tokyo, both engaged in important trading disputes
with the United States, immediately denounced the step. The
European Union announced Friday that it would seek a review of the
measure at the trade organization's meeting in February.
</P>
<P>
   Four years of cementing a world trade system seemed shaky this
week, as Washington found itself verbally pummeled by other members
of the trade body. While there was no head count _ the
organization's debates are closed to the public _ it appeared few
nations backed the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need an impartial decision on violations, not a decision
by one country alone,'' said Norway's envoy, Kaare Bryn. `We don't
take a position on bananas. It's a complicated dispute that has
existed for many years, but one country can't be the judge and the
jury.''

 &HT;    What Kiss and football have in common
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ I finally found something worse than talking to football
players about football _ talking to entertainers about football.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two days, I've been filling my notebook with the
pigskin ruminations of Sunday's featured performers in the Super
Bowl's pre-game, post-game, and halftime on-the-field
extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching the game,'' Stevie Wonder said, explaining
why he was happy to be part of the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, on Super Bowl Sunday, I drink beer and drive a
car,'' the blind performer said, bobbing his head from side to
side, obviously enjoying putting everybody on.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not as much as KISS, the rock band known for their
elaborate black-and-white face makeup and dungeon-like garb.
</P>
<P>
   The band took time out Friday from rehearsing their pre-game
pyrotechnic rendition of ``Rock 'n Roll All Night'' to talk
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``KISS and football have a lot in common,'' band member Gene
Simmons said. ``We both have pads, we're attractive men, and we
bend over once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take more than a few questions to realize that the
band members had little interest in the game, or even rudimentary
knowledge of who was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Band member Paul Stanley said the band was playing because the
Super Bowl reaches so many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we could get into more homes is with a key,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who said he's rooting for ``the Yankees'' in the game,
was more interested in talking about the band's upcoming tour, than
talking about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to be on stage,'' he said. ``We're not hams, We're the
whole pig.''
</P>
<P>
   When photographers tried to get the band to try a version of
Atlanta's ``dirty bird'' dance, Simmons asked, ``What's a dirty
bird?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``Do we look like we know anything about
football?''
</P>
<P>
   Cher, who is singing the national anthem, tried to talk a good
game, saying that football always has been special to her. But her
interest in the game seemed to be restricted to the distant days of
being pregnant with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be avid when I was pregnant,'' she said. ``Deacon
Jones taught me football.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other football players she named, or tried to name,
were former Raiders wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff, and ``some
Italian guy who used to play for the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   You got the feeling she had little idea or interest in who would
be playing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins is fine,'' Cher said.
</P>
<P>
   Halftime performer Gloria Estefan doesn't care who wins either.
She's a Miami Dolphins fan. Estefan is just glad that she doesn't
have to sing at a cold Super Bowl city, like she did the last time
she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be freezing like it was in Minneapolis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Halftime show performer Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, a swing revival
band from California, has a favorite team in the game _ but for a
less-than-sporting reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going for the Denver Broncos,'' the band leader Scotty
Morris said, ``because we're hopefully playing the victory party
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos lose, he said, the atmosphere at their post-game
Broncos gig ``might be a little tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a real football fan among the performers proved to be a
tough task. The best I could come up with was Harry Wayne Casey,
the leader of K.C. and the Sunshine Band, which will perform a
post-game medley of their hits after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Casey actually seemed to know something about the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to root for the Falcons,'' he said. ``They're the
underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess I shouldn't be too hard on the performers. They've got
better things to worry about than football.
</P>
<P>
   Cher still doesn't know what to wear, or whether she's going to
keep that magenta streak in her hair. KISS is on the cover of
Playboy magazine next month. And Stevie Wonder is far too mellow to
contemplate a contest that is measured by wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will win,'' Wonder predicted about the game.

 &HT;    Inside NFL Films
 &HT;    By P aul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ None of it adds up to a sports institution.
</P>
<P>
   A bored, middle-aged, Philadelphia family man is sick and tired
of selling winter coats for a living. When his 8-year-old son
begins playing peewee football, he digs out the forgotten wedding
present, an 8mm Bell &AMP; Howell camera, to start a hobby filming his
son's games.
</P>
<P>
   Add a few improbable twists and 36 years later, you get NFL
Films started by Ed Sabol, who never had to sell winter coats after
he taught himself to film football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of NFL Films could never happen again,'' says Steve
Sabol, the 56-year-old NFL Films president who was that 8-year-old
playing peewee football while his dad learned to work the camera.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Films is headed to Super Bowl XXXIII at Pro Player Stadium
Sunday to make a movie of game number 7,216 in an uninterrupted
string.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lasted because of the sincerity, the authenticity, the
passion,'' says Steve Sabol. ``We always said we don't make films
for the owners, the players or the league. We make them for the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And those fans include kids with dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on that,'' says Jamal Anderson, the Atlanta Falcons
running back. ``While most kids used to watch cartoons on Saturday
and Sunday mornings, I was watching NFL Films.''
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the league that it covers, NFL Films, based in Mount
Laurel, N.J., has the single mission of all industrial film makers:
glorify the product. But NFL Films has risen above that task with
signatures familiar to every football fan.
</P>
<P>
   They only use film, not videotape which is cheaper, because film
allows for super-slow motion shots of sweat dripping off faces of
300-pound linemen. NFL Films is known for creative scoring with
original and familiar music from rap to rock to opera. And a sense
of humor. It invented the sports blooper reel in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't journalism. NFL Films has no use for mug shots or
court records. But it doesn't waste its exclusive access.
</P>
<P>
   This season's wrapup, The Road to the Super Bowl, premieres 5
p.m. today on Fox stations (WFLX-Channel 29, WSVN-Channel 7). It
includes tirades, taunts, testy coaches and complaints about
referees. A microphone worn by Bret Favre of the Green Bay Packers
lets you hear him tell two officials, ``I've got some advice for
y'all. Take two weeks off then quit.''
</P>
<P>
   No other in-house industrial filmmaker has 73 Emmy awards and
prestigious outside work such as videos (Bruce Springsteen, Pearl
Jam and others) or second-unit work on features (Jerry Maguire, The
Water Boy, He Got Game, When Harry Met Sally and others).
</P>
<P>
   All this from that improbable beginning.
</P>
<P>
   After filming enough of his kid's football games, Ed Sabol was
ready to go pro. With the kind of feeble finances and rock-hard
chutzpah that built theme parks, record companies and TV networks,
he went to the NFL and bid $3,000 for the right to film the 1962
NFL championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners overlooked Ed Sabol's total lack of experience in
favor of a bid that was double the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Ed Sabol and a handful of employees were Blair Motion
Pictures with an office above a Chinese laundry in Philadelphia.
They filmed the NFL season but Ed Sabol was hearing footsteps. He
feared a bigger film company could push his tiny operation aside.
In 1964, he convinced the 14 NFL owners to each kick in $20,000 to
create an in-house film company.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Motion Pictures, named for Ed Sabol's daughter, became NFL
Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first four years the company really lived on my dad's
personality,'' says Steve. ``He was an incredible salesman. The
owners liked him. They felt he was a vibrant person. He was great
at a cocktail party. He was a charmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son. Ed Sabol, now 84 and retired comfortably
to Arizona with a newly earned pilot's license, left the company to
his son who went from a teen loading cameras to filming, editing,
writing and running the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of telling the story because of the
innocence,'' says Steve Sabol. ``We were just a bunch of young guys
who loved to make movies, loved pro football and we wanted everyone
to feel the way we did.''
</P>
<P>
   As an NFL executive who's colorful, Steve Sabol's way down
field, wide open. For sports TV and radio show producers he's a
banquet of sound bites. Anecdotes are the comfortable shoes that
carry the former Colorado College Tigers fullback from show to
show.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotes such as: Vince Lombardi hated NFL Films' Green Bay
Packers '66 highlight film. When Ed Sabol asked him if he thought
anything should be cut, Lombardi snapped, ``Yeah, the throat of the
guy who wrote this crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sabol says there were two critical events for NFL Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a (1965) film called They Call It Pro Football and that
was the Citizen Kane of sports movies,'' says Steve.``That was the
one that (John) Facenda narrated and we miked (Philadelphia Eagles'
coach) Joe Kuharich for sound. The editing was all montage, the
music was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the birth of NFL Films' style.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, cable TV took that style into homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before ESPN, NFL Films was like an underground movie company
only seen (on TV) early in the morning and late at night,'' says
Steve Sabol. ``We went around with a projector, we'd go to church
groups, Kiwanis clubs, Boy Scout groups, the Masons. We'd set up a
projector and show films on a screen or bedsheet or piece of
cardboard. ESPN literally opened the vault for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the films we made in the '60s and '70s never really
seen on television were suddenly being shown in prime time on
ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN made the early voice of NFL Films, John Facenda, a star
just after his death from lung cancer in 1984. The measured, solid
voice is featured on a new CD from Tommy Boy Music called The Power
and the Glory: The Original Music &AMP; Voices of NFL Films.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Films now is 230 employees who produce 2,000 hours of TV
programming each year including NFL Films Presents and HBO's Inside
the NFL. Each season also means about 40 videocassettes _ year-end
highlights for every team plus staples such as Road to the Super
Bowl and a Super Bowl game video.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NFL Films is also handling satellite feeds to 180
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the business end of just-better-than-break-even NFL
Films. Steve Sabol says one-half of one-percent of NFL profits
comes from his operation.
</P>
<P>
   The movie company's lifeblood is the men with the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Steve Andrich, 39, will be shooting his fourth Super
Bowl. He waited through seven years of free-lance assignments until
hired as a staffer four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place you want to stay because of the creative
environment,'' he says. ``You don't have a director in a headset
telling you where to go or how to frame your shot. You go out and
shoot the game the way you want to shoot it and hopefully you come
back with something that makes the game bigger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   A job with NFL Films is not a stepping stone, he says, it's a
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve (Sabol) is very generous and really takes care of his
people,'' says Andrich. ``Not just payroll but the benefits,
vacation and travel. They really keep an eye on keeping people
happy and that's why people stay there so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five percent of NFL Films employees have 27-plus years
seniority. There are only two or three hires a year.
</P>
<P>
   For regular-season games, there are two cameramen. One is
stationed high to film every play while a ground man roams the
field collecting fans, atmosphere and isolated slow-motion plays.
That's the coveted job Andrich will have on Sunday. NFL Films will
use 21 cameras for this Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Andrich will be looking for his signature shot. Veteran NFL
Films cameramen are known for one shot that defined their career
such Ernie ``Immaculate Reception'' Ernst.
</P>
<P>
   Andrich says there will be a touch of big-game jitters on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the stadium five hours early, you've got that
anxiety level building and you're just happy when the ball's
finally kicked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the players,'' says the NFL Films cameraman.

MYSTERY OF STRAY TIGER LEADS TO A PRESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Armed with search warrants and a
forensic arsenal worthy of a murder investigation, state wildlife
agents descended Friday on the property of a woman known to many as
the ``Tiger Lady,'' seeking to confirm their suspicion that she was
the owner of the tiger that was shot Wednesday night after
wandering loose for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Joan Byron-Marasek, keeps about 20 tigers on a
12-acre compound that she and her husband opened three decades ago.
She continued to insist that the cat that roamed loose Wednesday
night was not one of hers, state investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But wildlife officials believe otherwise, and Friday more than a
dozen state investigators and Jackson Township police searched Ms.
Marasek's preserve, gathering evidence that they said would be
subjected to a battery of scientific tests, from DNA analysis of
hair found caught on bushes to forensic comparisons of the
compound's soil with the soil found in the dead animal's paws.
</P>
<P>
   The hair was found on bushes between what investigators said was
an intact interior security fence for the tigers' exercise and pen
area, and a second, perimeter fence with a section that had been
pushed down.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Huljack, the deputy chief enforcement officer of the State
Department of Fish, Game and Wildlife, who headed the search team
at the preserve, said that after a day of refusing to cooperate
with investigators, Ms. Marasek was now helping.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts by phone and in person to reach Ms. Marasek
for comment were unsuccessful. Telephone messages left with her
lawyer were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old, 431-pound yellow Bengal tiger was shot and
killed Wednesday night after wandering in this northern part of
Ocean County for seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many residents here were surprised to learn that
between Ms. Marasek's compound and the Great Adventure Safari Park
a mile south, there were about 30 tigers living in their town.
Friday some of that shock turned to indignation, and some residents
of a nearby subdivision angrily wondered what it all meant to their
property values.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marasek holds a state permit to keep and care for a total of
23 of the exotic cats. In her application for a permit, she said
she intended to breed and raise the animals for use in films,
educational purposes and research.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marasek told investigators that she now had only 20 tigers
because 3 had died in the last year. But so far investigators have
been able to coax only 17 of the beasts into the open, out of a
series of enclosed, hidden shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of getting a reliable count and Ms. Marasek's
repeated insistence that the wandering tiger was not one of hers
made much of the planned testing necessary, Huljack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that the laboratory results may not be
conclusive,'' Huljack said, indicating that it could be weeks
before results are available. ``But if in fact the evidence
indicates that what she has said was not accurate, then you can
draw your own conclusions about what would happen,'' Huljack said.
He would not say whether Ms. Marasek could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the discovery of the break in the perimeter fencing of
the property, Ms. Marasek has been cited for a violation of her
permit's requirement that she maintain a secure preserve. The
violation carries a fine of up to $2,000, but is not subject to a
criminal charge.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Huljack said that the preserve seemed secure and the
animals healthy, and that Ms. Marasek and her husband, Jan, seemed
capable of safely running what the couple calls the Tigers Only
Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Both Huljack and Jackson Township Mayor William J. Allmann said
they saw no reason to close the compound. But as they spoke in the
township's municipal courtroom, an angry resident, Suzanne
Fiorello, shouted her concern. Ms. Fiorello said that she had moved
into a new subdivision that bordered Ms. Marasek's property, but
was never told about the tigers. With her daughters, Bobbi, 2, and
and Nicolette, 3, in tow, she thundered at the mayor:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about this. The value of our house just dropped.
It's not safe and I blame the Township.''

 &HT;    Reeves the heart of the Falcons
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ To better understand Dan Reeves and what makes his
patched-up heart tick _ to understand how a guy has quadruple
bypass surgery one day, returns to his Atlanta Falcons four days
later to give a pep talk and less than six weeks after that will be
coaching his just as unlikely team in the Super Bowl _ you need to
know this story first.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Reeves was a high school senior in Americus, Ga., he
broke his collarbone during a football game. After having a pin
surgically inserted, he missed four games, then decided to play in
the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   In that game he was tackled so hard, the pin bent and he had to
have it removed because he no longer could raise his arm. Besides,
basketball season was about to start.
</P>
<P>
   Americus doctor Bud Robinson told Reeves to skip study hall one
day and come to the local hospital. Dan's cousin Bob went along for
moral support and watched as the doctor numbed the shoulder and
went to work with a pair of pliers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob grabbed Reeves' feet. Two nurses grabbed Reeves' arms and
the doc began to tug, pull and pry. The pin was the size of a
10-penny nail and took more than 15 minutes to remove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob ended up getting sick as a dog,'' Reeves remembered with a
laugh. ``I ended up driving HIM back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, that basketball season Reeves made four free
throws in the last minute to help Americus win the state basketball
title. When baseball season came, he played left field and led that
team to the state crown. As for the old pin, Reeves' mom Ann still
keeps it in a mason jar back home.
</P>
<P>
   Come this Sunday, the big difference is that there'll be no
nurses holding Reeves by the arms. He will have his cardiologist
with him on the sidelines of Pro Player Stadium as he tries _ in
that emotional yell-and-tell style of his _ to maneuver his
underdog Falcons past the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   With that shoulder blade long healed, he's now working on
getting the hurt from his heart. It's not from the bypass surgery _
this deep, decade-long ache comes because he's bypassed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' has been a Super Bowl head coach three times previous _
with the Broncos, no less _ and each effort has led to his team
being stomped. That has led to a nasty subplot this week _ a flap
addressed here later that is full of betrayal, vengeance and just
enough contrition _ and causes some to believe Reeves' current team
will fare no better than his other Super Bowl deflations.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons _ 7 1/2 point underdogs _ are one of the most
unexpected teams to make the Super Bowl in years. Just two seasons
ago they were the saddest franchise in the NFL, a 3-13 team that
was in as pathetic a shape as the current Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves came in _ wounded by his 1992 firing in Denver and his
dismissal four years later by the New York Giants _ and has pulled
off an NFL resurrection of Super consequence. Using castoff players
and over-looked talent, he has built a team that is 14-2 and has
impressive playoff victories over both San Francisco and
everybody's favorite, the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he's everyone's NFL Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the most compelling figure taking part in Sunday's
game _ no only because his story is about heart...but also because
it touches on the total lack of it. And that leads us to a blood
feud like no other in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of it is that Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan and
quarterback John Elway worked for Reeves and ended up not liking
him. Shanahan was handpicked by Reeves from the college ranks and
first served as a receivers coach, then Reeves offensive
coordinator and _ after an ill-fated jump to the Oakland Raiders -
a return to Denver as Reeves' quarterbacks' coach.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Elway was chafing under what he thought was a
too-conservative offensive attack employed by Reeves. Elway and
Shanahan became fast friends and Reeves suddenly was feeling
paranoid. He felt the two were conspiring against him and he may
have been right.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl debacles _ blowout losses to the New York Giants,
Washington and finally a 55-10 drubbing by San Francisco _ didn't
help matters.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves fired Shanahan for insubordination. Elway ripped Reeves
publicly and to owner Pat Bowlen and finally Bowlen fired Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter feelings on all sides have been there for years and
while Reeves' Dec. 14 heart surgery briefly softened some of the
stances, it didn't take long for them to resurface.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Reeves was asked in so many words if he still felt
Shanahan and Elway had acted like sideline skunks. With a wrinkle
of the nose he basically said yes. Since then there have been
apologies, sidestepped questions and forced smiles, but the battle
lines are as prominent as the zippered scar across Reeves chest.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant coach who has worked for both Shanahan and Reeves
admitted there in no love here: ``They both watch each other and if
one messes up the other loves it. There's no question that Mike is
working extra hard right now because it would torment him forever
to lose to Dan in the Super Bowl, and Dan is working extra hard for
the same reason. That's how much they hate each other.:''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Reeves motivation, he has returned from surgery faster
than anyone can imagine. And while that is an inspiring story, it's
also unsettling when you consider his approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is known for his tough guy, old school approach. He was
schooled by Tom Landry, the Dallas coach for whom he was a player
and sidelines assistant in a 16- year tour with the Cowboys
franchise. During those years he made five super Bowl appearances
and won twice _ once as a player, once as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his sidelines emotion _ ``I holler and scream a lot
just like I did as a player,'' _ Reeves has tried to tone things
down since his surgery. He's shown himself to be funny, charming
and emotional _ sobbing openly at a press conference after his
surgery and getting close to tears Friday during his final Super
Bowl session with the media.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he still gets quite tired every day and hates taking
medication: ``I've gone from a guy who never took any pills to
about 10 a day now. You just throw 'em all in there and hope they
go to the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his efforts some things don't change. For a while
Reeves had taken to coaching in a jacket and tie. That formal look
will be long gone by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore a coat and tie because I thought it would help me
control my temper,'' he said. ``I thought it'd calm me down, but I
was getting just as mad and I was even less comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   So the formal duds now hang back in his closet. And the shoulder
pin is still in that jar.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, all that's left is removing the hurt from his
patched-up heart.

SAUDI PRINCE COULD BUY POLYGRAM FILM UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Saudi prince has emerged as the leading
contender to buy PolyGram's movie business from Seagram Co.,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, which has been trying to sell PolyGram Filmed
Entertainment since last spring, had no comment on a reports that
Prince Muhammad Bin Bandur Abdul Aziz has been in negotiations for
several months to buy PFE for $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, who surfaced as a possible buyer last summer, has no
other Hollywood investments. Daily Variety reported Friday that he
has put at least $50 million into an escrow account for the deal
and that former Columbia TriStar executive Fred Bernstein will run
PFE if the bid succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, parent of Universal Studios, put PFE up for sale for $1
billion after reaching an agreement to buy Dutch music giant
PolyGram for $10.4 billion, but found no takers. It has since
agreed to sell off PFE's film library in two deals totaling $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining PFE assets that the prince is reportedly
interested in include the Working Title, Interscope and Propaganda
production operations, domestic and international distribution arms
and up to 18 unreleased films, including the romantic comedy
``Notting Hill'' with Julia Roberts and the thriller ``Arlington
Road'' with Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   PFE's last two releases, ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Very Bad
Things,'' were box-office disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based PFE has about 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Seagram wants to unload PFE to focus on music
since it is now the world's biggest music conglomerate. A sale
would also improve its balance sheet and cut exposure to the heavy
risks of the movie business, where Universal was the poorest
performer among major studios last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, rumors emerged that USA Networks chief Barry
Diller was in talks to buy parts of PFE along with Universal's
October Films art-house unit, but no deal has materialized.

 &HT;    From linebacker to human bowling ball
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On most weekend nights in the offseason, Keith and
Michelle Burns strap daughters Danielle and Rachel into their
car-seats and go bowling. It is an appropriate pastime for a Denver
Broncos player who enjoys collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching those pins fly all over the place, yeah, it's a lot
like watching videotape of a special-teams (coverage) play,'' Burns
said. ``When you are running down under a kickoff or punt, you're
basically the human bowling ball trying to splatter the pins from
the other team. It's not a bad analogy, really.''
</P>
<P>
   And Burns is good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite starting just one game in five seasons, the former
Oklahoma State linebacker has become a notable part of the Broncos
success. At 6 feet 2 and 245 pounds, he has the size and speed _
and, most importantly, the heart _ to do the job. He normally can
be found in the middle of the flying bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has led the Broncos in special-teams tackles for three
seasons. In 1998, he had 17 kicking-game tackles during the regular
season and has added four more in the two playoff victories. His
two stops in the AFC Championship Game helped pin the New York Jets
deep in their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Burns desperately wants to be a starter and has moved, during
the past two years, into the Broncos short-yardage and goal-line
defenses. His passion is for contact; he had 233 tackles in two
years at Oklahoma State. Broncos coaches hold him in such high
regard that they named him special-teams captain. At the initial
media session of Super Bowl week, he was selected as one of the six
veterans to represent the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   During a half-hour interview, he wore his heart on a blue-collar
sleeve as he described his unglamorous role on one of the NFL's
glitziest teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the team to vote me as one of its captains, to know that
I'm one of the guys going out for the coin toss in a Super Bowl _
it's humbling and also an honor,'' Burns said. ``I like to think my
teammates are saying, 'This is a guy we can count on, that we can
turn to when something goes bad and know he's going to be there
with us.' Every time I run down under a kick, I'm doing my best to
uphold that trust they have in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Special-teams coach Rick Dennison traveled a similar path during
his career. Dennison broke in as a reserve under Dan Reeves, and
his special-teams play led to a starting job. Burns has made
strides defensively, Dennison said, but he emphasized that his
contributions on special teams are significant.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway and tailback Terrell Davis cited Burns as
one of the Broncos' unsung players. Kickoff returner Vaughn Hebron
talked about the key block thrown by Burns on a 99-yard runback
against Miami late in the regular season. It marked the first
kickoff return for a score by a Denver player in 1,362 runbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the heat of battle,'' Burns said, ``you do whatever it
takes. If my teammates need me to run through a 300-pound guy to
break the wedge on kickoff coverage, I'll do it. If they need me to
hang back and make the tackle, I'll do it. They know I'm here and
ready to go to war for them.''

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will probably forgo witnesses of
its own in President Clinton's impeachment trial unless the three
witnesses giving depositions next week present damaging new
evidence against him, White House advisers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, presidential aides warned that if Republican
prosecutors drawn from the House called even one witness, Clinton's
lawyers would be forced to examine others and to review evidence
the White House has never had access to.
</P>
<P>
   They have now softened their stance. Clinton's lawyers are still
conspicuously keeping their options open, and may ultimately seek
to call witnesses of their own. But they are hoping that this step
will prove unnecessary, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to surrender our rights,'' one senior Clinton
adviser said, ``but we're not going to exercise them unless we feel
we need to.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton ally said the White House was worried about a risk
beyond delay. ``The White House, for all its bluff and fuss,
doesn't want a live witness,'' he said. ``Even your own witnesses
surprise you.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, he said, is in ``as good a situation as they're
going to get, and any new news, by way of new testimony or this and
that, is probably bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible that White House lawyers will choose to ask
few questions during the three depositions, beginning with an
interview of Monica Lewinsky on Monday, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Votes in the Senate trial this week, the lawyers believe, have
demonstrated that barring an explosive disclosure, Republicans will
not be able to muster the two-thirds margin needed to convict and
remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators said earlier this week that Clinton's legal
team was split on whether to try to finish the trial quickly or
push for extensive discovery to search for additional evidence
favorable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides said Friday that the lawyers had now
agreed to place priority on wrapping up as soon as possible.
Clinton is eager to push ahead with a raft of domestic policy
initiatives. Already on Monday he faces the prospect that attention
to the unveiling of his annual budget proposal will be swamped by
that directed to Ms. Lewinsky's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is to be interviewed beginning at 9 a.m. at the
Mayflower Hotel, said Judy Smith, her spokeswoman. Aides to the
Senate Rules Committee, which is overseeing per diem expenses for
the witnesses, said Friday that they had bought a round-trip plane
ticket for Ms. Lewinsky from Los Angeles for $250.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Senate sent a subpoena to Ms. Lewinsky and the two
other witnesses whose testimony the Senate demanded in a party-line
vote on Wednesday. They are Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House
communications strategist, and Vernon Jordan, a lawyer and Clinton
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is to be interviewed on Tuesday, and Blumenthal on
Wednesday. Unlike Ms. Lewinsky, both men will be deposed at the
Capitol, in a secure room normally used for secret briefings on
national security matters or discussion of ethics issues.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers and the White House lawyers will have four
hours each to question each of the witnesses, meaning that none of
the depositions should run more than eight hours. Two senators, a
Democrat and a Republican, will preside over each deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The room is likely to be rather crowded, though, since up to six
senators, six Senate leadership aides, two Senate legal counsels,
two court reporters and one video-camera operator will be present.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the presidential press secretary, said Friday that
White House lawyers might meet with witnesses before they testify.
``The House managers,'' Lockhart said, ``saw it appropriate to sit
down and have a cup of coffee with Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the depositions will be conducted behind closed doors,
they will be videotaped, and some Republicans are urging that the
tapes be released to the public, a step opposed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee-jerk reaction that these must be made public suggests
that our belief that this is about trying to inflict political
damage on the president has some merit,'' Lockhart said. He
contrasted the willingness to release the tapes with the Senate's
decision to close its deliberations to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adopted rules on Thursday that require a vote to
determine whether the materials should be made public or for that
matter, whether the videotaped depositions would be shown on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart criticized those rules Friday, saying they were drawn
up ``literally on the back of an envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules permit a motion calling for more witnesses or evidence
to be heard by the Senate, but that motion must be made jointly by
Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Tom Daschle, the minority
leader. That would seem to give Daschle veto power over the calling
of further witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart argued that with a simple majority vote, the
Republicans could rewrite the rules.

<P>
   ``The rules can be changed at any time,'' he said, ``opening
this up to new witnesses, new evidence, and allowing this trial to
go on endlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House would like to see the Senate set a
concrete date for the end of the trial, provided that rules were
clear and a specific record for weighing the president's conduct
was agreed upon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the depositions next week are complete, the White House
will have an opportunity to file a motion seeking to summon
witnesses of its own. ``No decision's been made,'' a senior White
House official said. ``Nor is there any reason at this point why a
decision needs to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   In eventually making that decision, the White House lawyers must
weigh several issues. First, they must determine whether any of the
depositions have produced evidence that weakens their case, a
prospect the White House says is unlikely, since all three
witnesses have already testified at length before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a further complication. Some Republicans are
pushing for a vote on a ``finding of fact'' that the president
committed perjury and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   That vote, unlike those on the articles of impeachment, would
require only a simple majority, and would not require the Senate to
decide whether to convict Clinton and oust him from office. It
would also enable the Senate, although without the two-thirds
majority needed to convict, to pass judgment on Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate is going to proceed with that vote, White House
aides said, the president's lawyers may feel it necessary to call
witnesses to bolster his case. But they may not know before they
must file their motion whether the Senate will take that step.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a former White House special counsel who still
consults with some of his old colleagues, said that ``there is
sincere anger at the patent unfairness'' of a vote on a finding of
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it so outrageously unfair,'' he said, ``is that
they're doing that in the context of intense pressures that they
are putting on the White House not to call witnesses and engage in
extensive discovery.''

20-SOMETHING SINGLES JILTED BY MARRIED MEN CAN RELATE TO MONICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They relate to Monica. &QL; 
These 20-something single woman who boast about looking good in
thong underwear. They are Monica's soul sisters, and they talk
about the times they, too, were jilted by married men.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewinsky prepares to testify Monday about her affair with the
president, these woman feel her pain. From the restroom at the Merc
Bar, where happy hour is in full swing, they carefully line their
lips and apply color in hip shades of cocoa and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   It's early in the evening, and no one wants to talk about their
rendezvous. But as the night wears on, and the alcohol weakens
their defenses, they pull me to a corner of the dimly lit restroom
with copper counters and talk about their married men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was thinking about,'' confesses the tall,
pretty blonde, who gets interrupted by a friend who yells, ``You
weren't thinking, remember?''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was saying,'' continues the blonde, shooting her friend
an exasperated look, ``I can't tell you what was going through my
mind and I can tell you that I don't think Monica thought about
what she was doing either.''
</P>
<P>
   The blonde's man was a partner at a downtown law firm where she
works as an administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   His smile, she says, would make her heart skip a beat. But when
he began commenting on how sexy she looked in her short tailored
skirts, she says her heart started racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started having these incredible dreams about him,'' says the
27-year-old. ``I started finding ways to be around him more. I
would try to work late whenever he worked late. Then it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   They began having drinks after work. He complained that his wife
didn't pay very much attention to him much ever since their baby
son was born a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon their cocktail hour moved to her apartment. One thing led
to another. She never questioned his intent _ until she found out
six months later that his wife was pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
   Like Monica, the relationship went beyond sex for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confronted him. I asked him what I was to him. I didn't like
his answer,'' says the blonde, shrugging her shoulders. She washes
her hands and tosses the paper towel in the trash before returning
to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy says her heart breaks every time she sees Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they doing this to her?'' asks Marcy. ``Hasn't she
been through enough? They're just using her.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy leaves the restroom, but later she returns holding a glass
of red wine. Tapping her French-manicured nails against the rim,
she begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an affair with a married man. I worked with him. It went
on for about two years. He never did leave his wife,'' Marcy says
matter-of-factly. ``I knew what I was doing. I took my chances. It
didn't work out. I could deal with that. But then my company tried
to fire him, and they wanted me to press sexual harassment charges
against him.``
</P>
<P>
   Company lawyers spent hours deposing her. Marcy says they delved
into intimate matters that should have been kept private.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' says Marcy, adjusting the silver-buckle belt
threaded through her tight black jeans. ``A nightmare. I had to see
a psychologist. The stress was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are sickened by the sight of President Clinton and the men
he represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pig. Just like Mark. Just like all guys who cheat,''
says a 24-year-old graduate student with long, straight black hair.
</P>
<P>
   She fell for a professor. His story was that he was in the
process of leaving his mentally unstable wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so naive. How could I believe it?'' she rolls her eyes.
``I just thought he was wonderful. We would sneak into his office
and close the door.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, she says he invited her into his office to discuss his
lectures. Later, he asked her for her thoughts of love and life.
One day, when he was talking about his wife, he got very emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a sympathetic hug, and he just attacked me,'' she
recalls. ``I thought he felt something for me. Now, I think it was
a ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Their affair continued through the semester. But then a new one
began, with a fresh crew of coeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped taking my calls. And one day, I waited outside his
office, I could hear a woman giggling inside his office,'' she
says. ``I was so mad. I should have known, just like Monica should
have known.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.
Amparano can be reached at 444-8394, or at
julie.amparano(at)pni.com via e-mail. &QL;

 &HT;    FALCONS vs. BRONCOS: GAME DAY
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _An NFL title for San Francisco in 1981 seemed so unlikely
that when several seasons of misery were followed by a 1-2 start, a
key member of the offensive line called his agent to command, ``Get
me the hell out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets in 1968 weren't considered flotsam so much as
an AFL punchline. The two previous champions of the
down-and-out-to-the-Chevy league lost to the global power Packers
by a composite 68-24. It seemed logical to pay more attention to a
betting line of 18 points than a guarantee from a loud-mouth
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the true AFL watchers believed in us,'' said Emerson
Boozer, the former Jets' running back. ``But we felt that was an
advantage, the same way it's an advantage now for Atlanta. It's
good to be the sleepers.''
</P>
<P>
   This Atlanta Falcons franchise has slept for most of its 33
years. If slumber wasn't anticipated this season, neither was this.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are not monumental underdogs to Denver today in the
Super Bowl; the seven-point line is dwarfed by the 13 1/2 points
that Green Bay was favored over the Broncos last year. But if
Atlanta can win a league title a mere 15 months after starting last
season 1-7, the team could claim the unofficial title as most
improbable Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other teams so radically altered reality and perception
in one season:
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was 8-24 in the two years preceding 1981, had a
Falcon-esque one winning season in the previous eight and two
playoff victories since 1950. Veteran tackle Keith Fahnhorst was so
fed up, he demanded a trade. Didn't happen. Good thing. The 49ers
won seven in a row under a young quarterback named Joe Montana,
molded a strong defense with the unlikely combination of Fred Dean,
Jack ``Hacksaw'' Reynolds and three rookies in the secondary and in
the postseason flattened Tampa Bay, the New York Giants, Dallas and
Cincinnati for its first of four Super Bowls in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falcons remind me a lot of us in '81,'' said Fahnhorst, a
Minnesota resident who had an up-close view of the NFC title upset
over the Vikings two weeks ago. ``It was incredible when the
Vikings were up by 10 a couple of times. A team that doesn't have a
lot of playoff experience usually wilts. But I look at body
language a lot, and you could see they weren't dying. I'm sure they
feed off the whole underdog thing like we did. It's like when we
played Dallas, and (Ed) Too Tall Jones said, 'I don't have a lot of
respect for them, and I don't know who half of them are.' We were
like, 'Good, keep talking.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the NFL and AFL were still two years away from the
merger. The AFL seemed a millennium away from equal footing. In the
first two title collisions of the leagues, Green Bay stomped Kansas
City and Oakland. The Chiefs and Raiders had gone a combined 24-3-1
in the regular season. It didn't seem to matter that the Jets went
11-3 in '68, especially with that year's NFL champion, the
Baltimore Colts, coming off a 34-0 league title victory against
Cleveland. And there was the Jets' quarterback, Joe Namath, issuing
a guaranteed upset in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother us when Joe made his prediction, because we
were of the same opinion,'' Boozer said. ``We actually had to cut a
meeting short earlier in the week because some of our players were
starting to get overconfident after watching film of the Colts'
game against Cleveland. We knew we could move the ball on them. Joe
told the world what we all were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets won 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, former 49ers coach and current club
president Bill Walsh helped put his players at ease Super Bowl week
when he greeted the team bus at the team hotel dressed as a
bellhop. Walsh doesn't believe the Falcons will need such gimmicks,
that Dan Reeves already has created a formula for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has demonstrated one more time that a coach, regardless of
the athletes, can create an atmosphere for the team to be
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh picks the Falcons to beat Denver and calls them ``one of
the great stories in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team has to learn how to win in the early years,'' he said.
``We knocked off Dallas big time during the regular season (45-14),
and we developed an incredible enthusiasm and commitment. It was
like, 'Wow! We can win!' I don't think Atlanta ever got as low as
the 49ers did. We were laughable. We just wanted some dignity. We
just wanted some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   If the no-respect cries link the '98 Falcons with the '81 49ers
and the '68 Jets, so does something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a catalyst, even when people are saying, 'It's
fate. It's destiny,''' former 49ers guard Randy Cross said. ``For
that Jets team, the catalyst was Namath. For our team, we had so
many young players who turned out to be pretty good, like Joe
(Montana). At the time, we just figured we knew a secret nobody
else knew. The catalyst (for the Falcons) is Chris Chandler.
Everybody knew Jamal (Anderson) could run. Add to that Dan's has
heart problems, which seems to keep that team so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Lott, a starting rookie cornerback in '81, echoed some
observations from Walsh, putting less stock in the talent of the
players than in attitude and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, the 49ers and the Falcons, you had a coach
putting in a program to give the team some stability and
direction,'' Lott said. ``You also had veteran leadership with guys
like Hacksaw and Fred Dean. The Falcons have Eugene Robinson and
William White. You also have a bunch of guys who believe in each
other. That's one thing a lot of people outside the locker room
can't understand. I've always felt you can accomplish anything if
you can get people to buy into a common goal. Sometimes people put
too much into X's and O's and the size of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Maynard, a wide receiver on the Jets' Super Bowl team, said,
``I figured out one day that I played under nine head coaches and
42 assistants. I definitely learned how not to coach. But we had a
plan (under Weeb Ewbank). The players are real similar today in
size and ability. But it took a guy like Reeves to turn it around.
It's like the saying, 'I can take my players and beat yours and
take yours and beat mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahnhorst said he thinks that Reeves will take his and beat
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they do it, because I'd like to see them share in the
kind of satisfaction we had the first time,'' he said. ``I just
happened to see highlights of our '81 team on TV the other night. I
was sitting there, and I was practically in tears watching that
thing because it had been a while since I had seen it. I hope the
Falcons get to enjoy that.'' Schultz writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution

joined in marriage, have a powerful man trying to tear it asunder.
Humaira's father, who had other plans for her betrothal, is a
veteran legislator and one of Pakistan's largest landowners. By the
couple's account, Khokar's tenacious opposition to their romance

live, Ken Steele speaks with some gingerness, as if talking about
those times in too much detail might somehow bring them back. ``I

   A SURGE IN 1998 GDP PUSHES MARKET GAUGES UP
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.27 points, or 1.13
percent, to a record 1,279.64, after the government announced a
surprising surge in U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Other market gauges also soared. The Nasdaq composite index
surpassed 2,500 points for the first time, increasing 28.55 points,
to 2,505.89, and wrapping up its biggest monthly gain in 24 years.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 77.50 points, to 9,358.83,
with IBM and Hewlett-Packard accounting for almost half of the
gain. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.08 percent,
from 5.10 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's gross domestic product increased at a 5.6 percent
annual rate in the final quarter of 1998. This marked the fastest
pace in two years and made 1998 the third consecutive year that the
economy had expanded at a nearly 4 percent pace.
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL AIRLINES INCREASE FARES
</P>
<P>
   Several major airlines, including Delta and Northwest, announced
across-the-board fare increases, which if successful would be the
first in more than two years. But some airlines had not gone along
with the price increases as of late Friday, indicating that their
success was far from assured.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT DATA PUBLIC, COURT RULES
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court has decided that all the deposition
transcripts and videotapes in the Microsoft antitrust trial must be
made public. That includes the 20 hours of taped deposition
testimony of Bill Gates, chairman of the software giant, as well as
about 100 other depositions taken by the government or the company.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKTHROUGH IN BANANA FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   After five days of intense wrangling, members of the World Trade
Organization reached a compromise in a politically charged dispute
over bananas between the United States and the European Union,
averting a major rift at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore told the World Economic Forum meeting in
Davos, Switzerland, that the financial crisis of 1998 could become
``the trade crisis of 1999,'' and said the United States would seek
the elimination of enormous subsidies that European nations provide
to their farmers.
</P>
<P>
   SEC HALTS TRADES OF USA TALKS
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading in
shares of the start-up Internet telephone company USA Talks.com
after they almost quadrupled in less than a month, to a market
value of $1.3 billion. The agency said questions had been raised
about ``the accuracy and adequacy of public information'' about the
company, including questions about the status and extent of its
business operations.
</P>
<P>
   KELLOGG'S EARNINGS DROP 40 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Kellogg fell $1.4375, to $40.625, after it said
fourth-quarter profit excluding one-time adjustments fell more than
40 percent, reflecting stiffer competition and less consumer
appetite for cereal. The results were in line with analysts'
estimates, which had been revised downward more than once.
Kellogg's chief executive, Arnold Langbo, conceded that ``our
financial results are disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   NOKIA PROFITS RISE 72 PERCENT IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone maker Nokia reported a 72 percent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, topping analysts' expectations. The
Finnish company's profit rose to 3.474 billion markkaa ($666
million), or 6.09 markkaa a share. Analysts had expected a net
profit of 3.2 billion markkaa.

   France: Investigation Into Diana Crash Ends
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Magistrates completed a 17-month investigation into the
death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in an automobile crash that also
killed her escort, Mohamed ``Dodi'' al-Fayed, and the driver, Henri
Paul. There were no details on the findings or substance of the
inquiry. A decision on whether to bring manslaughter or other
charges against nine photographers and a motorcyclist accused of
chasing the car is expected by May.

   After meetings with the International Monetary Fund, First

refinance its old loans to Russia, once it is satisfied that Russia
is sticking to its proposed 1999 budget. Russia, whose industrial
production showed signs of recovery in late 1998, has been pressing
for a reprieve on a $4.5 billion debt payment due later this year.

</P>
<P>
   With a national election due in less than three months, a
prosecutor has begun proceedings aimed at banning the country's
Kurdish political party. The prosecutor, Vural Savas, said that
hunger strikes held last year in the offices of the People's
Democracy Party after the arrest of the Kurdish guerrilla leader
Abdullah Ocalan in Italy show that the party sympathizes with
guerrillas.

WAVING OFF A RIVALRY, WOODS IS IN THE HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ In recent weeks, many have called David
Duval the world's No. 1 golfer. Tiger Woods, who is still No. 1 in
the world ranking, claims he has not been bothered by the talk.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday at the Phoenix Open, Woods played as if his ears have
been burning.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a four-under-par 67 and setting up an interesting
weekend, Woods ended his second round at four under par (138), two
strokes behind Rocco Mediate, who also shot a 67. Among the players
who finished before play was suspended by darkness, Mediate was the
leader at six under par (136).
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one players will finish second-round play Saturday morning
before third-round play begins, including Gabriel Hjertstedt, 28, a
Swede, who stood at 4 under through 13 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval was down, but not completely out of contention, after
Friday's par 71 left him 3 over par for the tournament and nine
strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Woods, Friday's charge was a coincidence, that he
has not been motivated by Duval's sizzling streak of 9 victories in
his last 28 starts. During the last 15 months, Duval has won nine
times on the PGA Tour, while Woods has won once.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Duval won the money title and led the tour in scoring
average. With a victory this weekend, Duval would unseat Woods atop
the world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   So regardless of how either Duval or Woods feels about it,
comparisons between these two talented young players will continue.
But after taking his turn on center stage Friday, Woods played down
the potential rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win golf tournaments,'' said Woods, who had 13
top-10 finishes last year, but who has not won since the BellSouth
Classic last April. ``Last year, other guys outplayed me, or I made
mistakes down the stretch. Hopefully, this year I'll have the same
amount of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of being overtaken by Duval in the
ranking, Woods said: ``If he does it, he does it. If he doesn't, he
doesn't. I'm playing hard, and he's going to do exactly the same
thing. He and I don't really make it our lives to be No. 1 in the
world. Our lives are to win golf tournaments, and that will take
care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Woods took care of business on a TPC of Scottsdale layout
that has been far more challenging than in past years because of
steady winds and increased rough. Justin Leonard, the first-round
leader, struggled miserably, shooting 7 over par through 14 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods played 20 holes Friday, managing seven birdies and just
one bogey. After ending Thursday's first round at 2 over par
through 14 holes, Woods completed his first round Friday morning,
getting back to par with a 15-foot birdie putt at No. 16 and a
five-foot birdie putt at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   That quick start sent Woods into the second round with momentum.
Starting the round at the 10th hole, Woods birdied Nos. 10, 13, 16
and 18 to reach four under par and stir murmurs through his
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Woods loves the par-3, 162-yard 16th hole, the rowdiest hole on
tour, where thousands gather on a hill and scream as soon as each
player tees off. Two years ago, Woods sent the gallery into a
frenzy with a hole-in-one at No. 16, pumping his fists and
imploring the gallery to raise the roof, a scene that has been
replayed thousands of times on television. Today, Woods birdied
that hole twice.
</P>
<P>
   And in the afternoon at No. 17, Woods made a great par save
after chipping his second shot into the water. Taking a drop by the
green, Woods followed his water shot by chipping in from 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Woods lost some momentum during his final nine holes, when he
missed a six-foot putt for par at No. 3 and settled for a bogey.
But he ended the day with a birdie at No. 9, hitting a superb
pitching wedge approach shot four feet from the cup, then making
the putt.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods did not add fuel to the Duval-Woods argument, he
said the attention given to both players was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for golf, especially if we can add another
two or three guys to that,'' Woods said. ``Back in Jack Nicklaus'
day, you had Arnold Palmer, you had Lee Trevino, you had Tom
Watson, even Lanny Wadkins or Tom Weiskopf. You had a group of four
or five players always battling.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade, it could be Duval and Woods. &QL;

U.S. AIDES DECIDE ON SENDING TROOPS FOR KOSOVO TRUCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``an eventual'' to ``any eventual'' in 1st graf.
Changes graf that begins ``The violence in Kosovo.'')  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Va., Ind., Fla., Calif., Conn., Neb.)  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's top national security advisers
decided Friday that the United States should commit several
thousand ground troops to an international force in Kosovo to
monitor any eventual cease-fire there, according to administration
officials and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were promoting the plan around Capitol
Hill on Friday before discussing it with Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the United States and its allies, meeting in
London, on Friday ordered the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo to
sit down to a tight schedule of peace talks. NATO is expected to
vote on Saturday to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they
do not agree to a political settlement of autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative plan, as outlined by administration and
congressional officials, would involve 2,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops
in a NATO force of more than 20,000 ground troops to monitor a
cease-fire in the separatist province of Kosovo, which has been
torn by warfare. Those troops could remain in Kosovo for as long as
three years under one of the proposals, according to a
congressional official.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the French and the British announced that they
would send ground troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case the administration is making is to say the Europeans
can't handle this themselves,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
``The larger question is whether we should commit troops. They want
to commit, but the mood of my colleagues is extremely skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   More meetings are scheduled through the weekend to refine
details of a possible NATO air strike and of the components of a
NATO ground force that would enforce a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of another troop commitment in the Balkans,
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the new chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said he gave his full support to the
administration's plans when the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, telephoned him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we have no choice but to commit
ground troops, and I'll have to lead that effort to convince the
Senate,'' said Warner, who added that he had been urging the
administration for weeks to make such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made an enormous investment in Bosnia,'' he said, ``A
continuing destabilized Kosovo will put our people at risk and
bring to a halt the creeping progress being made there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong meeting Friday, the president's senior advisers
also discussed the immediate problem of how to persuade the two
warring parties in Kosovo to accept a cease-fire, according to P.J.
Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   There are 700 unarmed monitors operating under the auspices of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on patrol
now in Kosovo. They will be especially vulnerable to being taken
hostage or being attacked during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an administration official, the monitors could
be removed from the region within eight hours in the event of a
decision to carry out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovo continued unabated Friday. In Rogovo more
than 24 ethnic Albanians were found shot. Serbs said they had
raided a guerrilla group, but the ethnic Albanians said most of the
dead were civilians. Monitors said it appeared that the killings
were in revenge for the shooting of a Serbian policeman by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern was behind the massacre at Racak two weeks
ago, where 45 ethnic Albanians were shot at close range by Serbian
forces after the Kosovo Liberation Army killed four Serbian police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition of such attacks, with the Serbian forces having
far superior weapons and numbers of policemen and soldiers, pushed
the NATO allies into seeking a speedy solution and backing it up
with the threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was not impressed with the bombing proposals
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that the kind of air strikes that are being
contemplated would convince Milosevic to sign a cease-fire,'' he
said. ``They are not strong enough or sustained enough to inflict
significant damage on Milosevic's military capability.``
</P>
<P>
   The administration plans to formally present its plans for
troops to Congress once the president agrees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seven senators sent the president a letter Friday urging that
the United States, in concert with NATO, take military action
against Milosevic. It was signed by Evan Bayh of Indiana, Bob
Graham of Florida, Charles Robb of Virginia, Dianne Feinstein of
California, and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, all Democrats; and
by Richard Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter warned that a delay in action ``may result in more
innocent civilian casualties and in the questioning of NATO's
ability to preserve peace in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But those sentiments will be challenged by other senators who
remember the administration's earlier promises that the
peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, begun after the signing of the
Dayton accord, would have a definite ending _ a promise that was
repeated twice but has yet to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton accords, will not
take part in the coming talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say Holbrooke has been heavily
involved in helping shape U.S. policy in response to the recent
crisis in Kosovo, even as he has struggled to reach a settlement
with the Justice Department to end an ethics investigation that has
sidetracked his nomination to the position of chief delegate to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, Dick has been an important participant _
at least by phone _ in every major conversation on this subject
over the last two weeks,'' a senior administration official said.
``That cell phone is glued to his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they know of no plans for
Holbrooke, who is as close to Milosevic as anyone in the
administration, to travel to Belgrade to deliver an ultimatum. But
they say it is an option that will be considered if NATO gets much
closer to a military strike against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who lives in New York, where he is vice chairman of
the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse First Boston, was
traveling Friday in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on private
business. Friends said he had no immediate plans to travel to the
Balkans and was expected back in the United States this weekend.

PLAN TO MOVE BACK ARIZONA'S PRIMARY BY A MONTH RAISES QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Critics say it could push Arizona back into the
political desert.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the state GOP questions the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bill's sponsor isn't so sure it's the right thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   So why try to move Arizona's 2000 presidential primary back a
month _ to well after California's primary and a proposed Rocky
Mountain presidential vote?
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans directly or indirectly point to Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who launched a presidential exploratory campaign
Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest McCain wants to push back Arizona's primary from
mid-February to March 14 to avoid being embarrassed by billionaire
publisher Steve Forbes. Forbes spent millions in Arizona for his
1996 carpet-bombing television ad campaign, which left Sen. Bob
Dole politically wounded. Dole later became the first Republican
presidential contender to lose Arizona since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain wants Arizona to sort of be defused,'' one key
Republican said. ``The political establishment is basically
accommodating him on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   A McCain spokeswoman denied he is trying to manipulate the
process for his own political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to do the right thing and move the primary to
when it would be the least problematic for Arizona voters,'' Nancy
Ives said. ``He's confident he'll do well in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McCain was one of the people behind the earlier
primary date, and his change of heart is not going over well in
Republican circles.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it would destroy Arizona's chance of regaining the
national attention it enjoyed in 1996, when its early GOP
presidential primary launched Forbes political career and destroyed
Pat Buchanan's White House hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this will not give us the presence and visibility we
had in 1996,'' outgoing state GOP Chairman Mike Hellon said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dean Cooley, R-Mesa, chairman of the House Government
Reform Committee, who was tapped by House GOP leadership to run the
bill next week, also seemed perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal preference is to keep it early so we can have the
national exposure in the media and we can have the revenue of
candidates campaigning here,'' Cooley said. ``I kind of liked that.
I'd like to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also questions the proposal, according to Bert Coleman,
an Arizona aide to Forbes' Americans for Hope, Growth and
Opportunity organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would help John McCain in a presidential bid
to have his home state as an early primary,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   And a Republican state committeeman today plans to introduce a
resolution at the state GOP convention in Phoenix urging that the
state keep the February primary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the John McCain puppet show,'' said Becky Fenger,
chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republican and Democratic leaders originally had
proposed joining seven other Western states in a proposed
consolidated Rocky Mountain primary to take place on March 10,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a House panel in Utah gave its approval to the
proposal, which is being pushed by Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt.
Other states involved are Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New
Mexico and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The idea stumbled in Arizona, though, because the proposed March
10 date would cause logistical problems for elections officials.
That would put the vote four days before one of Arizona's four
consolidated elections, when 42 Arizona cities and towns and many
school districts are conducting votes.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's proposed March 14 primary date, Hellon said, ``is an
effort to accommodate other election plans and keep costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain adviser Wes Gullett downplayed speculation that McCain is
trying to engineer the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the case at all. The only thing he has said is,
`Let's try and do what works best,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To McCain, Gullett said, that means having an election that
allows Democrats to participate and falls on the same date as
Arizona's consolidated vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we all looked at it, it made sense to go with the 14th,''
Gullett said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Western Primary voting day would fall between the
Super Tuesday primaries and simultaneous primaries in California
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature moves Arizona's date to March 14, Arizona's
vote would run into Super Tuesday, when several major Southern
states are conducting votes.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party chairman Mark Fleisher, who supports the
proposed Western Primary, said Friday that he had not been
consulted about moving the date to March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be unfortunate,'' he said of the proposal. ``I hope
they'll reconsider . . . because for us not to have the vote when
everyone else does is going to dilute our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Western Primary has run into problems in other
states. A Senate panel in Wyoming killed it, and Idaho has
expressed concerns about the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, opponents of Arizona's primary also expressed concerns
about the cost and accused then Gov. Fife Symington and McCain of
trying to engineer the date for Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who was then
in the GOP presidential sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm didn't survive long enough to make it to the Arizona
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Symington is out of the political limelight, but McCain
remains the center of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully strange that Senator McCain's advisers seem to be
pushing something that creates the impression that Senator McCain
is afraid of losing his own state,'' said local GOP political
consultant Sydney Hoff-Hay, an adviser to conservative radio talk
show host and presidential hopeful Alan Keyes.

SETTLEMENT BARS AU PAIR FROM PROFITS IN BABY'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston witnessed the likely final chapter in its nanny
murder case Friday: a civil-suit settlement barring the convicted
British au pair, Louise Woodward, from ever profiting from the
death of the baby in her care.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's parents, Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen, had brought
the suit last summer accusing Ms. Woodward of causing wrongful
death. They acted after the state's highest court upheld a judge's
decision to lighten her conviction and sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In a drama followed on both sides of the Atlantic, a jury had
convicted Ms. Woodward in October 1997 of second-degree murder and
sentenced her to life, but days later, Superior Court Judge Hiller
Zobel reduced the conviction to manslaughter and the sentence to
time served, 279 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest concern the Eappens had,'' their lawyer, Fredric
L. Ellis, said Friday, was ``if Louise Woodward became a
millionaire driving around in a Rolls Royce because she killed
their baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Ms. Woodward, 20, may not profit from
selling her story, and any money she gains in connection with the
case must go to UNICEF, the charity of her choice. Ellis said that
all other financial terms were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens' concern about the possible sale of Ms. Woodward's
story stemmed from the tremendous public interest in her televised
trial. For many Americans, Ms. Woodward personified every working
parent's worst nightmare about child care: she combined a fresh
milkmaid face with the ability, in the jury's opinion, to shake and
bash 8-month-old Matthew Eappen to the brink of death in a fit of
pique on Feb. 4, 1997. He died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward, who is studying law in England, has maintained her
innocence. In England, her supporters welcomed the settlement,
saying she had never planned to profit from her story. They
predicted that she would continue to seek exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't totally draw a line under the matter, because
Louise is still determined to prove her innocence in scientific
terms, but in terms of the immediate legal battle it does bring
matters to a close,'' Andrew Miller, the member of parliament who
represents the district in which Ms. Woodward's family lives, told
the Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston Friday, the case that Court TV televised nationally as
``The Nanny Murder Trial'' continued to resonate, though with less
intensity than at its peak. Reports of the settlement led the noon
news, and passers-by at Fanueil Hall Marketplace, when asked about
the case, tended to say that although they no longer debated its
facts, its central lesson remained strong in memory.
</P>
<P>
   James Dawson, 29, an insurance company employee, said he was
``petrified'' about leaving his 8-month-old son with an au pair,
and that he and his wife left their son only with relatives or
friends. ``It's always in your head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bernays, a Cambridge-based writer, said she was writing a
novel loosely based on the case, which she said, had ``made people
hyper-aware of the risk, in a good way, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Kenneth D. Mandl, a pediatric emergency room doctor who
treated Matthew Eappen when he was brought into Boston's Children's
Hospital, said ``there's still this huge interest in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, there was just so much confusion among the public
about the evidence, and Number two, the issues in the case went so
far beyond the case itself,'' Mandl said. ``People's points of view
often had very little to do with the case and more with whether
they thought women should work outside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the trial, Mandl said, there has been a
flurry of articles in medical journals about shaken impact syndrome
in abused children, and that flurry may have sparked more interest
in financing research on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Ms. Woodward's lawyers called for the creation of
a scientific tribunal to investigate into their assertions that
Matthew Eappen could have been killed by the aggravation of an old
injury. That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey Silverglate, one of Ms. Woodward's lawyers in the
criminal case, said Friday, ``Now that this litigation is over, it
actually gives us the opportunity to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the judge afforded Ms. Woodward leniency, more
than 50 medical experts in child abuse from around the country
challenged the defense's old-injury argument in an open letter
asserting that the medical evidence ``overwhelmingly supported a
violent shaking/impact episode on the day in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the criminal proceedings ended. Deborah Eappen, an
ophthalmologist who worked part time and drew fire in the trial
from people who believe mothers should not work, gave birth to
another son in May, a day after what would have been Matthew's
second birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Woodward flew home to England, only to find that the
nation that had overwhelmingly supported her during the trial had
more mixed feelings. Her parents' decision to accept tens of
thousands of dollars from the Daily Mail for exclusive rights to
their story angered other tabloids and the public, and helped spark
the Eappens' civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brought a real ending neither to the Woodwards
nor the Eappens. Gary Woodward, Ms. Woodward's father, said of the
case, ``It will never leave us.'' Ellis said that the Eappens
``live every day with a sense of tremendous grief, and I don't know
if they will ever have a sense of closure.''

SEVERAL AIRLINES RAISE FARES ACROSS THE BOARD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several major airlines made across-the-board increases in their
fares Friday, sending stock prices in the industry soaring as
investors apparently believed that a price increase would finally
stick after numerous abortive attempts in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   If the increase does stick, it would be the first industrywide
since the fall of 1997. But a number of major airlines, including
United Airlines and Trans World Airlines, had not gone along with
the price increase as of late Friday, indicating that its success
was far from assured.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was initiated by Delta Air Lines, which raised its
last-minute, unrestricted business fares 2 percent and
advance-purchase, restricted leisure fares 4 percent. Northwest
Airlines, which has foiled recent attempts to increase fares,
quickly matched Delta, leading many to believe that the other
carriers will go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks good that this one is going to stick,'' said Kevin
Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, which saw its traffic fall as a result of a pilots'
strike in September, had been discounting heavily in order to woo
back business travelers. ``They said that they would be back to
status quo in the first quarter,'' Murphy said. ``Here we are
one-third the way through the first quarter so it makes sense that
they have appetite for a fare hike.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have raised prices on various routes and in various
classes over the last year but a system-wide price increase has
proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Though flights are full and demand is strong, industry revenues
fell 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998 compared with the
comparable period in 1997, indicating that pricing had weakened.
With recent economic indicators for the national economy stronger
than previous estimates, many investors believe that the airlines
are poised to surpass profit estimates if they can raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   News of the fare increase sent Northwest stock soaring 18
percent Friday, or $4.125 a share, to close at $27.375. shares of
the other major carriers also rose sharply: Delta increased $4.4375
a share, to $54.5625; the AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines, gained $4.25 a share, to $58.75, and the UAL Corp., the
parent of United, closed at $62.25, up $3.875.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines can change their fares several times a day by
filing them with an electronic clearinghouse. If even one carrier
decides not to match a general fare increase, the others will
usually back down for fear of losing passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes one,'' said Terry Trippler, who closely follows
air fares as a columnist for a Web site, 1Travel.com. ``TWA even
though they aren't one of the big ones, if they don't do it, it
will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   But an industry executive who insisted on anonymity said that if
TWA were the only holdout, the other airlines might simply raise
fares on all routes but those flown by TWA. That was not possible
when Northwest did not go along because it is too large.

ON SUNDAY WE'LL HEAR SOUNDS OF SILENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The End is near. The Interruption, anyway. And
this has nothing to do with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at 3:25 p.m. _ prophecy doesn't get more specific than
this _ restaurant dishes will stop clattering, amusement park
turnstiles will grind to a halt, movie reels will uncoil before
empty houses and anybody who absolutely has to be out and about
will feel like the last survivor of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   For the time it takes the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons to
play a Super Bowl, the planet might as well stop spinning for all
40 million television households care.
</P>
<P>
   Ski slopes will be open but uncrowded. In anticipation of which,
Colorado resorts have been advertising themselves as the cool
alternative to an afternoon of Broncos madness.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping malls will be as empty as the Linda Tripp Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Even criminals will be shut away safely _ watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's a pretty good day,'' said Los Angeles Sheriff's
Deputy Isaac Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it a good afternoon to venture outside if you can
stand the echo. (At least until the bar-goers get back on the
roads.)
</P>
<P>
   Rob Lowman, the Daily News' entertainment editor, read that
Super Bowl Sunday is a good time to buy a car. So after watching
the Cowboys beat the Steelers in 1996, Rob and his wife Sarah sped
to a Santa Clarita Ford dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mob scene, the way the (salesmen) were coming at
us,'' he said. ``There were probably more salesmen than
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the salesmen lonely because of the Super Bowl, but
January is the slowest month of the year in the car market, and it
was the end of the month, time to fill quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get up and leave, and they were blocking the
door,'' Lowman said. ``I got a pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Lowmans needed another new car in 1998, they did
their shopping on Super Bowl Sunday again. They got another pretty
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe movie theater owners should follow the car dealers and cut
their prices on Super Bowl Sunday. Movie attendance usually is way
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side is that there are some people who aren't
interested in the Super Bowl, and going to the movies might be a
nice alternative,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations Co., a box-office tracking firm in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't make up for the millions whose day revolves
around football.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, movie attendance on Super Bowl weekend was 5 percent
lower than the following weekend, even though the numbers for Super
Bowl weekend were higher than ever because of ``Titanic'' fever.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, Super Bowl weekend movie-going was 46 percent lower
than the following weekend, when ``Star Wars'' was rereleased.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said the Super Bowl's impact rivals that of the
winter holidays, Fourth of July fireworks and national elections.
</P>
<P>
   How about impeachment hearings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's had much of an impact,'' Dergarabedian
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll be watching the Super Bowl at his mom and dad's
house.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl empties Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, where
Sunday will look more like a Monday, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Orange County, a Disneyland spokesman claimed the
Super Bowl ``doesn't affect our attendance at all. Never has.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to believe. Unless they've put TV sets on the
Matterhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a lot of people who aren't football fans,''
said Joe Aguirre, a park publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Aguirre !ital!is!off! a football fan. ``I'll be watching the
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Denny's might as well close during the Super Bowl. Raul
Rodriguez, manager of the franchise in West Hills, said business
drops to holiday levels.
</P>
<P>
   And Santa Anita Park, which used to try to go head-and-head with
the Super Bowl, has learned from that mistake and will hold
Sunday's first horse race at 11 a.m., 90 minutes earlier than usual
on a weekend. The last race is scheduled for 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves plenty of time to get a bet down on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some things the Super Bowl just can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Which was the subject of a Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power study a couple of years ago. The department found that water
use shot up 25 to 30 percent at halftime of the Super Bowl. The
increase was similar at the end of last year's final ``Seinfeld''
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes many people doing the same activity at the same time
for that kind of detection to take place,'' said Walter Zeisl, the
DWP's manager of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   E pluribus unum. Out of many, one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to watch how you word this when you're talking about
people going to the bathroom,'' Zeisl said. ``But the last time we
measured it there weren't any related service outages.''
</P>
<P>
   What a relief, pardon the expression.
</P>
<P>
   If this national obsession with the Super Bowl seems unhealthy,
don't worry. Churches say their Super Bowl Sunday evening services
have attracted as many worshippers as any other Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's wrong with anything that brings families and
friends together, at home and out of the local galleria? It's a
welcome timeout. Real life takes a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   It's Christmas without the shopping.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;

   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A better idea: Have each impeachment witness deposed by this
team _ Don Imus, Rush Limbaugh and Geraldo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Lott says the Senate will have a full agenda when the
impeachment trial ends. But now it's as if the Senate leader is
Representative Delay.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Senate end the impeachment trial soon? Yes, if you use
the word ``soon'' the way the NBA and NFL think of each game's last
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``are basically good people
who want to do the right thing.'' But who, like him, figure they
won't get caught.
</P>
<P>
   The president says he thinks a lot ``about 5 years from now, 10
years from now, 15 years from now.'' Thinking Monica Rodham
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let the hum of our prosperity lull us into
complacency,'' Mr. Clinton says. Especially if it hums, ``Brother,
Can You Spare a Dime?''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``He's so organized he can correctly pick
socks out of his drawer in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley says he'd be better able to attract independent
voters than Al Gore in the 2000 presidential race. Independent
voters, maybe, but what about independent prosecutors?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court says statistical estimates to adjust for
any undercount can't be used in the 2000 census. Should the new
Census Bureau slogan be: ``At All Costs, Avoid Accuracy''?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT TIME, EAT THE PIZZA AFTER THE INTERVIEW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clean your fingernails. Make sure no food is stuck between your
teeth. Polish your shoes. And your resume.
</P>
<P>
   For years, self-help books have been preaching these basic rules
for job interviews. Getting in the door is a good start, of course.
It's your chance to separate yourself from that stack of
applications, to impress the prospective boss with all your
personal charm. The goal isn't just getting in the door, though.
It's leaving with a job.
</P>
<P>
   But some sad sacks never get the word. A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants
about a year ago. The results are a primer on what not to do on a
job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Commemorative Brands, a
manufacturer of high-school and college class rings, by the New
York research firm Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas. Here is a
sampling of comments from the interviewers:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The reason the candidate was taking so long to respond to a
question became apparent when he began to snore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``During the entire interview, the applicant wore a baseball
cap. . . . A few days later, another college graduate showed up for
a management trainee position wearing overalls and sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I asked the candidate to give a good example of the
organizational skills she was boasting about, she said she was
proud of her ability to pack her suitcase `real neat' for her
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wanted to know if employee perks included a swimming pool,
paid lunches at the company cafeteria or a free computer to use at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did he go to college? His ill-conceived answer: `To
party and socialize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He couldn't answer any of my questions because he had just
had major dental work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I gave him my business card at the beginning of the
interview, he immediately crumpled it and tossed it in the
wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I received a resume and a note that said the recent high
school graduate wanted to earn $25 an hour _ `and not a nickel
less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He had arranged for a pizza to be delivered to my office
during a lunch-hour interview. I asked him not to eat it until
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Said she had just graduated cum laude, but had no idea what
cum laude meant. However, she was proud of her grade point average.
It was 2.1.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Insisted on telling me that he wasn't afraid of hard work.
But insisted on adding that he was afraid of horses and didn't like
jazz, modern art or seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The candidate never looked directly at me once during the
entire interview. Just stared at the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An otherwise qualified candidate took herself out of the
running when she opened her mouth. She had her tongue pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She actually showed up for an interview during the summer
wearing a bathing suit. Said she didn't think I'd mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He sat down opposite me, made himself comfortable and
proceeded to put his foot up on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The interview had gone well, until he told me that he and
his friends wore my company's clothing whenever they could. At
which point, I had to tell him that we manufactured office
products, not sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Applied for a customer service position although, as he
confided, he really wasn't a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I mentioned that we had gone to the same college, he
stood up and began to belt out the school football fight song.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Without asking if I minded, he casually lit a cigar and then
tossed the match onto my carpet _ and couldn't understand why I was
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``On the phone I had asked the candidate to bring his resume
and a couple of references. He arrived with the resume _ and two
people.''

<P>
   &UR; BANISHING THE MILLENNIUM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  The year
has barely begun and yet I'm ready to scream if I hear the word
``millennium'' one more time.
</P>
<P>
   This portends a lot of screaming, needless to say, accompanied
by a great wailing and gnashing of teeth every time I hear or read
the acronym ``Y2K'' between now and the start of the next
thousand-year cycle, the name for which escapes me at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   While there is not, to my knowledge, any (legal) way to rid the
language of annoying words, terms, acronyms or phrases, the good
folks at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
are doing what they can. Every year since 1976 they have compiled
Word Banishment Lists, which, taken together, form the List of
Words Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and
General Uselessness.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as you might guess, quite a long list.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to see that this year's list includes ``Y2K,'' which
John Charles Robbins, a columnist for the Petoskey (Mich.) News
Review, suggested be banished until Y3K, if not later.
</P>
<P>
   (I was rather surprised that ``millennium'' did not make the
list. Perhaps the soporific effects of the word have hypnotized the
list-makers into a thousand-year trance or perhaps they were just
snowed in and couldn't make it to the office.)
</P>
<P>
   Another acronym that's not popular at Lake Superior State
University is ``SUV,'' which is short for sport utility vehicle,
though if you've ever been tailgated or cut off by one of these
hulking gas-guzzlers, you probably know them by a different name.
</P>
<P>
   They are also campaigning at LSSU to rid the language of the
``-gate'' construction, as in ``Monica-gate,'' ``Zipper-gate,''
``It Depends on What Your Definition of Is Is-gate,'' etc. This is
a noble cause, and I support it, though I worry about the job
security of late-night comedians if this construction were ever
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have no qualms about doing away with the term
``courtesy call.'' As Al Schut of Muskegon, Mich., points out:
Since when did an unsolicited call become a courtesy call? You want
to be really courteous? Then don't call!
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper business, there are lots of words and terms
that should be banished, but it's probably not worth trying because
they'll just be replaced by something even more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   An example that comes immediately to mind is ``a sense of
urgency.'' This phrase is usually trotted out by newsroom managers
to prod the troops into working harder and faster (for the same
pay, of course, and without accruing any overtime). There has never
been an instance, to my knowledge, where a newsroom manager berated
a person or group for having too much of a sense of urgency; it is
always for failing to have enough. The effect this phrase has on
staffers, of course, is to make them want to flee the meeting as
urgently as possible. Which is OK, because the newsroom manager can
report to his superior that he instilled a sense of urgency in the
troops and not, technically, be lying.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoying phrase that is more common in the world of
sports than in newsrooms (we're too busy urgently sensing) is
``giving 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A player who merely gives 100 percent comes off looking pretty
bad when compared to a player who gives 110 percent or, better yet,
120 percent. Players who give more than 100 percent undoubtedly
have a highly refined sense of urgency, which could account for
their success.
</P>
<P>
   Some other words that made it on the LSSU banishment list:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``armed gunman'' - Does that mean there's such a thing as an
unarmed gunman?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``close proximity'' - I suppose that makes more sense than
distant proximity, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``end result'' - As opposed to beginning results. Or
something.

   &UR; BANISHING THE MILLENNIUM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;  The year
has barely begun and yet I'm ready to scream if I hear the word
``millennium'' one more time.
</P>
<P>
   This portends a lot of screaming, needless to say, accompanied
by a great wailing and gnashing of teeth every time I hear or read
the acronym ``Y2K'' between now and the start of the next
thousand-year cycle, the name for which escapes me at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   While there is not, to my knowledge, any (legal) way to rid the
language of annoying words, terms, acronyms or phrases, the good
folks at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
are doing what they can. Every year since 1976 they have compiled
Word Banishment Lists, which, taken together, form the List of
Words Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and
General Uselessness.
</P>
<P>
   It is, as you might guess, quite a long list.
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to see that this year's list includes ``Y2K,'' which
John Charles Robbins, a columnist for the Petoskey (Mich.) News
Review, suggested be banished until Y3K, if not later.
</P>
<P>
   (I was rather surprised that ``millennium'' did not make the
list. Perhaps the soporific effects of the word have hypnotized the
list-makers into a thousand-year trance or perhaps they were just
snowed in and couldn't make it to the office.)
</P>
<P>
   Another acronym that's not popular at Lake Superior State
University is ``SUV,'' which is short for sport utility vehicle,
though if you've ever been tailgated or cut off by one of these
hulking gas-guzzlers, you probably know them by a different name.
</P>
<P>
   They are also campaigning at LSSU to rid the language of the
``-gate'' construction, as in ``Monica-gate,'' ``Zipper-gate,''
``It Depends on What Your Definition of Is Is-gate,'' etc. This is
a noble cause, and I support it, though I worry about the job
security of late-night comedians if this construction were ever
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   However, I have no qualms about doing away with the term
``courtesy call.'' As Al Schut of Muskegon, Mich., points out:
Since when did an unsolicited call become a courtesy call? You want
to be really courteous? Then don't call!
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper business, there are lots of words and terms
that should be banished, but it's probably not worth trying because
they'll just be replaced by something even more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   An example that comes immediately to mind is ``a sense of
urgency.'' This phrase is usually trotted out by newsroom managers
to prod the troops into working harder and faster (for the same
pay, of course, and without accruing any overtime). There has never
been an instance, to my knowledge, where a newsroom manager berated
a person or group for having too much of a sense of urgency; it is
always for failing to have enough. The effect this phrase has on
staffers, of course, is to make them want to flee the meeting as
urgently as possible. Which is OK, because the newsroom manager can
report to his superior that he instilled a sense of urgency in the
troops and not, technically, be lying.
</P>
<P>
   Another annoying phrase that is more common in the world of
sports than in newsrooms (we're too busy urgently sensing) is
``giving 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A player who merely gives 100 percent comes off looking pretty
bad when compared to a player who gives 110 percent or, better yet,
120 percent. Players who give more than 100 percent undoubtedly
have a highly refined sense of urgency, which could account for
their success.
</P>
<P>
   Some other words that made it on the LSSU banishment list:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``armed gunman'' - Does that mean there's such a thing as an
unarmed gunman?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``close proximity'' - I suppose that makes more sense than
distant proximity, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``end result'' - As opposed to beginning results. Or
something.

<P>
   A better idea: Have each impeachment witness deposed by this
team _ Don Imus, Rush Limbaugh and Geraldo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Lott says the Senate will have a full agenda when the
impeachment trial ends. But now it's as if the Senate leader is
Representative Delay.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Senate end the impeachment trial soon? Yes, if you use
the word ``soon'' the way the NBA and NFL think of each game's last
two minutes.

   ``Most people,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``are basically good people
who want to do the right thing.'' But who, like him, figure they
won't get caught.
</P>
<P>
   The president says he thinks a lot ``about 5 years from now, 10
years from now, 15 years from now.'' Thinking Monica Rodham
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let the hum of our prosperity lull us into
complacency,'' Mr. Clinton says. Especially if it hums, ``Brother,
Can You Spare a Dime?''
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``He's so organized he can correctly pick
socks out of his drawer in the dark.''

<P>
   Bill Bradley says he'd be better able to attract independent
voters than Al Gore in the 2000 presidential race. Independent
voters, maybe, but what about independent prosecutors?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court says statistical estimates to adjust for
any undercount can't be used in the 2000 census. Should the new

<P>
   &UR; NEXT TIME, EAT THE PIZZA AFTER THE INTERVIEW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clean your fingernails. Make sure no food is stuck between your
teeth. Polish your shoes. And your resume.
</P>
<P>
   For years, self-help books have been preaching these basic rules
for job interviews. Getting in the door is a good start, of course.
It's your chance to separate yourself from that stack of
applications, to impress the prospective boss with all your
personal charm. The goal isn't just getting in the door, though.
It's leaving with a job.
</P>
<P>
   But some sad sacks never get the word. A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants
about a year ago. The results are a primer on what not to do on a
job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Commemorative Brands, a
manufacturer of high-school and college class rings, by the New
York research firm Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas. Here is a
sampling of comments from the interviewers:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The reason the candidate was taking so long to respond to a
question became apparent when he began to snore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``During the entire interview, the applicant wore a baseball
cap. . . . A few days later, another college graduate showed up for
a management trainee position wearing overalls and sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I asked the candidate to give a good example of the
organizational skills she was boasting about, she said she was
proud of her ability to pack her suitcase `real neat' for her
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wanted to know if employee perks included a swimming pool,
paid lunches at the company cafeteria or a free computer to use at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did he go to college? His ill-conceived answer: `To
party and socialize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He couldn't answer any of my questions because he had just
had major dental work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I gave him my business card at the beginning of the
interview, he immediately crumpled it and tossed it in the
wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I received a resume and a note that said the recent high
school graduate wanted to earn $25 an hour _ `and not a nickel
less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He had arranged for a pizza to be delivered to my office
during a lunch-hour interview. I asked him not to eat it until
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Said she had just graduated cum laude, but had no idea what
cum laude meant. However, she was proud of her grade point average.
It was 2.1.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Insisted on telling me that he wasn't afraid of hard work.
But insisted on adding that he was afraid of horses and didn't like
jazz, modern art or seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The candidate never looked directly at me once during the
entire interview. Just stared at the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An otherwise qualified candidate took herself out of the
running when she opened her mouth. She had her tongue pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She actually showed up for an interview during the summer
wearing a bathing suit. Said she didn't think I'd mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He sat down opposite me, made himself comfortable and
proceeded to put his foot up on my desk.''

   _ ``The interview had gone well, until he told me that he and

SALT LAKE CITY: of bicycles. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who were close to the Olympic effort here say that
successive defeats changed the tenor of the bid committee's work
over the years. A first blow came in 1985, when the city lost to
Anchorage in its effort to become the official U.S. bid city. Ted
Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City and one of the early
leaders of the Olympic effort, who now teaches at the University of
Utah, said the analysis of that defeat led to the conclusion that
the city should be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we lose? The answer we kept coming up with was that we
didn't schmooz,'' Wilson said. That led to a pattern of what he
called ``extended hospitality,'' which included first-class hotels
and air fare for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   But the real watershed was in 1991, he said, when the city lost
to Nagano by four votes. ``That led to a kind of superschmoozing,
which may have led to this cash,'' Wilson said, referring to the
payments to members and their families that have since emerged.
``It led to the kind of mood that made us overcompetitive, though
that is probably one of the world's great understatements.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bid committee had been reorganized and held its
first board meetings in 1992, at which the scholarship program was
presented, the documents show that payments had already been made
to an IOC member's children attending school in the United States.
In the years that followed, those payments became regular,
formalized and according to the bid committee budget records,
strictly accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, the payments to Moriba Keita, son of the
Olympic committee member from Mali, Lamine Keita, who was studying
at Howard University, came like clockwork: tuition payments ranging
from $2,825 on Jan. 12, to $5,925 on Aug. 24, with regular monthly
checks of $500 through the fall term.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Moriba Keita got a summer job working for First
Security Bank, whose chairman, Eccles, was a trustee on the
committee's board. But it was also clearly no simple internship. A
letter to Keita, from one of the bank's senior vice presidents,
refers warmly to his ``plan to spend some time in Salt Lake City
and working at First Security Bank of Utah,'' and notes that bank's
president, Scott Nelson, had specifically been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said in a statement earlier this month, when the first
reports emerged about the summer jobs of Keita and of another IOC
relative, who was hired in 1992, that such hiring was ``not
extraordinary or inappropriate in any way'' and had been done
through a program ``where we hire interns and summer help referred
to us through customers, employees and other relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the records show, the bid committee simply
needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1995, which was 10 days before Salt Lake City won the
IOC balloting to host the 2002 Winter Games, the bid committee
withdrew $30,000 in cash from its account at First Security Bank.
The committee's record with the withdrawal noted that it was for
``unknown purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 through the end of 1995 the daughter of Augustin C.
Arroyo, the IOC member of Ecuador, received $19,000 from Salt Lake
Olympic officials, according to the IOC report last week that
recommended Arroyo's expulsion. Documents from the bid committee
show precisely where that money went: Insurance, furniture, rent
and on one occasion an American Express bill of $701.54.
</P>
<P>
   The records also show that, at least with respect to
bookkeeping, no one tried to hide the fact that checks were made
out to individual Olympic committee members, and not their sports
associations. The ledgers, for instance, list payments to
Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of Congo, who
received a total of $70,010 from the Salt Lake committee, according
to last week's IOC report. Ganga was expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the still unfolding story of how Salt Lake
City chased its Olympic dreams, however, there has been lingering
question of what the true nature of all the payments and
reimbursements and gifts were. Were all contracts to influence IOC
members improper, some board members ask, or just some contracts to
the agents? Many people here, on and off the Olympic committee,
have condemned outright cash payments. But some of the elements
outlined in the committee's document are perhaps in some ways no
more clearly understood for all the new detail.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Marsh, the Olympic steeplechaser and athlete's
representative on the bid committee, said the board ``understood we
were hiring people to help us with our bid and lobbying efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The contracts, he said, went to ``people who had contacts in
these countries, who had relations with these people, who could
help us, period. It's legitimate to contract with someone to help
you.'' In any case, he added, so far he had heard nothing to
indicate that money paid to agents had made its way to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   With federal and state investigators swarming over the records
and witnesses, it may be months before conclusions can be drawn
about who knew what in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee's initial inquiry, led by Richard Pound, a
Montreal lawyer, did not settle the issue. Pound said he questioned
Joklik, the board chairman, about whether he was aware of the
payments and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him and his statement to us was that he didn't
know,'' Pound said. ``What I don't know is the degree to which the
board was active in all of these things. It was hard for us to
tell.''

   RIVERHEAD &UR; 11 &LR; , N.Y. _ Driving to work early Friday morning,
Martin A. Sullivan, 37, saw a car smoldering on the side of
Longwood &UR; 12 &LR;  Road in Middle Island.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he thought it had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just a lot of lights and flames, you couldn't really
see anything inside,'' he said. ``Then I yelled into it and I heard
a woman's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, of Middle Island, opened the passenger-side door and
saw Donna Herrera &UR; 13 &LR;  wedged beneath the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so concerned about spine and neck injuries, and I know
you are never supposed to move anybody, but I figured it was that
or worse,'' he said. ``So I got her arm around my neck and lifted
her out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the car was engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herrera &UR; 13 &LR; , 20, was in stable condition at Brookhaven &UR; 14 &LR; 
Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Patchogue &UR; 15 &LR;  Friday night, and
the police were crediting Sullivan with saving her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, an electrician and owner of a window-washing company
in Riverhead &UR; 11 &LR; , visited briefly with Ms. Herrera &UR; 13 &LR;  in the
hospital in the afternoon. ``She grabbed my hand and thanked me for
saving her life,'' he said. ``I didn't bawl, but it was definitely
an emotional moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Ms. Herrera &UR; 13 &LR; , a bank teller who is also
from Middle Island, was driving alone in her 1989 Ford sedan when
it slid off the road and struck a tree, igniting an engine fire.
She was trapped inside and semiconscious, they said.

BRITISH COMPANY BUYS NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY FERRY SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adding corporate muscle to New York Harbor's
passenger-ferry industry, a British shipping and hotel company said
Friday that it had paid $5 million to acquire Express Navigation
Inc., which operates ferry service from Monmouth County, N.J., to
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Express Navigation, a subsidiary of Holyman Ltd. of Australia,
operates three boats between docks in Highlands and Atlantic
Highlands, N.J., and Pier 4 in Brooklyn and Pier 11 in lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, Sea Containers Ltd., which operates several ferry
lines in Europe and also owns the ``21'' Club in Manhattan, said it
had no immediate plans to expand the operations of Express
Navigation. But it said its financial resources and expertise could
eventually allow it to introduce larger ferryboats in New York
Harbor or elsewhere along the Atlantic seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   William Galvin, a Sea Containers spokesman, said he did not
expect the purchase to be the only one the firm makes in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said there were no plans to change the existing service.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition by Sea Containers, which has diversified
international holdings in cargo container leasing, ferries and
hotels, provoked immediate questions over whether it intended to
add routes elsewhere in the harbor, perhaps challenging the
dominance of New York Waterways, which is based in Weehawken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Both Express Navigation and New York Waterways have operated
commuter ferry services from New Jersey to New York City since
1986. But New York Waterways has grown far more rapidly, and now
carries 30,000 passengers daily on a fleet of 20 boats. It also
operates 80 shuttle buses in Manhattan taking riders to its dock.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said Sea Containers had not ruled out new service that
would compete directly with New York Waterways, but had no
immediate plans for such a challenge. ``It is conceivable, but this
is not a Coke vs. Pepsi situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said the company was more likely to set its sights
on new routes that would employ larger boats capable of carrying up
to 900 passengers and 140 cars, as it does in Europe. Such
car-ferry operations would not be well suited for Manhattan
commuters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company may consider the use of its large car
ferries on routes that would go from Manhattan or New Jersey docks
to Long Island, Hudson River docks north of the city and ports in
New England.

   KARACHI, Pakistan &UR;  &LR; _ True love may never run smooth, but rarely
is the road as treacherous as it has been for Humaira and Mehmood
Butt, Pakistani lovers who, though joined in marriage, have a
powerful man trying to tear it asunder.
</P>
<P>
   In this part of the world, many a father believes his daughter
to be his property and her elopement would amount to nothing less
than a theft that needs to be avenged. Humaira's father, who had
other plans for her betrothal, is Abbas Khokar. A veteran
legislator in Punjab province, he is one of this nation's large
landowners who are collectively known as ``the feudals.''
</P>
<P>
   By the couple's account, Khokar's tenacious opposition to their
romance has led to the beating of Mehmood, 26, in a Punjabi lockup
and a frantic life on the run. Humaira, 29, claims to have been
kept in frequent isolation, including three months of punishment
within the immobilizing plaster of a full-body cast.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, as the couple faced criminal charges filed by
Humaira's angry family and fast-approaching court dates, they
attempted an escape. Holding visas for travel to the United States,
they had tickets for a London-bound flight with connections to
Newark, N.J. As they waited at the Karachi airport, however, a half
dozen burly men jumped them, witnesses said. Humaira began
shrieking. Butt, himself a stocky man, fought his captors but was
overpowered. ``Where are you taking us?'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple was dragged out of the busy terminal, the
assailants were joined by uniformed police authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is now in police custody in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police will not give us a clue to their condition,'' said
Tahira Khan, one of many human rights advocates who have been
helping the couple. ``We're worried about their safety and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor and tradition are at stake. Khokar has refused to comment
about recent events surrounding his daughter, but Sadar Hasan
Akhtar, a close friend and deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly,
explained: ``In the Subcontinent, there is a tradition that a
girl's marriage is arranged by her parents, and once the
arrangement is made, it cannot be broken. Humaira had been promised
to someone else a very long time ago, and it was an understandable
shock to her father when she ran away. It is his right to have her
returned.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the couple's vivid descriptions of mistreatment, Akhtar
scoffed. ``These are very common lies of people who have committed
wrongs against a family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, an overwhelming number of marriages are arranged by
parents. While the practice may seem curious to some Western eyes,
people here, often citing high divorce rates elsewhere, generally
believe their approach to wedlock to be the wiser way.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, young people rebel. Desperate lovers _
kept apart by differences of caste, class, religion or ethnicity _
are the stuff of folk tales. In the past year or so, this nation
has been riveted by one romance after another as forbidden lovers
have gone public.
</P>
<P>
   Humaira and Mehmood are the latest tragic lovers in the news.
Their desire to marry has been the undoing of much of the Butt
family, including Mehmood's father, Mohammad Naseem Butt, a
businessman in Flushing, N.Y., and a naturalized American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government is concerned that one of our citizen's
sons and the son's wife are in danger,'' a State Department
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmood met Humaira in the spring of 1991. She was a student at
Queen Mary's College in Lahore. He told her he worked at his
brother's electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came to the shop the next day, I knew she liked me,''
he said, telling his story last week during a nervous rendezvous
while thinking his life in danger. ``From the very first, I loved
her. It was as if I had known her from the day I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmood did what any love-smitten man in an electronics store
would do. He gave Humaira a television set. ``A costly gift, but
who cared?'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His chronology of events matches in detail the story that
Humaira has repeated to her lawyers and advocates for battered
women. During three hours, he relived seven years of turbulence,
occasionally laughing or weeping and once dropping to the floor to
say his afternoon prayers as he faced Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with Shakespearean flair, made all the easier by
Shakespearean circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is God's gift, and God made Humaira and I for each
other,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Below is the couple's story as they tell it:
</P>
<P>
   Dating is not socially acceptable in Pakistan. After their
initial meetings, the two continued to meet furtively at
restaurants. Humaira knew her parents would disapprove.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmood's family is well-off. His father owns a grocery in
Queens and splits his time between New York and Lahore. The Butts
were city people, however, cut from a different mold than the
Khokars, whose deep roots are in village life. Abbas Khokar had
planned for his daughter to be married to his nephew, just as his
son was married to his niece. Such arrangements are commonly used
to keep land holdings within an extended family.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1992, Humaira confessed her feelings to her parents,
hoping they would approve a marriage. Instead, they locked her up.
She escaped in August that year and the fearful couple, finally
living together, privately exchanged vows with their hands on the
Koran in a makeshift ceremony. Ten days later, they were grabbed
off the street and Mehmood was beaten for two days in a police
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that Humaira's father could have me killed
whenever he wanted,'' he said. ``They thought I would give up.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not give up, he did prudently retreat. He went to
the United States and started to work for his father. Humaira sent
him letters, smuggled from her house by a servant. ``She cut her
finger and wrote something to me in blood. `Don't forget me,' it
said.'' Mehmood called her long distance at pre-arranged hours. He
taped each call to replay later.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, the couple's fate seemed to have improved.
Humaira told Mehmood that her parents had relented and now only
wished that his marriage proposal be made properly, with his
parents arranging the terms. Mehmood's father accompanied his son
to Pakistan, the younger man toting gifts in 14 pieces of Samsonite
luggage. Once in Lahore, he giddily purchased jewelry and clothing,
dining room furniture and a bedroom set.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting of the two families never happened, and the
couple came to conclude that it had all been a trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her parents had found out we were communicating,'' Mehmood
said. ``Humaira told me that if they kill me, they think she will
marry someone else. But they don't know her. If I died, she would
only commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   They eloped _ or rather, re-eloped. This time they were
officially married on May 16, 1997, at a Lahore mosque with four
friends as witnesses. They thought it best to keep this wedding a
secret from Humaira's parents. Indeed, when Khokar announced his
suspicions that the two were seeing each other again, Mehmood once
more feared for his life and in November 1997 fled to the United
States. It would be nine months before he returned to Pakistan,
beseeched by Humaira, now suicidal, who said she was about to be
married to her cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Her thumb print had been forcibly placed on a marriage
certificate, she said, backdated to one month before her wedding
with Mehmood.
</P>
<P>
   With Mehmood back in Pakistan, the two made plans. Last Oct. 29,
while she was shopping with her mother in Lahore, Humaira raced
away to a prearranged place. The couple began a month on the run,
zigzagging between cities and towns, sleeping on trains and buses.
</P>
<P>
   They had reason to hide. They were wanted by police.
</P>
<P>
   The Khokars and the man they had intended as Humaira's husband,
her cousin, Malik Moazam Ghias, had filed charges against them,
telling the police that he was married to Humaira before her
wedding to Mehmood.
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, Humaira could be convicted of adultery under
an Islamic ordinance in Pakistani law.
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed that she stole $4,000 and some jewelry from him.
At the same time, the Khokars charged that their daughter had been
kidnapped by Mehmood and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   After a month on the lam, Mehmood left Humaira at a women's
shelter in Karachi, the Edhi Center. They thought this place
inviolate, but on Dec. 1, Humaira's brother led an eight-vehicle
police raid on the sanctuary. The Punjabi police, far from home,
acted in rare concert with the law officers from Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humaira was screaming, `These people will cut me to pieces!'''
said Faisal Edhi, assistant president of the Edhi charity. ``We
were in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Intervention by Sindh's governor kept Humaira from being
transported to Lahore. The couple was overwrought, nonetheless. The
Khokars' feudal power was even greater than they had imagined. A
court ruling kept Humaira from being handed back to the Punjab
police, but she was ordered into a city shelter where she had to
live behind barred windows and locked gates.
</P>
<P>
   For Mehmood, everything was chaos and conspiracy. Pakistan
operates on the principle of sifarish, or influence, and he did not
have enough. He feared for his life. So did his mother, Zaib
Naseem. She too had gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God can solve our problems,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``I've had no contact with my husband for two months,
and I don't want to contact him because then he'll be tracked
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Naseem Butt, who had come to Lahore to try to help his
son, was taken into custody by the Punjab police, he said, and
spent 20 days in leg cuffs. When released, he went into hiding,
where he remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is not well,'' said Dawood Butt, Mehmood's older
brother who lives in Flushing. ``I have spoken to him on the phone.
He is very angry with Mehmood. His love for this girl has gotten
the whole family in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmood was angry with himself. He felt helpless. He had drawn
his parents into his problems. Humaira was facing a court date in
Lahore on Feb. 3. He was afraid she would be killed if she returned
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep calling the U.S. Consulate, trying to arrange visas,''
he said. ``I think maybe this is our only hope.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, in a special hearing in Karachi, Humaira's
lawyers obtained her release from the city shelter. She was free of
the steel bars, yet also lacking their protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, she and Mehmood went to the airport, where they
hoped they might finally get beyond the influence of Abbas Khokar
and the eye of the Punjab police.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where they got their answer.

AUTISM CASES BRING ALARM TO A NEW JERSEY TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRICK TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Holding her tiny 6-month-old daughter
close to her shoulder, Heather Howarth talked about government
scientists who had come into her town to study whether anything in
the environment was causing local children to develop autism, a
disorder that affects a child's ability to communicate and function
socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband heard about it on the radio, and he called to tell
me, `If you let her drink the water, I'll kill you,''' Mrs. Howarth
said, pulling a white sweater up protectively over her baby's head
as she stood outside a shopping center here. ``I heard they found
400 cases of autism here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not 400 cases of autism in this coastal town in Ocean
County. There might be 40, but scientists are still verifying the
number. And no one has said that there is anything wrong with the
town's water that might be causing autism.
</P>
<P>
   But since last week, when news spread that the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and another federal health agency
were investigating the incidence of autism in this town of 72,000,
many people here have become fearful that something about Brick is
harming its children.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm began when Bobbie and William Gallagher, who have two
autistic children, noticed that there appeared to be many other
children in their town with the same disorder. After some amateur
epidemiological canvassing of their own, the Gallaghers and some of
their friends with autistic children persuaded federal authorities
that an investigation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it would have been unlikely that these parents
would have got such a prompt and attentive hearing from state and
federal officials. But the belief that clusters of cases of cancer
and other illnesses might be caused by something in a community's
air or water or soil is a recent phenomenon that has quickly
developed the power to arouse both panic among people and action on
the part of politicians _ although there is no scientific evidence
that such clusters are anything more than statistical flukes.
</P>
<P>
   Although autism had never before been linked to environmental
causes, fears were easily roused here partly because this part of
New Jersey has many toxic waste sites that the state and federal
governments ordered cleaned up. In nearby Toms River, parents of
children with cancer persuaded state health officials to conduct a
comprehensive environmental study of Dover Township, which includes
their town, to see whether these cases were somehow connected. The
study is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Joanne Renz, a mother of two boys, ages 5
and 3. ``I was listening to the news on the way to work and heard
about it. Toms River is just down the street from us, and you see
they've got problems with the water. We always drink the tap water
here, but it makes you wonder. Knock wood, my two boys are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substance and
Disease Registry, an agency created when Superfund toxic waste
sites were designated for cleanup all over the country, said news
media reports that they had found Brick Township's autism rate to
be 12 times higher than the national average were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is not finished, and besides, scientists say
there are no reliable figures to determine a normal rate for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped concerned parents and couples who are
expecting children from flooding the office of Mayor Joseph
Scarpelli with panicked phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we move out?'' asked a man whose wife is pregnant.
Another parent asked: ``We just closed on a house. Should we cancel
our contract?''
</P>
<P>
   Scarpelli said, ``We're telling people, until we narrow it down
and get a definite conclusion, it's too early to speculate on the
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the mayor tries to quell the panic, others have not.
The other day, for example, a law firm in nearby Middletown placed
a full-page advertisement in two Brick-area newspapers with the
headline, ``Is Contamination the Cause of Autism in Brick?'' The ad
gave a toll-free number to call the firm, which promised to ``fight
for your legal rights'' against ``an identifiable polluter.''
</P>
<P>
   The maelstrom began with the Gallaghers, whose two children were
found to have autism several years ago. When their daughter,
Alanna, who is now 8, was less than 3 years old, she would spin
wildly until it made her dizzy, and she would line up her stuffed
toys obsessively. She could also make only guttural noises at an
age when other children were speaking in full sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Autism, which varies in severity and has no known cause and no
real cure, is generally diagnosed in children when they are around
3 years old. While autistic children may appear physically healthy,
they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no
interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like banging
their heads. As adults, some people with autism are highly
functional, while others never learn to speak and may require
institutionalization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gallagher, whose son, Austin, now 6, was later found to
have the disorder, began attending meetings of an Ocean County
support group. After several months, she said, she noticed that
many families in the group were from her town, a working-class
community bisected by the Metedeconk River.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, a commercial fisherman, began to think that
there might be something more than coincidence linking all these
cases. More than two years ago, they decided to investigate, on
their own, the extent of the problem in Brick.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallaghers and Angela and Kevin Fryczynski, whose son Kevin
is also autistic, first asked the local school system, which has
special services for autistic children, for the names and addresses
of families with autistic children, but school officials refused.
So, working with addresses from families in their support groups,
they plotted on a map where in Brick the autistic children lived.
As it turned out, they were spread out.
</P>
<P>
   After distributing a flier and then putting an ad in a local
newspaper, the couples determined that at least 19 families living
in Brick had autistic children who were born and conceived here.
They approached politicians with their findings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith of Trenton said the couples'
research persuaded him to urge the C.D.C. to investigate. Although
the study was not scientific, Smith said he did not want to ignore
any evidence that people might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the point of view that it would be irresponsible not
to pursue it and get experts to look into it, but with science, not
speculation,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   With the urging of Smith and U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli,
federal health officials agreed to investigate the number of autism
cases and to try to determine whether something in the area could
be causing them.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it turns out that there are 40 cases of autism in
Brick, there is still no measuring stick to compare that number
with, said Dr. Coleen Boyle, chief of developmental disabilities
for the CDC in Atlanta. The Brick study, along with one the CDC is
conducting in the five-county area that includes Atlanta, could
provide such a standard, Dr. Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall, the CDC and the toxic substance registry hope to
finish identifying all the children in Brick between the ages of 3
and 10 who have autism, and where they were born and conceived.
While they told people at a recent town meeting that they know of
40 children who have been found to be autistic, they have verified
the diagnoses of only 15 and are working on the rest. When they
have those findings they will determine how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   As another part of the study, researchers from the toxic
substance registry are analyzing samples of soil and water from
industrial sites and residential areas, and locations of local
chemical spills and waste dumping. Those sites include a town
landfill that was placed on the Superfund list and closed in 1972,
and a packaging manufacturer that was ordered closed a few years
later after it was fined for polluting the Metedeconk River, which
now provides the town's drinking supply.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers emphasize that the cause of autism is still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have found that with fraternal twins, in only 10
percent of cases in which one child had autism did both have it.
With identical twins, when one had it, the other had it in
two-thirds of the cases, leading scientists to think there is a
strong genetic cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the other third?'' asked Dr. Eric London of the
National Alliance for Autism Research outside of Princeton. ``The
current belief is that you need a genetic predisposition, and
something else. What that something else is, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Various factors have been studied, London said, including
toxins, viruses, diet, drug or alcohol use by the mother during
pregnancy, and even the effects of certain inoculations. But no
cause has been proved, he said, ``which is why this alleged cluster
in Brick is so important to study.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he believes that the availability of special
services for autistic children _ including tuition at a private
school paid for by the public school system _ has drawn families
with autistic children to Brick, and that that has inflated the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't want to believe there are any environmental
problems,'' Mrs. Fryczynski said. ``Maybe they're worried about the
property values. But you know what I say? We live here, too, and my
property values will go up or down or all around like everybody
else's, and I have two children, and I want to know what's causing
this problem.''

ELECTRICIAN SAVES TRAPPED WOMAN IN BURNING CAR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ Driving to work early Friday morning, Martin
A. Sullivan, 37, saw a car smoldering on the side of Longwood Road
in Middle Island.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he thought it had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just a lot of lights and flames, you couldn't really
see anything inside,'' he said. ``Then I yelled into it and I heard
a woman's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, of Middle Island, opened the passenger-side door and
saw Donna Herrera wedged beneath the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so concerned about spine and neck injuries, and I know
you are never supposed to move anybody, but I figured it was that
or worse,'' he said. ``So I got her arm around my neck and lifted
her out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the car was engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herrera, 20, was in stable condition at Brookhaven Memorial
Hospital Medical Center in Patchogue Friday night, and the police
were crediting Sullivan with saving her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, an electrician and owner of a window-washing company
in Riverhead, visited briefly with Ms. Herrera in the hospital in
the afternoon. ``She grabbed my hand and thanked me for saving her
life,'' he said. ``I didn't bawl, but it was definitely an
emotional moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Ms. Herrera, a bank teller who is also from
Middle Island, was driving alone in her 1989 Ford sedan when it
slid off the road and struck a tree, igniting an engine fire. She
was trapped inside and semiconscious, they said.

COMMENTARY: TRASH PILES UP ON HOPES OF PAROLEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several years ago, a pristine plaza sprang up on
Second Avenue near East 118th Street, attracting crowds for free
food, weddings, parties and revival meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza, built by a group of ex-convicts who lived next door
at the United Christian Prison Ministry, was a luminous sight in
East Harlem. What was once a dumping ground for junk and junkies
became a haven lined with skinny palm trees, murals of dreamy
clouds and elegant arches. Hovering above it all _ OK, bolted to
the side of an adjoining building _ was a big wooden dove.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bird looks like a cartoon character frozen in flight by
a frightful sight: The plaza is a heap of wood, plaster and broken
glass. The very men who built it took it apart a month ago when the
city _ which had leased the land to them for $150 a month _
auctioned it to a private buyer for $100,000. Soon illegal dumpers
returned at night to turn the lot back into an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about it,'' said the Rev. Ramon Cabrera, the ministry's
founder, who is scrambling to raise more than $100,000 to buy the
lot. ``I have to turn my head when I walk by there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashes to ashes, dumps to dumps was not exactly what Cabrera
expected when he first leased the lot. A weapons charge landed him
in prison for eight years. A jailhouse conversion guided him to
East Harlem, where in 1992, he and his wife, Mercedes, took in
paroled convicts who slept on the floor of the couple's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the ex-convicts roomed in the basement of a Pentecostal
church. Finally, Cabrera rented a building next to the Second
Avenue lot, fixing it up with castoffs scavenged in nightly raids
of trash containers. He also signed a monthly lease with the city
for the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show people that we were not a threat to
anybody,'' he said. ``To show everybody we can clean this place
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera planned to turn the plaza's site into an expanded
residence and training center for the ex-convicts who arrive there
after years upstate. He was preparing a proposal to seek state
financing to buy the site and build on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 men now live in a hodgepodge of rooms above the
ministry, sharing one bathroom per floor and hanging their clothes
on bunk beds packed into barrackslike rooms. Although officials
ranging from Rep. Charles Rangel to the local community board
members supported him, their pleas did not prevent the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand they didn't have the funds on hand to purchase
the property at auction and that although they had tentative plans
for development, they didn't have funding secured,'' said Denise
Collins, the spokeswoman for the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services, which ran the auction. ``But that's not
our primary issue. For us it is the fact that this property is
surplus, and we have as our priority the disposition of surplus
property for which there is no city use.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the ministry reply that the government has no use for
paroled convicts looking to stay straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes all this hard is that it is politically correct for
politicians to use prisoners as their platform to build up their
power base,'' said an ex-convict in the ministry, Henry Rivera.
``Look at the governor. He's talking about doing away with parole.
But it's not politically correct to take a public stance in favor
of a program helping ex-offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Nelson Denis, whose district office faces the
ministry, said city officials overlooked the ministry's long-term
ability to prevent repeat offenses in favor of short-term financial
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is divesting itself of any property it can to bolster
the balance sheet so they'll look good now,'' Denis said. ``That
looks good financially, but it won't really accommodate the needs
of a community like mine.'' With tens of thousands of dollars spent
a year to house an inmate, he said, ``it's an ill-founded way of
demonstrating economic leadership when you are disemboweling local
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cabrera embarks on a fund-raising drive, he has put on
hold much of his group's charitable work: Without the lot, they
have no place to distribute fruits and vegetables from a food bank.
The basement chapel is cluttered with chairs and other equipment
that used to be in the plaza. It's an obstacle course all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw somebody's dream in this place,'' said Alberto Paez, who
arrived at the ministry on May 18 last year. ``When you have a
dream to do something and you want to set things right, so many
obstacles get put in your way. It's crazy.''

MARC SAVARD TRIES LIVING UP TO HIS NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name Savard is much honored in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Savard played defense for the Montreal Canadiens, filled
his fingers with Stanley Cup rings and then took his place in the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Savard was a flashy center for the Chicago Blackhawks and
the Canadiens, who retired in 1997 and now works as an assistant
coach of the Hawks. When his three-year waiting period ends, he too
is likely to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame in downtown Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   As for Marc Savard, the New York Rangers' young center, he will
take things one step at a time with no rehearsals yet of his
induction speech.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Savard's first as a professional, he played 58
minor league games and 28 in the National Hockey League. This
season, after spending the first month in Hartford, he has played
35 games with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   His play has painted an inconsistent canvass with splashes of
promise and streaks of mediocrity. In recent games, Savard has lost
ice time to the rookie Manny Malhotra. They share the third- and
fourth-line pivot positions on the depth chart behind Wayne Gretzky
and Petr Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Savard was concerned with job status Thursday night in
Greensboro, N.C., for a game against the Carolina Hurricanes.
Although the Rangers lost by 3-2 in overtime, they played well and
Savard was one of their best players.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 minutes 49 seconds of action, spread over 14 shifts,
Savard scored one goal and assisted on the other _ by Mathieu
Schneider _ on the power play. Savard put five shots on goal, the
most for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Should Savard play with the same intensity Saturday night, he is
likely to get as big a role when the Rangers end a three-game road
trip against the Stanley Cup champion Red Wings in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better out there,'' Savard said, adding that he had
been studying under the direction of Craig MacTavish, an assistant
coach. ``He's been working with me after practice and skating with
me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Generously listed at 5 feet 11 inches and 187 pounds, the
21-year-old Savard is not a large or an experienced player, but he
plays with a certain canniness, or savvy, which just happens to be
his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   While on a power play Thursday, Savard was high-sticked by Kent
Manderville. Referees often overlook minor violations when a team
is already a man down, especially late in a game with a one-goal
lead. But Savard reacted theatrically, rubbing his lower face for
traces of blood. It gave the Rangers a two-man advantage for 15
seconds and led to Schneider's goal after Carolina got one man
back.
</P>
<P>
   MacTavish was asked if he was worried that referees might become
wary of Savard as the ``boy who cried wolf'' by exaggerating fouls.
MacTavish replied, ``It's a very real danger,'' but quickly added
that Savard is often fouled because of his size and the way he
protects the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Sticks and elbows of bigger foes ``ride up'' on Savard,
MacTavish said, and players run him from behind because his
protection of the puck puts him ``in a vulnerable position.''

PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY, LOTT TALK TO MAYORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton took advantage of a meeting with
mayors from more than 200 cities Friday to announce that he is
seeking a hefty raise for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposed increase of $2.5 billion would give the
agency a record $28 billion at a time the administration is using
every bit of good news to draw attention from the impeachment trial
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that lasted more than an hour in the East Room of
the White House, the president thanked the mayors for their role in
helping drive down crime rates, expand job growth and improve the
living conditions for many low-income Americans. But he emphasized
that more work remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present prosperity is an opportunity and a responsibility
to make sure that opportunity and prosperity reaches every person
in every corner of this country, into every neighborhood in every
city of this country,'' he said. ``If we cannot do this now with
what some people believe is the strongest overall economy in our
history, believe me, we will never get around to doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The address by Clinton was the first of several the mayors heard
here on the third and last day of the winter meeting of the United
States Conference of Mayors. Over lunch in a hotel ballroom, they
listened to Senator Trent Lott, R-Miss., who is the majority
leader; Attorney General Janet Reno, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
They focused on different urban issues.
</P>
<P>
   The original speaking schedule included only Lott and Mrs.
Clinton, a plan that left open the possibility that Mrs. Clinton
would share a dais with the man who is controlling the impeachment
proceedings against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But other commitments assured that the two would not even be in
the hotel at the same time. Lott, who spoke for 25 minutes,
finished at 12:10 and quickly returned to Capitol Hill for
meetings. Mrs. Clinton arrived shortly before 1:30 and spoke for
half an hour. An aide to the mayoral conference said she had asked
to speak last and had told officials that she could not arrive any
earlier than she did.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by members of his Cabinet, Clinton used much of his time
with the mayors highlighting aspects of the urban agenda he
discussed in his State of the Union address last week. He said the
housing increase would help pay for a second round of community
empowerment grants to 20 cities, which were announced two weeks
ago, and for 100,000 new vouchers for poor and low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rep. Rick A. Lazio, R-N.Y., who heads the House
subcommittee on housing, said the administration was certain only
to get an increase of $2 billion and faced a fight for the
remaining $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, Clinton took questions. Mayor Linda Lawrence
of Wausau, Wis., rose and took aim at the impeachment trial,
saying, ``I want you to know what on behalf of everybody I know,
especially my parents who are so damn conservative that I had an 11
p.m. curfew all my life, that they want Congress to stop this to
allow you to get on with the business of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mayor Lawrence said later, the other mayors stood
to applaud, ``and I couldn't finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's appearance before the mayors was his first after two
previous invitations. Assuring the mayors that the Senate was eager
to get busy on a spectrum of issues that affected cities, he made
only veiled references to the impeachment trial, saying he was
grateful to be away from the Capitol, where he has been ``tethered
to the floor'' of the Senate for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we have a particularly difficult responsibility,
given to us under the Constitution, to carry out, and we're going
to carry out that responsibility,'' Lott added. ``But it will come
to a conclusion, and when it does, it's important that we have a
burst of activity to work on those problems that Americans really
do care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott received respectful applause before and after his remarks.
But it was nothing like the ovation showered upon Mrs. Clinton as
she walked down the ballroom aisle toward the dais. The mayors
stood and clapped loudly; some cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent the first half of her speech reviewing
administration programs that she portrayed as ``tools this
president has provided'' to help cities and urged the mayors to
build support for the president's next budget.
</P>
<P>
   She closed by promoting the Millennium Communities Program, an
effort by the White House to encourage communities to plan
celebrations that ``honor the past and imagine the future.''

DON'T BUCK BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, since the Broncos and Falcons qualified
for Super Bowl XXXIII, I've had this nagging feeling that I'm
missing something.
</P>
<P>
   The moment sports books established the defending Super Bowl
champs as a modest seven-point pick, my eyes popped out of my head
like that woman who's a regular on the stunt TV circuit.
</P>
<P>
   This had to be a mistake. Sooner or later, I figured the betting
public would make the same distinctions between the two teams as I
did and start pouring money in on the Broncos, driving the line up
to double digits.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't happened. The line is holding at seven, and there
are even some indications that it may go down before kickoff
Sunday. A betting man would just accept this as manna and smile.
Instead, I've tried to rationalize it.
</P>
<P>
   My conclusion: I haven't missed a thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a series that has often been as one-sided as a tornado in a
trailer park, the Broncos are extremely capable of adding the 33rd
edition to the list of Super blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I twist my analysis and the matchups, looking for
any edge favoring the Falcons, I get the same result. Denver
clearly is the better team across the board, and the fact they're
favored by a mere touchdown seems like lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked myself into some strange predictions over the years,
and a few years of college debate taught me how to argue either
side of an issue. But there's no getting over all of my rational
thoughts supporting Denver.
</P>
<P>
   I'll share: Their record. (end bold) In the last three seasons,
the Broncos are 45-10. Six of those losses came in December games
after the Broncos had clinched a playoff berth. All six were on the
road, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of those ten losses, three were to hated division rivals (Chiefs
and Raiders) and seven were to playoff teams. If the Broncos were
as in vogue today as the 49ers, Cowboys and Packers were during
their '90s run, critics would be calling them a Superteam.
</P>
<P>
   They're not because they are still identifiable to some as the
team that suffered Super Bowl losses by margins of 17, 19, 32 and
45 points, rather than the 11{-point underdog which smacked Green
Bay last year.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach. Mike Shanahan's year-plus as the sorceror's
apprentice with the Raiders served him well, giving an edge to
those sharp incisors that have earned him residence in Jim Rome's
Rat Family.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan did walk up the back of Dan Reeves to get where he is,
and those who believe in fair play find this reprehensible. But
let's make the distinction between the moral high ground and
astroturf. Vince Lombardi, Weeb Eubank, Tom Landry, Chuck Noll,
John Madden, Bill Parcells and Jimmy Johnson all won Super Bowls,
and they all had some ruthless qualities.
</P>
<P>
   So does Shanahan. He just doesn't disguise them very well.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway vs. Chris Chandler. Some of the prattle out of Miami
has been astonishing. Some critics and observers would have you
believe Elway will take the field wearing orthopedic hose and
Chandler is the quarterback headed for Canton.
</P>
<P>
   I missed whatever weekend it was that Elway received league
approval to play with a walker. Did it happen during their 13-game
winning streak, or when they got vengeance on Miami? Elway may not
be a threat to scramble as he once was, but he can still sidestep
and spin with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in that same moment, Chandler apparently shook his
reputation as the most physically and mentally fragile quarterback
in the game. His bruises receive more coverage, as they should. One
hard sack of Chandler by Bill Romanowski Sunday, and all that
hard-earned Atlanta money flies south.
</P>
<P>
   But his emotional side is just as fraught. Chandler is the worst
kind of martyr, a chatty one. He's spent most of Super Bowl week
showing off 11 years of wounds, literal and psychic, to anyone who
asked.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a Ram, you couldn't talk to another Ram quarterback
without Chandler eye-balling you with a look that screamed ``I know
you're talking about me.'' I don't know if Chandler will unravel
Sunday, but he's more likely to come off his spool than Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis. Super Bowl history weighs heavily for those teams
with dominating running games.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson has been a gem for Atlanta, but Davis has emerged
as the league's best. The Falcons have a stingy run defense, but
they haven't seen anyone like Davis, or a line that executes as
well as Denver's.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons built their numbers against Carolina, St. Louis, New
Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago and Miami, and even the 49ers
weren't much rushing this season, either. They bottled up Sanders,
but the Lions had mailed in their season by then.
</P>
<P>
   They're still the Falcons. Great season or not, this is still a
franchise unaccustomed to success and the kind of suffocating
pressure of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Their manners all week long have all been off the readiness
dial. Some players have been flippant, others are enjoying the
attention way too much, and Reeves has all this nervous energy
bunked by midnight. There's only four players with any Super Bowl
experience on the roster. They look just like the Charger team that
cracked quickly in Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back logic. In a series that is only 33 years old, there
have been six back-to-back Super Bowl champs, a pretty hefty edge
that favors experience. And in all but one of those six examples,
the second win was easier than the first
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota game. Not only did the Vikings allow the Falcons
to drive on them for a touchdown at the end of regulation, but they
let them drive to one in the last minute of the first half. The
Vikings lost that game more than the Falcons won it.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that Denver will lose this game, too.
Stranger things have happened _ but just not in the Super Bowl.
Denver 38, Atlanta 20.

WORLD TRADE CENTER TERRORIST ENDS HUNGER STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Texas) (bl) 
By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the men convicted in the World Trade Center
bombing ended a two-week hunger strike Friday after a federal judge
in Manhattan threatened to return him to a Texas prison from New
York, where he had been brought to prepare for a court hearing next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Ahmad Ajaj, was transported back to New York
recently from Beaumont, Texas, where he has been serving a 240-year
sentence for his 1994 conviction in the 1993 bombing, which killed
six people and injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ajaj and other defendants in the case are scheduled to appear in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan in February at a hearing on some
defense motions filed after their convictions. Ajaj is claiming
ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But in court Friday, his lawyer, Maranda Fritz, told Judge Kevin
Duffy that in transit to New York, Ajaj was held for a time in a
prison in Oklahoma, where guards taunted him, spit into his food
and placed him in a cell for more than a day with the
air-conditioning at full blast.
</P>
<P>
   Ajaj, who had a lung removed after a diagnosis of lung cancer a
few years ago, was left ``literally shivering in a cold cell,'' Ms.
Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
lower Manhattan, she continued, Ajaj was also mistreated. She said
in legal papers that he had been placed in a cold cell and refused
blankets by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Ajaj has since been moved to a prison ward in the Westchester
County Medical Center, where the authorities have said they would
force-feed him if he did not end his strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fritz asked that he be allowed to stay in the infirmary at
either the jail in New York City or the federal prison in
Otisville, N.Y., a request the government strenuously opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his demands ``unacceptable and unnecessary,'' a federal
prosecutor, David Kelley, told the judge in legal papers that
Otisville was too far away and not secure enough for Ajaj.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said that during an earlier stay there, Ajaj had gone
``on and off hunger strikes, thus demonstrating the manipulative
nature of his current behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley argued that the law did not require Ajaj to be present at
his post-conviction hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, by his remarks, seemed to agree. Although the judge did
not rule from the bench, he suggested that he was not impressed by
Ajaj's tactics, a transcript shows.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides that he wants to remain on the hunger strike, the
judge said, ``he will be returned to Texas or to wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he is returned there,'' the judge added, ``he stays
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Ajaj had been brought to New York ``as a help''
to him and his lawyer, ``and if he is not going to eat, and he is
going to make this kind of difficulty for himself, the only thing I
can see is to have him returned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for him to be here,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's words appeared to have their desired effect. By
day's end, the dispute had ended. So had the hunger strike, as Ms.
Fritz said in a letter to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   She said ``certain understandings'' had been reached with a
lawyer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, including that Ajaj
would be given access to doctors and appropriate medical care. She
said that if further problems developed with the guards, the lawyer
would be available for Ms. Fritz to call.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fritz did not return calls to her office Friday seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan, said prosecutors would have no comment.

SENATE REPUBLICANS FIND THE HOUSE TRIAL MANAGERS UNGRATEFUL
GUESTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf to eliminate duplicate reference to Hyde as the
leader of the House prosecutors. No other changes.)  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans say they have given Rep. Henry
Hyde just about everything he could ask for: an impeachment trial,
depositions from witnesses, even the possibility that Monica
Lewinsky may be summoned in person, or on videotape, to testify on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   And they have done so, they say, at great risk to the comity and
dignity that define their august institution. So what do they get
in return? A heap of abuse, in their view.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican managers who serve as prosecutors in the Senate
trial of President Clinton may be heroes to their Republican
colleagues in the House of Representative, but to many in the
Senate, they have become 13 angry men.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate Republicans asked Hyde this week, for example,
to pare his witness list to what he called ``a pitiful three,'' the
Illinois Republican said of his overseers, ``I'm glad those people
weren't at Valley Forge or the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers sounded just as grumpy on Friday about the
ground rules for depositions the Senate adopted Thursday night,
even though their Senate brethren trumpeted them as a hard-fought
victory for the managers' right to make their best case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are awkward and are another difficulty created by
the Senate for our presentation,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon,
R-Utah. ``The Senate is conveying the idea they are a superior
body. I'm offended that senators hold themselves wiser or better
than those of us from the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, led by the white-maned Hyde, are true
believers, men on a mission, and to friends and foes alike, they
just cannot be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they've been frustrated, some more than others,
with the format they've had to operate under,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican whose brother, Asa, a House
manager, has bit his tongue more than once to check his irritation
with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asa would like to have this over as much as anyone,''
Hutchinson said, ``but he has that trial lawyer's push. He wants to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans wonder if the House managers are not
acting just a bit like ingrates, given the holes in their
circumstantial case that might have been plugged by live witnesses
the House Judiciary Committee decided not to call. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of time for discovery in the fall,'' said Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala. ``Maybe they thought their case was stronger
than it actually was.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem lies in institutional differences. The House
and Senate chambers are on opposite sides of the Capitol, but they
might as well be on different planets, given the baffled reactions
of many House managers to the arcane ways of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors complain that they have been left in the dark as
Senate Democrats and Republicans negotiate important details of
their proceedings, like what the order of the depositions will be,
how long they will last and what questions can be asked. The
frustration is especially acute with junior House managers who have
dealt less with the proudly deliberative Senate. Many are now
resigned to this weird dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from the House,'' said Rep. James Rogan of California,
who will interview Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, on
Wednesday. ``We just show up with our briefcases and announce,
`Ready to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is differing expectations. Hyde and the House
managers would prefer a bipartisan outcome, but they say the
pursuit of truth and duty is their ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   If only Senate Republicans would show some spine and not worry
so much about civility, the managers say privately, the prosecutors
could try the case  &UR; their &LR;  way and persuade all of America that
Bill Clinton really should be kicked out of office.
</P>
<P>
   That was Rep. Bill McCollum's double-barreled message to
senators this week when he criticized them for abridging the
witness list. ``We still do believe that 10 or 12 witnesses are
what we should have and should have been permitted to call to prove
our case,'' he said, demanding that senators allow flesh-and-blood
testimony. ``In real criminal trials,'' the Florida Republican
said, ``the witness is normally live.''
</P>
<P>
   But as many others have tried to remind them, this is not a
criminal trial; it is a political-criminal hybrid subject to the
caprices of public-opinion polls and impending elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has tried
to balance the public clamor for a speedy trial with the outraged
calls from his party's conservative base _ and their flag-bearers
in the Senate _ to let the House be the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott and his caucus know they do not have the 67 votes
needed to convict and remove Clinton. A prolonged trial probably
hurts Republicans more than Democrats, they fear. ``We need to give
the House managers maximum flexibility,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, a
Colorado Republican, ``but we don't want them to wander way off.''
</P>
<P>
   So the managers march on. In new dark suits, they argued more
thoughtfully and effectively on the Senate floor than their critics
ever expected. They continue to push their cause, on the talk-show
circuit and now in preparing for the depositions, even as they
perceive the Senate is hemming them in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crusade that is taking a steep personal toll, their
friends say. Asa Hutchinson, a witty, engaging man, does not smile
much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a spellbinding story
teller, sounds more strident these days. ``This is what his life
has boiled down to,'' Rep. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina
Republican, said of his friend, Graham. ``He told me last week,
`I'm ready to get a real life back.'''

SOARING CONTRACTS MAY LEVEL OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to the salaries of sports stars in the 21st
Century, the sky might not be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the superstars will continue to earn fabulous amounts of
money, and the gap between the haves and have-nots will continue to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts believe the implementation of salary caps, luxury
taxes, and a variety of other restrictions could put a limit on
escalating contracts well before the first decade of new century
has passed. It seems hard to believe. After all the Dodgers just
signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a seven-year $105 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   That figure would have been unthinkable just 30 years ago when
the average baseball player earned about $30,000 on the field and
had to sell cars or real estate in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   It was big news when Dodger pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don
Drysdale held out before the 1966 baseball season. Koufax finally
agreed to a $120,000 contract; Drysdale signed for $105,000. They
became the highest paid teammates in professional sports, but such
salaries are peanuts today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salary caps have emerged as a quid pro quo to free agency,''
writes Cal State Hayward professor Paul D. Staudohar in a paper
published by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``While players are allowed to sell their services to the
highest bidder, the salary cap (keeps) labor costs from rising (too
high).''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has no salary cap, but experts believe some form of
control will have to be imposed on owners and players when the
league's labor agreement expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries got so out-of-whack in professional basketball that the
NBA, after a lengthy lockout, had to swallow a salary cap that
limits how much the league's players can earn. As a result,
up-and-coming players like the Lakers' Kobe Bryant and the 76ers'
Allen Iverson will never earn what their counterparts did just
three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's cookie-cutter contract with the Lakers will net him
just $70.8 million for six years. In contrast Kevin Garnett, who
signed before the new labor agreement, will make $126 million over
the life of a contract that will never again be offered in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bryant -- for one -- isn't too worried about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven million, $8 million, $9 million, that's still a lot of
money,'' Bryant told the Associated Press. ``I'm very happy with
the situation. I think a lot of guys would play for free, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stealing money. We are overpaid. We're playing
basketball,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The new millennium brings limits to the NBA for the first time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Before the lockout, the NFL player strikes of 1982 and 1987 were
the longest and hardest fought in sports history, according to
Staudohar. For now the league's labor relations appear harmonious.
Its current labor agreement extends through 2002 -- until then
there is a cap on what owners can spend to fill their rosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our league salaries are tied to the overall cap, unlike the
new basketball limitations,'' said Al Lo Cosale, executive
assistant for the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's salary cap is expected to go up about $5 million next
season to $57.5 million per team, according to an estimate made by
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association. The
1998 salary cap was $52.388 million per team -- $10 million more
than it was in 1997. The increase was due to the $18 billion,
eight-year television contract that took effect at the beginning of
this season. The cap will continue to rise as long as the agreement
remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   That could be quite some time, said Greg Aiello, the NFL's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no reason why the agreement won't be extended beyond
2004,'' Aiello said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Because of revenue sharing, salary caps and other factors,
professional football should experience labor peace well into the
next decade. And salaries should stay relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the ability for somebody to just go out and buy
a winner. They can move toward it but there are limits because of
the cap,'' said Lo Casale. ``There is also a minimum built in so
somebody cannot go out and say, `I'm not going to spend a thing.'
''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the NHL, where average salaries rose from
$173,000 in 1986 to $981,000 in 1997, there are no constraints --
except on rookie salaries. There is also a fairly weak free agency
system. The collective bargaining agreement between owners and
players extends through September 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, any constraints in hockey are imposed by the market,
according to Staudohar.
</P>
<P>
   In the end there is no crystal ball to predict whether the
Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr. will become baseball's first $200 million
player, or if some player will break the $1 billion barrier before
the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Staudohar does offer a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists know that programs for controlling wages and prices
at the national level ... are not particularly effective,'' the
professor wrote. ``Salary caps and payroll taxes may seem
beneficial to owners but their effects appear to be more symbolic
and cosmetic than fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   As Y2K dawns, it's pretty clear that caps, payroll taxes and
revenue streams will continue to be issues on the bargaining tables
in all professional leagues.

RENO DECIDES AGAINST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IN CASE OF FORMER CLINTON

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending an inquiry that has haunted her for months,
Attorney General Janet Reno declined on Friday to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate whether the former White House
aide Harold M. Ickes lied to a Senate committee two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision represented a significant step toward bringing the
Justice Department's long-running campaign finance inquiry to a
close, leaving virtually no investigation open that could lead to
an independent counsel's examination of President Clinton's
re-election fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable basis to believe that any additional
investigation would discover additional evidence sufficient to
prove that Ickes' testimony was knowingly and intentionally
false,'' Ms. Reno found in a legal analysis of the case.
</P>
<P>
   With the cloud of potential criminal prosecution lifted after
nearly a year of inquiry into whether he testified falsely about
his activities on behalf of the Teamsters union, Ickes said: ``I
feel very pleased and very relieved. There is no question in my
mind that she reached the right conclusion. I was hopeful and
confident that she would.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was pleased by the outcome. ``I have always
had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and
appropriately,'' Clinton said in a statement. Ickes' lawyer, Robert
S. Bennett, said he was ``gratified'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, who in the past had savagely denounced
Ms. Reno for repeatedly deciding against the appointment of
independent counsels, had mixed reactions to the final rebuff that
left the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation
sputtering to a close with a record of about a dozen prosecutions
against lower-level campaign fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., expressed dismay. ``I don't see
how she could determine there wasn't a violation,'' he said. ``She
was willing to have Judge Starr look into the president's sexual
activity, but she has consistently refused to look at something at
the very center of the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of
the Governmental Affairs Committee, which investigated the
Democrats' political fund raising and referred Ickes's case to the
Justice Department, said the decision would hasten the death of the
independent counsel statute. ``The demise of the independent
counsel law when it expires this year may be the most notable
achievement of her tenure,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAFS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed disappointment. ``I don't
wish Harold Ickes any harm,'' Hatch said in an interview Friday
night on CNN. ``Frankly there's enough evidence that should have
triggered the independent counsel statute. It's a very grave
disappointment and spells the death of the independent counsel
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who headed a House
committee investigation of campaign financing, said: ``The attorney
general is once again protecting the president and his friends.
Janet Reno has defied the spirit and the letter of the independent
counsel statute.'' He added, ``Her investigation has become a
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPITONAL GRAFS
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Ickes's truthfulness had confronted Ms. Reno with a
difficult decision. She weighed the matter for 90 days before
seeking a 60-day extension, which expired on Friday. Ms. Reno
deliberated until late in the afternoon as the time for
consideration ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations about Ickes focused on a single question and
answer during a three-day deposition in September 1997 about the
efforts of the Clinton administration on behalf of the Teamsters
union during a strike against Diamond Walnut Co., a California nut
processing company. The teamsters had supported Clinton during his
first presidential campaign in 1992 and Democrats wanted their
support in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate investigator asked, ``What did the administration do
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes replied, ``Nothing that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses testified that Ickes had urged Mickey Kantor,
then the U.S. trade representative, to telephone the company about
the strike, and Kantor acknowledged calling the Diamond Walnut
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee uncovered a Teamsters union memo related to
a 1995 meeting between Ickes and union officials. The memo said
that the union contributed $2.4 million to Democratic candidates in
1992 and suggested the administration consider helping on issues
like the strike if it wanted continued support.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he had asked Kantor to
urge Diamond Walnut officials to settle the strike. Later, Kantor
said he had asked only for a status report.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials and Charles G. La Bella, the former head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance unit, had urged Ms. Reno to
refer the Ickes case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Ms. Reno said she reasoned that Ickes did
not break the law. ``The questions asked of Ickes were ambiguous,
and his answers were truthful under a reasonable interpretation of
the question,'' Reno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The serious defects in the questioning, the relatively
insignificant nature of the underlying event, the extended lapse of
time and the absence of any perceivable motive to conceal create an
insurmountable barrier to the proof of any potential criminal
violation,'' Ms. Reno concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, she found no reasonable grounds to seek the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Clinton's role
in the multi-million-dollar Democratic fund-raising campaign for
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier she found insufficient grounds to ask an
independent counsel to investigate whether Vice President Al Gore
had lied to Justice Department investigators about his fund-raising
efforts in the re &UR; - &LR; election campaign, a decision that removed a
potential hurdle in the path of &UR;  &LR; Gore's expected presidential
candidacy.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since the sudden death of Glenn Bernbaum last
September, closing down Mortimer's, the public outpost for the rich
and socially registered that he ran for 22 years, the social flock
has been circling the Upper East Side, looking for a new place to
alight.
</P>
<P>
   Some have swooped down on Doubles, the private club in the
Sherry-Netherland Hotel. The Park Avenue doyenne Nan Kempner has
brought her posse, which includes Kenneth Jay Lane and Mica
Ertegun, to her own home, where her cook, Silvina Barroso, makes
them lunch every day. ``I never know who is going to show up,''
said Mrs. Kempner, who sometimes entertains 12.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the old regulars, particularly the younger set, have
found a new sanctuary. Since they can no longer have chicken salad
at Mortimer's, they are dining on demi canard de barbarie a
l'orange sanguine at La Goulue, the French bistro on Madison Avenue
at 64th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has been building for a while, but this past week it
was at a full roar. All the signs of a clubby Upper East Side
restaurant _ people table-hopping and calling out to one another;
the men in double-breasted blazers and pocket squares, the women
with coiffed helmet hair _ were apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Three times during the week, the socialite Nina Griscom and her
husband, Dan Baker, a plastic surgeon, dined at La Goulue. On
Monday night, not far from them, sat a table of other chums of
Mortimer's, including Diana D. Brooks of Sotheby's and her husband,
Michael; Tony Mortimer, a son of Babe Paley, and his wife, Siri,
and the magazine publisher Chris Meigher and his wife, Grace.
</P>
<P>
   At a central table, the decorator Geoffrey Bradfield presented a
silk dressing gown with little sheep on it as a birthday gift to
Mark F. Gilbertson, a director of the Museum of the City of New
York's junior committee. When Gilbertson paraded around the dining
room in his robe, Ms. Meigher shouted, ``Mark, you'll have to wear
that to our house in Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Farkas, a one-time Mortimer's fixture, who has been
dining at La Goulue three times a week, said of the new place's
anointment: ``I don't think it was a conscious thing. It's
subconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   But he called the restaurant, with its oak floors, frosted-glass
partitions and bistro mirrors, a natural choice. ``Nello's is too
model-y, too trendy,'' he said. ``At Balthazar, if you're not a
movie person or someone they'll recognize immediately you will have
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   New York may be a city of 10,000 restaurants, but as Farkas sees
it, ``there was nowhere else to go.'' He dined at La Goulue twice
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look decent and you're part of the 10021 life style,
they'll cultivate you,'' he said referring to the zip code for much
of Manhattan's Upper East Side. ``Just like Mortimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Vietor Glass, who got engaged at Mortimer's in 1982, has
been dining regularly at La Goulue with her husband, John. ``It's
the same type of atmosphere,'' she said. ``Good food, but not over
the top. A nice attractive crowd. It's comfortable. There aren't
that many places that are an extension of your apartment. It's
clearly the new Mortimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Latapie, who with his wife, Susan, owns La Goulue, is
not entirely happy with the comparison. With no disrespect to
Bernbaum, Latapie, who was once the maitre d'hotel at Le Cirque,
sniffed and said, ``Here we have good food and a wine list.''
</P>
<P>
   La Goulue's own longtime regulars are beginning to see the
differences that the new crowd has wrought. Ralph Weindling, a
retired management consultant who was having dinner with his wife
the other night, said it is harder to get a reservation now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be able to call that day and come in at any time,''
he said. ``Now if you come in at 7 p.m. without a reservation, you
may get a table, but when you get into the real players' time, at 9
p.m., you definitely need a reservation days in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime, the evolution of the crowd is also apparent,
though less so than at night. Pat Buckley and Blaine Trump, former
Mortimer's regulars and occasional patrons of La Goulue, now have
lunch at La Goulue more often.
</P>
<P>
   As at Mortimer's, the new regulars at La Goulue are beginning to
feel so comfortable that they don't hesitate to show up alone. On
Wednesday, Maldwin Drummond, 40, a private investor, was dining
alone for the third or fourth time that week. ``Anytime I went to
Mortimer's, I knew 90 percent of the people when I walked in,'' he
said. ``Now this place is becoming like a big cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Drummond was back again. Sitting across the
room with another man, Elizabeth Ballard, a former girlfriend of
Drummond's, looked over and said, ``I think he gets his mail
here.''

RASH OF BABY ABANDONMENTS IN HOUSTON AREA CALLED `AN ANOMALY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HANSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In slightly more than a month, five newborn children
have been abandoned in the Houston area, an ``anomaly'' that local
officials say is not a trend.
</P>
<P>
   But, they say, it is still alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent case, a baby girl was left Thursday outside
Rosewood Hospital in a knapsack, covered with placenta and blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``An animal could have come along and run off with that
knapsack,'' said Judy Hay of Children's Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating, Hay and others said, is that no one need
abandon any infant, because agencies are ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Hay said CPS usually handles about 15 cases a month of abandoned
children of all ages and sees another 15 teen-age mothers who want
to give up their children for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with newborns (left) laying out like this in very
dangerous situations, we are used to one, maybe two a month,'' Hay
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has contacted children's agencies around the
country and found no other regions experiencing an increase in
abandonments. And, she noted, teen-age pregnancy rates are down
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anomaly,'' Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the mothers of abandoned newborns are often teen-agers,
but not always.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can involve homelessness with women in their 20s, with
women that have other children. It can involve poverty, drugs,''
Hay said. ``Somehow they can't cope with the pregnancy or they
don't want their family to know because the family will insist they
raise the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Franzmeier, program manager for adoption services at
Delpelchin Children's Center, said women who have contemplated
abandoning their children have told counselors they felt helpless
and hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have any resources to be parent of the baby,'' she
said, ``I think that anybody who follows through with abandonment
must feel like there are no choices. They are pretty desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have to be, she said, because Depelchin and other
adoption agencies can give them advice and help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is confidential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That applies even if the mother is a minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't want to tell their parents if they are
young,'' she said. ``Or, if they are older they may be in a
relationship where they don't want the man to know they are
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent abandonment occurred Thursday. About 6:45 a.m.
CST, a security guard at Rosewood Hospital in west Houston saw a
knapsack on the ground near the emergency room entrance.
</P>
<P>
   When the guard opened the knapsack he was startled to find a
baby girl inside. The child, dubbed Rose Wood, by hospital
personnel, was just hours old when found and is expected to be
released from the hospital Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hay said she will be placed in a foster or adoptive home.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, a woman on her way to work in southwest
Houston found a newborn boy beneath a sheet. The boy, called Isaiah
by hospital personnel, was in good condition at Texas Children's
Hospital and also is expected to be released soon to a
foster/adoptive home.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, police were called to a middle school in Wallis in
Austin County where a baby boy had been found. He is at Polly Ryon
Hospital in Richmond and will not be released until he gains some
more weight, Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29 a newborn boy was found on the front porch of an
apartment in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl who reported finding him was later arrested
and charged with abandoning the child. The child was in good
condition and later placed in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   And, a baby boy was found in a restroom at St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital Dec. 23. Hay said he is in a foster/adoptive home.
</P>
<P>
   Hay said one of the reasons offered by mothers who abandon
children is that they considered the child to be a burden to be
gotten rid of and not a living human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also underestimated the amount of support they would have
gotten from their families,'' Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   Hay said in the two most recent cases the infants were in peril.
The baby boy found Wednesday in far southwest Houston rolled out of
his blanket on a sidewalk onto the street where he could easily
have been run over.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the minimal for another human life,'' she said,
``would be to safely deliver the baby and safely place them in
another home.''

DUKE? THIS ST. JOHN'S GAME IS REALLY BIG
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pardon St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis if he's sounding
a bit weary after spending the week talking about matchups and
polls and the pressures of playing the top two teams in the nation,
plus a difficult Big East road game, in a six-day span.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Jarvis was going through this exercise one last time as
his ninth-ranked Red Storm (17-4, 8-1 Big East) prepared for
Saturday's version of the biggest game of the season: a 1 p.m.
matchup with No. 1 Connecticut here at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime loss to second-ranked Duke last Sunday may still be
the talk of the college basketball world, but it now seems far away
to St. John's, and the joy of the Red Storm's thrilling, gritty
victory at Syracuse on Wednesday night has been set aside. In
Connecticut (18-0, 10-0), St. John's faces its most critical test
yet: a team almost as deep as Duke, complete with a player of the
year candidate, Richard Hamilton, who is averaging 22 points per
game; a superstar point guard, Khalid El-Amin (13.7 points, 3.8
assists), and the 6-foot-11-inch center Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team presents matchup problems,'' Jarvis said. ``You've
got to make sure their great players, Hamilton, Kevin Freeman and
El-Amin, don't have career nights. They're loaded. They present
problems just based on their talent level. You do what we've been
doing all year _ just throw different people on different people
and hope they do a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's split its season series with the Huskies last year,
winning in the Garden with Lavor Postell doing a good defensive job
in limiting Hamilton to 17 points, and getting blown out in the
final regular-season game at Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its unblemished record, Connecticut has struggled of
late. The Huskies have trailed at halftime in their last three
games; Miami, the only Big East team to defeat St. John's this
season, took the Huskies to overtime before losing. But the Huskies
have used defensive pressure and a fast-break offense to dominate
the rest of their opponents. Fans at Saturday's game should not
expect the Huskies to change that plan, Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun said, because Connecticut is most comfortable in a
fast-paced game even though St. John's presents matchup problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always feel we have two people who can beat you up the
floor with the fast break,'' Calhoun said. ``That doesn't apply
with St. John's because they have five who can motor. They use
their quickness to prevent being pounded inside and they use it as
a tremendous asset offensively, where they spread the court and
create penetration gaps. We've pressed every team we've played and
we'll press St. John's. If you only have one good ball handler,
we'll try to take it away from him. With St. John's, it's not going
to be full, all-out trapping. We'll play them full court, but not
in the same mode. St. John's is unique, their smaller guys are some
of the smallest guys in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, some of the most fearless. St. John's has
provided some of the most dramatic basketball of the season in its
last two games _ and in the process caught everyone's attention _
even though Tyrone Grant, the team's best rebounder and its
emotional leader, is not due to have his injured wrist re-evaluated
until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a group of kids that really, really are not afraid of
anybody,'' Jarvis said. ``They've beaten so many of these kids
before, in AAU. And when you have adversity you get tougher or
weaker, and our kids got tougher. They don't want to be looked at
as a group that relies on one guy. They take everything as a
personal challenge.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: IN A WORD   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.199 9 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   An unfortunate incident reached an unfortunate conclusion in the
office of the mayor of Washington D.C., Anthony Williams, this
week. Williams, who is black, permitted his newly appointed
ombudsman, David Howard, who is white, to resign after using the
word ``niggardly'' in the presence of two co-workers who looked
shocked at the phrase. The word means ``miserly,'' and Howard,
explaining how tight his office budget was, said, ``I will have to
be niggardly with this fund because it's not going to be a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The context clearly was finance, but to one of Howard's
co-workers who is black, the context clearly was race. Howard
resigned, and Williams hurriedly accepted his resignation. Howard
was abject in his apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used bad judgment in using the word `niggardly,''' he said.
``You have to be able to see things from the other person's shoes,
and I did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a racially polarized city, so officials must
choose their words carefully. But there is no evidence that Howard
was trying to make a racist pun or purposely use an offensive
homophone. If anything, Howard was being excessively contrite in
saying, ``It's an arcane word that's unfamiliar to a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The English language is a glorious construct. Words that are
correctly used cannot be barred from conversation for the simple
reason that they are not shopworn.
</P>
<P>
   Howard may blame himself for lack of sensitivity, but surely the
larger fault lies with Williams for being too hasty in accepting
Howard's resignation. The proper response is to give him his job
back.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK :  PICKING THE PARLIAMENT'S HOTTEST HITS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere in the former Communist world, the transition to
democracy and the free market depends on the young. While older
people tend to feel threatened by the risk and responsibility
demanded by capitalism, those in their 20's relish them. For the
most part, the young are more tolerant, less nationalistic and more
interested in European normality than their elders. They do not
support the Slobodan Milosevics of the region. But their views
count little, because like young people everywhere, they tend not
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   So it was startling that two days before Slovakia's
parliamentary elections last fall, Bratislava's central square
filled with young people listening to rock bands and shouting ``We
will go vote!'' And 80 percent of the 380,000 voters age 18 to 21
did, compared with 20 percent in the 1994 elections. More than
two-thirds of them supported the opposition, making a difference as
Slovakia ousted Vladimir Meciar, a nationalist bully, and installed
a promising pro-European coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The mobilization of Slovakia's youth was a campaign that
deserves study by democracy activists in neighboring countries,
especially those run by autocrats such as Milosevic or Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia, who stage-manage their own elections.
</P>
<P>
   A year before Slovakia's vote, an American Peace Corps volunteer
working in the Slovak affiliate of the American Foundation for a
Civil Society thought about Rock the Vote, an American effort to
encourage young people to vote. Could it work in Slovakia?
</P>
<P>
   The foundation hired 23-year-old Marek Kapusta, who had managed
a team of young Slovak election observers in Bosnia, to direct what
became ``Rock volieb '98'' _ Rock the Vote '98. The youth campaign
was part of an ambitious, mainly nonpartisan effort by Slovakia's
nongovernmental groups, which have high credibility, to turn out
voters, track the government-controlled media and monitor voting.
``We had to be positive and light,'' Kapusta told me. ``And we had
to attract media, because we couldn't pay for it.'' Rock volieb
staged a 16-city concert tour, during which young volunteers handed
out T-shirts and voter information.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, video producers were making spots featuring the
American rapper Coolio and Slovak celebrities, including musicians
and snowboarding and hockey stars, in MTV-style ads set to the
music of the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. ``When you go out in
the evening you choose your club,'' a famous disk jockey says in
one. ``Make sure you vote, because a DJ may be coming whom you
don't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock volieb got the ads free airplay on MTV Europe and
Slovakia's private TV station 8 or 10 times a day. They played in
theaters before the movie premiere of ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapusta is now talking to his potential counterparts in Croatia
and Serbia. But Slovakia's success may complicate their attempts to
duplicate it. Meciar probably tolerated Rock volieb because the
young were famously apathetic. Now authoritarian leaders know they
are a threat. But the Slovak experience may also energize
democratic activists in Croatia and Serbia, giving a shot of
confidence to a fragmented and demoralized opposition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a surgeon wielding a scalpel, Mark S. Hansen has cut
swiftly and deeply into Fleming Co., closing plants, eliminating
departments and dismissing workers.
</P>
<P>
   He has been chief executive of Fleming, the United States'
second-largest food distributor after Supervalu Inc., for just two
months. But swift action was essential: The fat and decay at the
ailing company, which has $15 billion in sales, posed too great a
threat, and its complacent culture was too big an obstacle in a
rapidly evolving business. The ordeal will be painful, but Hansen
says he believes it will ultimately put Fleming on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   He is intent on ``repositioning the thinking process at Fleming
as a company that wins as opposed to one that doesn't,'' he said.
That includes a plan endorsed by Hansen, 44, to make the company's
leadership more accountable to shareholders, by requiring directors
_ including Hansen, who is also chairman _ to be re-elected
annually instead of every three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a history of very kind shareholder
relationships,'' Hansen said. ``This is absolutely an olive branch
to our shareholders that says we are concerned about what your
issues are and are willing to change accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the proposal reflects management's confidence that
the Oklahoma City-based company, which distributes food products to
3,000 supermarkets in 42 states, including nearly 300 stores of its
own, will be able to right itself and thrive again.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strategy to revamp Fleming, including the plan for
shorter board terms, was devised long before Hansen was hired in
November to run the company after an extensive search. Last year,
after a string of disappointing quarters, Fleming conducted an
eight-month internal assessment of its operations and laid out a
restructuring strategy. It is Hansen's mandate to expand on and
execute the plan at a company that is clearly in need of a new and
clearer vision.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's numbers remain bad. In the third quarter of 1998, the
latest it has reported, Fleming had a net loss of $2.3 million, or
5 cents a diluted share, on sales of $3.4 billion. The quarter a
year earlier was worse, with a $3.8 million net loss on essentially
the same sales. Fleming is expected to report results for all of
1998 on Feb. 18, and it has projected that annual revenue will
decrease by a total of $1 billion over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry where profit margins are already razor-thin,
Fleming's lag behind competitors. Its stock has lost nearly
three-fifths of its value since 1994, closing at $8.093 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen wants to move margins closer to 1 percent of sales, from
one-fourth of 1 percent, and to lift the stock out of the basement.
It is these lofty goals that call for the major surgery he is
performing.
</P>
<P>
   To start, he said, the company is too bureaucratic. So he has
reduced the number of operating units to 14 from 57 and eliminated
220 corporate jobs, or about 12 percent of the headquarters staff.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from Wal-Mart's game book, Fleming hopes to get
better prices on everything from soup to saltines by buying
nationally instead of regionally. In the process, the company is
closing seven distribution centers and selling one of its 12
supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming expects to save $20 million annually by combining the
operating units and an additional $10 million a year from the job
cuts. But the company is taking hefty charges _ $667 million in the
fourth quarter alone _ related to its business overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Though investors see the restructuring as a move in the right
direction, few expect the stock price to improve any time soon.
``It's become a show-me stock,'' said Antonio DeSpirito, an analyst
with Pzena Investment Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pzena Investment has held on to 800,000 shares that it has owned
for about two years because it thinks the price has the potential
to recover as Hansen's revamping takes hold. Nevertheless,
DeSpirito said, ``Everyone is skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the company's troubles can be attributed to the swiftly
changing nature of the business in which it operates. Along with
other companies that supply independent grocers, Fleming has been
hurt as its customers have struggled to compete with giant chains
like Kroger and Safeway that enjoy huge purchasing power and big
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nontraditional food retailers like Wal-Mart and Kmart
have been adding grocery sections to hundreds of their stores,
further squeezing the smaller grocers who buy from Fleming. As a
result, independents have been selling out to the big chains or
closing at an accelerating rate, constricting the pool of potential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleming has also suffered from some problems that are
uniquely its own.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's cost structure had become top heavy, for example, at a
time when retailers were looking for low-cost operators who could
help them keep their own expenses down in the face of mounting
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was sued several times in recent years, accused of
charging unfair prices to some grocers. It settled the suits
without admitting wrongdoing, but agreed to sell a food
distribution center to Furr's Supermarkets to settle one claim and
paid nearly $20 million to settle another.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said the accusations of overcharging and inflating
manufacturers' prices made in the suits ``obviously hurt the
corporate psyche.'' But Fleming has been able to maintain good
relations with most of its customers, he said, and the company is
trying to put the issues behind it and focus on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's background includes much he can draw on to attack
Fleming's problems. Before joining Fleming, he was president of
Sam's Club, the warehouse-store division of Wal-Mart; he is also a
former president and chief executive of the Petsmart chain and has
extensive experience in management at food retailers like Federated
Foods and Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure at Sam's Club, he said, gave him an inside view of
Wal-Mart, the supermarket industry's nemesis. Wal-Mart is more
simply organized and less bureaucratic than other large
corporations, he said, making it nimble in spite of its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding how they behave and how customers use their
stores,'' he said, ``strengthens and broadens the perspective of
the company.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Attorney General Janet Reno decided not
to let an independent counsel pursue allegations of perjury against
Harold Ickes, the former White House official who ran President
Clinton's 1996 campaign. The decision is consistent with her other
efforts to prevent the thorough investigation of White House
fund-raising recommended by the director of the FBI and by Ms.
Reno's top campaign-finance prosecutor. The Reno cover-up is now
complete and will become a shameful page in Justice Department
history.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a
perjury indictment against Ickes. But that is the sort of sensitive
judgment call that should have been left to an independent counsel
who had broad authority to investigate all aspects of the most
reckless fund-raising operation since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Ickes may have committed perjury when he was
deposed in September 1997 by the Senate governmental Affairs
Committee, the answer seems to hinge on one brief exchange and _
this will sound familiar _ on what is meant by the word ``do.'' In
1995, Ickes met with leaders of the teamsters union about its
long-running strike against Diamond Walnut Growers of California.
The teamsters, a memo prepared for him noted, had given more than
$2 million to Democratic candidates in 1992. The same memo also
suggested that the administration consider helping out on issues
such as the strike if it wanted to continue that level of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the administration do regarding the Diamond Walnut
strike?'' Ickes was asked by the Senate panel. ``Nothing that I
know of,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   It later emerged, and Ickes acknowledges, that he in fact asked
Mickey Kantor, then the trade representative, to intervene on
behalf of the striking union. Ickes' lawyers insist his answer was
proper because Clinton administration officials only made inquiries
and thus did not really ``do'' anything concrete.
</P>
<P>
   An independent counsel unburdened by Ms. Reno's conflict of
interest might have come to the same conclusion. That decision
would have carried an authority beyond the reach of this attorney
general and her compromised Justice Department. &QL;

NAILON'S STRATEGY: LAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Double-secret probation officially begins for TCU's Lee Nailon
in tonight's game against Rice.
</P>
<P>
   His patience, his temper and his hands will be tested and
scrutinized game after game after game.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon has a plan, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laugh,'' Nailon said and then began doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   When a defender bumps him a little too hard, when taunts come in
a little too often, when bait gets tossed in his face with the hope
of getting him to react, he simply plans to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to purposely try to foul me to see how I'm
going to react because of what happened,'' Nailon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon was ejected for fighting 34 seconds into last Saturday's
game against Nevada-Las Vegas after a referee ruled he had thrown a
punch at UNLV guard Mark Dickel. Nailon served an NCAA-mandated
one-game suspension on Monday against Tulsa. He returns at 7:35
tonight at Rice when open season begins on trying to get him to
snap again.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets ejected for fighting again this season, NCAA rules
say that his season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's tougher than the double-secret probation John
Belushi and his frat brothers faced in Animal House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be testing me,'' Nailon said of opponents. ``They do
anyway, but this will be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs laughs at this.
</P>
<P>
   He's at a loss for words, trying to figure out ways that
opponents will bait Nailon that haven't already been tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can they do to him that they haven't already been
doing to him,'' Tubbs said. ``I think he'll handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon is going to talk to game officials before games. He wants
them to keep an eye out for potential baiting, as he and Tubbs
believe Dickel baited Nailon by slapping at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon has moved on, however, and he'll be ready when faced with
scrum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play,'' Nailon said. ``It's been hard watching my
teammates play without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Life without Nailon has been hard on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Minus Nailon, TCU lost back-to-back games against UNLV and
Tulsa. Tubbs hardly took solace in the fact that both losses were
close even though the Frogs were without Nailon and his 22.7 points
a game average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm not looking for silver linings,'' Tubbs said. ``I'm
looking for wins.''

HALL VOTERS SHOULD SAY WHAT LT CAN'T: NO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who keep saying over and over again that morals and
character don't matter make me nervous. When we're in the same
room, I tend to keep one eye on them and the other on my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us, without further preamble, to the great Lawrence
Taylor Hall of Fame debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this morning, ``Bergen Record'' football writer Vinny
DiTrani, one of the 36 members of the Hall of Fame selection
committee, will stand up in the Brickell Meeting Room at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel in Miami and recommend that Taylor, on the strength
of his 132.5 sacks, 10 Pro Bowls and unquestionable impact on the
NFL, be admitted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And the debate will begin. Eight ``no'' votes can do something
few offensive linemen ever could _ block Taylor cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a Hall of Fame without Lawrence Taylor,'' DiTrani has
already told fellow scribes in Miami while stumping for his man,
``is like filming the Titanic without a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the rest of us in this business, Vinny can
sometimes lean toward the hyperbolic.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in New York, where Taylor plied his trade for the
Giants, mauling running backs, mugging tight ends, devouring
quarterbacks like they were mere nachos on his plate of life _ and
all legally, we might add _ is that it would be the biggest crime
since, well, LT's last drug bust, if he's not elected in his first
shot at the Hall today.
</P>
<P>
   That Taylor, in the five years since he retired from the NFL,
has been less than squeaky-clean presents his supporters with at
least a public-relations problem if not the cannon by which his
detractors can blow his candidacy right out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   There are the two drug-related arrests, of course, both highly
publicized. There's the ongoing substance abuse rehab. Oh yeah, in
lesser crimes and misdemeanors, he has also filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy, lost his driver's license because he refused to pay his
parking tickets, three times has been cited for leaving the scene
of accident and was called before a grand jury investigating
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, LT has been a swell guy.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the debate is the criteria on which Taylor should
be judged. If it's his playing career and nothing else, he's a
shoo-in. If citizenship and good character are part of the
requirements, he has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say morals don't matter contend that the Pro Football
Hall of Fame's bylaws for entry, unlike those for the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., say nothing about citizenship. It's
all, they say, about the kind of player a man was.
</P>
<P>
   It's what happened between the lines, they say, not how many
lines Taylor sucked up through a straw after he left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the sad case of former Cowboys receiver Bob
Hayes. If citizenship doesn't matter, then how can it be that the
man who revolutionized the deep passing game with his speed has yet
to be elected? Could it be that Hayes hasn't been ushered into the
Hall because he served a five-year prison sentence after being
charged with distributing cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the precedent has been set.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented move, the NFL, flooded with interview
requests, even arranged a half-hour conference call between Taylor
and football writers at the Super Bowl early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor handled the situation with the same kind of subtlety he
used in once snapping Joe Theismann's leg like a toothpick on
national TV.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude would best be described as arrogant, defiant,
unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me to apologize or feel remorseful for what
I've done ... sorry,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   So much for throwing yourself on the mercy of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Taylor debate has redefined the case for Pete Rose
being re-instated to Major League Baseball and placed on the
Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. Taylor's supporters say that, unlike
Rose, he never did anything to hurt the game, only himself.
</P>
<P>
   There's another major difference, though. Since leaving the game
more than 10 years ago, Rose has kept himself and his record clean,
something Taylor cannot claim. Besides, at least Taylor's case will
be presented and he will be judged by 36 voters. Baseball should
also allow its Hall of Fame voters to determine Rose's worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to this critical question: Are our sports' halls
of fame meant simply for great players or are they for great men
who played the games?
</P>
<P>
   Because I believe that morals and character do very much matter,
I have to vote for the latter.

THOU SHALT NOT PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons linebacker Cornelius Bennett lost four
Super Bowls as a member of the Buffalo Bills. Falcons wide receiver
Tony Martin lost one Super Bowl as a member of the San Diego
Chargers. For their teammates this week, both had plenty of advice
on how not to lose a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest tip was this: Don't let the party atmosphere consume
you.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Martin said they, along with their former teammates,
may have enjoyed Super Bowl week too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we thought we were the party team of the
1990s,'' Bennett said. ``We lost all four \RSuper Bowls\S and there
was good reason. I can only speak for myself. I don't want to name
names, but what we did was cheat ourselves and the Buffalo fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to distract ourselves and get
caught up with the Super Bowl hype. Everyone tried to outdo
everyone. I look back now and think of it as wasted
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, who lost four consecutive Super Bowls by a combined
score of 139-73, were overmatched in three of the losses, two to
the Cowboys and one to the Redskins. Staying off the streets of
Minneapolis, Pasadena, Calif., and Atlanta in the nights leading up
to those Super losses may not have made much difference in the
games. The Bills lost their first Super Bowl, in 1991, to the New
York Giants, 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Broncos defensive lineman Mike Lodish, who was also a
member of those Bills teams, said late-night carousing had little
if anything to do with the three blowout losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our first Super Bowl, Scott Norwood wasn't partying or
drunk when he missed that field goal,'' Lodish said. ``Yeah, I went
out, had a beer, and was in my room by 2 a.m., but that had nothing
to do with the way I played. When we lost to Dallas \R52-17 in
1993\R, you are going to tell me that the guys who turned the ball
over were drunk? Of course not. All I can say about that is, if
we'd been a little more disciplined, maybe we'd be more rested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had a 12:30 a.m. curfew this week, but bed check is
11:15 tonight. The Falcons' curfew was similar, with a post
midnight bed check during the week and a premidnight curfew
tonight. During the week, there were no reports of players missing
curfews, and there were no published sightings of players running
out all night in the South Beach area of Miami, which has numerous
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing, Martin said. The 1994 San Diego
Chargers missed plenty of curfews in the nights leading up to Super
Bowl XXIX. He said some players took the field with bloodshot eyes
as they practiced for the San Francisco 49ers. Predictably, the
Chargers were blown out, 49-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here \Rin Miami\S with the Chargers, we acted like
a high school team or even worse,'' Martin said. ``Some of the guys
were so intoxicated the nights before that they couldn't get it
together in practice the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember NFL security telling us we were the worst team they
ever had to police during a Super Bowl week. That's pretty bad when
they are talking about 58 teams in Super Bowl history to that
point. I knew when 20 guys showed up late for that first practice
in Miami and that we were playing the San Francisco 49ers, that we
would be in for a long night in the Super Bowl. And we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos quarterback John Elway, a loser in the first three Super
Bowls he played in, said the key to the week is being smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't become a hermit and stay in your room,'' Elway said.
``But it takes extra work to stay focused on what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have had fun this week. They welcomed their families
in the latter part of the week. And they'll go to sleep tonight
knowing they have properly balanced football and fun. Martin looks
in the eyes of Falcons teammates and said his team will be as
prepared as the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see something in my teammates' eyes that was not there with
San Diego in 1995,'' Martin said. ``This group knows the
distractions are out there, they just aren't interested. The only
thing we are interested in is winning the first Super Bowl ring for
all of us, and the first title for our fans in Atlanta.''

NEW YORK POLITICAL NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly two years, their feud has been at the
center of an assortment of political dramas in Brooklyn, its battle
lines shaping virtually every contest in the borough. But now the
tension between Rep. Edolphus Towns and Assemblyman Clarence Norman
Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman, shows distinct signs
of easing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Norman and Towns have met _ at the request of
several Brooklyn politicians _ to iron out their differences. And
while they have not yet reached the level of friendship they
enjoyed before their feud began, the relationship is said to be
improving. ``It's getting better,'' Towns said in an interview this
week. ``We're making a lot of progress. I think we'll be able to
work things out between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the closest of friends, the two Democrats began sparring
over competing sets of delegates to the party's convention to
select judicial candidates (Norman won). Then Towns endorsed Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani for re-election in 1997, a move that Norman called
a final straw and an act of party betrayal. The Democratic leader
responded by not endorsing Towns' son, Assemblyman Darryl Towns,
who nonetheless won decisively in the Democratic primary last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement is based at least in part on political
calculation and mutual benefit, many Brooklyn politicians suggest.
Norman won the Democratic nomination for his Crown Heights Assembly
seat last year by a mere 580 votes against a relatively unknown
candidate, making him particularly vulnerable to a potential
challenge in 2000. And Towns has been urged by some leaders to
support a candidate against Norman in that election.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Darryl Towns has made it clear that he intends
to run for Brooklyn borough president in 2001. The support of the
borough's Democratic leader for that race _ to say nothing of his
re-election next year _ would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Club Says It Still Has Clout
</P>
<P>
   Many Brooklyn politicians questioned how robust the Thomas
Jefferson Democratic Club could remain after the death last year of
its leader, Anthony Genovesi, the Canarsie assemblyman and powerful
political strategist. For years, the club has been known for its
prowess in helping to elect officials in the area, and for sending
its members beyond the boundaries of the 39th Assembly District to
assist in the campaigns of Genovesi's allies.
</P>
<P>
   If its legislative breakfast earlier this week served as a
harbinger, the Thomas Jefferson Club is still capable of attracting
a large following. With more than 200 politicians and club members
in attendance, the event brought together an array of officials
supported by the club, including U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep.
Anthony Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the club said they were planning to demonstrate their
muscle in approaching City Council contests and in next year's
Assembly and state Senate races. But club members are also talking
about another rallying point: a potential candidacy of one of their
own, City Councilman Herbert Berman, who is considering running for
comptroller in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'm looking at,'' said Berman, chairman of the
Council's finance committee and Genovesi's successor as a
Democratic district leader. ``But, no matter what, we will still be
a strong political force in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Man With a Mission
</P>
<P>
   For months now, G. Oliver Koppell, the former New York attorney
general, has dedicated himself to the mission of trying to change
the way the state places candidates' names on the ballot. While
Koppell has met several roadblocks along the way, he received a
glimmer of encouragement this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under state election law, placement on the ballot in statewide
primary contests is determined by lot. If a candidate wins that
lottery and receives the top spot on the ballot, that name appears
at the top of every ballot throughout the state, except those in
New York City. In the city, the order of candidates' names is
rotated, with each candidate at the top of the ballot in about an
equal number of city election districts.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians take it as a given that the top ballot position
confers an advantage, and Koppell is trying to gather hard evidence
to support that view.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell, who was defeated in four-way Democratic primaries in
1994 and last year, has maintained that the first-place spot can
provide as much as a 10-point advantage to a candidate,
particularly in races that receive little news media attention.
</P>
<P>
   But he failed in his effort last summer to have U.S. District
Court in Manhattan issue an injunction to alter the system for the
Democratic primary. Later, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld that ruling. But last week, the same U.S. District Court
said it would hear Koppell's argument to determine whether the
system used outside New York City creates an unfair advantage for
some candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by this,'' said Koppell, who now practices law
in Manhattan. ``The court has at least opened the door.''

EDITORIAL: THE ONEIDAS' CLAIM ON NEW YORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Wis., CANADA)   c.199 9 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The sins of Albany's political forebears are being visited on
20,000 property owners in upstate New York who have deeds or
property rights on about 270,000 acres now being claimed by the
Oneida Indians. The Oneidas argue that between 1795 and 1840, the
state purchased the large territory east of Syracuse from their
tribe but failed to seek congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Without that approval, today's Oneidas claim, the land could not
be sold legally. Therefore, the tribe argues, with some support
from the courts and the U.S. Justice Department, the land still
belongs to the Oneida Nation, which has about 1,000 members in New
York state, 15,000 in Wisconsin and 3,000 in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, a stark choice between the Oneidas and 20,000
upstate property owners is about as politically enticing to Gov.
George Pataki as a new income tax on small farmers. As Raymond
Halbritter, the elected leader of the Oneida Indian Nation of New
York, acknowledges: ``No governor wants to pay this bill on his
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter and the Oneidas became convinced after years of
discussion with former Gov. Mario Cuomo that the state's tactic was
to talk the issue onto his successor's desk. When Pataki was
elected, the matter seemed to disappear again until the Justice
Department decided to put its heft behind the Oneidas' case and the
tribe moved to add the 20,000 frantic landowners as defendants in
an effort to force a settlement. The passions now stewing in the
land mass between Syracuse and Utica have triggered plans for a
``nonconfrontational'' parade Saturday in Verona, where cars and
floats are set to circle the Oneidas' lucrative Turning Stone
Casino.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Syracuse is considering the appointment of an
expert to help negotiate a settlement. For previous claims settled
in other states, a fund was established with state and federal
money to buy land from willing sellers. Other possibilities include
a payment to the Oneidas or allowing an economic development zone
to lure businesses onto the tax-free reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said they know of no cases in which
landowners have been forced to give up their homes, but Pataki
needs to focus on this problem that clearly has landed on his
watch. The understandable anxiety among homeowners will not be
allayed by trying to stall or back away from giving the Oneidas
their due.

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the most expensive deal in the history of network
television _ and the riskiest, carrying predictions that it might
come close to bankrupting the companies that agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Super Sunday for the National Football League, one year
after three networks committed a total of $12.8 billion for rights
to broadcast NFL games through 2005, the alarm that sounded on many
sides of the television industry has become muted.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is a growing conviction that in the diminished
world of network television, football may soon be among the few
sure sources of big audiences _ especially male audiences, the most
precious commodity for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the reliable, enduring appeal of the sport that is
convincing some television executives inside and outside the
networks that the financial risks of meeting the NFL's extravagant
price pale in comparison with the risk of a future without
football, particularly as the advent of digital television promises
to multiply the number of television channels many times over.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen Media Research, men already are watching
less television across the board than in the past. But all three
broadcast networks with professional football _ ABC, CBS and Fox _
have shown some growth in one category or another of male viewers
for their regular prime-time shows this season. At least in part,
those numbers are connected to the promotional opportunities that
football games offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NBC, the network that chose to walk away from
the NFL rather than pay what it deemed to be an inflated price for
the right to broadcast games, has lost fully a quarter of the male
viewers who watched its shows last season. (Its prime-time ratings
among men 18 to 49 were down 26 percent in late 1998 and early 1999
from the same period a year earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   While the largest portion of those male defections is being
attributed by executives both inside and outside NBC to the absence
this season of what had been television's most popular
entertainment show among men, ``Seinfeld,'' the loss of football
amounts to a second wound for NBC, one that is certainly
contributing to its hemorrhaging of male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Many advertisers pay a premium to pitch to men, because they are
harder to reach than women, who simply watch more television. ``In
prime time, most shows are geared toward women,'' said Steve
Sternberg, a senior partner with TN Media in New York, a company
that advises advertisers about buying commercial time on
television. ``So when you get a show that draws men, it is
particularly valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Football, though it does have a sizable number of female fans,
still draws a heavy concentration of men, which makes it a must buy
for companies that sell products like beer, cars and shaving gear.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, the networks have seen their share of
the overall television audience greatly reduced because of
competition from the growing number of cable television channels.
So despite some overall losses in viewing for the NFL over that
time, there is an increasing recognition of the value of football
as a means to attract a mass audience as channels mushroom in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this year's National Football Conference
championship game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota
Vikings generated a 25.7 rating for Fox, the network that bought
the rights to carry NFC games in last year's deal. The American
Football Conference championship game between the New York Jets and
the Denver Broncos hit a 26.6 for CBS, which won the rights to AFC
games. (Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Only two programs do better than that in any year: the Academy
Awards and Sunday's main event, the Super Bowl. That means three of
the four top-rated programs every year _ in all times, not just in
prime time _ are NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see football as vitally important; in the year 2005, it's
going to look like a giant in a sea of pygmies,'' said David Hill,
chairman of the Fox network, a unit of News Corp., which won
legitimacy as a network largely on the basis of outbidding CBS for
NFC games in 1994. Fox paid $1.58 billion that year for four years
of games, and $4.4 billion in last January's deal to renew the
rights for another eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is holding up very well in the face of the
fragmentation of viewers,'' said Dean Bonham, the head of the
Bonham Group, a Denver-based sports marketing firm that specializes
in analyzing financial deals for sports properties. ``The NFL is
insurance. For these networks, whether they lose money on the deal
or not, the NFL is not part of the problem; it's part of the
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg of TN Media agreed. ``Five years from now, this could
look like the greatest deal in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it still looks a bit pricey. The networks that
agreed to pay those billions all recognize that they cannot charge
enough for the commercials during the games themselves to cover the
enormous annual rights fees. They have all tried to use football as
a promotional lever to build revenue in other areas, like regular
prime-time programming, their own cable programming and even their
informational sites on the Internet, where the networks are seeking
a growing presence.
</P>
<P>
   The record of success for those efforts is open to some debate.
NBC executives, who still find themselves defending the network's
decision to abandon professional football after more than 30 years,
say that any network in the NFL deal can expect losses of more than
$100 million a year from it, making it extremely difficult for the
networks to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, said the full measure of
the risk of the deal made by the other networks cannot yet be
taken. ``In a great economy, the likes of which has seldom been
seen before, this is a very shaky deal economically,'' he said.
``In a bad economy, it's unimaginable how bad it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol agreed that the NFL retained a powerful appeal among
viewers. ``There are four or five times a year when you get a
lead-in for your shows like nothing else on television,'' he said.
``But we said, `Do you trade that for $150 million to $200 million
in losses?'''
</P>
<P>
   NBC insists that the falloff in its numbers of prime-time male
viewers this year cannot be attributed to the absence of NFL games.
``We can find no statistical evidence that the loss of football is
a major part of our problem,'' said Randy Falco, president of the
NBC Network. Instead, both he and Ebersol put the blame on the
network's failure to develop strong hits in the last three years
that could take up the slack from the ``Seinfeld'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the three networks that paid huge prices for
football argued when their deal with the NFL was announced last
year that critics had exaggerated the expected losses. They
predicted that in the long run, their investment in football would
prove to be successful _ both economically and strategically.
</P>
<P>
   CBS says the deal is already paying off. The network has been
the most aggressive of the three in claiming that it will make a
modest profit on the NFL, even though, at $500 million a year, it
agreed to pay more than double what NBC had been paying under the
previous NFL contract for rights to the AFC games.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports, pointed to the ratings
for CBS' nationally televised games this season, which were exactly
equal to those that NBC recorded the year earlier _ a performance
that defied the general downward trend in ratings for network
programming.
</P>
<P>
   As for revenues from NFL games, McManus said, ``We accomplished
our goals for the season; in fact, we exceeded our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other senior CBS executives declined to offer any
specifics about the network's football revenue, but several
executives involved in the sale of commercials during NFL games
said CBS had taken in about $360 million from those ad sales. Ad
agencies would keep 15 percent to 17 percent for commissions,
leaving net revenues for CBS of just over $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The network also said it received about $80 million in new
revenue for the local stations that it owns _ seven of which,
including WCBS in New York, are in cities with AFC teams. The $80
million figure has been disputed by some of CBS' rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, the NBC Sports president, also suggested that CBS had a
one-year-only break this season as it absorbed some money from
advertisers displaced from NBC by the strike that killed the early
part of the National Basketball Association season. But CBS
executives said that any extra money the network accrued from NBA
sponsors contributed little to the $70 million in additional
advertising revenue that it took in over NBC's total for the AFC
package the year before.
</P>
<P>
   CBS certainly benefited from a deal it made last year with its
affiliated stations to share some of the costs of its football
contract. CBS executives put the affiliates' contribution at about
$40 million, though only about $28 million of that was in cash,
with the rest taking the form of a complicated exchange of
advertising time. (Fox made a similar arrangement with its
affiliates.)
</P>
<P>
   One other source of revenue for CBS is subscription fees paid by
satellite services. Those fees, currently about $5 million, should
increase in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   So a best-case scenario _ after subtracting the $35 million CBS
paid in production costs this year _ puts CBS' total football
revenue at about $380 million _ well below the $500 million annual
rights fee it must pay. But CBS spread out its payments to the NFL,
assigning only $300 million to $330 million to the first year of
the deal. That might mean that enormous costs are looming in the
future, though CBS financial executives say they have taken steps
to assure that no overwhelming balloon payments lie ahead. They say
they will use some of the money made this year to cover those
deferred expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Less tangible, but perhaps more important for CBS, is the
influence that the NFL may be having on both the network's
prime-time schedule and its overall image. Leslie Moonves,
president of CBS Television, cited 12 shows that have attracted
bigger male audiences this season than the shows that were in the
same time periods last year. The network's new core of hits _
including ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``King of Queens,''
``Becker'' and ``JAG'' _ were heavily pushed during football games.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two new programs, ``60 Minutes II'' and ``Turks,''
garnered strong ratings when they were introduced in recent weeks _
thanks, in part, to the exposure they got in heavily viewed NFL
playoff games, Moonves said. (The same sort of exposure also worked
for a new Fox show, ``The PJ's.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When we didn't have football, we were looked upon as a
second-rate network,'' he said. ``The 28-year-old media buyer in
New York probably never watched a show on CBS. Now he watches
football, and he's going to realize we have some other shows he's
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   More pointedly, the loss of the NFL five years ago had a
profound effect on the entire structure of the CBS network. One
year after the deal, a host of important CBS affiliates abruptly
defected to Fox, the network that had stolen away CBS' NFL package,
sending CBS reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the clear and measurable downside of losing football
for CBS,'' said Bonham, the sports marketing expert. ``We can also
look at Fox and see how it benefited. Everyone said Fox was crazy
with what it paid to get football away from CBS. It was predicted
they'd lose hundreds of millions _ and they did. But football put
Fox on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television, said: ``Football
helped build this network. The Fox sports brand, which is centered
in the NFL, has been essential in building all of Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl rotates each year among the three networks that
carry regular NFL games. Fox has it this year, and Carey said it
would be the centerpiece of the most profitable day in that
network's history. ``We're going to make $150 million from Super
Sunday,'' he said. That includes money from commercial spots during
the game, selling at $1.5 million to $2 million for 30 seconds, and
from spots during seven hours of pregame shows and the hour of
entertainment shows that will follow the game.
</P>
<P>
   Carey declined to say whether Fox would make or lose money on
the NFL this season, but he noted that ratings for Fox's national
games were up slightly from last season. ``It's an expensive
deal,'' he said, ``We'd prefer to pay less. But by the end, we'll
be more than whole on this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, which has the rights to the NFL's Monday night games,
the economic picture is gloomier after the first season of the new
football contract. Ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' were down
about 5 percent, and ABC, unlike CBS and Fox, did not reach an
agreement with its affiliates for help with the rights fees. When
Walt Disney Co. which owns ABC, reported last week that its
earnings had declined, it cited the high cost of broadcasting NFL
games as part of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ABC paid $4.4 billion, or $550 million a year, to retain rights
to the Monday games for eight years, up from $920 million, or $230
million a year, for its previous ``Monday Night Football'' deal.
Disney also paid $4.8 billion, or $600 million a year, for
exclusive rights for Sunday night games on cable, which its ESPN
all-sports channel had previously shared with Time Warner's TNT
channel for a total price of $992 million, or $248 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bornstein, president of ABC Sports and chairman of ESPN,
said ``Monday Night Football'' suffered from the effects of
``lopsided games.'' This season was also the first in which the
network moved the starting time up from 9 p.m. to 8:15. ``That
helped us in the East, but there was falloff in other time zones,''
he said, adding that the network is considering ``moving the start
time later'' next season.
</P>
<P>
   Like his peers at other networks, Bornstein declined to provide
specifics on football revenues. ``We knew it was going to be very
expensive,'' he said of the NFL deal. But he pointed out that the
Sunday night games showed strong ratings growth of 13 percent from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a down year, Bornstein said, ``Monday Night Football''
still delivers the best profile of male viewers of any show in
prime-time television. For the television season so far, it had a
12.4 rating for all male viewers over the age of 18, by far
television's best number; NBC's ``ER'' was a distant second, with
an 8.9 rating. That strong appeal to men was the attraction that
led NBC, even after it decried the escalation in fees for its old
package of AFC games, to bid that much and more in an effort to
steal ``Monday Night Football'' away from ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a crown jewel,'' Bornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bornstein concluded, ``We don't look at the NFL deal as
anything but positive.'' That picture gets even brighter, he said,
when the future makeup of the television landscape is factored in.
``I have always believed that sports would be the punch-through
programming for the future,'' Bornstein said. ``It's big-time
programming for the fragmented television picture. I believe that
more today than ever before.''

FALCONS' BUCHANAN RELISHES ROLE OF BROADWAY RAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves this week has taken to
calling Ray Buchanan Broadway Ray, after the former Jets
quarterback, Broadway Joe Namath, who 30 years ago also guaranteed
a Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the Falcons' talkative and talented cornerback, who
has 28 interceptions in six seasons, still answers to Big Play Ray
as well. But he seems entirely comfortable with the avalanche of
notoriety from guaranteeing an Atlanta victory over the Denver
Broncos in the Super Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the news media earlier this week, Buchanan sat
down and turned on his video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm center stage,'' he said, smiling, ``I'm taking
full advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has also appeared in public wearing a dog collar
because the Falcons are underdogs. The Broncos believe that all
Buchanan has done is set himself up for ridicule. Tight end Shannon
Sharpe engaged in a trash-talking duet with him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he made the guarantee jokingly to Cris
Collinsworth on HBO's NFL highlights show, then realized what he
had done when he picked up the next day's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my face,'' he said. ``I was like: `Whoa! What did I dig
up here?'''
</P>
<P>
   The more he thought about it, though, the more he embraced the
idea of the guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of a confidence thing,'' Buchanan said. ``The
spirit of this team right now is that we can go out and win.
Sometimes you've got to speak about it and stand on your faith,
that you believe you can win the game. If you don't believe, then
you've already lost the game. In a boxing match, in a baseball
game, in a basketball game, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The only troubling aspect of the guarantee for Buchanan was that
he spoke for the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went and checked around with a lot of the key veterans,''
he said. ``They said: `Ray, you're supposed to feel that way.
Because if you didn't, I wouldn't want to go with war with you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As I went around, everybody patted me on the back. The locker
room didn't really change. Someone said, `Ray, we kind of expected
that from you because of the confidence you have on the field.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he was sure the Broncos were talking with similar
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're over there guaranteeing wins, too,'' he said. ``But
they're not being vocal about it. That way, they'll save face if
they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding aside, why put yourself in the middle of a controversy
in the country's most widely covered sports event? ``I play on an
island and I feel like Gilligan,'' he said. ``If I have enough
confidence to go out and hold my own, then I think sometimes you
can say what you want. And hopefully you can back it up. That's the
key: backing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were not backing up much when Buchanan arrived in
Atlanta last season after four years with Indianapolis. Before the
Falcons went on a 22-4 run that has put them in Sunday's main
event, the cornerback once had his car egged after a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to that guy now,'' Buchanan said. ``I'd tell
him: `I can understand where your problem was coming from. But look
at us now.' There was a time when we had people coming to the Dome
actually buying hot dogs to go. We've really come from ground zero
to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, with his ever-present video camera, is trying to enjoy
every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This football team has the opportunity to shock the world,''
he said. ``It's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And I
plan not to look bad.''

deposition that he was no longer an officer of his Houston company,
Albo Pest Control Inc. But he listed himself as chairman of Albo on
his personal financial disclosure forms that he filed with the
Federal Election Commission. If he lied on the deposition, it's
perjury. If he lied on the forms, it's also a crime. By GREG

DEPOSITION DISCREPANCY SURFACES AGAINST DELAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who wants President
Clinton ousted on charges of lying under oath, listed himself on
congressional disclosure forms in 1994 as chairman of a Houston
pest control company but denied under oath in a deposition that he
was an officer of the business for that period.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a Republican from Sugar Land, Texas, testified under oath
in a 1994 deposition that he had not been an officer of Albo Pest
Control Co. for two or three years. Then he backtracked in the
testimony, saying he was uncertain if he had ever formally
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came in a lawsuit by an ex-partner who alleged
that DeLay and another man unjustly cut him out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But in financial disclosure documents members of Congress are
required to file every year, DeLay listed himself as president or
chairman of the board of Albo from 1985 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House document he signed under penalty of fine and
imprisonment just three months after the court deposition was taken
listed him as the company's chairman in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is also listed as a ``registered agent'' of Albo Pest
Control from 1991 through 1994 on the annual Texas Franchise Tax
Public Information Reports filed with the state comptroller's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against DeLay by ex-partner Robert Blankenship ended
in a confidential 1995 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spokesman Michael Scanlon said Friday there was nothing to
the allegations and dismissed them as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are statements and allegations made by political enemies
of Tom DeLay. They're being made for political purposes and
political purposes only. You have to take them at face value,''
Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that DeLay does not plan to comment on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship's lawyer, Gerald De Nisco, said Friday that he was
unaware of the apparently contradictory personal financial
disclosure forms at the time he took DeLay's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   De Nisco said it is now clear that DeLay ``either lied in the
deposition or lied when he filled out that disclosure form.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if DeLay was trying to limit his financial liability in
the case by denying he was an officer of the company, De Nisco
said, ``That's my read on it, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   De Nisco said DeLay could have been liable if he were an
officer, of any rank, in Albo. DeLay's statement about that matter
would have become an issue in the case if it had gone to trial, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawyer said he believes the matter should be pursued
as a possible perjury case.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay's whole point (in the impeachment process) is he wanted
a standard that applied to everyone. We took the definition of
perjury and looked at the facts. In our case, I think it should be
looked into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a perjury case against DeLay would be difficult to
prosecute, said Harris County (Texas) District Attorney John B.
Holmes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said a three-year statute of limitations normally applies
to perjury, whether a misdemeanor or felony. Holmes said perjury
would qualify as a felony offense if it took place in ``official
proceeding'' related to a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   No statute of limitations prevents prosecution of ethics
violations. De Nisco suggested that the case could be presented to
the House ethics committee for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his standing in Congress, it may be something they would
look into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional official said Friday that in order for a case to
be brought against DeLay another member of Congress would have to
file it, under new ethics guidelines adopted by the
Republican-controlled House last year. The new rules make it
difficult, if not impossible, for outside complaints to be filed
against lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 deposition, De Nisco asked DeLay if he was still an
officer of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so. No,'' DeLay said, explaining he had a verbal
agreement with the third partner, Darrell Hutto, to resign as an
officer of Albo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything formal,'' DeLay said of his resignation.
``I haven't had much to do with the company since I was elected to
Congress (in 1984).''
</P>
<P>
   After discussing several other topics, De Nisco asked DeLay when
he resigned as an officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember,'' DeLay said. ``I'm not even sure I am
resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's deposition in 1994 was taken as part of a lawsuit
Blankenship filed after he was locked out of the company's offices
and told that he was being fired.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Blankenship accused DeLay and Hutto with not
only wrongful termination, but also financial fraud. He alleged
that Albo funds were being used to pay off a $32,000 judgment
against DeLay filed by another business associate and may have been
used to pay off campaign debts.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants answered in court papers that Blankenship stole
the company's equipment and diverted profits to his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship, who lives in Richmond, Texas, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents that are separate from the deposition, DeLay
also said he was president of Albo from 1985-88 and that he gained
no income from the company after then. He said his income from Albo
was $1,000 for 1987 and again in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional records show that he reported capital gains income
from Albo in 1992 and 1993 of $5,000 to $15,000. In 1995 and again
in 1996 he reported dividends of $15,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The differing stories portrayed in the deposition and his
financial disclosure forms are the subject of an article in the New
Republic magazine due out Monday.

SHARPE TALKS AND PLAYS A BIG GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI_ It will be a difficult emotional, cerebral and physical
job for the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday when they face the Denver
Broncos. For in confronting Shannon Sharpe, who is going into the
Pro Bowl for the seventh straight year, they are dealing with
someone who defies easy answers. Sometimes, in fact, Sharpe doesn't
understand himself.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his relationship with quarterback John Elway, Sharpe
says: ``John will make plays and get the ball to you. That's all
you can ask for if you're a wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Shannon Sharpe isn't a wide receiver. He's a tight
end. Or, as the Falcons' defensive coordinator, Rich Brooks, says,
``a wide receiver in a tight end's body.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the difficulty facing any team going against Sharpe, a
problem complicated by the undeniable delight he takes in trash
talking. But defenders have to get beyond that to effectively
handle Sharpe the player. For over and above his ability to out
talk almost everyone, overshadowing his reputation as the king of
invective is the simple fact that he is a force on the field.
</P>
<P>
   This is how good Sharpe is: He scored 10 touchdowns, caught 64
passes and had more receiving yards (768) than any other tight end
this season. In his career, he has had games in which he caught as
many as 13 passes and amassed as much as 180 yards. He is one of
only three tight ends _ the other two are Ozzie Newsome and Kellen
Winslow _ to produce 500 career catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should treat Sharpe as a wide receiver and not a tight
end or else he'll kill you,'' says television analyst John Madden,
who has a soft spot in his heart for tight ends, since they are
almost linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sharpe blocks, too. After all, that is part of the job
description. But going wide, stretching defenses, making everyone
on the other side of the ball either agitated with his talk or
nervous with his walk _ that is something the 30-year-old Sharpe
does better than most anybody.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 feet 2 inches tall, he weighs more than 220 pounds, yet
he can sprint with cornerbacks, and he is faster than plenty of
safeties. He has averaged more than 15 yards a catch for an entire
season _ a wide receiver's numbers _ and during the recently
concluded regular season had seven games in which he produced
catches of more than 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hybrid,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells, whose team
held him to a rare two-catch game in the American Conference
championship. It was also one of only two games this season in
which Sharpe failed to get at least one 10-yard reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a decent blocker who's a great receiver,'' Brooks said.
``The difference he makes is not so much in the running game. In
the passing game, it makes all the world of difference defending
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was not a big name in college _ he was a seventh-round
pick out of Savannah State in Georgia _ but came into his own with
Denver in 1993 and '94, when he caught 81 and 87 passes,
respectively, for 995 and 1,010 yards. And then Mike Shanahan took
over as head coach in 1995 and had his own ideas about offense and
the way you practice it. They differed from Sharpe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here I had a talk with him about his practice
habits,'' Shanahan said. ``We straightened it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our relationship wasn't very good; maybe I was a hot
dog,'' Sharpe said. ``Mike knows I'm not a selfish ballplayer. I'll
do what it takes. Sure I'd like to catch 70 balls, but I'll block
for Terrell if that's what's required.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem Mike Shanahan had with me at the beginning
was that I was doing more talking than playing. Once I got on the
field and played every day and practiced every day, he didn't have
a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's slightly altered role under Shanahan _ he has had to do
more run blocking, particularly because Terrell Davis arrived the
same season the coach did _ has never become a source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking wasn't required of me,'' Sharpe said looking back to
when his coaches were Dan Reeves and then Wade Phillips. ``Mike
came in and wanted me less in the receiving game. It's not
difficult at all, but my size, 225 pounds, I'm always blocking guys
260. I say to myself, `I'm not going to let these guys beat me.'
Now, my blocking skills have caught up to my receiving skills.''
</P>
<P>
   His communication skills, of course, remain unequaled. Shanahan
revealed Friday that before the Monday-night clash with Kansas City
last November, Sharpe came over to him and said, `` `Coach, I am
really convinced with some of the talk that has been going on that
I can get at least two or three personal fouls during a game
because people won't be able to keep their poise.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he did,'' Shanahan added. ``As you know, Shannon Sharpe is
a pretty sharp cookie and he can get under people's skin.''
</P>
<P>
   In that game, with Denver safely ahead, Sharpe infuriated
several Chiefs players during a fourth-quarter drive. One player,
Derrick Thomas, grabbed Sharpe's face mask twice during the drive,
threw him to the turf once and ended up drawing three personal
fouls and a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it will be the Falcons' strong-side linebacker, Henri
Crockett, who will be tailing Sharpe. ``Whatever side he goes to, I
go to,'' Crockett said. ``He's taken tight end to a whole other
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett also knows his verbal skills will be tested on Sunday,
and he is ready. ``Sometimes I talk,'' he said. ``But not with a
vet like him. He talks a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta linebacker Craig Sauer, who plays short-yardage
situations, said he had prepared a personal game plan for Sharpe.
``You've got to be very disciplined,'' he said. ``You've got to get
your hands on him. That's probably the basic thing _ hands on him
before he gets downfield. He's just a big wide receiver, really,
and he talks a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And Falcons safety Eugene Robinson is ready, too, for Sharpe to
tell him, ``You can't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all ready, for the player who talks big and sometimes
plays even bigger.

VERNON BERG III, 47, GAY ENSIGN WHO FOUGHT NAVY ON DISCHARGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: N.C., Tex. N.J., Washington)  By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vernon E. (Copy) Berg III, an artist who was one of
the first military officers to challenge a discharge on the ground
of homosexuality, died Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 47 and lived in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from AIDS, said his partner, Dub
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After Berg's suit against the Navy, which had given him an
``other than honorable'' discharge as an ensign in 1976, the armed
forces adopted a policy of generally granting honorable discharges
to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled that Berg and former Tech. Sgt. Leonard P. Matlovich of the
Air Force had been unfairly discharged, although it did not
reinstate them, as both had sought. Berg was discharged after an
investigation revealed he was in a gay relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first to stand up to the military,'' said
Kevin M. Cathcart, executive director the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which represented Berg. ``People forget in the
1990s what kind of courage that took. Tens of thousands of people
have benefited from his fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Berg attracted attention anew as a prolific
artist who documented life with AIDS in sculptures, paintings,
photographs and thousands of cartoonlike drawings in hundreds of
sketchbooks that he called the ``pages of my unfinished Surrealist
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hunt, executive director of Visual AIDS, which offers
assistance to artists with HIV, said the artworks ``do appear
simple and innocuous at first glance, but you catch the touches
that he slips in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He conveys a difficult message and wins people over to AIDS
activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was
called Copy because he was so like his father, Cmdr. Vernon E. Berg
Jr., a Navy chaplain. Cmdr. Berg, who supported his son's legal
battle, died in 1984. Besides Williams, Berg is survived by his
mother, Vera Berg of Kitty Hawk, N.C.; a sister, Valerie Berg Rice
of San Antonio, and two brothers, Victor and Vincent, both of Kitty
Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, which was upgraded to honorable in 1977 as
a result of the legal action, Berg received a master's degree in
design from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Berg was embroiled in controversy again when some
students at Rutgers University objected to the sexual content of
Marcus Leatherdale's photographs of Berg and his previous partner,
Paul Nash, who died in 1993. Eight photos, six of which depicted
Berg nude, accompanied a show of his artwork in a gallery on the
Newark campus.

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The leaders of Salt Lake City's effort to win
the Olympics committed themselves as early as 1991 to a four-year
campaign that included financial assistance to people who could
influence the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games, planning documents
show.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which also called for the use of hired lobbyists
and payments to national Olympic committees around the world, was
outlined in a detailed blueprint presented in a binder in December
1991 to the board of business leaders, which oversaw the Olympic
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Documents maintained by the committee's staff, including minutes
of the committee's meetings and ledgers showing checks paid
directly to members of the International Olympic Committee and
their family members, clearly show how the effort was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The internal committee documents portray an aggressive program
to use money to secure votes by a city determined not to fail again
in its efforts to bring the Olympics to one of the fastest-growing
metropolitan areas in the West. In 1991, Salt Lake City, in a
bitter defeat its officials attributed to what they believed were
free-spending efforts of the Japanese, lost out by four votes to
Nagano, Japan, for the right to play host to the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Salt Lake's bid committee have professed
surprise and dismay in recent weeks at revelations of improper
payments and other inducements provided to members of the
International Olympic Committee or their families. They have
frequently said that they were aware only of a plan to provide
humanitarian aid to deserving countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But documents provided to the leaders of Salt Lake's committee
at the outset of their effort to gain the 2002 Games suggest that
the leaders were committed to a global courtship of potential swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   One budget summary, for example, presented at a meeting of the
bid commitee's board in December 1991, projects spending roughly
$500,000 on aid to national Olympic committees and contracts with
``key individuals'' in three crucial parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key person,'' the document states, ``is one who would
influence an IOC member's vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents raise several questions that investigators say
they are pursuing. Was the Salt Lake City board aware that its
campaign had come to include cash payments to Olympic officials and
their families? Did the board, which included experienced business
executives, turn a blind eye to the activities of its staff? Or
were those activities concealed by a staff that had struck out on
its own?
</P>
<P>
   It has been disclosed in recent weeks that Salt Lake City
arranged college scholarships for six family members of Olympic
committee members. Other family members were given jobs or other
financial assistance. And an investigation by the International
Olympic Committee discovered that Salt Lake City made payments
directly to voting IOC members and not to their national sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was meticulously and openly detailed in the bid
committee's records, including American Express bills paid for the
stepdaughter of one Olympic committee member, rent checks for
another relative of a committee member and hundreds of thousands of
dollars in gifts and favors for committee members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Those records, from 1991 until the selection of Salt Lake City
in 1995, were reviewed and approved by a national audit firm that
reported directly to the board. The financial records and the
spending blueprint provided to the board were shown to The New York
Times by a participant in the bid effort concerned that a fuller
version of the story be made public.
</P>
<P>
   G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of the bid committee, said
through his lawyers that the ``details of the bid's work'' were
handled by Thomas K. Welch, its president, and David Johnson, its
vice president. The attorney, Mark H. Tuohey, said the detailed
spending was not reviewed by Joklik.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of the ship was Tom Welch,'' Tuohey said. ``He ran
the show. No one else. Frank Joklik was not a CEO. He was a
volunteer, part-time chairman of the board. The executives were
paid handsomely to run the ship. The board had no other function
but to raise money and approve the budget each year and implement
initial financial controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board had nothing to do with the books and records of the
company,'' said Tuohey. ``They never looked at the books and
records.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuohey conceded Joklik and other board members did sign off
on the plan of action spelled out in the earliest budget documents
from 1991. He said those budget documents, however widely reviewed
and disseminated in an organization, are policy statements and not
for the most part detailed spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Johnson have said the board had access to
complete documentation of all payments and arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times attempted to reach every member of the bid
committee involved in the successful effort to secure the Winter
Games. John Ruger, a former Olympic biathlon competitor, said the
board had set ``broad policies'' and did not try to
``micromanage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' he said of the board, ``we were only in there
three or four times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is currently examining whether anything
done by Salt Lake City officials or members of the International
Olympic Committee violated any laws. Last Sunday, an Olympic
committee investigation concluded there had been widespread
wrongdoing in the bid process and expelled six members of its own
committee. Three others had previously resigned as a result of the
investigation into the awarding of the Games to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the International Olympic Committee said bid
cities were permitted to make payments to national Olympic
committees around the world as long as they were not exchanged for
an IOC member's vote and as long as they were given to the national
committee, not an individual. Bid cities are required to audit
their expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents disclosed to The Times, along with dozens of
interviews with people who are or were close to the bid process
here, show that money was also only part of the machinery of
influencing IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lead lawyer for the bid committee telephoned the
University of Utah in an effort to gain admittance for the son of
an International Olympic Committee delegate.
</P>
<P>
   _ An employee of First Security Bank, whose chairman and chief
executive, Spencer F. Eccles, sat on the executive committee of the
Salt Lake bid organization, offered a summer job in 1995, in
writing, to Moriba Keita, the son of a delegate from Mali.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Olympic Committee also came to the city's aid. In a
letter to the IOC member Lamine Keita of Mali, the American
committee said it was giving Mali $5,000 worth of bicycles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   People who were close to the Olympic effort here say that
successive defeats changed the tenor of the bid committee's work
over the years. A first blow came in 1985, when the city lost to
Anchorage in its effort to become the official U.S. bid city. Ted
Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City and one of the early
leaders of the Olympic effort, who now teaches at the University of
Utah, said the analysis of that defeat led to the conclusion that
the city should be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we lose? The answer we kept coming up with was that we
didn't schmooz,'' Wilson said. That led to a pattern of what he
called ``extended hospitality,'' which included first-class hotels
and air fare for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   But the real watershed was in 1991, he said, when the city lost
to Nagano by four votes. ``That led to a kind of superschmoozing,
which may have led to this cash,'' Wilson said, referring to the
payments to members and their families that have since emerged.
``It led to the kind of mood that made us overcompetitive, though
that is probably one of the world's great understatements.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bid committee had been reorganized and held its
first board meetings in 1992, at which the scholarship program was
presented, the documents show that payments had already been made
to an IOC member's son attending school in the United States. In
the years that followed, those payments became regular, formalized
and according to the bid committee budget records, strictly
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, the payments to Moriba Keita, son of the
Olympic committee member from Mali, Lamine Keita, who was studying
at Howard University, came like clockwork: tuition payments ranging
from $2,825 on Jan. 12, to $5,925 on Aug. 24, with regular monthly
checks of $500 through the fall term.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Moriba Keita got a summer job working for First
Security Bank. A letter to Keita, from one of the bank's senior
vice presidents, refers warmly to his ``plan to spend some time in
Salt Lake City and working at First Security Bank of Utah,'' and
notes that bank's president, Scott Nelson, had specifically been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said in a statement earlier this month, when the first
reports emerged about the summer jobs of Keita and of another IOC
relative, who was hired in 1992, that such hiring was ``not
extraordinary or inappropriate in any way'' and had been done
through a program ``where we hire interns and summer help referred
to us through customers, employees and other relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the records show, the bid committee simply
needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1995, which was 10 days before Salt Lake City won the
IOC balloting to play host to the 2002 Winter Games, the bid
committee withdrew $30,000 in cash from its account at First
Security Bank. The committee's record with the withdrawal noted
that it was for ``unknown purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 through the end of 1995 the daughter of Augustin C.
Arroyo, the IOC member of Ecuador, received $19,000 from Salt Lake
Olympic officials, according to the IOC report last week that
recommended Arroyo's expulsion. Documents from the bid committee
show precisely where that money went: Insurance, furniture, rent
and on one occasion an American Express bill of $701.54.
</P>
<P>
   The records also show that, at least with respect to
bookkeeping, no one tried to hide the fact that checks were made
out to individual Olympic committee members, and not their sports
associations. The ledgers, for instance, list payments to
Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of Congo, who
received a total of $70,010 from the Salt Lake committee, according
to last week's IOC report. Ganga was expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the still unfolding story of how Salt Lake
City chased its Olympic dreams, however, there has been lingering
question of what the true nature of all the payments and
reimbursements and gifts were. Were all contracts to influence IOC
members improper, some board members ask, or just some contracts to
the agents? Many people here, on and off the Olympic committee,
have condemned outright cash payments. But some of the elements
outlined in the committee's document are perhaps in some ways no
more clearly understood for all the new detail.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Marsh, the Olympic steeplechaser and athlete's
representative on the bid committee, said the board ``understood we
were hiring people to help us with our bid and lobbying efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The contracts, he said, went to ``people who had contacts in
these countries, who had relations with these people, who could
help us, period. It's legitimate to contract with someone to help
you.'' In any case, he added, so far he had heard nothing to
indicate that money paid to agents had made its way to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   With federal and state investigators swarming over the records
and witnesses, it may be months before conclusions can be drawn
about who knew what in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee's initial inquiry, led by Richard Pound, a
Montreal lawyer, did not settle the issue. Pound said he questioned
Joklik, the board chairman, about whether he was aware of the
payments and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him and his statement to us was that he didn't
know,'' Pound said. ``What I don't know is the degree to which the
board was active in all of these things. It was hard for us to
tell.''

EDITORIAL: RENO DOES IT AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct hed, and to delete Ms. before Reno)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 30:
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Attorney General Janet Reno decided not
to let an independent counsel pursue allegations of perjury against
Harold Ickes, the former White House official who ran President
Clinton's 1996 campaign. The decision is consistent with her other
efforts to prevent the thorough investigation of White House
fund-raising recommended by the director of the FBI and by Reno's
top campaign-finance prosecutor. The Reno cover-up is now complete
and will become a shameful page in Justice Department history.
</P>
<P>
   Reno concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a
perjury indictment against Ickes. But that is the sort of sensitive
judgment call that should have been left to an independent counsel
who had broad authority to investigate all aspects of the most
reckless fund-raising operation since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Ickes may have committed perjury when he was
deposed in September 1997 by the Senate governmental Affairs
Committee, the answer seems to hinge on one brief exchange and _
this will sound familiar _ on what is meant by the word ``do.'' In
1995, Ickes met with leaders of the teamsters union about its
long-running strike against Diamond Walnut Growers of California.
The teamsters, a memo prepared for him noted, had given more than
$2 million to Democratic candidates in 1992. The same memo also
suggested that the administration consider helping out on issues
such as the strike if it wanted to continue that level of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the administration do regarding the Diamond Walnut
strike?'' Ickes was asked by the Senate panel. ``Nothing that I
know of,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   It later emerged, and Ickes acknowledges, that he in fact asked
Mickey Kantor, then the trade representative, to intervene on
behalf of the striking union. Ickes' lawyers insist his answer was
proper because Clinton administration officials only made inquiries
and thus did not really ``do'' anything concrete.
</P>
<P>
   An independent counsel unburdened by Reno's conflict of interest
might have come to the same conclusion. That decision would have
carried an authority beyond the reach of this attorney general and
her compromised Justice Department.

 ANALYSIS: NEW BUDGET GIMMICKRY IS REALLY OLD BUDGET GIMMICKRY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican leaders are accusing President Clinton of budget
gimmickry, saying his plan to shore up reserves in the Social
Security trust fund is an accounting trick.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, says the president's plan ``appears to double-count the
Social Security surpluses,'' somehow extending the life of the
trust fund ``without doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire accuses the president of
relying on an ``accounting trick.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics are right that Clinton's plan double-counts
surpluses in the Social Security program. But these surpluses have
been double-counted in the budget for years, so the president's
device is no new trick.
</P>
<P>
   Political posturing aside, the real difference between the
president's plan and that of his critics is not double counting.
Some critics want to use the surplus to cut taxes. Many Republicans
want to use it to create individual retirement accounts, which
would serve the purpose of raising national savings if individuals
did not offset the new accounts by reducing their other forms of
private savings.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the national savings is widely embraced by economists.
Liberal Democrats want to use the surplus to create universal
health insurance or for education and other discretionary programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants instead to drive down the federal debt, now
about $4 trillion. These are honorable differences in the
positions. But, economists point out, most of these proposals
double-count the surplus in the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration expects Social Security payroll taxes over
the next 15 years to exceed outlays by about $2.7 trillion, a
surplus that initially goes into the program's trust fund. Clinton
proposes to add an additional $2.8 trillion to the fund, for a
total of $5.5 trillion, extending its life by almost 20 years, to
2049.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the $2.8 trillion is the same money that comprises
the $2.7 trillion already in the fund. Clinton, his critics say,
proposes adding the first $2.7 trillion twice. To see through the
dispute, trace the path of a surplus dollar, a dollar of Social
Security payroll taxes that is not currently needed to pay
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking loosely, the dollar passes from a taxpayer to the
Social Security trust fund and then on to the Treasury. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin makes the trust fund whole by sending it a
$1 bond. He then spends the dollar on public housing, tanks or any
other public purpose. Note the double use of the dollar. It is
credited first to the trust fund and then to another program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan, the path is initially the same.
Surplus dollars would flow into the trust fund and back out to
Rubin. Rubin continues to send the fund a $1 bond. But, under
Clinton's proposal, Rubin would no longer use the surplus dollar to
buy tanks or housing. Instead, he would buy back one dollar of
federal debt from the public in the form of a bond. Then he would
deposit the repurchased bond into the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans look at this process and cry double counting:
Clinton has deposited two dollars' worth of bonds into the fund
from a single dollar of excess payroll taxes. In describing the
process, they are correct.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials point out that nearly any use of
excess Social Security taxes would involve double counting. Several
Republican proposals to reform Social Security would use the
surplus to create private retirement accounts, another version of
double counting.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the president is guilty of accounting tricks, why aren't
they?
</P>
<P>
   ``All they would change is the use to which the surplus would be
put,'' says the president's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the administration's thinking is the assumption that
without the president's program, Congress would spend the surpluses
on other federal programs or, if the Republicans get their way, on
a large tax cut. Sperling estimates that buying back federal debt
would instead reduce federal debt as a percentage of economic
output from about 45 percent today to about 7 percent by 2014.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to believe,'' he says, ``that a plan that virtually
pays off the nation's publicly held debt in 15 years could be
criticized as an obtuse government accounting trick.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate purpose of buying back debt from the public, the
administration contends, is to pump trillions of dollars into the
bank accounts of individual investors. These investors would then
be able to lend the money to businesses for investment in new
plants and equipment. The process would increase the nation's
savings rate, channeling less money into consumption and more into
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling repeats the economists' mantra that the only real way
to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers is to save and
invest, thereby building up the capacity of the economy to produce
food, clothing and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could have slipped the charge of double counting if he
had proposed doing nothing with the expected surpluses other than
to buy back debt. That would be the preference of many other
economists.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration believes that Congress would never sit
back and let trillions of dollars slip by without siphoning them
away for public programs or tax cuts. So Clinton devised a backup
plan, channeling most of the surplus to Social Security. That would
commit those dollars to support the elderly sometime in the future.
It would block their use for tax cuts or programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's choices are not the only responsible ones. They may
not even be the best. But they raise no issue of budget deceit.

TAYLOR IS 1 VOTE CLOSER TO HALL ENSHRINEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The NFL suspended him for four games in 1988 after he
tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since he retired, he has been arrested twice on cocaine charges.
Pleaded guilty to filing false federal tax returns. Had his
driver's license suspended for outstanding parking tickets.
Received three summonses for leaving the scene of an accident.
Testified before a grand jury investigating organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   And this morning I will vote for Lawrence Taylor to be inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Part of me says vote no. A shrine is defined as a hallowed
place. Does a drug user and deadbeat dad belong?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should make him wait. Keep him out, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Eight no votes among the 36 selection committee members could
exclude Taylor. (He will get in automatically if he is among the
top four vote-getters.) Six voters have indicated they will turn
thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor didn't help himself with some undecided voters when he
said, defiantly, ``I don't apologize for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   No one asked him to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny ``I regret . . .'' wouldn't have hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But I will vote to take him, rap sheet and all.
</P>
<P>
   Then I will walk out of that private meeting room and call home
and talk to our 12-year old son and ask if his soccer team won and
talk about Little League sign-ups and then tell him about Lawrence
Taylor and the Hall of Fame and try to explain why his father voted
the way he did.
</P>
<P>
   Canton isn't like Cooperstown. In the Baseball Hall of Fame
voters are instructed to consider a player's ``integrity,
sportsmanship and character'' along with his athletic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criteria for election to the Pro Football Hall of
Fame is a nominee's achievements and contributions as a Player, a
Coach or a Contributor in professional football.'' The bylaws in
clude no citizenship or morals clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consequences for every choice you make,'' Taylor
said this week, as if making an argument against his selection.
Some believe that closing the Hall of Fame doors to Taylor is an
appropriate consequence for his drug use and destructive personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   But the bylaws state that Taylor is to be judged only on his
accomplishments as a football player. And as Bill Parcells,
Taylor's former coach, once said, if the Hall of Fame goes strictly
by what LT did on the field he should sail into the shrine in his
first year of eligibility ``on roller skates.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 56 of the Giants was one of the greatest defensive players
in NFL history. He redefined the position of outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   A monster pass rusher, (132 sacks) Taylor did as much as any
player to influence the modern era. Because of him, teams changed
the way defenses attacked the quarterback, and how offensives
protected them.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor played 13 seasons. He made the Pro Bowl 10 times. The
NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1986, he helped the Giants win two
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember what Richie Petibon told me one time,'' Peter
Finney, a New Orleans newspaper columnist and Hall of Fame voter
said. ``In his opinion, there was more distance between Lawrence
Taylor and the next-best linebacker than there was at any position,
even Joe Montana and the next best quarterback. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The New York media is lobbying on Taylor's behalf. Earlier in
the week one writer asked how I planned to vote. Hedging, I said I
was undecided. His jaw dropped. He looked stricken.
</P>
<P>
   During Super Bowl week, one New York newspaper polled its
readers. Of those who responded, 75 percent favored LT's induction,
giving him a higher approval rating than the president.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are asked to consider Taylor's NFL career, not judge his
character. Did he bring shame upon the game? No. He shamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   To exclude Taylor would be to punish him. The Hall of Fame isn't
in the punishment business.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor belongs in Canton, although if they put LT's and
O.J.'s bronze busts in a separate room, I might feel better. &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI - There is no doubt former New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor belongs in the Pro Football Hall of the Fame, but
the question is, when?
</P>
<P>
   I won't vote for a known drug addict until he cleans up his act.
</P>
<P>
   Just last October, he checked into a New Jersey drug
rehabilitation clinic a week after he was charged with possessing
crack cocaine. At least this time he didn't do his drug rehab on a
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   He's a deadbeat dad, a guy who was investigated by a grand jury
looking into organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say I'm being holier than thou and trying to legislate
morality in addition to going against the Hall of Fame's bylaws
that only his performance on the field should count.
</P>
<P>
   I can't separate the two. I wouldn't vote for O.J. Simpson, who
was charged with a double homicide, if he were up for election
today. Why is former Dallas Cowboys great Bob Hayes, who
revolutionized the wide receiver position, not in the Hall of Fame
other than having been jailed for drug trafficking?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Taylor held a national conference call in
which he showed no remorse and apologized for nothing. He remains
in denial.
</P>
<P>
   It's my right to try to deny him a chance to enter the Canton,
Ohio, Hall on the first ballot. &QL;

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending an inquiry that has haunted her for months,
Attorney General Janet Reno declined on Friday to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate whether the former White House
aide Harold M. Ickes lied to a Senate committee two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision represented a significant step toward bringing the
Justice Department's long-running campaign finance inquiry to a
close, leaving virtually no investigation open that could lead to
an independent counsel's examination of President Clinton's
re-election fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable basis to believe that any additional
investigation would discover additional evidence sufficient to
prove that Ickes' testimony was knowingly and intentionally
false,'' Reno found in a legal analysis of the case.
</P>
<P>
   With the cloud of potential criminal prosecution lifted after
nearly a year of inquiry into whether he testified falsely about
his activities on behalf of the Teamsters union, Ickes said: ``I
feel very pleased and very relieved. There is no question in my
mind that she reached the right conclusion. I was hopeful and
confident that she would.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was pleased by the outcome. ``I have always
had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and
appropriately,'' Clinton said in a statement. Ickes' lawyer, Robert
S. Bennett, said he was ``gratified'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, who in the past had savagely denounced
Reno for repeatedly deciding against the appointment of independent
counsels, had mixed reactions to the final rebuff that left the
Justice Department's campaign finance investigation sputtering to a
close with a record of about a dozen prosecutions against
lower-level campaign fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., expressed dismay. ``I don't see
how she could determine there wasn't a violation,'' he said. ``She
was willing to have Judge Starr look into the president's sexual
activity, but she has consistently refused to look at something at
the very center of the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of
the Governmental Affairs Committee, which investigated the
Democrats' political fund raising and referred Ickes' case to the
Justice Department, said the decision would hasten the death of the
independent counsel statute. ``The demise of the independent
counsel law when it expires this year may be the most notable
achievement of her tenure,'' Thompson said, referring to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The independent-counsel law, enacted in 1978, was one of the
important pieces of post-Watergate ethics legislation. It was
intended to provide a procedure for evaluating charges against
high-level officials and for determining whether investigations
would be a conflict of interest for the attorney general. It has
been amended and reauthorized several times.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said the law forces the attorney general to
open criminal inquiries into minor matters while others have said
that an attorney general can interpret the law so narrowly that it
stifles inquiries. Still others point to the dangers of unbridled
independent-counsel investigations that go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed disappointment. ``I don't
wish Harold Ickes any harm,'' Hatch said in an interview Friday
night on CNN. ``Frankly there's enough evidence that should have
triggered the independent counsel statute. It's a very grave
disappointment and spells the death of the independent counsel
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who headed a House
committee investigation of campaign financing, said: ``The attorney
general is once again protecting the president and his friends.
Janet Reno has defied the spirit and the letter of the independent
counsel statute.'' He added, ``Her investigation has become a
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Ickes' truthfulness had confronted Reno with a
difficult decision. She weighed the matter for 90 days before
seeking a 60-day extension, which expired on Friday. Reno
deliberated until late in the afternoon as the time for
consideration ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations about Ickes focused on a single question and
answer during a three-day deposition in September 1997 about the
efforts of the Clinton administration on behalf of the Teamsters
union during a strike against Diamond Walnut Co., a California nut
processing company. The teamsters had supported Clinton during his
first presidential campaign in 1992 and Democrats wanted their
support in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate investigator asked, ``What did the administration do
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes replied, ``Nothing that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses testified that Ickes had urged Mickey Kantor,
then the U.S. trade representative, to telephone the company about
the strike, and Kantor acknowledged calling the Diamond Walnut
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee uncovered a Teamsters union memo related to
a 1995 meeting between Ickes and union officials. The memo said
that the union contributed $2.4 million to Democratic candidates in
1992 and suggested the administration consider helping on issues
like the strike if it wanted continued support.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he had asked Kantor to
urge Diamond Walnut officials to settle the strike. Later, Kantor
said he had asked only for a status report.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials and Charles G. La Bella, the former head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance unit, had urged Reno to refer
the Ickes case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Reno said she reasoned that Ickes did not
break the law. ``The questions asked of Ickes were ambiguous, and
his answers were truthful under a reasonable interpretation of the
question,'' Reno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The serious defects in the questioning, the relatively
insignificant nature of the underlying event, the extended lapse of
time and the absence of any perceivable motive to conceal create an
insurmountable barrier to the proof of any potential criminal
violation,'' Reno concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, she found no reasonable grounds to seek the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Clinton's role
in the multi-million-dollar Democratic fund-raising campaign for
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier she found insufficient grounds to ask an
independent counsel to investigate whether Vice President Al Gore
had lied to Justice Department investigators about his fund-raising
efforts in the re-election campaign, a decision that removed a
potential hurdle in the path of Gore's expected presidential
candidacy.

TAGLIABUE TO BACK STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue reaffirmed on Friday
that the Valley would be in a rotation to host the Super Bowl if a
new stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   At his state of the NFL address, Tagliabue said he will be
coming to the Valley this spring to support the Rio Salado Crossing
project that goes to voters in Mesa, Gilbert and Queen Creek on May
18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in the East Valley a number of times in the past
year and I do expect to be back,'' Tagliabue said. ``This project
is very strong and is one we would be very proud to be supportive
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1996 Super Bowl in Phoenix was extremely well supported
statewide. The only thing missing there long-term is a
state-of-the-art stadium. If it is built, it will be in the Super
Bowl rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league recognizes that the economic impact of
the NFL's championship game is not as great when it is held in
locations where winter tourism already is strong _ places such as
the Valley, San Diego and Miami _ as it is when held in places such
as Minneapolis or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Minneapolis or Detroit, it would have a bigger increment
than in Miami or Phoenix, but the effect of the exposure of a Super
Bowl is without parallel,'' he said. ``There is a lasting benefit
from the exposure of a community that is seen as attractive by tens
of millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, during his annual ``State of the Game'' news
conference, also said:
</P>
<P>
   Plans have not been finalized for an American Bowl game in
Mexico next preseason. It has been speculated that a game in
Monterrey in August would match the Cardinals against the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get something done next week or possibly at
our March meetings,'' Tagliabue said. ``I don't know if there are
serious issues or marginal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He will decide by the conclusion of the March meetings whether
to move the 2003 Super Bowl from San Francisco, where construction
of a new stadium has been delayed. If it is moved, Tagliabue
prefers San Diego as the replacement venue. Super Bowls through
2002 all are east of the Mississippi River. Tagliabue wants one in
the west.
</P>
<P>
   A league official said Thursday that if a new stadium could have
been completed in the Valley by January, 2003, the game would have
been moved here.
</P>
<P>
   He expects instant replay in some form to be approved by owners
during their spring meetings in Phoenix in March.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue acknowledged that there were problems with officiating
this past season, but said they were exaggerated by ``us shooting
ourselves in the foot by jumping on them'' publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the league has been examining digital technology
that could be used in an instant replay system that could be
announced at the March meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Selection of the next expansion city is likely during the
meetings March 14-18 at the Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Houston have made strong pitches to rejoin the
league as an expansion site. Tagliabue cited the league's desire to
get back into the large Los Angeles television market, but balanced
it with the league's sensitivity to the importance of football in
Texas ``at all levels from high school on up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Houston also has a strong stadium proposal in place,
something he has not seen from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie DeBartolo Jr. is unlikely to be reinstated to operate the
San Francisco 49ers for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue emphasized the guilty plea entered in Louisiana by
DeBartolo was not to a gambling-related charge but in connection
with his failure to report an extortion plot. It was of serious
enough nature for Tagliabue to leave DeBartolo's suspension in
place, giving his sister, Denise, control of the 49ers through ``at
least the 1999 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said a decision on which group will take ownership of
the Washington Redskins ``is not a disabling issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the importance of free agency, of keeping a team
together and improving a team,'' Tagliabue said. ``We will be able
to manage it so that there will be no negative effect on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tagliabue believes former New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor should be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame despite his off-field conduct. Taylor's use of drugs has cast
doubt on his suitability among some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system where we hold our athletes to very demanding
standards in areas where they are expected to perform,'' he said.
``I think the public understands that by making a judgment about
what he did on the field you are not condoning what he did off the
field.'' &QL;

QB COACH CHRYST LEAVING CARDS FOR CHARGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For the seventh consecutive year, Jake Plummer of the
Cardinals will have a new quarterback coach.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who had four different quarterback coaches at Arizona
State, will be playing next season for his third quarterback coach
in three years in the pros after Geep Chryst left the Cardinals on
Friday to become offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer played for Dick Jamieson his rookie year. Jamieson was
fired at the end of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Chryst joins his brother, Paul, on new Chargers Coach Mike
Riley's staff. Paul, who came with Riley from Oregon State, will
coach San Diego's tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was a very tough decision for all the obvious
reasons,'' Chryst said. ``It was a unique situation having known
Mike Riley as long as I have and having my brother there. Bob
Ferguson (Cardinals vice president-player personnel) asked me if I
would have still been interested in San Diego if they weren't
there, and I said probably not. But it's a great opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. Talking to all my coaching buddies, everyone said,
`Man, you've got to go.' But I enjoyed my relationship with Jake.
Vince (Tobin) is a great man to work for. And on a 1 to 10 scale,
we rank Arizona about 9.5 as a place to live. It's tough to top
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin will begin looking for a replacement
immediately. One name that already has surfaced is Sun Devils
quarterbacks coach John Pettas, Plummer's coach his senior year at
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he was very happy for Chryst, who worked with him
previously at the Chicago Bears. Chryst coached tight ends his
first two years with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to be an offensive coordinator in the league
is quite an accomplishment for a coach as young as he is,'' Tobin
said of Chryst, 36. ``I'm very sorry to lose him. He was a very
valuable part of our success here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chryst will also coach the Chargers quarterbacks, meaning he is
responsible for the development of Ryan Leaf, the second pick
overall in last year's draft who committed 19 turnovers and had
only two touchdown passes as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's a young quarterback,'' Chryst said of Leaf.
``You try to help him understand there are people around him who
can help him win _ a great defense, an all-pro punter and a running
game. He won his first two games, but he's got to understand he's
just one piece of a larger team.'' &QL;

RIVALRY TALK DOESN'T RILE TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN, JOHN DAVIS AND TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Many believe that  &UR; David Duval should be
ranked ahead of  &UR; Tiger Woods in the world golf rankings, but all
the talk about their ``rivalry'' doesn't seem to faze Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great. If he does, he does. If he doesn't, he
doesn't,'' Woods said when asked about the possibility of Duval
moving up one spot and overtaking him as the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going out there trying to win a tournament. I'm
playing hard and see what happens. He's going to do exactly the
same thing. I know he and I don't really make it our life to be
number one in the world. Our lives are probably to win golf
tournaments, and that will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, Woods said, the two golfers are good friends off
the course and talk about being the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of funny,'' Woods said. ``We had lunch the other
day and just talking about all the things that he's required to do,
such as the pre-tournament press conference, something that I have
never cared to do. I did it for a long time, and now he has to do
it, so it's kind of funny.'' &QL; 
Biting bunkers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Azinger complained Thursday about unfair bunkers and said
two of them jumped up and bit him coming down the stretch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger, who started on the back nine, bogeyed his last two
holes before play was halted, putting him at 2-under par, 4 shots
off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played solid golf, but I hit into bunkers on the
last two holes with six-foot lips that I couldn't even see over,''
he said. ``I thought we could have played a couple more holes
(before play was suspended). But who knows, the way I finished up
maybe it's just as well.'' &QL; 
Welcome birdie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Phil Mickelson, who won the Open in 1996, finished up his round
with a welcome birdie at the 15th hole before play was stopped,
leaving him at 3-over par.
</P>
<P>
   The birdie was particularly good to see because Mickelson had
bogeyed three of the first five par-5s he played, a rarity for him.
He isn't complaining, however, about the tougher course conditions
at the TPC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of good to see,'' he said. ``I like it. I still
think 10 or 12 under is going to win, just because I think it'll
play easier on the weekend. It hasn't been easy up to this
point.'' &QL; 
Local hero &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rookie &UR; Ted Purdy looked like a goner as he neared the end of the
first round. He was 6 over after 14 holes, and nothing seemed to be
going right.
</P>
<P>
   Then his swing _ and fans _ kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gallery was as huge as Tiger's,'' noted the Scottsdale pro,
who was the state champ at Brophy Prep and later an All-American at
the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we didn't have the numbers, but we certainly had the
volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy ended up completing his opening round Friday morning for a
75, then went right back out on the course and holed five birdies
to offset a couple of bogeys for a 68. He is 1 over, 5 shots back
of Tiger Woods, at the midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to play 25 holes (on Friday) without any wind, and that
helped,'' Purdy noted. ``It was a tremendous feeling to make my
first cut as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy, who got into the tournament on a sponsor's exemption, is
playing in his second PGA Tour event since gaining his card in
qualifying school. He had missed the cut badly earlier this month
at the Hawaiian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does help to be a local guy playing before your
family and friends,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Burn, baby, burn &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Disco 7-Tees'' party sponsored Thursday night by the PGA
Tour Wives Association turned out to be a big success. Fairly wild
and crazy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Among those showing up in full '70s attire at the Scottsdale
Princess were  &UR; Mickelson,  &UR; Payne Stewart,  &UR; Mark Calcavecchia, &UR; Billy
 &UR; Mayfair,  &UR; Azinger and  &UR; Gary McCord. Just call them the tour's
version of Village People.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson donned construction clothes and a full tool belt;
Stewart wore a full headress and was referred to as ``Chief'';
Calcavecchia lived out his lifelong fantasy as a cop; Mayfair wore
_ of all things _ a full sailor suit; 'Zinger played the role of a
cowboy; and McCord capped his outfit with the biggest Afro wig in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be left out, however, was  &UR; Jesper Parnevik, who went as a
``very '70s Swedish guy,'' complete with sideburns, mustache and
pink, heart-shaped glasses. The defending champ of the Phoenix Open
had so much rthymn, as compared to say, Mickelson, that he made the
finals of the disco contest despite a sore neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I did wrong. I had it going pretty good on
stage,'' Parnevik said of his losing effort. ``But afterward, Calc
told me that the contest was rigged.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Parnevik said, he'd sooner come out a winner on Sunday.
He's got a shot, as he sits 2 strokes off the pace set by Tiger
Woods at the midpoint. &QL;

HOMECOMING TREAT FOR KAYE  
 VALLEY GOLFER GETS BIG CHANCE AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Call him golf's Nowhere Man. He's
self-taught. No club manufacturer claims him. Still, he has found a
home high up on the leaderboard of the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   After fashioning a 4-under 67 during Friday's second round to
move to 3 under for the tournament, Mr. Nowhere was asked whether
he was on the playing staff of PING, the brand of golf clubs he
uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't want me,'' he said. ``They fired me a couple of
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And he still plays the clubs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you got to go with what works, you know,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kaye, 27, out of Sunnyslope High School, who cut his
teeth on local blue-collar city tracks like Encanto Golf Course,
does not lack candor. Or, confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another round of golf,'' Kaye said of entering
today's third round just 3 strokes behind leader Rocco Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Timeout, Kaye! He was told he had a good chance to be paired
with Tiger Woods, golf's youngest legend who is at 4 under, for
today's round. Is that ``just another round of golf?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' he said. ``I'm going to do what I got to do. I've never
played with him before. I've played behind him, in front of him,
all around him. Will I be paired with him?''
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? Kaye makes Alfred E. Neuman look like a pessimist. As
a walk-on at Colorado, he beat Arizona State's Phil Mickelson,
merely the the king of collegiate golf at the time, in a playoff to
win the PING Invitational in 1992. So much for big names.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kaye really think he can win this thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The man is capable of some sweet swings on the
course. He still holds the course record at Encanto with a 58 last
year. In last week's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, he set a PGA Tour
record for the biggest scoring swing in consecutive rounds _ 21
strokes, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   After opening with a 64, he soared to an 83 and then backed it
up with an incredible 62 at Tamarisk Country Club. He finished the
tournament with a 69 and a 74 to tie for 43rd place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been playing pretty well and, unfortunately, I got stuck
at Bermuda Dunes when the wind was howling _ a dust storm. I kind
of lost my composure and train of thought there for a few holes,
and before you knew it, I was shooting 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two bogey-free days and one birdie-free day, all in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it earned him a spot in the PGA record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's nice to be in there, but I kind of wish it was for
something else,'' said Kaye, whose best Tour finish was second in
the 1995 Quad City Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Kaye is playing, and playing as well as he is, is a
story itself.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 94th on the money list as a Tour rookie in 1995,
he tore the rotator cuff in his shoulder and missed most of the
1996 and 1997 seasons. He had to earn his Tour card back at
qualifying school, where he finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an untimely toe injury created by frustration from a
game gone south because of the shoulder injury. The digit had a
nasty meeting with a metal locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder was bugging me, so you hurt the toe; next thing
you know, the shoulder is fine,'' he said, grinning. ``I was pretty
close (to quitting) toward the end of last year. I was playing so
bad and Q-school was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hitting it poorly and my club contract expired. I
went back to some irons I knew I could play and it turned my game
around.''
</P>
<P>
   That, along with an assist from buddy Mike Nicolette, who two
weeks before the second stage of Q-school directed him to Milwaukee
golf instructor Manuel de la Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a 20-minute lesson and just kind of enlightened me
to what I was doing wrong and I've been working on those little
keys over the last two months,'' said Kaye, who wasn't recruited
out of high school and spent a year at Phoenix College before going
to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lesson here and there, but I've never had a teacher
and didn't have my first lesson until I was a junior in college. I
haven't been in touch with Manuel since. It's been working good, so
I figured I better not talk to him. I don't even know if he'd
remember me, there were so many people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be sweet to win the hometown tourney?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one is a good one for your first one,'' Kaye said. &QL;

NORTHWESTERN JOB LOOKING BETTER NOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a terrible job,  &UR; Kevin O'Neill kept hearing, especially
considering where he was before. Basketball at Northwestern was an
afterthought. Football was king, reborn under its charismatic,
telegenic coach,  &UR; Gary Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   This was two years ago, after O'Neill left Tennessee because of
repeated disagreements with Athletic Director  &UR; Doug Dickey.
</P>

   But look now. In the wake of its miracle Rose Bowl season in
1995, Northwestern football went 5-7 in 1997 and 3-9 in 1998.
Barnett is gone, the new coach at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Under O'Neill, meanwhile, the Wildcats basketball team is 12-5,
4-3 in the highly competitive Big Ten following Wednesday's upset
victory over No. 14 Purdue. It's Northwestern's best start in 31
years, and there's even talk of getting into the NCAA Tournament
for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of good things going for me,'' said O'Neill,
who is coaching his second team of Wildcats. He was an assistant to
 &UR; Lute
 &UR; Olson during Arizona's rise to prominence in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a great staff, I've got a senior player that's good,
I'm able to recruit and I love living here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``senior player that's good'' is center  &UR; Evan Eschmeyer, the
best big man in the Big Ten. Last year's recruiting landed three
freshmen who are starting. In that regard, O'Neill is similar to
his old boss, Olson, who also starts three freshmen and who also is
being driven slightly nuts by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill my point guard (freshman  &UR; David Newman) &UR; two
weeks ago,'' O'Neill said. ``Sometimes you want to kill 'em, and
sometimes you want to kiss 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill took over a program left in sad shape by his predecessor
and former colleague on Olson's staff,  &UR; Ricky Byrdsong. Last year,
O'Neill's first, the Wildcats went 10-17. Their best game was an
overtime loss to conference co-champion Michigan State. This
season, said O'Neill, ``I didn't know what we'd be, to be honest
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eschmeyer, the school career rebound leader, has stepped up
and the Cats are playing tough defense, like every O'Neill team
does. Before going to Tennessee, where he spent three years, he was
the head coach at Marquette for five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Like  &UR; Don Newman last year and now  &UR; Rob Evans at Arizona State,
O'Neill inherited a point-shaving scandal from a couple of years
ago. He dealt with it pretty much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I wasn't around for it and I didn't know any of
those guys,'' he said. ``You do damage control initially. We got
word out to recruits and coaches. We Fed-exed tons of stuff showing
there were no (NCAA) penalties, things like that. You can't forget
it because it's not going away. You just do your job, recognizing
that people will use it against you.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill addresses everything head on, including his strained
relationship with Dickey that led to his departure from Tennessee,
where basketball clearly is No. 2 to football, but is still a big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where a guy thinks he understands
basketball and has no clue about it,'' he said. ``Rather than have
anybody suffer any longer, I figured I'd get out and get another
job. I think I left the program in better shape than I found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern takes on first-place Michigan State today on the
road. The Spartans are finally getting their act together, but you
never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the score) is in the 50s, we can win,'' O'Neill said. ``If
it's 65 or above, forget it.'' &QL; 
No-fly zone &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to his name, UCLA freshman  &UR; JaRon Rush is a man of
inaction. When he feels homesick during holiday break, he stays
home. And when he doesn't feel like flying, he doesn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Bruins' flight to Memphis, Tenn., en route to
their game at Louisville was tossed around by a storm. When
Northwest Airlines announced the same thing might happen on the
connection to Louisville, Rush refused to board. Accompanied by
some UCLA staff people, he ended up driving the 375 miles, a
six-hour trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just though something bad was going to happen,'' Rush
explained. ``The coaches tried to convince me. . . . &UR; Baron Davis
came over, but there was nothing they could do.'' &QL; 
Hmmmmm &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've got to wonder if coaches aren't showing support of their
embattled colleague, South Carolina's  &UR; Eddie Fogler, at the expense
of
 &UR; Billy Donovan and Florida. How else to explain the wide disparity
between the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll and the Associated Press
poll, conducted by writers and broadcasters?
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Fogler, whose team is probably the biggest bust of
the year, and the young, upstart Donovan have been feuding after
Fogler alleged that Donovan was involved in questionable recruiting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   When the coaches' poll came out on Monday, Florida was 14-3, one
game behind Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference East and coming
off a decisive win over Tennessee. But the Gators weren't even
close to breaking into the top 25, checking in at No. 31 behind the
likes of 14-4 Utah, 16-4 Gonzaga (of the West Coast Conference) and
13-6 Temple.
</P>
<P>
   In the AP poll, Florida is 25th. That's quite a gap. Curiously,
the polls are pretty well matched everywhere else. &QL; 
Crime pays &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former New Mexico State Coach  &UR; Neil McCarthy received
$835,000 for settlement of a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed
against the university, which fired him after the school went on
three years NCAA probation for academic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a New Mexico State investigation uncovered ``new''
allegations of academic fraud during McCarthy's tenure, which it
will report to the NCAA in March. &QL; 
Biting the hand &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Coach  &UR; Gary Williams refuted an ESPN report that his
star guard, junior  &UR; Steve Francis, has decided to go pro after this
season. What's interesting is that Williams denied the story on the
``Walk With'' ``Williams'' chat show, which he conducts on ESPN's
web site.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams was a bit more pointed when he talked to the
``Washington Post''.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an out-and-out lie, a rumor spread by ESPN and
ESPN2,'' he said. ``And I'm calling them to find out who said
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Williams so incensed at ESPN, that he will give up the chat
line, for which he gets paid? As of Friday, someone at the Web site
said Williams was still on board. &QL; 
Fast breaks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona State plays Washington in Seattle next week, it
will be the Sun Devils' last trip to Hec Edmundson Pavilion until
2001. The 71-year-old arena will be gutted and remodeled after the
season. The Huskies will play their home games next season at the
SuperSonics' Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Last week we reported on the futility of Sacramento State, which
had yet to win this season. Guess what? The Hornets snapped a
34-game losing streak dating to last year with a 60-57 victory over
Montana State. That puts  &UR; Tom Abatemarco, who succeeded Don Newman,
at 2-42. &QL;

STANFORD AS GOOD AS PEOPLE EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Here's a switch. They mobbed the court at McKale
Center after Arizona beat Stanford at home on Thursday. Check that.
After Arizona ``upset'' Stanford at home on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Wildcats are the ones who inspire giddy pandemonium
among other team's fans after the occasional loss. But, for the
time being anyway, the Pac-10 showcase window remains occupied by
the 1998-99 Stanford model, tough, durable, able to maneuver in
heavy traffic or motor on the open road.
</P>
<P>
   Thus explains the behavior at McKale. It was Stanford's first
conference loss, by a scant two points at that, rendering moot all
talk of an 18-0 Pac-10 season. But the Cardinal remains in first
place and, with presumably the two toughest road games out of the
way (it already beat UCLA at Pauley Pavilion), it just might stay
there and win its first conference title in 36 years. If that
happens, Stanford probably will end up the No. 1 seed in the NCAA
West Region.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, which plays host to the Cardinal tonight at Wells
Fargo Arena, is capable of affecting those plans. The Sun Devils
are not to be taken lightly. But don't worry about that. There's
nothing like the stinging jolt of a tough loss to resharpen a
team's focus, especially if it's a smart, senior-laden team that
takes pride in its work. Like, for example, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have pretty good mental toughness,'' Coach Mike
Montgomery said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal started the season ready-made for big things. All
five starters and 95 percent of the scoring and rebounding were
back from the team that went 30-5, advanced all the way to the
Final Four and came within an overtime loss to Kentucky of playing
Utah, with whom it matched up favorably, for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Stanford was the overwhelming favorite to win the
Pac-10. ``Sports Illustrated'' and the ``New York Times'' tabbed it
No. 1 in the country, and virtually every other poll had the
Cardinal somewhere in their top five. Arthur Lee and Kris Weems
form a versatile, savvy backcourt. Up front, Mark Madsen, Tim Young
and Peter Sauer are strong, physical types. Except for Madsen, a
junior, the other starters are seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The bench is deep _ too deep, some were saying earlier. After
three reserves went down with injuries, the conventional wisdom was
that it actually helped, because Montgomery was forced to use his
best players more.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its back-to-back losses to North Carolina and Maryland
away from home, and Thursday's defeat at McKale, where Arizona now
has won 25 straight and 36 of 37, there have been few surprises.
Stanford started the week ranked No. 3. Asked if he has learned
anything new about his team during the course of the year,
Montgomery thought for a while. Finally, he said, ``Nothing
drastic, no.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the most cohesive unit in the league, if not the
country. No player ranks in the top five in the league in points or
rebounds, yet Stanford leads in six team categories, including
victory margin, field goal percentage defense and
assist-to-turnover ratio, and is in the top three in five others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so solid in so many areas,'' California Coach Ben
Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to his game against Stanford a few weeks ago, a
71-62 Cardinal victory, Braun thought his team did a nice job of
playing post defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just when you think we're defending them inside, they get
their scoring from the perimeter,'' he said. ``Then, as soon as you
start putting pressure on their outside people, they go back to
hurting you inside. They take advantage of your lulls and letdowns.
If you don't have a good possession on the offensive end, they take
advantage of it. You really have to play error-free against them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Montgomery cites what he likes most about his team, he
dwells not on its prodigious physical aspects but rather, the less
visible qualities.
</P>
<P>
   `It's not a group that gets easily rattled,'' he said. ``It
isn't a group that gives in very much. We've played good teams in
tough situations and teams have made runs at us, but it hasn't
devastated us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that stands out is that is that they are
really, truly unselfish. They like each other and they respect each
other. There's not too much thought process on who's getting what.
It's who can win for them.'' &QL;

UA NOT TAKING CAL FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN J. PEDERSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ If Stanford was the Pac-10's version of a great white
shark, then California is the sea life that swims alongside it and
picks up the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   And now that Arizona has knocked the Cardinal from the ranks of
the conference unbeaten, it is time for the Wildcats to avoid the
stereotypical letdown to the other team from the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Cal (12-6, 3-5 Pac-10), which meets No. 13 Arizona (14-3, 6-2)
today at 4 p.m. at McKale Center, is in a most enviable position
this season in that it gets to travel with Stanford for conference
road games. This gives the Golden Bears an extra advantage in that
they are meeting teams either right before or shortly after facing
the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal is so lucky because they get to travel with Stanford,''
said Arizona's Richard Jefferson. ``Everyone is worrying about
Stanford, so no one thinks about Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Arizona was what Stanford had been so far this year
_ the team everyone feared and circled on their schedule. The
Wildcats were 7-0 in conference heading into a showdown at Palo
Alto, Calif., against fellow 7-0 Stanford. Arizona blew out the
Cardinal by 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, Stanford fell again at home to Arizona State,
putting them two games behind Arizona in the standings and all but
ending any chance to win the conference crown.
</P>
<P>
   Cal hasn't had much chance to cash in on this stealth advantage,
as this weekend is only the second conference trip for the Bears.
Cal beat host Southern California two days after the Trojans lost
by 17 at home to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have sworn up and down all week that, even though
Stanford was the bigger of the two games as far as national
perspective went, two wins would be much better than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not treating any team more important and any other,''
Jefferson said. One place where the Wildcats should be able to
exploit the Bears is on the inside, where Cal is giving up a
conference-worst 40 rebounds a game. Arizona leads with a plus-8
rebounding margin, despite being outhustled on the boards against
Stanford. &QL; 
Notes
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is on a 25-game home-court winning streak, returning
McKale to the list of hardest places to win. But Cal has had more
success than others in Tucson, handing the Wildcats two of their 10
home losses since 1987-88. &QL;

NEW MAVERICKS THINK THEY CAN MAKE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody knows what to make of the Suns in Phoenix, but the Suns
in Dallas are a confident bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Former Suns now with the Mavericks already are measuring
themselves for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Former Phoenix forward  &UR; Cedric  &UR; Ceballos, re-signed by Dallas
this week, said the Mavericks have a real shot at their first
playoff spot since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the same confidence wasn't expressed by Mavericks Coach  &UR; Don
 &UR; Nelson, whose roster is loaded with former Phoenix players,
including
 &UR; John ``Hot Rod'' Williams,  &UR; Steve  &UR; Nash,  &UR; Michael Finley and  &UR; A.C.
 &UR; Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're not a playoff team,'' said Nelson, whose
Mavericks play the Suns tonight in a preseason opener at Dallas'
Reunion Arena. ``I'm saying I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson ranks Phoenix in the second tier of Western Conference
teams alongside Portland. His favorites in the West are Utah, the
Los Angeles Lakers, Houston, Seattle and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He figures his Mavericks will battle Minnesota and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom-feeders,'' he called them. &QL; 
Lost option &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were considering former San Antonio guard  &UR; Vinny Del
 &UR; Negro as a possible backup to shooting guard  &UR; Rex Chapman. But Del
Negro, 32, signed a multiyear deal on Friday with Milwaukee. He had
been playing for Bologna Kinder of the Italian League. &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL; 
As expected, the Suns signed guard  &UR; Shawn Respert on Friday. They
also waived  &UR; Jamie Feick, a forward who played last season at
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are trying to trade former University of Arizona
guard  &UR; Khalid Reeves. But they've had no takers. ``No offers,
nothing,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona State forward and Suns draft pick
 &UR; Mario Bennett is in the Chicago Bulls' camp. Bennett, who spent
last season with the Lakers, will be with the Bulls for at least a
few days. ``We're going to get a look at Mario,'' Chicago Coach
 &UR; Tim Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Fastbreak on the slopes: Suns forward  &UR; Clifford
 &UR; Robinson took up snowboarding at Mount Hood near his home in
Portland. Before the lockout ended, he was a regular, with nine
trips down the hill. Robinson must be quite a sight. Just when the
sport's offbeat crowd thinks it has seen it all, here comes a
6-foot-10 boarder. The reaction? ``Wow, dude, you're tall,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   New 'do: Suns Trainer  &UR; Joe Proski's trademark Afro is gone.
Apparently, so is the nickname, Prosk. With his straight gray cut
and beard, Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge is calling him Papillion, after the
film character about a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Joe Kleine, on the pressure of putting together a new team
during a short training camp: ``Kind of reminds me of my study
habits. Had a test on Monday, studied on Sunday.'' &QL;

CUMMINS SUSPENDED 3 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Coyotes right wing  &UR; Jim Cummins was bracing
himself for the worst Friday, a day after he was accused of abusing
an official _ pushing a linesman away during a fight with
Philadelphia's
 &UR; Roman Vopat _ during Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Friday's game against the New York Islanders,
Cummins got the verdict. He was suspended for three games, the new
automatic punishment under Category III of NHL Rule 76 for physical
contact with an official.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's  &UR; Alain Nasreddine received a similar suspension
during an altercation with the Coyotes'  &UR; Keith Tkachuk in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things,'' said Cummins, who leads the
Coyotes with 122 penalty minutes after the third-period incident.
``Guys were laying around on the ice all over the place, and it was
just one of those heat of the moment things, probably stupid.
Whether it was the right thing to do or not, it was a fight, and
sometimes you're not going to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick, meanwhile, has not yet been
fined for comments he made Monday about the officiating during
Monday's 1-1 tie in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hasn't happened by now, I doubt that it will,'' General
Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said. &QL; 
Oates staying for now &QL; 
Although he has told friends he wants to be traded to Phoenix,
center &UR; Adam Oates of the Washington Capitals further backed off
reports he is seeking to be dealt and said he wants to make things
work in Washington for now.
</P>
<P>
   Capitals General Manager  &UR; George McPhee echoed those sentiments
but did not rule out the possibility of Oates getting dealt prior
to the March 23 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's conceding the season and neither Oatesie or I is
ready to do that,'' McPhee told the ``Washington Post.'' &QL; 
Streak alert &QL; 
In the final minutes of Thursday's loss to the Flyers, Philadelphia
forward  &UR; Rod Brind'Amour, whose streak of 448 consecutive games
played is the NHL's longest, left the game because of sore ribs
after getting checked awkwardly into the boards by Coyotes
defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint.
</P>
<P>
   He did not return and his status _ and his streak _ is unknown
for tonight's game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look that bad to me. It looked harmless,'' said
Coyotes forward  &UR; Brad Isbister, who watched the game from the press
box because of a groin pull. ``He was off balance and Deron didn't
really hit him that hard, but I saw him doubled over heading back
to the bench.'' &QL; 
Staying back &QL; 
With Cummins out of the lineup, the team went with seven defensemen
and only 11 forwards. Last week when they were short-handed up
front, Quint played a wing position against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried that when I was in juniors and sort of liked it, but
they better not ask me to play forward,'' defenseman  &UR; Oleg
Tverdovksy said. ``I don't know what to do or where to go. I don't
think it would be a very good idea to put me there.'' &QL;

DEFENSES IN SUPER BOWL ARE UNSUNG, UNYIELDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Bill Romanowski, reaching his second straight Super
Bowl with a dominating Denver Broncos defense is nothing to spit
at.
</P>
<P>
   For Jessie Tuggle, just add an ``s'' before and an ``r'' after
the first letter in his last name. That's what his 12 years with
the Atlanta Falcons have been.
</P>
<P>
   They're the leaders of two of the NFL's best defensive units,
that will clash Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was second in the NFL against the rush, Denver third.
The Falcons were 21st in pass defense _ when a foe can't run, it
has to throw _ and Denver 26th.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true that defense wins championships, the Falcons
should be slight favorites in their first Super Bowl appearance.
But defending champion Denver, with the league's third-ranked
offense, has been more potent than Atlanta, which has the No. 7
offense. Both defenses face their biggest challenge against touted
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In its two playoff games, Denver has given up 14 rushing yards
each to the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets. That's after
yielding only 24 to the Seattle Seahawks in the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski, an outside linebacker, seems to epitomize what the
NFL once was: rugged, hard-nosed, a
dirty-when-he-thinks-it's-necessary kind of guy. Last year, he was
the talk of Super Bowl XXXII after spitting in the face of San
Francisco 49ers wide receiver J.J. Stokes earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of a throwback player, I think of a guy that
plays every play like his last,'' Romanowski said. ``He goes out
there and tries to do whatever he can do to dominate his opponent.
If it's a throwback player that people call me, that's a
compliment. I think it's great because those are guys I grew up
respecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violent sport. If you're not ready to hit somebody,
you're going to get hit and you're probably going to get hurt. I
prefer being the guy that tries to hit the other guy as hard as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done quite a job of it during the playoffs, leading the
Broncos with 17 tackles, a forced fumble and an interception. His
trademark is the crunching blow to stop a runner, which Romanowski
has delivered effectively and frequently while leading the Broncos
in tackling for three years, a span in which they have posted the
best record in the NFL with only 10 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always try to put your hat on the ball but that's easier
said than done,'' Romanowski said. ``You always want to hit
somebody as hard as you can, try to get the ball out. I've been
fortunate to do those things, to cause a few fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask what that feels like. It's funny. I was talking to
our punter (Tom Rouen), and he was talking about playing defense in
high school. He didn't like playing defense because every time he
hit somebody it hurt him. Well, when you get a good hit on somebody
it doesn't hurt, it feels good. It fires up not only your fans but
your teammates. It's what playing football is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   So are guys like Broncos left tackle Keith Traylor, who has
emerged from NFL Europe to start for the defending Super Bowl
champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy nobody hears much about is Keith Traylor,'' Romanowski
said. ``He's the guy that makes our defense work. It seems like on
every play he is the guy in the middle that's double-teamed and it
makes it easier for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The task for Romanowski, Traylor and the Denver defense is
daunting. They have to deal with Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson, the NFC rushing leader. Then there are Terance Mathis and
Tony Martin, the second-leading receiving tandem in the game, and
quarterback Chris Chandler, who isn't flashy but doesn't make
mistakes. The Falcons led the league in time of possession and
turnover-margin. They don't make many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Falcons' Bomb Squad defense has to stop Denver's
Terrell Davis, the leading rusher in the NFL. His work is
complemented by wide receivers Rod Smith and Ed McCaffey, as a duo
just a notch behind the Atlanta wideouts; tight end Shannon Sharpe,
and, of course, legendary quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   It's the chance of a lifetime for Tuggle, who has been with the
Falcons since he made the club as an undrafted rookie 12 years ago.
He has seen far too much lousy football during that run, even
though he has performed at a high level. Tuggle is the leading
tackler among NFL active players, and a five-time Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the bowl that matters, he said. This one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my chance to show everybody not only what I can do,
but also what the Atlanta Falcons are all about,'' Tuggle said.
``We finally made it here. This organization hasn't been respected
because of the past. We have set so many club records this year,
but this is the ultimate goal to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tuggle making 114 tackles and outside linebacker Cornelius
Bennett 121, there has been no shelter from the Bomb Squad, not
even for the league's highest scoring team ever, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offense scores points, but defenses win football games,''
Tuggle said. ``This is going to be a very tough game to win, a very
physical game up front. Denver's offensive line is one of the
better units I've seen work together. There are two great running
backs, but the best defense will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle said as recently as two years ago he couldn't envision
this. The low point was when former Falcons quarterback Jeff George
walked out on the team. Coach June Jones was fired after the
season. In came Coach Dan Reeves, who changed the way the Falcons
perceived themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time for us to realize that we can get to the
Super Bowl,'' Tuggle said. ``After 12 years you never give up, even
though we've had some really bad times. You continue to work hard,
and good things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is holding up. It's been an incredible year for me
personally, and I want to make this more than just one year. I want
to try to get something established for our young guys so they
don't have to wait like I did.''

INJURIES OF CONCERN TO NBA  
 SHORT PRESEASON HINDERS PLAYERS CONDITIONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first season of the NBA's post-lockout era, there's been
so much anguished talk about life without Michael Jordan that it
sounds as if the league needs a good shrink.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the mental breakdown. Sports psychology will have to
wait, because the real urgency might be physical.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated training camp and a compressed schedule could
lead to a lot of shredded muscles and compound fractures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear of that,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, whose
club plays the first of two preseason games tonight at Dallas after
a chaotic, eight-day camp.
</P>
<P>
   If there had not been a lockout, teams would have started
working on Oct. 6. Each would have had about eight preseason games,
before opening the 82-game marathon. There was plenty of time to
ease into what coaches and players call ``game shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But, now, the league is in the midst of what could be more
appropriately called ``crisis conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether it can work, especially over the subsequent
course of a 50-game, 3{-month season. Three and four games a week
are on a schedule that could turn hamstrings and tendons into the
physical equivalent of an eroded fan belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major concern,'' Suns strength and conditioning coach
Robin Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound foresees several possibilities. A rush job at camp could
result in ragged performances from fatigued players. The style of
basketball might not mollify impatient fans who already are
exasperated by the sight of millionaire players and billionaire
owners haggling over enough money to get a third-world nation out
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding issue, Pound said, is safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strains and things like that,'' he said. ``That's what we're
worried about. Getting in shape is going to take weeks, even
months, to reach, quote-unquote, top-game shape. We're just trying
to be healthy as we get there. Injuries occur simply because you're
in poor condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said the Suns reported to camp in conditions that are mix
of good and bad. That's not unusual under normal circumstances.
Some players have always been more diligent in off-season than
others.
</P>
<P>
   Under conditions forced by the lockout, however,
out-of-condition players don't have the same opportunity to catch
up with their teammates. An alteration with starting lineups and
substitution schemes is a possible result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where a guy's conditioning is right now will determine his
minutes,'' said Ainge, who shortened a practice session Thursday
night because his team had begun to appear sluggish. ``This
training camp hasn't been as hard as we've had in the past, because
before you had a little bit of time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, here, we're going to be getting into condition as the
season goes along. Because of that, you're fearful. You're more
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge's caution will be evident tonight and again Monday night
when the Suns and Mavericks play a second preseason game at America
West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Rex Chapman will not play in either game because
of a slight injury to a hamstring, Ainge said. Second-year pro
Marko Milic is expected to start tonight, instead.
</P>
<P>
   There is lingering concern whether Chapman's troublesome
hamstrings will endure the 50-game schedule. A hamstring injury
sidelined him in last year's playoffs against San Antonio. His
sudden loss stripped the Suns of perimeter shooting and leadership
in a first-round match that ended with their elimination in four
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing concern,'' Ainge said of Chapman. ``He's so
competitive. He always wants to play. I let him play last year
against Utah (April 17, just before the playoffs), and I shouldn't
have. That was a mistake. I knew better. Sometimes players don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also Danny Manning, who, as a starter or a reserve, is
a key component in the Phoenix rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year pro has been moving well in practice. But he has yet
to test his right knee _ surgically repaired last spring for the
second time in his career _ in a single game, much less a string of
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is overtraining people, because we do have
such a sense of urgency,'' Pound said. ``The bottom line is that it
takes time to get in shape. You have to do it through a
progression, otherwise it becomes high-risk, regardless of when the
season starts. It happens every year, but before I've had more time
to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is scary.'' &QL;

AFFECTION FOR WOODS A BIT MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - He is great for golf. A hero to kids, an
inspiration to minorities, a reason to care when the PGA rolls into
town.
</P>
<P>
   He is bad for golf. The center of too much attention, the Pied
Piper in cleats, proud owner of killer indifference.
</P>
<P>
   And he's so big that even his caddie _ Fluff Daddy _ was signing
autographs. The most famous bag toter since Danny Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   All that is Tiger Woods was on display Friday at the Phoenix
Open _ the human swoosh, the magic wedge, the mind-boggling skills,
the exploding hips, the beaming light to a million moths.
Validation for the kind of hype normally reserved for the pope.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, nearly 90,000 people walked the grounds of the TPC.
Half were spread about the course. The other half followed Tiger.
The attraction borders on the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing every (golfer) does is check their pairings
and see where Tiger is,'' Billy Mayfair said. ``The worst pairing
you can have is the group ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're playing with him. Because when Tiger is done with
a hole, the mob scatters, jockeying for position at the next tee,
and the hell with whoever is left on the green. A massive sea of
humanity moving in unison, army ants following the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of quieted down,'' said Jim Furyk, a member of
Tiger's group. ``Two or three years ago, there was more
stampeding.''
</P>
<P>
   How nice.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won nine tournaments since bursting on the scene in
1996, seven on the PGA Tour. David Duval has won nine tournaments
in the past 15 months, but on this afternoon, he was just a
curiosity, the guy who shot 59 and wears strange sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo, playing two groups ahead of McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Woods is a benefactor from the powerful forces of
marketing, and on Friday, the only thing without a visible Nike
logo was his socks. He is also a product of our need for greatness,
and you come to see Tiger because you think you're grabbing a piece
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was watching a golf tournament, I would not follow my
group today because it would be a lot more difficult to see,''
Furyk said. ``I feel bad for my family. My mom and dad were out
there. When they see I'm paired with Tiger Woods, they kind of
slump over a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   There are rewards, and on a day when he played 22 holes, Tiger
was on fire. It would be nice if this was the counter-strike to
Duval's 59, the missile aimed at the raging debate over who is No.
1, a boiling rivalry about to burn up the world of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Tiger doesn't care about that, or if Duval
unseats him at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' Woods said. ``If he does, he does. If he
doesn't, he doesn't. I'm just going out there trying to win a
tournament. He's going to do exactly the same thing. I know he and
I don't really make it our life to be Number 1 in the world. Our
lives are probably to win golf tournaments, and that will take care
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan would be appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have a life and have fun, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we must remember that Tiger is only 23 and life in a
fishbowl is no life at all. But ever since he blew the stodgy,
racial lid off The Masters, we have pushed him to fulfill our
vision of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will. When he's ready. Until then, give him space and
the rest of the field a little of your time.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Woods signed his share of autographs after
closing out a brilliant round of 67. Even if there were at least
5,000 people stretching a good 400 yards from the ninth hole to the
clubhouse, hoping for his signature. Or just to say they were so
close they could've touched him.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Woods, the man who sired a Tiger, is a man prone to
ridiculous statements. He once likened his son to the Second
Coming.
</P>
<P>
   Silly and sacrilegious. Unless, of course, you were on hand
Friday at the TPC. &QL;

KELLOGG'S PROFIT FALLS MORE THAN 40 PERCENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By DANA CANEDY  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kellogg Co. said Friday that fourth-quarter profit excluding
one-time adjustments fell more than 40 percent, reflecting stiffer
competition and diminished consumer appetite for cereal.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Kellogg earned $93 million,
excluding extraordinary charges, compared with $159 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Net income tripled to $47 million, or 11 cents a diluted share,
from $15 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier, when results
were depressed by restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest cereal company had $70.5 million in pretax
special charges in the 1998 fourth quarter related to an overhaul
of its domestic business that included the elimination of hundreds
of jobs at its headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich. It had $162
million in one-time charges in the corresponding fourth quarter a
year earlier. Revenue in the most recent period fell 1.1 percent to
$1.59 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Kellogg's profit before unusual items was $549
million, compared with $704 million in 1997. Net earnings fell 8
percent to $503 million, or $1.23 a share, from $546 million, or
$1.32 a share, in 1997. Revenue declined 1 percent to $6.76
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly and yearly results were in line with analysts'
expectations, which had been revised downward more than once after
Kellogg warned that results would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that ``our financial results are disappointing,''
Arnold G. Langbo, the company's chief executive, who will be
replaced in April by Carlos Gutierrez, the president and chief
operating officer, said the world's largest cereal maker had taken
steps to position the company for growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, we have a solid business plan that includes investing
in product innovation, accelerating the growth of our convenience
foods business and continuing to cut costs,'' Langbo said.
</P>
<P>
   But the market remains skeptical. Kellogg shares, which have
fallen about 15 percent in the past year, had begun to edge up
recently on optimism of pending management changes. They fell
$1.4375 Friday to $40.625
</P>
<P>
   ``While not unexpected, the numbers about 1998 were sobering,''
said John McMillin, an analyst who follows the company for
Prudential Securities. ``We all know that the Kellogg team lost a
lot of games in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is struggling to reverse steep drops in market share
that it has suffered as nimbler competitors, like General Mills
Inc., have stolen many of its once-loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   Private-label cereal makers also have hurt Kellogg by selling
cheaper versions of popular items like corn flakes. The company is
also trying to lure customers who now eat bagels and other
breakfast foods instead of cereal and has promised that this year
will be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced. ``I think it will be a very
challenging year for them still,'' said Patrick Schumann, an
analyst with Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co.

MEDIATE GRABS LEAD IN DASH TO CLUBHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - With darkness settling in on the 64th
Phoenix Open, and the vast majority of the 89,750 fans either long
gone or over the hill in the Bird's Nest, Rocco Mediate came
chugging down the 18th fairway at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   From his vantage point, it was difficult to know who was walking
faster on this Friday, those exiting the course thinking Tiger
Woods was the leader, or Mediate, who was attempting to post his
score even though the horn that signals the end of play already had
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Mediate won the race, as players are allowed
to finish the hole they are playing once the horn has sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a marathon. I'm just happy I don't have to come
back in the morning (to complete the round),'' said Mediate, who
also had to be a little high after his 4-under 67 got him to 6
under at the midpoint _ 2 shots in front of Woods, who also shot
67.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton (70) and Phoenix's Jonathan Kaye (67) were another
shot back at 3 under.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was lucky enough to reach the scorer's tent.
Sweden's Gabriel Hjertstedt, who was 4 under and still had chance
of catching Mediate, only made it through 13 holes when play was
called at 5:54 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 51 players will return today at 7:50 a.m. to complete
the second round. The third round is scheduled to start at
approximately 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate said nothing could shake him at the end, not even the
crowd's mad dash to the exits or the noise emanating from the Nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky,'' he said. ``That stuff doesn't affect me. If I
hear it, I just back off. It's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of rowdy behavior earlier on this sun-kissed
day, as Tiger worked the galleries into a frenzy. Woods said when
he makes a few birdies, ``the crowds tend to move quicker to the
next tee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm really playing well, they start running,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Round 2 resembled the running of the bulls through the
streets of Pamplona, Spain. Tiger was hot, and the stampede was on.
</P>
<P>
   Woods began his charge early in the morning by rallying with two
birdies over his last four holes to complete his first round, which
had been held over due to darkness from Thursday. That left him at
71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I could get back to even par, I had a legitimate
chance to go out there and shoot 65 easily, or even 64,'' said
Woods, who had formulated his strategy Thursday night after a
conference with his instructor, Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Starting his second round on the back side, Woods found his
groove quickly, punctuating his first nine holes with back-to-back
chip-ins at No. 17 and 18. The first chip-in helped him save par
after he had pitched his ball in the water. The second slam-dunk
from off the green gave him a birdie that vaulted him to the top of
the pack at 4 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is playing a lot more difficult this year,'' noted
Tiger, citing firm greens, the added length and shaved banks around
the water-guarded greens. ``But (the rough) is really not that
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving it really well right now, and if I do miss the
fairways, I'm down there far enough where I have wedges or 9-irons
in my hands and it's not as difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bore him out, as Woods is averaging 317.5 yards per
wallop through two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite hitting on all cylinders was the other pre-tournament
favorite, David Duval. Shooting for his third victory in three
starts this season, Duval was 3 over after a 71.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval was in no danger of missing the projected cut of 5
over, which would be the highest cut since the tournament was moved
to the TPC in 1987. The previous high had been 1 over in 1989 and
'90, a testament to just how demanding the course is playing this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking at an early exit include PGA champ Vijay Singh (7
over), Scottsdale's Billy Mayfair (8 over) and Fuzzy Zoeller (8
over), whose 79 was the day's high round.
</P>
<P>
   Providing Hjertstedt and Paul Azinger don't sweep past Tiger
today when they complete their rounds, Woods will be paired with
Mediate. Now the real test will come as to how Rocco can handle the
raucousness that's associated with this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to play with Tiger because he's always up
there (on the leader board),'' said Mediate, whose last victory
came in the 1993 Greater Greensboro Open. ``Playing with Tiger is
not something I'm worried about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me at all, the people. They will be noisy on
certain holes, but they will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, the birdies start flying, and the bulls begin
to run. &QL;

EWING LEAVES EXHIBITION GAME WITH INJURED KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Patrick Ewing's opportunity to work
himself back into shape hit a setback Friday night when he limped
into the tunnel in the second quarter and disappeared for the rest
of the New York Knicks' exhibition game against the New Jersey
Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said that Ewing mildly sprained his right knee
fighting for a rebound with about seven minutes left in the second
quarter, but they were unsure when he would return to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, coach Jeff Van Gundy had planned to play Ewing
at least 30 minutes because his superstar center had played
clumsily in an exhibition game on Wednesday night and was out of
sync in a scrimmage on Thursday. Simulating the scenario of
back-to-back-to-back games the Knicks will face twice this season,
Ewing was going to be watched carefully Friday night. Just how
resilient was the 36-year old Ewing?
</P>
<P>
   In foul trouble early, Ewing's minutes were spare but were
indicative of how far he has to go to become an impact player
again. When he left the game, he had three turnovers in seven
minutes and was 1 of 1 from the field with one rebound and one
assist.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the six-month lockout engrossed in meetings as
the National Basketball Players Association president, Ewing
entered camp carrying extra weight and had several questions
surrounding him. Not only was his conditioning suspect, but no one
knew what to expect from his form. Last year, Ewing played just
four playoff games after sitting out for several months because of
a wrist injury in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's injury did not seem nearly as severe. Ewing
emerged from a crowd of players limping after he appeared to step
on the side of Lucious Harris' foot, but continued to play. On the
next possession, Ewing was stripped of the ball as he put it below
his waist. In transition, Keith Van Horn was fouled, and at that
point, Ewing was taken out of the game with 6 minutes 36 seconds
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing immediately left to receive treatment in the Knicks'
locker room and did not return for the second half. Although his
knee injury did not appear serious, Ewing has had nearly a decade
of trouble with his right knee. Over the years, he has had four
arthroscopic surgeries on that knee.
</P>
<P>
   Any practice time missed will be detrimental to Ewing's
progress. Like his teammates, Ewing is learning how to adjust his
game to the arrival of Latrell Sprewell. Now, Van Gundy is running
a system that does not revolve around the post-up offense. With
Sprewell and Allan Houston, both of whom have the ability to drive
and kick the ball outside, the more up-tempo offense is expected to
be more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of anchoring himself beneath the basket, Ewing will
often slide out when the guards come barreling inside. In that
position, he can be the recipient of a pass for an open jumper.
After 13 years of playing the same way, Ewing needs time to adjust.
That time was cut short Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby and Dennis Scott, players with much to prove to
coach Jeff Van Gundy, did not help themselves Friday night. Camby,
playing right into the fragile reputation attached to him while
with the Toronto Raptors, decided not to play because of a blister
on the ball of his left foot. In one week of training camp, Camby
has left the team longing for Charles Oakley. Camby has had his
work ethic questioned and played himself out of the Knicks'
eight-man rotation after a disappointing first exhibition game.
Scott, who came to the Knicks last Sunday in poor condition, did
not play because of a strained right hamstring. When they arrived,
both players were expected to be large contributors, but there is
little time for them to play themselves into Van Gundy's good
graces. ``The whole season is built on mental toughness,'' Van
Gundy said. ``You want to look a guy in the eyes and say I can
count on you.'' Camby, who incurred injuries spanning from back
spasms to a jammed neck in Toronto, knows what his absence looked
like, but said the blister went through to the bone. ``A lot of
people will have their own opinion,'' Camby said. ``But I've played
in pain before.''  &QL;

 COAST GUARD LOOKS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Coast Guard radio operators, the frantic mayday
calls from crippled and sinking boats on two occasions were
useless. The calls were muffled and no vessel names were
discernible, the Coast Guard said. They gave no location, and were
too brief to allow operators to get a directional bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, no rescue ships or aircraft were sent. And eight
people perished: four on the sailboat Morning Dew after she hit a
jetty while entering the harbor in Charleston, S.C., in December
1997, and four others on the fishing vessel Adriatic after she went
down for unknown reasons off New Jersey on Jan. 18, while hauling
45 tons of clams to a wholesale dock in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the two boats has prompted an inquiry by the
National Transportation Safety Board into ways to improve one of
the Coast Guard's primary missions, search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
   It underscores a weakness in the agency's maritime-distress
communications system and its ability, in situations like the
Morning Dew's and the Adriatic's, to find foundering vessels and
save their occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The communications system is ``in dire need of modernization,''
said the Coast Guard's commandant, Adm.. James M. Loy, earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of orders he issued after the Coast Guard's inquiry
into the sinking of the Morning Dew, Loy said that much of the
agency's equipment is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communications technology is readily available that would give
us the capability to save additional lives,'' he said. ``We must
make every effort to obtain and use these modern capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Loy instructed his staff to look into ways to speed up work on a
nationwide project to upgrade the agency's entire maritime distress
communications system.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the overhaul, expected to cost $100 million to $140
million, started three years ago, Cmdr. Mike Lapinski, a spokesman
in Washington, said in an interview. The new equipment is expected
to be in place in the Coast Guard's hundreds of vessels, aircraft,
shore stations and radio-antenna sites by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski said the Coast Guard saves 4,000 to 5,000 people a year
in life-threatening situations at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do a remarkable job,'' he said. ``But that
certainly can be better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said rescue aircraft and vessels are all first rate. Coast
Guard personnel involved in search and rescue receive excellent
training, he said. ``The only place where there is a weak link is
we have a communications system that's not state of the art,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski said the Coast Guard has no figures on the number of
times unintelligible maydays have discouraged immediate rescue
efforts and lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect it's not very many,'' he said. But the new
communications system, he said, would eliminate the problems of
maydays that are garbled, muffled, too weak or too short.
</P>
<P>
   With existing equipment, a mayday must last at least 10 seconds
before a radio operator can get a directional bearing on the site
of a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would reduce that time to one second, said Cmdr.
Jon Allen, deputy manager of the replacement project. He also said
that bearings obtained now can be wrong by as much as 10 degrees.
The new gear, Allen said, would be accurate to 2 or 3 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The new gear also provides for quicker and easier removal of
static and background noise that can muffle a distress call. It
also has better memory, Allen said. It prevents a transmission that
comes in after a distress call from wiping out information needed
to learn the bearing of a mayday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard now requires commercial and recreational vessels
to carry a signaling device called an Emergency Position-Indicating
Radio Beacon. Once activated by a flip of its switch or removal
from its housing bracket, the device beams a boat's location to a
satellite, which then sends it in about a minute to Coast Guard
radios.
</P>
<P>
   But the Adriatic's device never went off when the boat foundered
this month; divers found it in its bracket. Investigators do not
believe the Morning Dew carried the device, Lapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Friday that the families of four
people killed when the Morning Dew sank have filed a $35 million
suit in Charleston against the government. The suit faults the
Coast Guard for failing to launch a search for the Morning Dew.
</P>
<P>
   The Adriatic's three-word distress call was played Thursday at
the start of an inquiry into her sinking. The call lasted about two
seconds. The first word was mumbled and indiscernible; the next two
words, ``mayday, mayday,'' were clear.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 1st Class Horace Browder, who oversaw response to
the distress call from Atlantic City, testified that an immediate
search was ruled out because the mayday gave no ship name or
location, and radio operators got no responses to their appeals to
the vessel in distress and other ships off New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, relatives of lost crewmen asked why the mayday
was so unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Oland, whose son Doug was on the Adriatic, asked if the
garbled message could have been decoded, made more audible or
slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it take a long time?'' Oland asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have any equipment to do that,'' Browder said.

L.C. LEWIN, WRITER OF SATIRE OF GOVERNMENT PLOT, DIES AT 82 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)   By JOHN KIFNER    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard C. Lewin, whose Vietnam-era satire of a supposed secret
government study on the dangers of peace, ``Report From Iron
Mountain,'' resurfaced nearly 30 years later as proof of government
conspiracies for right-wing paramilitary groups, died on Thursday
at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 82 lived in Guilford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Report From Iron Mountain,'' supposedly the work of a
topsecret 15-member study group that concluded that even if lasting
peace ``could be achieved, it would almost certainly not be in the
best interests of society to achieve it,'' caused a sensation when
it was published in the fall of 1967. By the next year, it was on
the best-seller list of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Peace would be catastrophic, the report said in deadpan
bureaucratize, unless there was extensive planning to replace the
many benefits of war. It was possible that a ``sophisticated form
of slavery,'' together with ``blood games'' might have to be
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately poisoning the atmosphere, the parody went on, ``in
a politically acceptable manner'' or inventing enemies from another
planet might be necessary to maintain social cohesion. The end of
war would require some other form of wasteful spending to support
the economy, possibly an unlimited space program aimed at reaching
unreachable points in space.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax that would not die began one day in 1967 when Victor
Navasky and a few other editors of Monocle, a humor magazine that
is now defunct, noticed a short newspaper report describing how the
stock market had tumbled because of a ``peace scare.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the height of the Vietnam War. Savoring the Swiftian
implications, Navasky, now the editor of The Nation, and the others
began tossing around the idea that Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara and the other famously hard-nosed intellectuals brought
into government by President John F. Kennedy had commissioned one
of their studies _ research organizations like Rand and the Hudson
Institute were all the vogue then _ on the threat of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin, an accomplished political satirist, produced the supposed
report, complete with footnotes, most of them from other reports by
the government or research organizations, and a tribute to the
``methods'' of Herman Kahn of the Hudson Institute that allowed
thinking about war without ``getting bogged down in questions of
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Other plotters included E.L. Doctorow, then an editor at Dial
Press, later the author of ``Ragtime'' and other novels, and the
publishing house's president, Richard Baron, who listed the 109
page work as nonfiction and was to turn aside questions about its
authenticity by citing the footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Debate immediately raged about whether the ``Report From Iron
Mountain'' was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``One informed source confirmed,'' U.S. News and World Report
said in its Nov. 20, 1967, issue, ``that the `Special Study
Group,'' as the book called it, was set up by a top official in the
Kennedy administration. The source added that the report was
drafted and eventually submitted to President Lyndon B. Johnson,
who was said to have `hit the roof' _ and then ordered that the
report be bottled up for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Action, an influential journal of the period, devoted an
entire issue to the debate over the book. Esquire published a
28,000-word excerpt. John Kenneth Galbraith got into the act with a
book review in The Washington Post under a pseudonym vouching for
the book's authenticity and the validity of its conclusions but
expressing reservations about releasing it ``to an obviously
unconditioned public.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1972, Lewin confessed that he had made up the report. The
``Pentagon Papers,'' the secret history of the Vietnam War, had
been published, Lewin wrote in The New York Times Book Review, and
were ``as outrageous, morally and intellectually'' as his own
invention,
</P>
<P>
   ``The charade is over,'' he wrote. ``Some of the documents read
like parodies of Iron Mountain, rather than the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewin, a graduate of Harvard University, came to writing after
stints as a labor organizer in New England and work in his father's
sugar refinery in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to Iris Zinn Lewin and Eve Merriam, a poet,
playwright and children's book author, ended in divorce. He is
survived by his daughter, Julie Lewin of West Hartford, Conn., a
son, Michael Z. Lewin of Frome, England, and his longtime
companion, Lorraine Davis of Manhattan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Report from Iron Mountain'' went out of print in 1980, but a
few years ago Lewin was startled to get a request from a white
supremacist group in Arkansas wanting to buy old copies. Then he
discovered that the Liberty Lobby, a far-right group, was offering
copies of the book as a genuine government report. His insistence
that he had written the book only reinforced the belief among the
paramilitary groups that it was a real secret document.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin successfully sued the Liberty Lobby, which asserted that
that there was no copyright for the book because it was a
government document. Neither side would reveal the full terms of
the settlement, but Lewin received more than a thousand copies of
the bootlegged version.
</P>
<P>
   Pirated copies _ some of a new edition published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster's imprint, Free Press _ are still in circulation, along
with a six-hour videotape version. Simon &AMP; Schuster has been trying
to stop right-wing groups from posting versions of the book on
their Internet sites under the guise of a government document.

NETS' KITTLES WILL MISS NETS OPENER, BUT WON'T NEED SURGERY

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For once, the Nets received some good
news regarding an injury. Kerry Kittles, the third-year shooting
guard who was thought to have torn cartilage in his knee, received
an incorrect diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   After doctors in New York said on Wednesday that Kittles had a
torn meniscus in his right knee, Kittles flew to Philadelphia for a
second opinion from his physician, Dr. Robert Good. On Thursday,
Good, who performed exploratory surgery on Kittles' right knee in
October, disputed the original diagnosis, saying instead that
Kittles' knee is only bruised.
</P>
<P>
   While Kittles still will miss next Saturday's season opener at
Atlanta and probably a week or two after that, he will not have to
have surgery and worry about cartilage or ligament damage once he
returns to the court. ``I'm definitely happy it's not a tear,''
Kittles said. ``I'd hate to be back in the operating room getting
sliced on in a short season.''
</P>
<P>
   Nets Coach John Calipari was pleased with the new diagnosis. ``I
was happy for him,'' Calipari said. ``I was going to my daughter
Megan's basketball practice, and I whistled and skipped all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said Calipari went overboard in his enthusiasm. ``He was
ecstatic; he was going crazy,'' said Kittles, who will combine rest
and rehabilitation over the next few weeks. ``I was like, `Cal,
wait. This is still a problem. I'll still be out for a while.'''
</P>
<P>
   The word on Kittles was one of two good reports the Nets
received Friday. After the club spent the afternoon recruiting
Scott Burrell, a free-agent small forward, a person close to the
negotiations said, ``Scott is the Nets' to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, who also is considering Houston and Miami, is very
likely to make a decision this weekend. The Nets are offering him
$1 million for one year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets could use a fresh body. Since training camp began eight
days ago, Rony Seikaly has suffered ligament damage in his left
knee, Keith Van Horn contracted food poisoning, Sam Cassell had
back spasms and Jayson Williams twisted his right ankle.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ Hakeem Olajuwon has the explosiveness back in his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley has the spring back in his step. And Scottie
Pippen has Houston dancing in the palm of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a dizzying preseason for the Rockets, like watching
a Fellini film come to life on the hardwood _ dazed looks on faces,
everyone scrambling back and forth at 78-rpm speed, hustling here,
bouncing there, cramming stories into every corner of the screen
and packing weeks of action into just a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Rockets have had to gobble up their appreciation
of what their 1999 story could be, the reviews are flying in and
the possibilities are delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Like feeling one's age, the Rockets' youth movement apparently
was only a state of mind. Barkley, 35, and Olajuwon, 36, are as
frisky as ever. Pippen, 33 and out of Michael Jordan's shadow once
and for all, is renewed and unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   We saw it all flash before our eyes throughout the first half of
the preseason, which was Tuesday in case you missed it.
</P>
<P>
   We should see it again throughout the second half of the
preseason, which is tonight against the Admiral, David Robinson,
and the Chief of Staff, Tim Duncan, in the final exhibition game
against the San Antonio Spurs. We have seen a refreshed and
recharged Rockets team that could become one of the NBA's classics.
</P>
<P>
   But what some might not have noticed, amid the giddiness of
having three of the NBA's best-ever players playing like the
legends they are, is the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The spring is in his step, too. The explosive feeling of
anticipation and anxiety for the upcoming season is clear on his
face every hour of every day. He is fitter than he has been in
years, too. He is renewed, too.
</P>
<P>
   And he has it all in the palms of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Rudy Tomjanovich if he has tinkered with things
more than in years past, to which he answered with a sly laugh: ``I
love to tinker. I tinker as much as I can. Don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T sees the possibilities of this team like we all do. But
it is his task to put pencil to paper _ or to a napkin at a
restaurant, or to a magazine, or scrap of paper, or anything he can
get his hands on as he fiddles with plays trying to help the
legends live up to expectations. And he has, more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   While Barkley was having offseason hernia surgery and devoting
himself to a tough workout regimen, and Olajuwon was strengthening
his knees, Tomjanovich was putting in extra work, too.
</P>
<P>
   He stuck to a mostly vegetarian diet. He watched the
developments surrounding the NBA lockout closely and worked out. He
put in long hours at the office, like always. And while deals were
being talked about, he fiddled _ even tinkered _ with the
possibilities of having Antonio McDyess or Pippen eventually join
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was possible we'd get Scottie,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``I just thought it would take so much, and we didn't want to
have to give up that much. But I thought about it, and then it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It opened up a whole new world to Tomjanovich, and, like it did
for his veteran players, it gave him everything he always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to run much more,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's
something I've wanted us to do for a while, but we weren't always
able to run.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen's unique all-encompassing game and the young legs of
Michael Dickerson and others in the backcourt, now the Rockets can
run. They also can do things in the half-court game they never have
been able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to say, `Here's the focal point for us,''' Tomjanovich
said, referring to the inside-outside post game that hinged on
Olajuwon and Barkley. ``Because of the flexibility of having
Pippen, we're getting more plays out of the offense now. We're
doing a lot more things.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more pick-and-rolls, more cuts off high picks, more
opportunities to option out of the post and drive, even more
inbounds plays. Often after a timeout or between quarters,
Tomjanovich gives his point guard three plays to run in the
half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   He still will, but now he says: ``I hope it's a long time before
we run any of those plays. I want us to run. I just want us to play
and get a lot of fast breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Just run and play. Like youngsters. Like they did before last
season's injury-riddled 41-41 season in which they all looked their
age and, worse, felt it.
</P>
<P>
   Like how they're looking and feeling these days, especially the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel renewed,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I do feel like this
is a whole new team.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is confident the owners
will adopt some form of instant-replay review of officials' calls
at their spring meetings in March.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his annual state-of-the-NFL address before Super Bowl XXXIII,
Tagliabue on Friday said he expects replay to return for the first
time since 1991, endorsed former New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, disclosed that
San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. probably will not be
allowed to run the team in 1999 and insisted the league is making
progress in hiring minority coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident about replay because we've come so close the
last couple of years,'' Tagliabue told a jam-packed ballroom at the
downtown Hyatt and a live television audience on ESPN. ``I'm
optimistic, but nothing in the NFL is a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a system that can be used as an advantage. We
don't want to turn it into a disadvantage to the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   This season may have been the most controversial ever for
officials, who have come under fire almost every week for missing
calls that cost teams games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we succeeded in shooting ourselves in the foot by
jumping on the officials with our network partners in ways that
were unfair,'' Tagliabue said, ``but we will look at all aspects of
officiating. We are not going to look at it with rose-colored
glasses, but I don't think we need to view the issues any
differently than we have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said NFL experts are studying a way to use digital
replay to speed the process. The competition committee will submit
a proposal to the owners in Arizona. It will involve either a
coaches challenge system or a form similar to the one used from
1986-91. That one was voted out because of long delays caused by
the replay official in the press box.

   ``We don't want to slow the pace of the game,'' Tagliabue said.
``Coaches make quick decisions all the time. That's one of the
things that makes a good coach.''

   When Tagliabue was asked if he believes Taylor should be voted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame today despite his history of
drug problems, bankruptcy and filing false tax returns, he said,
``I think he should be, and I say that without qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall's about performance on the field. Lawrence was one of
the greatest players ever. I think the public understands that by
making a judgment on what he did on the field, you're not judging
what he did off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, getting into the Hall would be a way for him to
regain some self-esteem and to pull his life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor needs 29 of 36 votes to make it. A maximum of seven
candidates and a minimum of four will be voted on and announced
today.

   Tagliabue has been a champion for minority hiring. He has
started programs to help minorities to get jobs. He has stressed to
the owners that he wants minority candidates interviewed. But he
can't force them to hire minority coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were one game away from a Super Bowl with a black coach, a
black quarterback and black personnel executives,'' Tagliabue said,
referring to the Minnesota Vikings, who lost to Atlanta in the NFC
Championship Game. ``I'm not satisfied with it, but we think we've
made a lot of progress getting minorities in the loop. There's been
an increase in African-American coordinators.''
</P>

   Tagliabue surprised many in the NFL when he said DeBartolo,
whose legal problems in Louisiana still have not been settled, will
likely remain on the sideline while his sister, Denise DeBartolo
York, will have control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a felony and was fined $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood is that Eddie will continue to be divorced from
the team in 1999,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has yet to approve the sale of the Washington Redskins
to Howard Milstein and Daniel Snider for $800 million. The trustees
of the estate of late owner Jack Kent Cooke accepted the bid from
Milstein and Snider. The league is making sure everything was
handled properly, because the owners want John Kent Cooke to be
able to keep the team, but that doesn't appear possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to satisfy ourselves that the (sale) process was
fair to the incumbent owner,'' Tagliabue said. ``We want to make
sure that we have the right to determine who our owners are.''
