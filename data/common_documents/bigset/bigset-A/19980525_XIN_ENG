<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Asked to Safeguard Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Zhu Bangzao, said today that the U.S. government should take
effective measures to prevent the proposals by some
U.S. congressmen from becoming law and should help safeguard and
develop Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while responding to a question about
U.S. media accusing Chinese of making political donations,
accusing Space System/Loral and Hughes Space and Communications of
helping China improve its missile guidance and control systems,
and criticizing the U.S. government of approving the use of
Chinese satellites by those corporations. And in response to these
accusations, there have been several motions in the U.S. House of
Representatives and Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has said several times that the Chinese
government is opposed to any country's interference in other
countries' internal affairs, and that China has never used and
will never use money to influence U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
He said that the China Great Wall Industry Corp. spokesman has
pointed out that the report by some Americans and news media about
Chinese involved in U.S. political donations is totally groundless
and sheer slander.
</P>
<P>
As for the Sino-U.S. cooperation in launching satellites, he
said, China Great Wall has explained the matter in detail and
shown that the cooperation fully complies with international
practices and that the Chinese have no intention to use this to
obtain U.S. missile technology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side stressed that the cooperation in the satellite
deal is normal business activity that is beneficial to both, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's strong resentment of and firm opposition
to the actions of some U.S. congressmen in pushing for approval of
several anti-China motions that wantonly interfere in China's
internal affairs and disregard the norms governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it must be pointed out that there are some
Americans who do not want to see Sino-U.S. relations improve and,
out of hidden motives, want to block or destroy those relations
in any way possible, and will resort to slander and falsehood.
</P>
<P>
The stable development of Sino-U.S. relations is in the
fundamental interests of the two countries and represents the
common desire of their people, Zhu said, and added that these
attempts will be in vain.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
virtually won the Thomas Cup Badminton Finals for a record
eleventh time after taking an unbeatable 3-1 lead over five-time
winners Malaysia in the final of the 20th Thomas Cup Badminton
Finals here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The team's 32-year-old Joko Suprianto is taking on Malaysia's
Roslin Hashim in the final's last match, a singles. Whatever
results out of the match could not affect Indonesia's victory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, a country with its people crazy about badminton from
generation to generation, proved its depth of potential for the
game when it won the Thomas Cup Finals for the first time in 1958.
Its team had won the game's most coveted trophy in 10 of the world
team championships, prior to the current tournament in Hong Kong,
including four straight times between 1970 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's latest triumph at the Hong Kong championships was
the third in a row since 1994, which confirmed Indonesia's
position as the most successful badminton powerhouse in the world.

<HEADLINE> Loral Chairman Denies Buying Approval on Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The American company suspected
of buying approval on satellite launch with China has stressed
that he never asked for special treatment from the administration.
</P>
<P>
Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman of Loral Space &AMP; Communications,
said in a lengthy interview with The New York Times Saturday that
there was no linkage between his 1996 donation to the Democratic
Party and President Bill Clinton's permission last February to
launch Loral satellite atop Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton came under criticism for the waiver,
which was allegedly influenced by Schwartz's 1.3 million U.S.
dollar donation. The president and government officials have
denied and released relevant documents to disprove the charges.
</P>
<P>
"I can say absolutely, categorically, I have never spoken with
the president about any Loral business except on one occasion,"
Schwartz told the newspaper in his 36th-floor office in New York.
</P>
<P>
He said that he met with President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore in 1993 and only generally described his company's
satellite work.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz and Loral are under scrutiny by the Justice Department
and Congress over allegations that Loral shared sensitive
technical data with the Chinese and as a result enhanced the
reliability of their long-range military missiles.
</P>
<P>
Outraged at charges by Congressional Republicans as an
executive who placed his business interests before national
security, the World War II veteran and lifelong Democrat said, "To
attach words like `treason' and `traitor' to these activities is a
deeply disturbing development."
</P>
<P>
The Republican-led Congress has urged further inquiries of the
allegations. The House of Representatives even went further to ban
last week sales of satellite and sensitive technology to China.
</P>
<P>
Although the measures still have a long way to go before
becoming law, they have already provoked much concerns among the
American companies desiring to promote business in China.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Saturday that U.S. aerospace
companies have launched an intensive lobbying campaign to defuse
the issue and block the legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a growing consensus there's a need to explain
why it is of critical national importance that we move forward on
U.S.-China trade," said Cal Cohen, president of the Emergency
Committee for American Trade, an umbrella group of chief
executives from the country's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
China has gained favor as a provider of launches because its
Long March rockets have proven cheaper than those made in Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
China represents a huge market not only for the companies that
make spacecraft and the vehicles on which they are launched, but
also the biggest potential market for commercial aircraft makers
such as Boeing Co., which last fall won a 3 billion dollar
contract to sell 50 jetliners to China.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that broader curbs on U.S. trade with China would
affect a wide range of companies including soft drink giant
Coca-Cola Co. and conglomerate General Electric Co., which have
targeted China for future sales.

<HEADLINE> Anti-nuclear Student Hijacks Pakistan Plane: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The hijacker of the Fokker plane
owned by Pakistan International Airline (PIA) is a student
belonging to a local nationalist organization, informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The student hijacked the plane because his organization based
in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province was opposing any
nuclear test within the province, the sources quoted unconfirmed
reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is no official announcement yet of Sunday's hijacking. It
is the first plane-hijacking incident in recent years in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Television said the plane was carrying 38 people when
it was hijacked at around 6:30 p.m. (local time) on Sunday, 15
minutes after take-off from Gwadar, a coastal town in Balochistan,
to Karachi, the country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports put the number of people aboard the plane at
48. There are still conflicting reports of the number of
passengers and crew aboard.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, which was reported to be heading towards India
after the hijacking, was later forced by the Pakistani Airforce to
land at the Pakistani city of Hyderabad, about 100 km northeast of
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at airports of Hyderabad and Karachi have been
placed on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Security officials at the Karachi airport said the aircraft
lost contact with the airport just two minutes before landing.
</P>
<P>
No further details are immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says His Government Working for "Real </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu reiterated Sunday that the peace process had been
collapsed even before he took office, saying his government had
been working for a "real peace."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a 50-member delegation of the U.S. Congress
led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Netanyahu repeated the
statement he made Friday that "the Oslo process was in dire
straits in its first two years."
</P>
<P>
In Friday's speech, the right-wing leader told foreign
diplomats that peace had died and collapsed before his Likud
coalition came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Being under fire from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and the opposition block in his government by making such a
statement, Netanyahu quickly denied he was writing off the peace
process, telling the Israeli press Saturday that he was
"misunderstood."
</P>
<P>
In his remarks Sunday, however, the Israeli prime minister
reaffirmed his position that there was no "real peace" before his
Likud coalition took control of the government.
</P>
<P>
All tracks in the peace process, including talks with the
Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria, had eventually been grounded to a
halt due to waves of violence against Israel and the conflicts in
south Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said his government, who came to power after
defeating the Labor party in the general elections in May 1996,
had been "working hard" to pursue a "real peace," citing the
signing of the Hebron agreement in January 1997, and the adoption
of the U.N. Resolution 425 by his inner cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel adopted the resolution, which demands
unilateral and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon. But Israel conditioned its troop pullback on security
arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, saying Israel faces terrorism threats "at
every moment," reiterated the demand that the PNA step up its
efforts in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that the continued cooperation between
Israel and the United States was important for pushing forward
the peace process. He described the U.S. support of Israel was
"significant."
</P>
<P>
In their remarks, Gingrich and House minority leader Richard
Gephardt and Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House international
relations committee, all reiterated their support for Israel,
saying that a real peace "must be based on security."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress delegation arrived here Saturday for a
four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Pardons Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei
Sunday announced to pardon or commute prison terms of a group of
prisoners sentenced by military courts.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
amnesty was announced to mark the recapture of Khorramshahr, a
port city in southwestern Iran, from Iraqi forces in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The leader pardoned those sentenced to two years or less in
prison for crimes committed before March 1991.
</P>
<P>
For other prisoners, prison terms of one year were commuted to
four months, those over one year to half of the terms, and life
imprisonment to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will not include those found guilty of sabotaging
the security of the country and of espionage, armed robbery,
kidnaping, arms theft, drug addiction and smuggling, graft and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty was proposed by head of the judiciary Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, IRNA added.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Demand Permission to Fly to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The hijackers of the Fokker plane
owned by Pakistan International Airline (PIA) have demanded that
the authorities provide more fuel to the plane and allow it to fly
to New Delhi, informed sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There were four hijackers and they have demanded more fuel and
be allowed to fly to New Delhi. Otherwise they will explode the
plane," said the sources by telephone in Hyderabad, where the
hijacked aircraft was forced to land by the Pakistani Airforce
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hyderabad is around 100 km northeast of Karachi, Pakistan's
biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The sources said local police and military commandos had
surrounded the plane at the Hyderabad airport and a state of
emergency has been in force at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are still negotiating with the hijackers at the
Hyderabad airport, trying to persuade them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
The PK-554 plane with 38 people including four crew members
aboard, which was heading for Karachi, was hijacked at around 6:30
p.m. (local time) Sunday, 15 minutes after take-off from Gwadar, a
coastal town in the southwestern Balochistan province.
</P>
<P>
Security officials at the Karachi airport said the aircraft
lost its contact with the airport just two minutes before landing.
</P>
<P>
It is the first plane-hijacking incident in the past several
years in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had asked the captain to fly to India but they
were told there was no sufficient fuel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier unconfirmed reports indicated that at least one of the
hijackers is a student belonging to a local nationalist
organization based in Balochistan which opposes any nuclear test
within the province.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- By beating Malaysia 3-2 and
retaining the title, badminton powerhouse Indonesia made history
in the sport when it won the prestigious Thomas Cup trophy for a
record eleventh time, at the 20th Thomas Cup Badminton Finals here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The strong and experienced Indonesians had virtually won the
final after reaching an unscalable 3-1 lead over five-time winners
Malaysia, prior to the last match, a singles.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia brought about a flying start earlier Sunday evening
when the team's world number six and this year's All England Open
runner-up Ong Ewe Hock beat seventh-ranked Indonesian Heryanto
Arbi 18-14, 15-7, in the opening singles.
</P>
<P>
A former world champion, Arbi, 26, had his right leg injured
during the earlier group competitions here. He had won five out of
the seven previous meetings with the Malaysian.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia leveled the team score 1-1 by taking the following
doubles. Olympic champions and world number two duet Rickey
Subagja and Rexy Mainaky won over world's top-ranked Malaysians
and Olympic silver-medalists Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock 15-3,
18-15 in an hour-long doubles.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 12th-ranked H. Hendrawan, semi-finalist at this
year's All England Open, brought his team one point ahead again
after he won over Malaysia' 16th-ranked Yong Hock Kin 18-14,
10-15, 15-5 in see-sawed singles in one hour and nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
And last year's world champions and World Grand Prix Finals
winners Candra Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit from Indonesia brought
about an unbeatable 3-1 lead and a virtual win for Indonesia, with
an easy 15-11, 15-12 victory over 14th-ranked Malaysians Lee Wan
Wah and Choong Tan Fook in the decisive rubber, the second
doubles.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Joko Suprianto, 32, lost to 29th-ranked Malaysian
Roslin Hashim 10-15, 15-11, 2-15 in the final singles match.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Offer Projects to International Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran will offer 20 oil and gas
projects to international tenders on buyback basis in a bid to
attract foreign investment, the Kayhan International daily
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
International Relations Director of the National Iranian Oil
Company Hojatollah Ghanimifard said the company would announce the
conditions on the bidding and details of the projects in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a pipeline to carry crude oil to
refineries in Tehran and Tabriz, capital of Eastern Azerbaijan
Province, from the Caspian Sea port Neka in the northern province
of Mazadaran, according to the English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
Contractors are required to "build, operate, transfer" the
392-kilometer pipeline in exchange for Iranian crude in the
Persian Gulf, Ghanimifard said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to United States embargo against Iran, he stressed
that the recent U.S. decision to waive sanctions against French,
Russian and Malaysian firms has proved the futility of
Washington's move.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. adopted the D'Amato Law in 1996 to punish any company
that invests 40 million U.S. dollars in the energy sector of Iran
and Libya. The ceiling was reduced to 20 million dollars last
August.
</P>
<P>
It was the U.S. companies that suffered from the law because
they have been denied a lucrative market, Ghanimifard said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that this time around the U.S. companies, like
other foreign companies, are allowed to participate in Iran's
energy projects.

<P>
DAMASCUS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met here Sunday with spiritual leader and founder of the
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
el-Shara, the Arab Syrian News Agency reported. But no further
detail was released.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam held talks with
Yassin Saturday on Israel's expansionist policy, its rejection of
the U.N. resolutions as well as the resultant suffering of the
Palestinian people, and the deadlock of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed Palestinian unity and ways of preventing
any potential infighting the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yassin expressed his appreciation of Syria's policy, its
steadfastness, and the leading role played by Assad in the defense
of Arab rights and strengthening the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"Syria and Hamas are in the same trench against the Israeli
expansionist policy," Yassin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader also said that "the Palestine issue is the
responsibility of all Arabs and Muslims and no one could give it
up."
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist usurpers," he added, "are chasing us in order to
undermine us rights, while we are continuing our resistance in
defense of our legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
"We are armed with faith in our rights and future, which is a
more mighty weapon than their weapons and repressive measures,"
Yassin said.
</P>
<P>
"Surrender is totally rejected," he underlined, pointing out
that "if the Israelis consider the national resistance for the
liberation of land and restoration of legitimate rights terrorism,
we are the terrorists who do not want to change our names, nor the
mission we are struggle for."

<HEADLINE> Berger Defends Decision on Satellite Launch with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said here Sunday that the administration has made the
best decision to allow American commercial satellite to be
launched atop Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
He said on CBS's "Face the Nation" that the granting of waivers
for satellite cooperation with China goes back to the
administrations of Presidents Ronald Region and George Bush, and
there were no political considerations behind it.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton came under criticism last week for
permitting Loral Space &AMP; Communications last February to cooperate
with the Chinese in satellite launching, which was allegedly
influenced by donation and led to technology transfer to China.
</P>
<P>
"Political considerations had nothing whatsoever to do with the
decisions made," Berger said. "We made the best decision that we
knew how in the national interest."
</P>
<P>
The Republican-led Congress has vowed to conduct inquires of
the allegations and called on the president to postpone his trip
to China scheduled for June. The House of Representatives even
went farther to ban satellite and sensitive technology sales to
China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bernard Schwartz, chief executive of Loral Space &AMP;
Communications, said on ABC's "This Week with Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts" that he never tried to influence with political
donations the administration's position on its satellites.
</P>
<P>
"That's just untrue. There's no foundation to that at all....
I've never sought favor, nor gotten favor," said Schwartz, who was
said to have donated 1.3 million U.S. dollars to the Democratic
National Committee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He denied that missile guidance technology was leaked to the
Chinese in satellite launches with the Chinese. "The satellite
itself, while in China, was under the control of the U.S.
government and U.S. citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a 200-page report on a launch failure in 1996, the
chief executive said that the insurance companies asked for an
independent assessment of what went wrong and "we were asked by
Intelsat and by the insurance companies to look at that."
</P>
<P>
"We sent people over there to do so. We did it under the
imprimatur of Intelsat, not China, and all we did was look at
their report and say that the report, with respect to what went
wrong was accurate," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government asserted that rules were in place to
protect American technology. Schwarts said that his company was
subject to the rules and in compliance all the way through.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in two days that Schwarts denied the
charges against him and his company. He conducted a lengthy
interview with The New York Times Saturday, rebutting the rampant
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"If the implication is that I would take a stand that was

<HEADLINE> One Crew Member Freed, Negotiations on With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One crew member was released
Sunday evening by hijackers of the Fokker plane owned by Pakistan
International Airline (PIA), as they were demanding more fuel and
permission to fly to India, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The crew member was freed by the five armed hijackers to
deliver their demands to the local aviation authorities at the
Pakistani city of Hyderabad, where the plane carrying 38 people
including four crew members was forced to land, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said negotiations with the hijackers were in
progress while local police and military commandos had surrounded
the plane and sealed off the airport of Hyderabad, which lies
around 100 km northeast of Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The PK-554 plane, which was heading for Karachi, was hijacked
at around 6:30 p.m. (local time) Sunday, 15 minutes after take-off
from Gwadar, a coastal town in the southwestern Balochistan
province.
</P>
<P>
It is the first plane-hijacking incident in the past several
years in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers "have demanded more fuel and be allowed to fly to
New Delhi. Otherwise they will explode the plane," said the
sources by telephone in Hyderabad, earlier Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had first reportedly asked the captain to fly to
India but they were told there was no sufficient fuel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier unconfirmed reports have indicated that at least one of
the hijackers is a student belonging to a local nationalist
organization based in Balochistan which opposes any nuclear test
within the province.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers have not been officially identified yet.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, China Ink Accord to Set up Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and China signed an agreement
on Sunday to set up a joint venture to lay down the infrastructure
for Egypt's first special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Egypt's Misr Bank, the National
Investment Bank of Egypt, the Arab Contractors Corporation and the
Suez Canal Authority and the Tianjin Economic and Technological
Development Area Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the envisaged Egyptian-Chinese
Joint Venture Company for Investment has a capital of 70 million
U.S. dollars, which are divided into 7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The four Egyptian firms will control 90 percent of the shares,
while the Chinese company controls the rest.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will be responsible for developing the
infrastructure of a zone two square kilometers in size in the
northwest of the Gulf of Suez area, Xia Baocai, vice director of
the Chinese company told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the joint venture will expand the strip into a
19.4-square-kilometer stretch, where the Chinese experience will
be well used in building a special economic zone, Xia said.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Egyptian Minister of Trade and
Supply Ahmed Gowaili expressed gratitude to China's aid in setting
up Egypt's first special economic zone, saying the project will
promote the bilateral relations to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on the issue was signed during a
visit to China last year by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Cement Output Reaches 20 Million Tonnes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's annual cement production has
reached 20 million tonnes from 6.2 million tonnes before the first
five-year economic development plan (1989-1994), Industries
Minister Gholamreza Shafeie announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of a cement factory in the western
province of Ilam, Shafeie said the construction of 13 cement
factories over the past 10 years have led to a balance in the
domestic cement markets, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ilam cement factory, with an annual production capacity of
600,000 tonnes, was built with an investment of 131 billion rials
(about 43.67 million U.S. dollars), including 33.61 million
dollars in hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Iran produced 19.5 million tonnes of
cement during the past Iranian calendar year (ended March 20)
while the country's domestic consumption stood at about 18.5
million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
With the inauguration of several new cement factories, Iran's
annual cement production will reach 23 million tonnes by the end
of this Iranian calendar year.

<HEADLINE> French Delegation Head Says Iraqis in Misery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Head of a French medical delegation
said on Sunday that the Iraqi people are leading a miserable life
due to deteriorating health caused by the United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iraqi News Agency, Patrique Le Brave expressed
concern for the prolongation of sanctions and the resultant
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program falls short of meeting Iraqi
people's needs due to the continuing sanctions, Le Brave said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions
on Iraq, banning export of oil, its main revenue earner, in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program coming into force in December 1996 is
an exception of the sanctions, which allows Iraq to sell a limited
amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Le Brave said the visit of the French medical delegation to
Iraq, the 10th since 1990, was an expression of solidarity with
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has discussed with Iraqi officials means of
enhancing bilateral relations in a way that would help strengthen
France's position on the lifting of the sanctions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Marks Capture of East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 Israeli soldiers
joined thousands of students and civilians Sunday in a march here
to mark the 31st anniversary of Israel's capture of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Participants waved Israeli national flags and chanted slogans
during the three-hour march while fighter planes flew in
formations in the sky.
</P>
<P>
There was a heavy presence of Israeli police and soldiers
along the main streets. Officials estimated that about 20,000
people took part in the march, the main part of activities marking
what Israelis call the Jerusalem Day.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem on June 7, 1967, the final day
of the Six-Day War. The anniversary falls this year on Sunday
because it is commemorated according to the Hebrew calendar.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's military parade, the biggest since 1973, is also part
of a wider celebration to mark Israel's 50th anniversary as a
state.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony held in the Herzl Mount to pay tribute to the
Israeli soldiers who died in the 1967 war, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Jerusalem would be under permanent control of
Israel and the Jerusalem Day would be celebrated forever.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert called for a "reconciliation" among
Jewish, Arab, Christian and all other residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
No issue is more volatile than the status of Jerusalem. Israel
regards all of Jerusalem as its "united, eternal capital" while
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
United States House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was leading a
50-member delegation of U.S. congressmen on a visit to Israel, had
canceled a planned visit to the proposed site of U.S. embassy in
Jerusalem, under pressure from the Palestinian National Authority
and the U.S. administration.

Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over territorial disputes and

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Reform Police, Justice Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Both the majority and opposition
parties of the Belgian parliament agreed Sunday to start reforming
the country's police and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
The demand for reform, triggered by the dramatic escape attempt
by child rapist and killer Marc Dutroux, was thoroughly discussed
at parliamentary sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian legislators agreed to break the country's police
force into a federal unit and a local unit.
</P>
<P>
The federal police force is consisted of a judicial police
under the command of the country's federal prosecution and an
administrative police in charge of public security and order.
</P>
<P>
The local police force, to be formed by joining the existing
communal police and the territorial brigade of the country's
gendarmerie, will be commanded by provincial and municipal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians also agreed to create a federal
prosecution to be in charge of territorial and national affairs.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the federal prosecution was especially inspired
by the investigation of the abortive escape of Dutroux in that
dysfunction had been spotted from within several of the existing
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecution will also be responsible for the fight
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene told the press Sunday
that the agreement on police and justice reforms demonstrated a
signal that the politicians of the country are capable of
attacking problems, of working out solutions and of reaching
consensus at crucial moments.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister described the reforms as an institutional
one with great importance.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux, the country's convicted child rapist and killer, broke
loose prior to a pre-trial hearing last month and ran wild for
some three and a half hours before being recaptured.
</P>
<P>
The man was charged with abducting six children and killing
four of them when a nationwide child sex ring was exposed to shock
Belgium in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
The attempted escape has caused the country's interior and
justice ministers and the commander of the country's police force
to resign.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Use Family Planning Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian experts have called for the
increased use of family planning methods in the West African
country, which boasts the largest population in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They voiced their worry over Nigeria's growing population at a
workshop on fertility management Saturday in Benin City, Edo
State, in southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A communique of the workshop warned that with the current 3.3
percent annual growth rate, Nigeria's 100-120 million population
is likely to double by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
Participants said only about four percent Nigerians are using
family planning methods, far less than the 20 percentage points
recommended by experts.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the 20 percent level set for the year
2000, the participants called for more efforts to promote the
awareness and use of family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
Experts also hope that the use of family planning methods
could help prevent defective child births before marriage, space
child births, prevent unwanted pregnancies as well as prevent
sexually transmitted diseases (STDS).
</P>
<P>
The workshop identified cultural and religious beliefs,
ignorance on proper use, consequences of improper use as well as
complications arising from use as major factors responsible for
the low acceptance rate of family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop was attended by medical practitioners,
sociologists, experts from universities as well as
representatives of non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was organized by Women's Health and Action Center, a
non-governmental organization based in Benin City.

BAGHDAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab Geologists said on Sunday that
the Arab nation is in dire need of healing the rifts and burying
past differences as a step toward achieving the aspired Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Supreme Council of Arab
Geologists Union at the conclusion of a three-day meeting here,
the participants called for Arab leaders to work side by side and
start a new era of relations based on good understanding.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the Arab leaders to work seriously for the
lifting of sanctions against Iraq, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The statement necessitated a serious action to face up to the
international conspiratorial schemes targeting Arab oil and
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Arab countries to face the real and vicious aims
of "the so-called new international order," stressing that the
plots in fact targeted all Arab countries without exception.
</P>

DAR ES SALAAM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Cashewnut
Farmers Cooperative Union has denounced that the Tanzania
Cashewnut Development Fund (TCDF) should be represented by all
parties concerned in the cashewnut industry.
</P>
<P>
The denouncement was made at the weekend during the third
general meeting of the union in southwest Tanzania's Lindi
Region, Shihata reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting noted with concern that the TCDF
runs presently like a private agency instead of safeguarding the
interest of the farmers and businessmen dealing with the
cashewnut, one of the African country's major agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the TCDF has been keen on winning its own
popularity while neglecting the problems encountered by cashewnut
farmers, the news agency said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The participants have also proposed that expenditure of the
cashewnut fund should be immediately stopped until its accounts
are audited with a report made known to the public.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed by members of the meeting that by December
members had contributed a total of 1.3 billion shillings (about
two million US dollars) to TCDF but so far no report on the
expenditure of the fund has been released.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani troops have taken full
control of the airport at Hyderabad, where a hijacked Pakistan
International Airline (PIA) plane had been forced to land, a PIA
spokesman said in Karachi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The army personnel were closely watching the situation at the
Hyderabad airport, PIA spokesman Kaleem Malik told reporters.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official briefing since the hijacking of the
Fokker aircraft Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Malik said the local authorities had given more time to the
hijackers in hopes that the passengers and crew members on board
would be released safely.
</P>
<P>
According to the PIA spokesman, one engineer had been sent to
the plane to provide water and food to the passengers. All
arrangements have been made for the safety of the passengers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Malik said there are 38 people on board, including 29
passengers, six crew members and three armed hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had said there were four armed hijackers and
four crew members.
</P>
<P>
PIA Chairman Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has confirmed that the
hijackers were carrying with them pistols and some bags which,
they claimed, contained explosive materials.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the local authorities and the hijackers
are still in progress.
</P>
<P>
One crew member was released by the hijackers to deliver their
demands to the local aviation authorities at Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers are demanding more fuel and permission to fly to
neighboring India, or they will explode the plane, sources from
Hyderabad told Xinhua by telephone.
</P>
<P>
While the negotiations with the hijackers are under way, local
police and military commandos have surrounded the plane and sealed
off the Hyderabad airport.
</P>
<P>
Hyderabad, a central town of Pakistan's Sindh province, lies
about 100 kilometers northeast of the port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The PK-554 plane, which was heading for Karachi, was hijacked

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Urges for Peace, Stability in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia underlined Sunday the
importance of consolidating peace, security and stability and
achieving development in the Africa continent.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on the 35th
anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) said that the organization is "a symbol of solidarity among
the peoples of the continent and the unity of their destiny."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU is a distinctive, collective mechanism for achieving
peace, development, stability, and cooperation, the main targets
of the OAU since its foundation," the statement was quoted by the
Tunisia-Africa News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
To attain these goals requires more peace efforts to reach
appropriate solution for regional disputes in Africa, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the African nations have to depend on themselves to
achieve progress, the international community, particularly the
industrialized countries, still has a historic responsibility for
supporting the efforts of the countries of the continent," the
statement underlined.
</P>
<P>
The international community must consider the continent as an
effective partner in international economic activities, it added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was founded on May 25, 1963, a date which was marked as
a day for the liberation of Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Iran agreed on Sunday to keep contacts on bilateral issues,
their disputes over three Gulf islands in particular.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached in a meeting between UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamdan
Ben-Zayed told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides highlighted their historical relations based on
friendship and common interests, Sheikh Hamdan said.
</P>
<P>
Zayed and Kharrazi reiterated their continuous keenness on
strengthening the principle of neighborliness, and maintaining
security and stability in the sensitive Gulf region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi arrived here Saturday on a two-day visit, which is
believed to be part of Iran's efforts to improve relations with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and Hamdan agreed during their meeting that no
development and progress in the region is attainable without
regional peace, security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit is also a response to UAE's call for holding
dialogs on the islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs
near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a main obstacle to the
normalization of their relations.
</P>
<P>
The UAE insists on international arbitration while Iran wants
the dispute resolved through bilateral talks.

<HEADLINE> New Potato Plants Resistant to Blight Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at International
Potato Center in Lima have bred three new, blight-resistant
strains that even can withstand the soggy Peruvian El Nino season,
The Washington Post reported here monday.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, scientists warned that a dread plant disease
called "late Blight"--the fungus that caused the Irish potato
famine of the 1840s -- had returned in a form resistant to
standard fungicides, cutting global spud production by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three new strains, produced after numerous
cross-breeding experiments to find those plants with the most
resistance genes, is being distributed to growers in the areas for
which it is best suited: one to Africa and other regions:one
adapted to the mountainous Andes area; and one for tropical
countries in general.
</P>
<P>
Today potatoes rank behind only rice, wheat and corn in
importance as a staple food crop around the world.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Considering Revised U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Monday denied reports
that it was considering a revised United States proposal to
combine the two stages of further Israeli redeployment into a 15
percent withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said that no such subject
was discussed at a meeting of the security cabinet late Sunday
night, Israel army radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his trip to
China for several hours Sunday night to chair a meeting of the
security cabinet, which also includes Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly discussed U.S. ideas on Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank aimed at reviving the Middle East peace process
which has been in dormant for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The revised U.S. proposal, local reports said, calls on Israel
to withdraw from 11 percent of the West Bank over three months and
hand over another 4 percent to the Palestinians no later than the
beginning of the final status talks, which was mandated by the
Oslo Accords for next May.
</P>
<P>
Naveh denied the topic was ever raised during the meeting. In a
similar reaction, Science Minister Michael Eitan said that if the
U.S. had put forward such a proposal, Netanyahu would not have
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeatedly resisted U.S. pressure to accept its
proposal on a 13.1 percent withdrawal, citing Israeli security
needs. Any pullback from more than 9 percent would endanger the
Jewish state's security, Netanyahu insisted.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky on Monday criticized the U.S. for violating the
Hebron Accord, under which the U.S. has pledged not to take a
stand regarding the scope of the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned
during the day that unless a solution is found to the impasse in
the peace process, "something will blow up."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a visiting U.S. congressional delegation led by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Weizman said that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat has not done enough to fight terrorism, but he has
taken "some steps" in this regard.

CHANGCHUN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, in a
visit to Jilin Province May 21-24, said that local governments
should be unified in their thinking, and be confident and make an
effort to restructure the country's grain marketing system.

The reforms are aimed at protecting grain production and
farmers' initiatives on grain production, he said, during talks
with leaders of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces in
Changchun, Jilin's capital.
</P>
<P>
Wen emphasized the importance of state-owned grain companies
selling grain at prices based on cost and minimum profits to avoid
any new losses.
</P>
<P>
It is the state's policy to purchase surplus grain from farmers
at protective prices without any restrictions, he said, and
purchase funds must be guaranteed through effective measures.

GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's triple Olympic champion
Michelle de Bruin may receive a life ban after the sport's world

</P>

FINA said in a statement that a second test on a urine sample

The case will immediately be submitted to the FINA Doping Panel

If the panel confirms the findings, De Bruin could be banned

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Speaks About Grain Marketing Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji, during a visit to
Anhui Province from May 21 to 25, said that the present
restructuring of China's grain marketing system will be carried
out to the end.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should study the State Council's recent grain
marketing reform decision and related documents and follow it to
the letter, the Chinese leader said during a visit to state-owned
grain companies and grain mills.
</P>
<P>
During talks with local government officials and grain company
employees, Zhu said that the key now is to accelerate the
restructuring process in government-owned grain companies by
changing their mode of operation and improving their market
viability.
</P>
<P>
Because the summer harvest is approaching, he said, local grain
departments need to purchase farmers' surplus grain at
government-set protective prices, without any reservation, because
this is the only way to protect farmers' desire to produce grain
and stable growth in production.
</P>
<P>
He asked grain companies to improve their services and said
they cannot refuse to purchase the grain sold by farmers and they
cannot levy charges on farmers, other than the usual taxes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Speaks About Grain Marketing Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the country's grain market is not open to private
businesses and that only state-owned grain companies can purchase
grain from the countryside directly.
</P>
<P>
State grain firms have to sell the grain at a price that is
based on purchase prices, a reasonable charge, and minimum profit
to avoid any new losses and to cover previous losses.
</P>
<P>
The failure to follow the central government's grain purchase
policies and selling grain below state cost are the two main
reasons for the current low grain prices in local markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments need to penalize government grain firms that
are losing big money by selling grain at lower prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Agricultural Development Bank, one of the three
state policy banks, to guarantee money for grain purchase
companies, which must pay back principle and interest, after they
sell the grain.
</P>
<P>
He criticised local governments that forced state grain firms
to hand over large amounts of profit, calling it "extremely
wrong", and emphasized that state grain companies do not need to
hand over any of their profits.

<HEADLINE> After Thomas Cup, Uber Cup Badminton Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- With the curtain fallen for the
10-day Thomas Cup and Uber Cup Badminton Finals in Hong Kong, the
sport of badminton has come to face a new structure with a fresh
four-fold rivalry coming into being. And the world has been all
the more aware of the meaning of the word "swiftness".
</P>
<P>
Swift was world number one Ye Zhaoying in upsetting Indonesia's
world and Olympic champion and hot-favored Susi Susanti to pave
way for a successful Chinese comeback to the Uber Cup title. It
also offered Ye a happy revenge on her defeat to Susanti two years
ago at the very same venue.
</P>
<P>
Swift was Denmark's new world ace Peter Gade-Christensen, who
floored China's rising star and second-ranked Sun Jun to help
Denmark to the decisive 3-2 win over China in a Thomas Cup Group A
tie.
</P>
<P>
And all the more so were the Indonesians who edged such tough
opponents as Denmark, China and Malaysia for a record eleventh
Thomas Cup triumph.
</P>
<P>
21-year-old Gade-Christensen entertained the crowd in the
Elizabeth Stadium with his unique Western-style net play
accompanied by aggressive Asian-style smashes. He turned out the
only male Danish player unbeaten at the Hong Kong championships.
</P>
<P>
Speed was Ye's most reliable weapon in conquering her arch
rivals Susanti and South Korea's Kim Ji Hyun in the Uber Cup
competitions. With her traditional play of solid defense and
tricky drop shots, Ye gained an upper hand when she quickened the
pace with improved footwork.
</P>
<P>
"Ye was too fast. I failed to return well and had to play the
game her way," admitted Susanti.
</P>
<P>
It was true in the doubles as well, as in the case of the
winning Indonesians. Their Chinese, Danish and Malaysian
opponents all admitted not to be capable of keeping pace with the
swift Indonesians, who often trapped the opposite side in a
passive position and made the game go in favor of the Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Badminton-crazy Indonesia remains the world's most successful
power in the sport, with their fresh Thomas Cup win and
silver-medal show in Uber Cup event. Its prospect was however
threatened by an increasing gap in succession, although with their
doubles duets still shining over others.
</P>
<P>
With veterans as Joko Suprianto, 32, and 26-year-old Heryanto
Arbi of the men's team fading, new talents like Marleve Mainaky,
26, and female players like Cindana and Ellen Engelina, both 21,
are still unable to take over the helm. And rising star Mia
Audina, 18, has been suffering from multiple injuries.
</P>
<P>
With a full-strength Uber Cup team scoring a worthy win, China
have again proved their capability after their 1-2-3 triumph in
both women's singles and doubles at last year's world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Lack of capable doubles players crippled China's effort in the
Thomas Cup. The lessons from their defeat here and the rise of
new blood Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei may boost them back years later
to their former height in the men's team world championships.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will have to focus on women's singles and doubles,
men's singles and mixed doubles when they take on other teams at
the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Instructed by Denmark's former world champion Morten Frost,
Malaysia have risen to a new world-class height, with such killer
players as Roslin Hashim for the singles and rising duet Choong
Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah.
</P>
<P>
Denmark would have become the first ever European winners in
Thomas Cup Finals, but for being affected by injured world
champion Peter Rasmussen and aging Olympic champion Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen. Gade-Christensen, as one of the most impressive
players out of the Hong Kong tournament, will surely be the one to
watch in the Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Regrets Accepting Nazi Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has
expressed "profound regret" that it unintentionally bought gold stolen
by Nazi Germany from Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
"The national bank regrets most profoundly that in accepting
gold deliveries from the (German) Reichsbank it may unwittingly
also have acquired gold derived from victims of concentration
camps," the SNB said in a statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss central bank said it considered it
unnecessary to make more amends for its wartime role.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, in a report by an independent panel of
historians investigating the Holocaust gold, the SNB was accused
of making no effort to stop dealing in Holocaust gold.
</P>
<P>
The panel, appointed by the Swiss government, confirmed that
the SNB bought gold worth 280 million U.S. dollars at wartime
prices from the Reichsbank, Hitler's central bank, and handled
further shipments to other banks.
</P>
<P>
The gold which the SNB bought was reportedly worth more than
2.5 billion dollars today.

<HEADLINE> Panel Report Confirms Switzerland to Be Biggest  Nazi Gold Buyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A new report on Switzerland's gold
dealings with Nazi Germany has confirmed that the figures given by
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) after World War Two were accurate.
</P>
<P>
The report released Monday seems to confirm previous findings:
Switzerland was the biggest buyer of gold from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
the SNB bought gold worth 280 million U.S. dollars at wartime
prices from the Reichsbank, Hitler's central bank, and handled
further shipments to other banks, said the report. Swiss
commercial banks took over 60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to say how much of it was looted by the
Nazis," said the report by a panel of international historians
appointed by the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
"One surprising element from the new report is that Swiss
insurance companies wanted Nazi Germany to repay debts with gold,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It's believed the amount of money involved runs up to nine
million francs (at wartime prices)," said the report. "But the
Swiss government in February 1945 apparently refused to allow the
deal to go ahead."
</P>
<P>
The gold is said to be worth billions of U.S. dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SNB has expressed "profound regret" that it
unintentionally bought gold stolen by Nazi Germany from Holocaust
victims in a statement released on the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss central bank said that it considered it
unnecessary to make more amends for its wartime role.

<HEADLINE> After El-Nino Rains, Rats Create More Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- After El-Nino rains, flocks of
rats are attacking Somalis in the Lower Shabelle Region, creating
more refugees.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families are taking refuge from 15 villages
around the river Shabelle for those hungry rats.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Muhidin Igalle Indhos, a farm owner, said
that the influx of the rats are beyond the imaginable
number.
</P>
<P>
Indhos said that the rats are especially attacking the maize,
sesame and sorghum usually cultivated by the small farm owners.
</P>
<P>
According to the villagers, the rats jump from one of the
sesame trees to another and from a maize tree to the next,
leaving no single seed on the trees.
</P>
<P>
The largest village, Baladdul Amin, inhabited by more than
2,000 families, is among the worst affected area.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the capital, four villages are
almost deserted just for the rats, while the villagers of other
three villages are also on the brink of moving.
</P>
<P>
The refugees sought for food in Dafed district, 90 km south of
Mogadishu or to the capital itself where they may find either a
refugee camp or start begging in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Manual sowing of the seeds in the farms has become impossible
as the rats immediately exhume them and eat.
</P>
<P>
Then the people resorted to using expensive tractors for
sowing the new seeds which did not work for long.
</P>
<P>
The tractors take 48,000 Somali Shilling (some five U.S.
Dollars) per hour, a sum most of the farmers can not afford.
</P>
<P>
Villagers are expressing deep concern for serious food
shortage in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
"It was floods last year, now rats and we don't know what
follows next," pleaded Abdulle Gonfo, one of the elders of
Baladdul Amin.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of the rat-created refugees have moved toward the
Kalagaddonka area, 60 km south of Mogadishu, for fishing.
</P>
<P>
It is not only rats and rains that are creating the economical
hazards to the poor farmers of Somalia, the farms of middle
Shabelle Region are also complaining about locusts that attacked
their peanuts and beans.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The blazing sun continued to
torment the western and southern regions of India Monday,
claiming 56 more lives and pushing the toll to at least 156,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The northwest desert state of Rajasthan, which accounted for 63
deaths, remained the hottest state in the country with the maximum
temperature of 49 degrees Centigrade in some places for the third
successive day Monday.
</P>
<P>
The blazing sun threw normal life out of gear in the northern
plains, with 33 deaths in Uttar Pradesh and one in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
In the capital New Delhi, temperature spiraled to a whopping 46
degrees Centigrade Monday and weather forecasts said the
temperature will remain so at least for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
The hottest temperature for the capital was recorded on May 29,
1944 -- 47.2 degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
As temperatures soared in more regions in the country, people
have been confined indoors, shops and business establishments
remained closed and roads presented a deserted look in most
states.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorological officers in most parts of the country have
predicted no respite in day temperatures with the heat wave
conditions likely to prevail for the next couple of days.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Reject Duty on Goods Imported Under ATT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia have
rejected a proposal by the Pakistani government to levy a 25
percent duty on the goods being imported under the Afghan Transit
Trade (ATT) scheme.
</P>
<P>
The News Network International quoted officials from the
finance and commerce ministries as saying that the Pakistani
government has recently taken up the issue of imposing duty on
goods being imported under ATT with the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government assured the Taliban that the duty
received from imported goods will be handed over to them. However,
the luring offer was flatly turned down by Taliban officials.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government proposed a 25 percent duty on ATT
goods to curb smuggling, as most of the goods imported under ATT
are being smuggled to Pakistan, an aspect hurting the local
industry, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the local industrialists, the Pakistani
government took up the matter with the Taliban, trying to resolve
the long-standing issue of smuggling from Afghanistan to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, this suggestion met with failure due to the pathetic
response of the Taliban, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They also said that Pakistan will persuade the Taliban militia
to impose duty on goods, which, they believe, is the only way of
curbing smuggling.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin hit
out Monday at newspaper publishers who meddle in the editorial
content of their titles and censor material.
</P>
<P>
He told the 47th General Assembly of the International Press
Institute (IPI) which opened at the Kremlin on Monday that private
ownership of the mass media was proving to be a "global problem."
</P>
<P>
Only a few publications in Russia still enjoyed genuine
independence, Yeltsin told the 765 IPI representatives of mass
media from 93 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
He went on to criticize mass media owners for "often acting as
the worst censors."
</P>
<P>
Warning against monopolization of the media, Yeltsin stressed
that the multipolar world needed diverse sources of information,
and called on reporters to carry out their duties responsibly.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of the meeting is "Russia -- Problems and
Prospects."
</P>
<P>
Other themes include the situation in the Russian press and
electronic mass media, problems of editorial independence, crimes
against journalists, and the situation in international journalism.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov and Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov are expected to give
their speeches to the forum.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Russia hosted the forum since the
first annual IPI assembly was held in 1951.
</P>
<P>
The IPI is a forum for editors-in-chief, publishers, and
leading journalists from more than 250 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and other SAR officials time and
again explained to the public the significance of the election.
</P>
<P>
During the registration drive from November 5 last year to
January 16 this year, 30,000 voter registration ambassadors,
mostly teenage students, made door-to-door visits across Hong Kong
to help those who are Hong Kong permanent residents and are 18
years old or above sign up as electors for the election.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office also gave a series of
briefings for major organizations to explain the registration
procedure and made thousands of telephone calls to urge all
eligible people to register as electors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government also organized month-long publicity
activities ranging from roving exhibitions, advertisements,
parades and carnivals to a string of forums for the candidates to
explain their views.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase transparency of the election and enable
the public to better understand the voting procedure, members of
the public were invited to a preview of two of the 496 polling
stations before they came into service Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government made specific stipulations and adopted
various measures for campaigning to ensure that the election was
conducted in a fair and honest way.
</P>
<P>
Candidates were required to obtain prior written authorization
for display of election advertisements and they could not publish
any false statement in oral or written way, relating to themselves
or to other candidates or lists of candidates. All corrupt
offenses and illegal practices would be punished.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts made the election process healthy, orderly
and smooth.
</P>
<P>
While going to polls Sunday, local residents expressed the hope
that the members of the first Legislative Council will live up to
Hong Kong people's expectations and make concerted efforts to
contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)
showed no signs of abating Monday as shares continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
Investors persisted with sell orders across the board and the
lack of institutional support drove the Karachi stock market to a
growing lower level. The KSE-100 Index breached the 1,200 barrier
as the major stocks continued to loss value.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index lost 49.01 points Monday to close at 1,156.81
points against last Friday's closing of 1,205.82 points. A total
of 59.78 million shares were traded Monday against the turnover of
77.43 million shares Last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi bourse had seen as much as 61 points down during
the day but recovered slightly on the back of short covering by
local speculators.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the weakness to persist in the market. A slight
technical correction may be seen, but the overall trend will
continue to be bearish.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshis Mark Centenary of National Poet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshis across the country
celebrated the birth centenary of the national poet, Kazi Nazrul
Islam, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Various programs, such as rallies, discussions and recitation
of verses by the poet, were held in the capital and elsewhere in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a year-long program Monday to celebrate the birth
centenary of the poet, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the poet
had inspired the whole nation through his fierce writings to fight
against hypocrisy, backwardness, communalism and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"He inspired the nation with the spirit of liberty to fight the
subjugation," she said.
</P>
<P>
The poems and songs by Nazrul still showed the path to the
people towards building a progressive and non-communal society and
inspire them to fight falsehood, injustice and backwardness, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Patriotism, love for the people, tolerance to other religions,
human values, spirit of non-communalism and eagerness to serve the
humanity were reflected in the writings of the poet, the prime
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the memories of the national poet, his residence in
the capital city had been turned into a museum, a Nazrul institute
was established, and a library was set up, she added.
</P>
<P>
Nazrul, who was born in 1898 and died in 1976, was an "immortal
name the history of Bengali literature and music," said an article
in the latest issue of Independent weekly.
</P>
<P>
He participated in the subcontinent's anti-communal struggle
for freedom, which raised him to the status of a "proverbial
hero," the article added.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Opposition Parties Call for Concerted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Angolan opposition
parties with no seats in parliament agreed here Monday that they
should ally all political forces and make concerted efforts in a
bid to build up peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ndongala Garcia, Leader of the Angolan National Unity Party,
said at the meeting of the opposition parties that elections
could not take place unless the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol is
fully implemented and mutual trust is increased among the Angolan
people.
</P>
<P>
Garcia noted that a broad and serious national discussion with
high transparency should help the peace process, despite the
complexity of the process.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than one hundred small opposition parties
should ally so as to play a bigger role in the country's
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders of the political parties stressed the importance
of the media in the Angolan peace process, saying that the just
and fair reporting can contribute to the national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Luis Pascoal, leader of the National Alliance of Democracy and
Progress, said that Angolans should not go on with their debates
over political issues.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos hold
talks with Jonas Savimbi, President of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), so as to resolve the
existing disputes between the government and the opposition
movement.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Alliance of Youth, Workers and Peasants said in a
statement recently that the deterioration in political and
military situation in the war-ravaged southern African country is
a major hindrance on the way of achieving final peace, calling on
all Angolan politicians to join hands to break the current
standstill for the sake of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
There has no progress in the peace process because the two
warring sides did not reach agreement on such issues as the
re-establishment of local governments in the areas formerly
controlled by UNITA and the transfer of the rebel headquarters to
Luanda, the capital of Angola.

<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with an economic and trade group from the Taiwan Council
for Industrial and Commercial Development today in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People, said that the Chinese mainland has always
favored economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits, and has worked hard for a common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The laws and regulations that are intended to encourage and
protect Taiwanese investment are now being improved, he said,
adding that a regulation on implementing the laws protecting
Taiwanese investments will be based on Taiwanese opinions.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the mainland will never try to obstruct
cross-straits economic exchanges and cooperation, and that the
policies of the Taiwan authorities, which repeatedly put obstacles
in the way of cross-straits economic cooperation and direct
postal, commercial, and transport links, ran counter to the times
and damaged the interests of people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the mainland will continue to follow Jiang
Zemin's Eight-Point Proposal and will welcome people from the
industrial and commercial sectors of Taiwan to invest in the
mainland. And no matter what happens, the mainland will protect
the rights and interests of Taiwan business people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Polish General Staff Chiefs Hold Talks In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May, 25 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, Chief of
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), told
his Polish counterpart General Henryk Szumski in their talks here
today that China is ready to further develop multi-level friendly
relations and cooperation with the Polish armed forces in a spirit
of mutual respect, equality, and benefit.
</P>
<P>
This is Szumski's first visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the people of China and Poland have a long and
traditional friendship and that relations between the two
countries have developed smoothly in recent years, with the
exchanges and cooperation in the political, economic and cultural
sectors increasing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski made a
state visit to China last November. He and his Chinese counterpart
Jiang Zemin had in-depth discussions on bilateral relations. The
two also signed the Sino-Polish Joint Communique, opening a new
chapter in the Sino-Polish relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that China values very much Szumski's visit to China
and that he believes it is significant for promoting mutual
understanding, increasing confidence, and developing friendship
and cooperation between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the PLA is subordinate to and serves the country's
economic development and it adheres to a policy of lean but mean
troops according to China's actual situation, carrying out the
strategic decision of cutting the armed forces by 500,000 within
three years as put forward by Party general secretary Jiang Zemin
in his report to the 15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Szumski described the reforms in the Polish armed forces and
said that the increased exchanges and visits to each other of
Polish and Chinese armed forces are significant for learning from
each other.

<HEADLINE> Samsung, Ford to Join Forces in Kia Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's leading car
manufacturer Samsung Motors Inc. and its American counterpart Ford
Motor Co. have agreed to join forces to restructure South Korea's
ailing automaker Kia Auto Co.
</P>
<P>
The two firms will make a strong effort to participate in
government programs in restructuring Kia although they failed to
agree on forming a joint venture, Lee Dae-won, vice-chairman of
the Samsung Group's auto arm, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ford is the largest shareholder in Kia, the third largest
automaker in South Korea, which is under court receivership after
going bankrupt last year.
</P>
<P>
Samsung conducted long negotiations with Ford on producing Ford
vehicles at Samsung's Pushan plant and building a partnership in
production, sales and financing in exchange for equity investment
from Ford.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations on establishing a joint venture broke down due
to different views on Seoul's economic prospects and local business
climate, including foreign exchange rates and market interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Samsung insisted the economy would return to normal within two
or three years, while Ford argued South Korea would need at least
five or six years for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Samsung and Ford have decided to postpone negotiations for the
establishment of a joint venture until late this year or early
next year," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said Samsung is seeking foreign business partners,
including Volvo of Sweden, to jointly cooperate in commercial
vehicle production.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Motors, which just put out its model SM5 Series earlier
this year and announced a sales target of 80,000 units in 1998,
has sold 16,200 units so far this year.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, Samsung plans to export 10,000
units of the SM5 Series to five countries -- Chile, Peru, China,
Turkey and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans Life Jail for Campus Cultists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will soon introduce a life
jail sentence without an option of fine for cult members in its
higher education institutions, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Mathew Afolayan, the Kwara State Commissioner for Information,
Youth, Sports and Culture, made the disclosure at the weekend in
Ilorin, the state capital city in west Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the remark at a press conference on the
theme of the Children's Day celebration,"cultism and the
Nigerian Children and the youths what hope for the future."
</P>
<P>
The official explained that if those cultists could be so
ruthless to kill some of their victims and maim others, such a
sentence would not be too stringent to apply.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the theme of the celebration was important
in view of the increasing vices among the children and youths in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The spread of secret cults in Nigeria's higher education
institutions has become not only a threat to the country's
education system, but also a major social problem.
</P>
<P>
To combat the vice, Afolayan disclosed that a nationwide
campaign would be soon launched in the 36 states of the
federation and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee announced Monday a series of proposals to encourage
scientific research in the country.
</P>
<P>
Awarding scientists here, Vajpayee declared that his government
would free scientific institutions of bureaucratic control, saying
that "administrators and government officials should be
facilitators and not masters of scientists."
</P>
<P>
Nine scientists were awarded of the 1997 Shanti Swarup
Bhatnagar Prizes, India's highest award in science, for their
outstanding contributions in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Prime Minister called for a radical change in
science administration and said scientists should be central to
all planning and operations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the society to accord greater recognition to highly
talented scientists and to use information technology as a
national campaign.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of making India an "Information Technology
superpower within the next 10 years," the government set up last
Saturday a task force on information technology and software,
which will draft a national policy on informatics and submit a
final report in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Proposals announced by Vajpayee included reversal of neglect of
the engineering sector, promotion of research and development in
the industry and creating a strong knowledge network of
universities, Indian Institutes of Technologies and the national

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Monday morning left here for Arusha, Tanzania to attend a two-day
donors conference on the development of the east African road
network.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni was
accompanied by Minister of Works, Housing and Communications,
John Nasasira.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Arusha, which opens Monday, will focus on a 4.6
billion-U.S.-Dollar plan to repair and restore roads washed out
by unprecedented El-Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, his Tanzanian counterpart
Benjamin Mkapa and their mainly Western donors are also expected
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The talks, called by the newly-founded East African
Cooperation (EAC) Secretariat linking the east African countries,
are co-sponsored with the European Union and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The regional road network is critical to the facilitation of
regional integration," the Nairobi-based Eastern African weekly
newspaper quoted an EAC statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The network involves five major road corridors with their
feeder links -- in all 6,605 km of paved roads and 8,668 km of
unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
The east African leaders had said the cost of repairs to the
heavily damaged roads would be so high as to threaten other
economic growth sectors.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that to enhance communication and boost
regional trade they must repair the damaged roads and build new

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets With Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the Chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee, in a meeting here
today with former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and
the president of the Japan-China Friendship Association Ikuo
Hirayama, said that China and Japan should not let the younger
generation forget the past, but be friendly to each other for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
The bitter experiences of the past, he said, referring to the
Japanese invasion of China in 1937, can serve as a guide for the
future -- if they are not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after the two Japanese guests attended a 3rd
anniversary ceremony of Nanjing's repaired city wall and visited
the Museum of the Nanjing Massacre Victims. Over 300,000 Chinese
were massacred by Japanese soldiers in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the two Japanese friends for their
contribution to the repair work on the Nanjing wall, saying that
it helped repair cultural relics and would help people understand
history and create a bright future for Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li referred to friendly contacts between the Chinese and
Japanese over the past 2,000 or more years, and said that the
Japanese militarist invasion of China caused heavy losses to the
Chinese, but it also caused bitter suffering for the Japanese
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that as China and Japan are important nations in Asia
and the world, the two should take the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty as an
opportunity to safeguard the principles set in the treaty and in
the China-Japan Joint Statement, and work for bilateral
good-neighborly cooperation oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Murayama said he felt happy to be invited to the Nanjing event
and that he hopes it will help repair cultural relics and help
younger Japanese remember the past.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply shocked by the barbarous killing of
Chinese by the Japanese, and that the past should be taken
seriously and history used as a mirror to make a positive effort
for a 21st-century Japan-China friendship and safeguard the peace
and stability in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
He spoke about a recent Japanese film, "Pride -- the Fateful
Moment", which gives a rosier view of Japanese aggression against
neighboring countries during World War II and of the wartime Prime
Minister Hideki Tojo, who was later executed as a war criminal,
and said that the film does not reflect Japanese government views
or the views of the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had made it clear in his official talks when he
was prime minister in 1995 that Japan admitted its external
aggression and the crimes of its colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
These talks represented the views of most Japanese, he went on
to say, and Japan should not, and will not repeat those actions.
</P>
<P>
Murayama is here as a guest of the China-Japan Friendship
Association.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu Province. The wall was built
from 1368 to 1386, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), but was
destroyed by Japanese troops, who killed some 300,000 Chinese in
December of 1937.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HKSAR First LegCo Election Open, Fair, Honest (1) </HEADLINE>

HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The curtain on the election of
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) fell Monday with 60 members returned
out of the 166 candidates through more than sixth months' efforts
by both the government and the people.
</P>
<P>
This is the first LegCo election since the HKSAR was
established last July and the whole process of the election is
generally deemed as open, fair and honest.
</P>
<P>
The elected LegCo members are broadly representative. They will
exercise powers and functions such as enacting laws and examining
and approving budgets introduced by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's election which lasted 15 hours from morning
till night, a record number of 1.49 million HK residents, or 53
percent of the 2.8 million registered voters, turned out to vote
at 496 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa described the active
participation by the Hong Kong people as a demonstration of "a
very strong support from the public" and "Hong Kong people's
determination and confidence in 'one country, two systems' -- Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth and successful running of the election,
the SAR government made careful preparations. It tried its best to
make election-related activities open to the public during the
different periods of drawing up the methods for the election,
voter registration and nomination of candidates.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition groups planned two private investigations into
the wealth of former President Suharto of Indonesia and his
powerful children within hours of his resignation on Thursday, the
groups' organizers said.
</P>
<P>
-- Americans worry about how they will afford their children's
college educations, but they are poorly informed about college
costs and how to pay them, according to a report to be released
Monday. It also said most Americans overestimated the average cost
of college and underestimated the amount of financial aid
available, and most said they did not know where it came from.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- One week before the Indian nuclear test caught the U.S.
intelligence community by surprise, CIA Director George J. Tenet
told his employees he believed the agency's espionage capabilities
had eroded since the Cold War and its analysts were depending too
much on Pentagon spy satellites, according to CIA officials who
heard the address.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets U.S. Trade Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator, Li Peng,
said today that Sino-U.S. relations have exhibited a momentum for
improvement and development since President Jiang Zemin's
U.S. trip last October.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, made the remark in a meeting with a trade-promotion
delegation led by Dick Chrysler, a former member of the U.S. House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Li said that U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit China soon,
and expressed his belief that an exchange of visits between top
leaders of the two countries will help promote the development of
Sino-U.S. relations in a stable and sound manner.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening-up
policy and his viewpoint on Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said that this is the first time for the delegation
members to visit China, and that they admire China's development
and its beautiful mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the delegation members will encourage Americans
to visit China after they go back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to have people-to-people friendly
exchanges. He said the fact that the delegation includes many
women shows that American women are willing to promote the
bilateral relationship, including Sino-U.S. economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed his appreciation for this.

<HEADLINE> Property Funds to Capitalize on Developments in Second-tier Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Brooke Hillier Parker (BHP), an
international property consultancy based in Hong Kong, will
establish a series of property funds to finance major developments
in China's second-tier cities.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be the first single purpose real estate
investment funds covering China. The first fund is expected to be
announced in July and will be marketed across the world, David
Faulkner, a BHP director, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The focus on second-tier locations, including special economic
zones such as Shenzhen and Xiamen and larger provincial capitals,
is in contrast with the traditional focus of developers on major
cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, where oversupply has led to
high vacancy levels and declining rental values, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Qingdao and Tianjin, which have successful development zones
and are well served by infrastructure; cities in the
Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which is the base for hi-tech and light
industries; the central Yangtze cities of Chengdu, Chongqing and
Wuhan which are to be the focus of new investment by the
government; and Shenzhen and Xiamen with their close links with
Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively, are the ones we will be
focusing on," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
He observed the targeted cities in China are attracting major
international companies which require high grade rental space and
this combined with rising local incomes will support retail and
leisure developments as well.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, battered by regional financial turmoil, many other
Asian property markets are expected to drop further this year and
a full recovery may take up five years in certain countries, he
pointed out, predicting recovery is likely to come soonest in
Singapore and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> UAE Briefs Gulf States on Iranian FM's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has sent its senior officials to some Arab Gulf states to brief
them on the recent visit to the UAE by Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, UAE's minister of state for
foreign affairs, left here Monday morning for the Qatari capital
of Doha, carrying a verbal message to Qatar's Emir Hamad Bin
Khalifa Al-Thani from UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan, the UAE news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Khalifa Shahin, director of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) and gulf affairs at the UAE Foreign Ministry, also
left Monday morning for Jeddah, carrying a letter from Sheikh
Hamdan to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the two messages deal with the outcome of
the recent visit to the UAE by Kharrazi. Further visits are
expected to be undertaken by UAE officials to other Gulf states
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi concluded his two-day visit to the UAE Sunday with the
aim of discussing the territorial dispute between the two
countries over the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and
the Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reportedly agreed to resolve the dispute
through peaceful means in a meeting between Kharrazi and the UAE
president. The two sides reached an agreement to restore the
situation in the Abu Musa island to what it had been before 1991.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Iran would pull out from one half of the island so
that the UAE may exercise its sovereignty in the implementation of
the accord signed in 1971. Iran had occupied that part as soon as
the accord expired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been locked in a dispute over ownership
of the three islands located on the edge of the Strait of Hormuz,
which Iran has taken control.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries were lowered to
the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest to Iran's full control of the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, Iran has insisted on solving its
dispute with the UAE through bilateral talks while the
UAE has called for an international arbitration over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese And Sri Lankan Foreign Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, in a meeting here today with Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar, said that China does not want to see a
nuclear weapons race in South Asia, because of the threat to peace,
stability, and development there.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that India's recent nuclear tests were strongly
condemned by the international community and that they will have
grave consequences in the regional and international
situation. More pressure should be brought to bear on India to get
it to abandon its nuclear weapons development program and join the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said that his country is really concerned about this
and that the Sri Lankan government's stance on the nuclear issue
has been consistent and that it urges a comprehensive nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the traditional friendship nurtured by China's
and Sri Lanka's earlier leaders has had very good development and
that there are neither long-standing issues nor real conflicts to
deal with, and that he is satisfied with the current relations. He
also extended thanks for Sri Lanka's support to China on human
rights and the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said that Sri Lanka attaches importance to its ties
with China and that the country wishes to further exchanges and
cooperation with China, expand cooperation areas with China, and
raise bilateral ties to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar is visiting China at the Foreign Minister's
invitation.

<HEADLINE> First PACS Local Mobile-Phone System Operational in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The world's first set of PACS, a
personal and local mobile-phone system, was put into operation in
this capital of central China's Hunan Province to mark the 30th
World Telecommunications Day, which fell on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The system was invented by Time Telecom Company of the United
States to meet market demand in China for digital mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders say PACS holds more users than common
mobile-phones in a per-unit area, which is especially useful in
largely populated cities.
</P>
<P>
It not only provides users a better tone quality and ensures
secret communications, but it also can be accessible for digital
transmission and multi-media applications.
</P>
<P>
The system, based on the honeycomb theory, greatly reduces the
launching power and reportedly does no harm to humans. Its cost is
only one-sixth of common mobile-phones, or less than local wire
phone systems.
</P>
<P>
Though a potential mobile-phone market, China still has a lot
of mobile-phone users confined to a fixed area, discounting the
functions of a honeycomb system. However, users are expected to
choose more economic and pragmatic systems.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company has agreed to develop this high technology in
China, and plans to establish an information industrial park to
integrate scientific research with manufacturing and marketing.

<HEADLINE> EU Ready to Help Further Peace in N.Ireland: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer on Monday expressed readiness of the 15-nation
European Union to help further the peace cause in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The European Commission warmly welcomes the majority vote in
favor of the Belfast Agreement in the referenda held in Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"As Northern Ireland seeks a better way forward, the European
Union stands ready to help further progress and support all groups
in society," said the president of the commission, the executive
body of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who just returned from the 1998 Expo in Lisbon, said
that the union had consistently supported the British and Irish
governments and the political leaders and people in Northern
Ireland and Ireland in their search for a stable and democratic
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this agreement," added Santer, "offers the best
basis for building a better life for future generations and the
European Union will continue to play its part in helping to
promote stability and opportunity as we have through various means
like the special support program for peace and reconciliation
since 1995 and our contribution to the reconciliation of peoples
who had been enemies for centuries."
</P>
<P>
The peace referendum held over the past weekend showed that
more than 70 percent of the protestants and upwards of 95 percent
of the catholics in Northern Ireland supported the peace agreement
reached in April among all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The peace appeal also received a massive yes vote in the
Republic of Ireland where almost 95 percent of the residents voted
for the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Construction Sector Profits Surge 54.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The construction sector of
Shanghai, China's largest economic and financial center, reaped
profits of nearly 1.3 billion yuan last year, a surge of 54.1
percent over the previous year, according to the latest official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's construction sector generated 56.43 billion yuan in
output value last year, up more than 25 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
As the construction sector expanded, the construction
enterprises have seen their assets rise and liabilities
fall. Official figures show that Shanghai's construction
enterprises had a combined asset value of 62.1 billion yuan by the
end of 1997, up 23.2 percent from a year ago. Of the total assets,
more than 60 percent were controlled by state-owned construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, Shanghai's large and medium-size
construction enterprises accounted for 53.4 percent of total
assets and 55.6 percent of total output value last year,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Shanghai's market opening has attracted many
construction enterprises from other parts of China and overseas,
urging local construction companies to make great efforts to tap
the market.

<HEADLINE> New Mayor Appointed to Sri Lanka's Northern Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A new Mayor has been appointed to
Sri Lanka's Northern provincial capital Jaffna to fill the post
which fell vacant following the assassination of its previous
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) which controls the
Jaffna Municipal Council has appointed the party's Legal Secretary
Ponnadurai Sivapalan to replace Sarojini Yogeswaran who was shot
dead in her home on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Yogeswaran was assassinated by gunmen of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) when she failed to respond to their threat
to vacate her position.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE which has been waging a 15-year war against government
forces for a separate state in the north and east, views
supporters of the main stream political parties particularly the
TULF as traitors to their cause.
</P>
<P>
Yogeswaran was the first mayor elected after 14 years to the
Jaffna Municipal Council which had during that period been under
rebel Tigers control.
</P>
<P>
The government held local elections in the Jaffna peninsula
this year after a 15-year break with a view to establishing civil
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, however, do not want the re-establishment of civil
administration in the peninsula which they consider their
territory. They have warned all politicians and officials holding
office in the North to vacate their posts or face consequences.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Prime Minister
Rafael Eitan Monday called on the ruling Likud Party and
opposition Labor Party to form a national unity government to
rescue the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Eitan said that the two
largest parties have the power to put the country on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
He added that if far-right wing parties or other parties want
to join the unity government, they are welcome.
</P>
<P>
However, in response to Eitan's appeal, Labor Party secretary
Raanan Cohen said there is no way that his party can join the
national unity government.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the objective of his party is to oust Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he said caused the collapse of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are
currently deadlocked over the scope of further redeployment of
Israel's troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly asked Netanyahu to carry out a 13
percent further withdrawal, while the far-right parties in the
Likud coalition have vowed to topple the government if Netanyahu
caves in to the American pressure.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Opposes U.S. Crisis Response Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has repeated its opposition
to the African crisis response initiative promoted by the U.S.,
saying that what Africa needs is support for its already existing
peace-keeping mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi made the remarks in a
lecture he delivered at the weekend in Kingston, Jamaica, where
he was paying an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that Africa already has a continental crisis
management and conflict resolution mechanism within the
Organization of African Unity (OAU). There is also the
sub-regional mechanism such as the West African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG. Hence, he said, the U.S. initiative is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi further said that African soldiers were sufficiently
trained and had distinguished themselves in several peacekeeping
operations in the world.
</P>
<P>
He cited the peaceful resolution of the Liberian civil war and
the reinstatement of the Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah as Africa's capability in crisis resolution.
</P>
<P>
"What Africa needs is the financial and logistics support to
enable the existing peacekeeping mechanisms function
effectively," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi called for strong ties between Nigeria and Caribbean
countries to foster the cause of the black race, according to
reports by Nigerian media.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministry Joins Internet For New Market Outlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies now have a new
place to display their goods -- Made-in-China -- a site on the
Internet that is linked to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation's web site at http://www.moftec.gov.cn,
according to MOFTEC's Vice-Minister Liu Shanzai
</P>
<P>
A dozen enterprises were already handing out information on
this web site in April while it was being tested.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Jianguo, deputy director of MOFTEC's China
International Electronic Commerce Center, a trade group in
Shandong Province earned 13 million U.S. dollars from two quick
deals done on the Internet. The electronic commerce age has
already arrived, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
It is especially valuable for medium-sized and small
businesses, because it's just like having salesmen all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
A chemical factory in Shandong saved eight million yuan
when it contacted an Italian raw materials source on the
Internet. In the past, it had to depend entirely on a Japanese
partner, a service it had to pay a lot more for. Businesses on the
Internet not only display their products there, but also negotiate
with other businesses in a negotiating room that has coded access
for security's sake.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC wants to turn the "Made-in-China" web market into
China's biggest marketing system on the net, so it established the
coded system.
</P>
<P>
It has a digital ID card that can be used by many enterprises,
Liu explains, and adds that it has formulated imports and other
trade procedures and ultimately will lead to EDA -- commercial
transactions without paper.

celebrations marking Sabena Airlines' 35 years of service here.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision quoted Museveni as saying that Uganda will
adopt the World Trade Organization regulations on customs
valuation that tax imports on the FOB (free on board) values
and not the CIF (cost, insurance and freight) values being used
by the Uganda Revenue Authority.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure all those in the air transport industry that we
shall soon implement the World Trade Organization rules on
customs valuation. I hope this will increase the volume and value
of imports by air substantially," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the freight element on goods transported by air
is very high and when included in the valuation it raises the tax
liability a lot.
</P>
<P>
The CIF is the basis of an export contract in which the seller
pays the cost of shipping or flying the goods to the port of
destination and of insuring the goods up to this point.
</P>
<P>
In FOB, the seller pays for sending the goods to the point of
shipment and loading them onto the ship or aircraft. The seller
also pays for the insurance up to this point. Thereafter,
transport and insurance charges are met by the buyer.
</P>
<P>
The value of Uganda's exports has increased by 70 percent and
that of imports rise by 21 percent over the last five years.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Starts Daily Air Quality Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen City Environmental
Protection Bureau today said that it will release daily
air-quality reports through local media as of today.
</P>
<P>
Next to Dalian, a seaport city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, Xiamen became the second city which reports its daily
air quality.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration started a
weekly report on the air quality of 13 key cities throughout
China, including Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The previous 62 weekly reports showed that the air quality in
Xiamen, a well-known scenic spot and a cultural center, remained
excellent, with an air pollution index (API) lower than 50.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Bureau will release the API to the
public on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
After knowing about the air quality in the city, local
residents have paid more attention to their environment. Some
Xiamen people even consider air quality as an important factor in
buying houses.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the bureau said the air quality report has
provided indispensable daily information for local residents.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities also can quickly respond to a negative change
in the air quality and effectively protect the environment,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Lower House Passes Four Financial Decrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives of
Thailand Monday afternoon passed the four controversial financial
decrees, which are part of the government's new measures to reform
the country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
All the four executive decrees gained 204 votes of support,
exceeding the required half of the parliament's 393 votes for
passing decrees.
</P>
<P>
The four decrees allow the government to raise the foreign debt
ceiling and issue up to 5 billion U.S. dollars in international
bonds; restructure debt obligations of the central bank's
financial institutions development fund (FIDF); amend the Bank of
Thailand Act, and change rules governing the asset management
corporation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 5 billion dollar international bonds, the
government also plans to issue 500 billion baht (12.8 billion
dollars) in domestic market to repay debts of the FIDF, which
spent about 700 billion baht (17.9 billion dollars) last year in a
failed attempt to rescue the debt-ridden financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The opposition denounced the decrees as an aid for the rich at
the expense of the poor. But Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said last Wednesday that the passage of the four
decrees is a matter of life and death for the nation.
</P>
<P>
The four decrees were submitted to the parliament last
Wednesday. After two days' debate and just before voting, the
opposition stunned the government with a last-minute motion,
asking the Constitutional Court to rule whether the decrees were
really necessary to solve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court called an urgent meeting of its 13
judges Saturday. After a four-hour session, President Chao Saichua
announced that the judges agreed unanimously that the decrees were
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The judges said that the decrees are necessary for the
maintenance of economic stability and that there was an urgent
need to issue them.
</P>
<P>
The four executive decrees are now presented to the Senate,
which is likely to pass them later Monday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Refugees in Guinea Face Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees
in southwest Guinea may soon be cut off from food supply unless a
relief effort is stepped up, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
has warned.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from Liberian capital Monrovia Friday,
the WFP said 200,000 Sierra Leoneans had sought refuge in Guinea
since early March and over 42,000 were in remote areas likely to
be made impassable by the rainy season over the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not able to move food during the next two to three
weeks, thousands of refugees will go hungry in July," said WFP
Regional Manager Paul Areas in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The WFP in a joint appeal with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called for at least 30
four-wheel drive trucks to transfer refugees to better camps and
to ensure the continued delivery of relief supplies to refugee
sites.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies are currently relying on 14 trucks operated
by the German GTZ Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have fled continued insecurity in parts of Sierra
Leone, where rebels close to the military junta ousted in
February are still active.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the opening of the parliament session Friday,
restored President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah deplored the atrocities
being committed by the rebels troops against civilians, including
the amputation of ears and limbs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebels, "not wanting Sierra Leone to exist as
a nation," were destroying the country's resources, including
mines, infrastructure and government buildings.

<HEADLINE> 26,000 Liberian Refugees Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 26,000 Liberians who fled
to Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire have returned home since last
December, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) has announced.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said in a statement Saturday in Abidjan that the
26,000 refugees returned to their country in convoys organized by
it, while thousands of others have returned spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, about 36 percent of the refugees
refused to join the UNHCR's convoys in January, whereas only one
percent refused now.
</P>
<P>
Initially, in Guinea, refugees were reluctant to return, but
repatriation convoys now take place on a weekly basis, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, however, regretted that donors had contributed only
4.35 million U.S. Dollars, compared with the 39 million U.S.
Dollars required.
</P>
<P>
It explained that two-thirds of this sum should help to
finance the rehabilitation programs in the fields of education,
health and program to generate funds for women and vulnerable
groups.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR estimated that before its repatriation operation
began, there were about 479,000 Liberians still in exile, in
Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fled Liberia during the seven years of its civil
war, which was brought to an end with the election of the Charles
Taylor government last July.

<HEADLINE> Australia Leads World in T-Ray Research: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers are leading
the world in developing a safe, new form of radiation, called
T-rays, which could replace potentially cancerous X-rays in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the University of Adelaide (a southern port city)
and the Royal Adelaide Hospital have teamed up with New York's
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to advance the use of TeraHertz
(THz) radiation, or T-rays, the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
T-rays could be used in medicine, agricultural science,
forensic science and food safety, eliminating the need for
dangerous X-rays in some fields.
</P>
<P>
University of Adelaide electrical and electronic engineering
department lecturer Derek Abbott said, T-ray research was a "hot
area", with scientists from Japan, China, Korea and Germany trying
to keep up with the Australians and Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We are the first people in Australia to deal with this
technology," said Abbott who leads the Adelaide team.
</P>
<P>
"It's still in the research area because it's so new. It does
take a while to get into commercial things. But it's not far off
... within the next five years," he was quoted by AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Abbott, T-rays were first generated in 1991 by
American scientists who developed a way to produce the radiation
using laser technology.
</P>
<P>
The THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies on the
border between microwaves and light (the opposite end of the
spectrum to X-rays), where it had been difficult to generate the
T-rays either electronically or thermally.
</P>
<P>
Now, T-rays are generated using lasers which pulse at a rate of
one thousand trillion pulses per second.
</P>
<P>
But T-ray images can take up to 10 minutes to produce using
current methods, so the Adelaide team's first aim is to develop
quicker, cheaper ways of generating the images.
</P>
<P>
T-rays are sensitive to moisture, so they could be used in
agriculture to detect the water flow within plants to help manage
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Dry, non-metallic materials such as plastics, paper and
cardboard are transparent to T-rays, so they could be used in the
quality control of packaged food.
</P>
<P>
Their ability to identify materials could see them harnessed in
forensic science.
</P>
<P>
In the medical field, T-ray imaging was limited to the surface
of the human body but could be used to estimate the depth of
burns, for corneal imaging, dental imaging or to detect early
warning signs of skin and scrotal cancer, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
"It's very sensitive to water, so you can't use T-rays to go
right through the body," he said. "So it won't totally replace
X-rays, but it's a big start to be able to replace X-rays at some
levels. The more you can reduce the amount of time you use X-rays,
the better."

TOKYO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit 137 yen in Tokyo
Monday for the first time since August 1991, boosted by reports
that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will tolerate a weaker
yen to keep the Japanese economy from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 137.13-15 yen at 5 p.m., up
from 136.62-65 yen at 9 a.m., and from 135.85-95 yen last Friday
in New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar peaked at 137.19 yen during the day, a level last
seen August 28, 1991, when it hit 137.20 yen.
</P>
<P>
Market players rushed to buy dollars after a magazine reported
that Rubin said he would tolerate the dollar reaching 140 yen or
150 yen, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The story on U.S. News and World Report's Web site said Rubin
is "willing to let the Japanese yen keep plunging -- below the 140
(yen)-to-the-dollar level and even to 150 (yen) -- if that's the
only way to keep the world's second biggest economy from totally
collapsing."

<HEADLINE> China Sees Growing PC Market with Thinner Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's personal computer
manufacturers are competing for increasingly thinner profits in
the growing China market.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China's PC market has entered a mature
stage. The fast-growing PC industry in the country is embracing
the world trend of low profits.
</P>
<P>
The profit rate of Chinese PC manufacturers and distributors is
estimated currently at 3-to-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, China's PC market drew in many
international brand products, forcing local manufacturers to keep
pace with technological developments in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese manufacturers have adopted international standards in
producing whole-set PCs and developing their own name-brand
products.
</P>
<P>
The gap between various name brands in PC performance was
narrowed while less competitive products were squeezed out of the
market. Profit rates of 20-to-30 percent have become a memory for
PC manufacturers and sales agents as they slashed prices to retain
or expand their shares of the ever-expanding China market.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the sales volume of PCs
reached 3.5 million in China last year, worth 41.5 billion yuan (5
billion U.S. dollars). Chinese manufacturers held 60 percent
of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to become the second largest PC market in the
world by 2001, after the United States.
</P>
<P>
Many large PC manufacturers in China have formulated a long-term
strategy of enhancing management and operations as well as
expanding their sales networks.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Legend Group has begun to carry out the
"Flying Dragon Plan" to keep the prices of all its PC under 1,000
US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Manufacturing Sales Rise 7.8 Pct in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of products from
Malaysia's manufacturing industries increased by 7.8 percent in
March 1998 compared with the same month of last year, the
Statistics Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sales value in March this year rose to 19.4 billion ringgit
(5.1 billion U.S. dollars) compared with the year-ago level of
18.0 billion ringgit (4.736 billion U.S. dollars), the department
said in its monthly manufacturing statistics.
</P>
<P>
It said that compared with sales value of 17.2 billion ringgit
(4.526 billion U.S. dollars) registered in February 1998, sales in
the month under review showed an increase of 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were based on 73 out of 137 manufacturing
industries in the country, and data collected covered the areas of
sales value, employment, wages paid and the main products of the
manufacturing sector, it said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Builds Cleaner Wool Processing Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a wool processing
plant using a new Environmentally-friendly technique began Monday
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The 20 million U.S. dollar wool cleaning and top making
facility at Finerwool Limited in the state of Western Australia,
Australia, will have a non-aqueous processing system.
</P>
<P>
The new plant will be the first in the southern hemisphere and
the second in the world to use such technique. Only one other
processing plant at Trieste, Italy, uses the technology, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Unlike aqueous, or water-based processing, which washes out the
lanolin and contaminants from the fleece into the effluent system,
the new system uses an organic reagent.
</P>
<P>
Developed at a cost of 37 million U.S. dollars over eight years
by Consolidated Press Holdings Limited, the new system allowed the
grease and contaminants to be captured and used as fuel in the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Resulting tops were cleaner, stronger and finer than those
cleaned by traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Michael Franklin said : "up to date, the
focus of the industry in Australia has been on the first stage of
wool cleaning, where the value added to the fibre approximates
only 14 percent of its raw value."
</P>
<P>
"By building an integrated wool cleaning and top making plant,
Finerwool will add at least 60 percent to the value of the greasy
wool it processes through to the second stage of top making for
the growing international market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Forward sales contracts were already in place for up to 60
percent of the expected 3,600 tones of wool to be processed at the
plant, which was expected to start producing mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's New Expressway, Green One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- What makes the just-completed
Route 3 (Country Park Section) different from other Hong Kong road
projects is that it is "green."
</P>
<P>
Ever since the commencement of the route's construction,
environment studies were done to ensure that disturbances to
its natural surroundings were kept to a minimum, Project Designer
Carlos Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
At the early stages of the project, the alignment of the route
was changed several times to avoid damage to the Tai Lam Country
Park. The 10.1 km route now extends across Tai Lam Country Park to
the Yuen Long Approach Road in the north through two specially
constructed tunnels.
</P>
<P>
At Ting Kau valley where a section of the route cuts across, a
special tunnel was constructed underneath the expressway to allow
animal crossing, as porcupines, young deer and other small animals
are seen moving around in the area.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this tunnel is Hong Kong's first underground
crossing for animals," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
On the slopes along the entire route, compensatory planting of
three trees for every one disturbed was carried out, according to
the chief designer of the road.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 trees, 150,000 shrubs and 60,000 climbing
plants were planted to attract birds to the area.
</P>
<P>
Another example of the environmental efforts made for the
route is the preservation of a 300-year-old tombstone, which led
to the construction of a flyover instead of a direct through road.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of effort and thought that our engineers and
architects have contributed to the building of this expressway is
immeasurable, and we are proud to claim that it is Hong Kong's
'green' expressway," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
Put into use Monday afternoon, the project marked the
completion of the entire Route 3 Expressway which provides a
strategic link between the developing northwest "New Territories"
and the rest of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls on to Abolish Extreme Forms of Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor Organization
(ILO) is preparing a convention and a recommendation to abolish
extreme forms of child labor immediately.
</P>
<P>
In announcing its preparation here Monday, the ILO noted that
millions of children worldwide are currently exposed daily to
exploitation, risks of accident, diseases and deaths.
</P>
<P>
The ILO, a Geneva-based specialized agency of the United
Nations, estimates that 250 million children at ages between 5-14
in the developing countries have to work full time or part time.
</P>
<P>
Among the underaged laborers, 61 percent are in Asia, 32
percent in Africa, and 7 percent in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne
said, the ILO annual conference will try "to identify, confront
and eliminate without delay" the extreme forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
The next ILO annual gathering is scheduled here for June 2
through 18.

<HEADLINE> France Offers Loans to East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The French Development Agency
(AFD), which recently launched its operations in Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda, has committed 19.6 million U.S. Dollars in loans and
grants to the east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The aid since December 1997 is targeted at infrastructure and
rural development as part of the French government's extension of
influence to Anglophone African countries, the East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Guy Terracol, head of the AFD Central, Eastern and Southern
Africa Department, said that the agency will be involved in
assistance to develop projects in rural areas in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Last year, AFD spent one billion U.S. Dollars on project
financing in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
"The agency will finance the governments on a project by
project basis through concession loans instead of allocating a
lump sum amount for the government to utilize," said Terracol.
</P>
<P>
France's total aid package for the region includes a
10-million-U.S.-Dollar initial project finance to rehabilitate
four rural water schemes around Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, a 3.6-million-U.S.-Dollar grant will be used in
the Tanesco power transmission network, while in Uganda, two
water projects in the rural and urban areas are under
construction at a cost of six million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The French interest in the Anglophone Africa began with last
year's visit by AFD Chief Executive Antoine Pouillieute when he
launched the agency's resident mission in Nairobi for its
regional operations.
</P>
<P>
The AFD was set up in 1941 and currently extends French
development assistance to 80 developing countries.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government on Monday issued a
policy statement to set out the objectives of the competition
policy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The secretary for Trade and Industry, Chau Tak Hay, said
competition was important as a means to foster free trade and
enhance economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure maximum adherence to this policy across the economy,
the government needs to set out in clear and transparent terms
what the policy entails," the SAR official said. "The policy
statement provides advice on the 'dos' and 'don'ts' under this
policy."
</P>
<P>
He said such principles as adherence to the free market
mechanism and maintaining a level-playing field were believed to
be conducive to providing a healthy environment to encourage fair
play.
</P>
<P>
The policy statement will be observed by all government units
in the initial stage, and other public sector entities will be
encouraged to adhere to the policy.

<HEADLINE> Australian dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed half a
U.S. cent Monday during Japanese yen-dominated trading in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The currency slipped back below the 63 U.S. cent mark in
offshore trading at the weekend before starting the week in
Sydney at 62.61 U.S. cents
</P>
<P>
It finished the day at 62.70 U.S. cents from 63.10 U.S. cents
late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Monday is the Memorial Day in the United States
and the Spring Bank Holiday in the United Kingdom had resulted in
a dull day for the local currency, said Stuart Moore, senior
foreign exchange trader of St George Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moore said during local dealings most of the market action was
in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar soared to levels not reached in over six years
in Tokyo trade Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers attributed the move to media reports that U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was willing to allow the yen to
weaken further.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the rise in the U.S. dollar against the yen had lead
to concern about a move by the Bank of Japan to protect its
currency.
</P>
<P>
"The market is getting more and more concerned about the
dollar/yen the higher it gets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was trading at 136.92 Japanese yen, from 135.86
yen at Friday's local close, and a level that many analysts are
fearful may invoke intervention from the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day the Australian dollar was fetching 1.1046
German marks from 1.1110, and was at 85.85 Japanese yen from 85.76
yen.

settling slightly higher at the close of the market.

The all ordinaries finished 1.9 points higher at 2727.8 points,
around the midpoint of the day's trading range.
</P>
<P>
Shaw Stockbroking's Jack Moss said public holidays in the

Asian bourses led to the drift in the Australian market Monday.
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest was reflected in thin trade with only
175.56 million shares worth 267.16 million U.S. dollar changing
hands. The falls outnumbered rises 530 to 413.
</P>

thin trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index (STII) increased marginally by 0.97 point
to close at 1314.64 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stock prices ended mixed after a very quiet

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Blamed for Abacha's Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
have been blamed for putting the Head of State General Sani
Abacha in a dilemma by adopting him as their consensus
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's special adviser and former Minister of Internal
Affairs Wada Nas said at the weekend that the parties, by their
decisions, had not helped Abacha "to take a decision on his
choice easily without offending any other party."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with major national media in Abuja, the
special adviser faulted the national conventions of the parties
last month, during which they all invited Abacha as their flag
bearer for the August 1 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"Really, I faulted the conventions that were held. There was
something to be done that was not done, " Nas said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the parties should have passed two
resolutions, one approving Abacha's candidacy, and the other
giving him (Abacha) their full support if the general declines
the invitation of any of them.
</P>
<P>
Since the parties have failed to do so, General Abacha is now
in a dilemma, the special adviser said.
</P>
<P>
"He is one man. How can he be divided and be the flag bearer
in all the parties. He cannot. It is impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
On what will happen if Abacha decides to declare for one of
the parties, he said: "I don't know what the parties will do, but
definitely to me, they put him in a very difficult position."
</P>
<P>
As August 1 draws nearer day by day, there has been amounting
pressure on General Sani Abacha to break his long silence on his
intentions, especially after the controversial consensus
candidacy was offered to him by the parties.
</P>
<P>
Wada Nas has been widely thought as Abacha's speaker on
political matters. He has spoken out several times when Abacha's
transition to civil rule program came to difficult situations.

<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, expressed the
hope today that the governments and peoples of China and Sri Lanka
should increase contacts and maintain cooperation to reinforce
bilateral traditional friendship under the new historic condition.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with Sri Lankan
Speaker of Parliament K.B. Ratnayake, who is here on a visit to
China as the guest of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
China and Sri Lanka are close neighbors and the two peoples
share a long history of friendly exchange, he said, adding that
bilateral ties have scored a smooth development since the two
nations forged diplomatic ties in 1957 as a result of the frequent
exchanges and contacts between the leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Chinese NPC values its cooperative
relations with the Sri Lankan Parliament since such relations play an
important role in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the speaker's current China
tour would help promote the cooperation between the two countries
and the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the Sri Lankan visitors on China's policy
on its ethnic groups and the development of different regions
in China.
</P>
<P>
Ratnayake said his country enjoys a good cooperative
relationship with China and the Sri Lankan parliament would make
continued efforts for the growth of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Sri Lanka-China ties would be
further enhanced with the concerted efforts of both sides.

<HEADLINE> China to Screen Documentaries at Wildlife Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China will hold the first
international wildlife film festival ever in Beijing June 5-8 to
commemorate World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The '98 Wildscreen China, jointly sponsored by the National
Environment Protection Agency (NEPA) and the World Wide Fund for
Nature (former WWF), will feature 10 award-winning documentaries
that explore the farthest reaches of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
The event is the first time that Wildscreen has held a
retrospective of its award-winning films outside England. Since
its beginning in 1982, the biannual Wildscreen Festival has become
the world's most authoritative forum for nature and wildlife
film-making. Bristol, the home of Wildscreen, has often been
called "Green Hollywood."
</P>
<P>
Wang Yaoxian, director of NEPA's Publicity and Education
Department, said at today's press conference that China aims to
spread environmental knowledge and improve the public's
environmental awareness through the film festival.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, daytime screenings will be reserved for
students, while evening screenings will be open to the
public. "All will be free of charge," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to make Wildscreen China a success, Shanghai
Television (STV) will broadcast some of the participating
documentaries on its highly popular program, the "Documentary
Editing Room."
</P>
<P>
Also in the period, SEPA, the World Wide Fund for Nature and
the China Television Documentary Academic Association will hold a
two-day international symposium to discuss the development of
wildlife film production in China.
</P>
<P>
The festival is sponsored by the U.S.-based Johnson and
Johnson, which has donated more than 1.3 million yuan to help
China research endangered wildlife protection over the past four
years.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Up in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports reached 3.86
billion U.S. dollars in the first five months of the year, up 13
percent against the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the growth was lower than planned, due to the region's
economic crisis, reduced farm produce in the wake of a prolonged
drought and the sharp drop of crude oil price.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) quoted Monday the General Department
of Statistics as saying that 2.65 million metric tons of rice were
exported, double over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Other export items attaining remarkable increases in the
five-month period were crude oil, 23.8 percent; tea, 31.4 percent;
textiles and garment, 7.0 percent; and groundnut, 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Decreased export items included pepper, down by 46.2 percent;
coffee, 27.5 percent; and vegetables and fruit, 11.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports were valued at 4.66 billion dollars from January to
May, a 1.8 percent yearly increase. Of the figure,
foreign-invested businesses accounted for 1.05 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the first five months was 800 million
dollars, down 25 percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Hoping to Score High Growth in GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is shooting for an average annual growth rate of more than ten
percent in its GDP (gross domestic product) the next five years.
</P>
<P>
That goal was set forth by Li Changchun, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and also secretary of the Guangdong Provincial
CPC Committee, in a report Friday to the ongoing Eighth
Guangdong Provincial Party Congress which runs through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Li put forward "three strategies" -- expanding
an expand-oriented economy, revitalizing Guangdong through science
and technology and maintaining sustainable development -- for
keeping Guangdong's high economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In group discussions in the last three days, delegates said a
careful implementation of the three strategies would be the key to
accomplishing the goal.
</P>
<P>
The average annual GDP growth of the province, which borders
Hong Kong, was 16.7 percent in the last seven years, while the per
capita GDP surpassed 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 U.S. dollars) each
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has affirmed the government's readiness to hold general elections
after the country's law on elections is amended, a senior official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The government is ready to hold general elections as soon as
possible," State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said following a
90-minute meeting between the president and his new cabinet
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In line with this, he said, the government will review the Act
on General Elections; the Act on the Structure of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), House of Representatives (DPR) and
Provincial House of Representatives (DPRD); the Act on Political
parties and the ruling Functional Group (Golkar); and the Act on
Rural Administration.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said President Habibie met with six pro-reform figures
last Saturday to discuss the next measures to be taken to
implement reforms. The discussions will continue on Wednesday and
some other figures may be invited, including student activists, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi said Monday's cabinet
meeting also discussed the possibility of releasing at least 10
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"President Habibie and the ministers agreed to grant amnesty to
certain (political prisoners)," said Muladi.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will study the possibility of releasing
several others, including those who were detained for staging the
recent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
On economic matters, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said
the ministers had been instructed to provide sufficient supplies
of staple food.
</P>
<P>
He said Habibie reiterated the government's commitment to
implement the economic reforms agreed upon with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). The government will launch various policies
to eradicate monopoly as well as oligopoly, he said, quoting the
president.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers were also instructed to take all actions
to keep inflation down and restore foreign investors' confidence
in the Indonesian economy, Yosfiah said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Diversified Rural Economy in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- There are 859,000 people in
suburban areas of the Chinese capital engaged in farming,
accounting for 39.2 percent of Beijing's total rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a survey of Beijing's rural areas
released here today, 90.7 percent of these farmers are growing
vegetables or fruit trees, which means grain growers are less than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rest of labor hands in Beijing's suburban counties are
engaged in industrial production, construction, transportation,
retail sales or running small restaurants. Most of them prefer
jobs in and around Beijing, with only 0.2 percent going to other
provinces to find work.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind in the capital, was begun in
January of 1997 and completed recently. It suggests that Beijing
has a high level of agricultural machinization, with four tractors
for every 25 hectares on average. Ninety-five percent of farmland
is now plowed by machinery.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that Beijing has 24,203 township
enterprises, 65.8 percent of which are engaged in industrial
production. One-third of the rural enterprises have an annual revenue
of 10-to-100 million yuan (1.25-to-12.5 million
U.S. dollars). Twelve enterprises have turned out an annual
revenue of more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, all villages in Beijing's suburban
areas have electricity; 99.5 percent have been connected to
highways; 92.3 percent are hooked up with telephone networks; and
54.3 percent use coal and gas as fuels.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing municipal officials pointed out that the city
faces grave challenges in protecting farmland.
</P>
<P>
The survey puts Beijing's total arable land at 343,933 hectares
by the end of 1996, a reduction of 64,333 hectares compared with
1993. More than 36 percent of the reduced farmland was used for
non-agricultural purposes.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser
Arafat arrived in Saudi Arabia late Sunday to lobby for unified
Arab stance on the Mideast peace process, Kuwait's official news
agency KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said Arafat's lightening visit to Saudi
Arabia is part of his campaign to lobby Arab leaders to hold a
Arab summit to adopt a unified stance against Israel's
intransigence on the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
In the Saudi Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah Sunday night,
Arafat met with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and briefed him on
the current efforts aimed at saving the stalled Mideast peace
process, the KUNA quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not give details about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's firm refusal to hand back to the Palestinians 13
percent more of the West Bank as proposed by the U.S. has made the
long stalled Palestinian-Israeli talks go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here from Egypt where he also discussed with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak the current impasse in the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cabinet Makes No Decision on U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security cabinet failed
to make a decision at its Sunday night session on a revised
U.S. proposal calling for a 15 percent Israeli troops withdrawal
in the second and third stages as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of the four-member "kitchen
cabinet" late Sunday night to discuss the proposal, one of the
several proposals discussed during his recent Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
The four members of the "kitchen cabinet," or core cabinet, are
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls on Israel to carry out an 11 percent
withdrawal from the West Bank within three months, and an
additional 4 percent no later than the beginning of the
final-status talks, which are mandated by the 1993 Oslo Accords to
start next May.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu has rejected the proposal in
Washington talks, but it did not say why he presented it at the
Sunday cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion Sunday, Mordechai expressed his concern
about the possibility of a showdown with the U.S. and eruption of
new violence in the region if a compromise can not be reached
soon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that Israel would continue negotiations
with the U. S. on the further redeployment during Netanyahu's
four-day visit to China, starting on Monday, the radio reported.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Stainless Steel Producer Goes Public with Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel
Share Holdings, China's largest stainless steel manufacturer,
today issued 250 million public shares through the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange, one of only two in China.
</P>
<P>
The company's stock sold at 4.32 yuan per share to raise 1.05
billion yuan for facility replacement and technological innovation
as well as company expansion.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in north China's Shanxi Province, has 30
percent of the domestic market share, with the production and
sales of iron products making up 85 percent of the country's total
amount.
</P>
<P>
Its share-holding system has been the result of recent capital
reformation, which transformed the net state-owned assets worth
580 million yuan into 60.19 percent of equity shares with the rest
depending on public funding.
</P>
<P>
Because of a weak steel market in recent years, the company
suffered a slump in sales and profits. However, company leaders
are expecting a turn for the better of 2.1 billion yuan in sales
and 213 million yuan in profits this year fueled by this round of
capital injection, representing an annual increase of 10.78
percent and 16 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Shenzhen's exchange observed that China's steel
industry is gaining momentum in using the stock market for
funding, which has greatly stimulated technological upgrading in
the sector. For example, from 1995 through last year, the Shanxi
company had pulled 684 million yuan for such purpose.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are eight steel companies listed on the Shenzhen
exchange in south China's Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Iran, UAE Share Common Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has said that Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
share very close positions on many issues after the two countries
reportedly agreed to resolve their dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return Sunday from a two-day official visit to the
UAE, Kharrazi expressed hope that the present political atmosphere
between the two countries and other regional countries would be
exploited to the benefit of Iran and the UAE, the Iranian official
news agency IRNA reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran and the UAE could broaden the relations in many
areas, using the existing opportunities,
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi did not mention the result of his talks with UAE
government officials on the territorial dispute between the two
countries over the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb
and the Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, reports reaching here said that Iran and the UAE
agreed on Sunday to resolve the dispute through peaceful means in
a meeting between Kharrazi and UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan and the Iranian foreign minister cut short of
his visit to inform his government of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"You can say the visit was successful," an Iranian diplomat
was quoted as confirming the agreement, "it opened new avenues
for discussions on all issues, including an acceptable solution
to the island (Abu Musa) issue."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit to the UAE was aimed at paving the way for
the two countries to solve their territorial dispute, following a
detente between Iran and its Gulf neighbors after the Islamic
summit held in Tehran last December.
</P>
<P>
"Determination of Iran and Saudi Arabia to develop bilateral
ties has had positive impacts on Iran's relations with other
countries," Kharrazi told the IRNA before leaving for home.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE has been locked in a dispute over ownership of
the three islands located on the edge of the Strait of Hormuz,
which Iran has taken control.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries were lowered
to the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest to Iran's full control of the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, Iran has insisted on solving its
"misunderstanding" with the UAE through bilateral talks while the
UAE has called for an international arbitration over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Striving to Cut Losses at State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin Municipality
has started a campaign to help financially troubled large- and
medium-size state-owned enterprises based in the city become
profitable in three years.
</P>
<P>
Taking textiles as an example, the city, the leading
manufacturing center in north China, will use mergers and
bankruptcies to achieve an improved reorganization of assets and
speed up a strategic reshuffling of state-owned enterprises to
form big groups that can have a dominant influence on the
industrial economy, said an official with the municipal economic
and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will also try to improve the multi-tiered
re-employment service network. The goal is to help a group of
enterprises through their difficult situations in three years by
improving efficiency in the workforce, tightening management and
improving enterprises' overall quality.
</P>
<P>
As an old industrial base, Tianjin has a lot of large- and
medium-size state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted among 326 large- and medium-size state-owned
enterprises from the city's industrial sector shows that there
were 166 money-losing enterprises in 1997, accounting for 51
percent of the municipality's total manufacturers, most of which
had been engaged in the textile, metallurgical and
electro-mechanical industries and had been in the red for two
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The official added that he hoped the work to reduce the number
of money-losing enterprises should be done step-by-step and that,
by 2000, money-losing major enterprises in the industrial sector
might be reduced to fewer than 60 from the present 149, with the
money-losing ratio down to less than 20 percent.

KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers of the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF), who had been held prisons of war
(pow) in Sudan since February 1997, were released Saturday in
response to Uganda's freeing 42 Sudanese last week.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers, John Rutembana and Paul Kabwire, arrived in
Uganda's Entebbe International Airport at 4:30 p.m. (1330 gmt)

<P>
Amama Mbabazi, Ugandan Minister of State for Political Affairs
in the President's Office, greeted them at the airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ugandan minister, the two soldiers were
arrested in Sudan as they were tracking down rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
He called for Sudan to free thousands of other captives.
</P>
<P>
There are now 72 Sudanese soldiers still in Ugandans' hands
after last week's release of 42.

<HEADLINE> Container Shipping "Buoyant" in Africa: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Shipping lines doing business in
Africa said that in contrast to the Asian trade, containerized
traffic in Africa is "buoyant", although trade is still regarded as
inherently volatile.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's List issued in Britain shows that northbound sailings
from Africa are full, while south-bound shipments are doing
particularly well, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, several international carriers are keen to serve
the continent, and one area where there is expected to be a boom
in exports over the coming years is fruit shipments and motor
vehicle parts from South Africa, the Lloyd report says.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a relative boom in the export of primary
commodities from several African countries and a big increase in
the import of chemicals, machinery and second-hand cars from the
industrialized North.
</P>
<P>
However, Richard Mellow, the Manager of P&AMP;O Nedlloyd's African
services, said in the report that continuing with a first-class
service to many African countries remains "challenging."
</P>
<P>
To trade in Africa "you have to be street-wise," he said,
adding that it is vital for shipping companies to keep abreast of
the local business and political climate.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Zimbabwe was showing healthy growth, with plenty
of overseas investment funds flowing in, but within a few months,
the currency has collapsed as political unrest spread, sending
prices and business confidence plummeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lloyd report says that even in South Africa, the most
industrialized country in the sub-Saharan region, productivity is
low by European standards, and manufactureers are unable to
compete easily in the international markets.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, "shipping lines have additional difficulties to
contend with, such as inefficient ports, unreliable inland
transport and a highly fragmented marketplace," said the Lloyd
report.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Reports Improvement in Comprehensive Economic Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has improved its economy through restructuring
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Information from the recently-held first session of the eighth
regional people's congress shows that the whole region chalked up
21 billion yuan in GDP (gross domestic product) in 1997, with an
average annual increase of 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the autonomous region has placed agriculture
ahead of all other economic work and has tried to increase input
in agriculture and promote the use of scientific achievements in
farming, bringing about positive changes in the region's rural
economy.
</P>
<P>
It produced more than 2.5 billion kilograms of grain in 1997,
ranking first among the provinces and autonomous regions in
northwest China and fifth in the whole country for per capita
grain production. Output of farm produce such as meat, eggs, dairy
and vegetables, fruits and aquatic products went up by varying
margins last year.
</P>
<P>
The added value of agriculture for 1997 amounted to 4.5 billion
yuan, with an average annual rise of 5.9 percent. The per capita
net income of farmers reached 1,580 yuan last year, according to
the information.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the region executed technical upgrades
of 283 projects. Retail sales of consumer commodities in 1997
doubled that of 1992, and the added value of the service trade
amounted to eight billion yuan in 1997, with an average annual
growth rate of 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has also made efforts to support and
develop diverse economic sectors, making non-public economy into
the region's new economic growth powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
As China has been implementing a strategy of developing the
central and western areas of the country, state investment in
infrastructure construction in this Muslim region has also
increased, said the information.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the leading manufacturing
center in north China, now has 344,000 mobile phone users,
ranking 4th in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Municipal Posts and Telecommunications
Bureau said there are 2.94 mobile phones for every 100 people in
Tianjin, nearly 2 percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Since the mobile telephone network in Tianjin began operating
at the end of 1989, the switching capacity has been raised from
1,500 in 1990 to the current 460,000.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's mobile telephone network is connected with the
networks in 304 cities and 1,731 counties in China.
</P>
<P>
Because of price cuts for mobile phones and network
connections, more average-income families began buying the former
luxury items which stimulated market demand.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 120,000 mobile phones were sold in
Tianjin. The posts and telecommunications department in Tianjin
expects to increase input in developing mobile phones this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic envoys from 48 African
countries gathered here today to celebrate African Liberation Day
and the 35th anniversary of the establishment of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told guests in a speech to the
celebration that African countries and people have, under the
banner of the OAU, fulfilled the great mission of national
independence and decolonization in Africa, thus adding a splendid
chapter to the annals of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he believed, with the constant efforts of African
countries to seek development roads suitable to their national
conditions and more support and help from the international
community, that the African continent can eventually eradicate
poverty and put an end to conflicts so as to make the coming
century one of development for Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-premier, China is pursuing an independent
foreign policy. "To strengthen its solidarity and cooperation with
the vast number of African and other developing countries
constitutes an important part of the policy," he said, adding that
he believed such cooperation would turn more closely in future
years.
</P>
<P>
Lucas Pande Tavaya, Zimbabwe's ambassador to China, read a
message delivered by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, the current
chairman of OAU, to commemorate African Liberation Day.
</P>
<P>
Jean Jacques Maurice, Madagascar's ambassador to China, dean of
the African Diplomatic Corps in China, also made a speech on
African development and Africa-China relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Sees More Natural Disasters This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters such as
earthquakes, snowstorms, droughts and fires have pounded China in
the first several months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Following top meteorologists' forecasts for less rainfall in
the spring, as many as 20 million hectares of farmland in the
north was reportedly suffering from drought in February.
</P>
<P>
Water storage in the country's big- and medium-size reservoirs
was down approximately one-third, and the Yellow River, China's
second longest river, reportedly ran dry at least seven times.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports, more than two million hectares
of farmland are being affected by drought.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the Ministry of Water Resources warned that
China may be facing even worse floods this year.
</P>
<P>
High-water season in the south came two months earlier than
normal. Serious floods have happened in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian and
Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained heavy rain may hit areas along the Yangtze River and
the Yellow River, and there is a possibility of a large-scale
catastrophic flood this year," said a vice-minister of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Fires also have gained the full attention of both the public
and top state leadship. A source from the Ministry of Public
Security said that more than 30 serious fires happened in the
first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
As much as 1.5 billion yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) in
direct losses from fires was reported in China last year, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
China's first law on fire control will go into effect in the
second half of this year, which is expected to decrease the figure
of money lost by fire.
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar, experts said that big natural disasters
are imposing an increasingly great influence on China's economic
development, with 25-to-30 billion U.S. dollars of direct economic
losses expected by all kinds of major natural disasters in the
coming several years.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, the losses retrieved through
flood control last year was 150 billion yuan (18 billion
U.S. dollars), and the retrieved grain output was estimated at 12
percent of the total grain output.

<HEADLINE> China Bank To Lend 30 Billion Yuan for Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB) plans
to loan 30 billion yuan for graded highway construction this year
as part of its intensifying support for key projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank has tightened its management of loans granted in that
regard beginning this year, and will increase loans and ensure the
timely placement of loans to better meet the demand of highway
construction, according to an official with the bank.
</P>
<P>
So far, 14 such highways have received 4.1 billion yuan in CCB
loans, with another 56 under evaluation expected to receive 113.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing loan support for the fixed-asset projects has
accelerated the economic growth, and the Chinese economy is in a
more solid position to reach the growth target of 8 percent this
year," said a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the CCB had extended 108.66 billion yuan
in loans. Most of the loans went to the infrastructure projects in
sectors such as railways, highways, telecommunications and urban
construction.
</P>
<P>
CCB has decided to grant 32 billion yuan in loans to key
projects since the beginning of this year, 9.6 billion yuan more
than the same period last year. The agreed loans for
transportation projects is estimated at 8.3 billion yuan for the
present.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that CCB has supported the building of 254
graded highways with a total length of 20,344 kilometers by the
end of 1997, extending loans of more than 18.534 billion yuan.

MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's Foreign Ministry has
issued a statement accusing Abkhazian militants of using artillery
against Georgian residents in the Gali district on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax news agency report on Monday quoted the statement
as saying the most disturbing thing is that the military operation
is underway in an area controlled by peacekeeping forces.

Georgia also called on the United Nations, the Organization for

<P>
The Georgia-Abkhazia conflict began after Abkhazia declared
independence in July 1992. But it has not been recognized by any
country in the world so far.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, the two sides reached a cease-fire agreement
through the mediation of the United Nations and Russia. The
situation in Gali has become tense since May 20.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Optimistic over World Bank's Emergency Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Expectations are reportedly high
among Kenyans that negotiations between the government and the
World Bank (WB) for the 65-million-U.S.Dollar El Nino emergency
aid project will be concluded later this week.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 40 million U.S. Dollars will come directly
from WB as new funds and go into rural roads, bridges, health
services, rural water and sanitation, while 25 million U.S.
Dollars for the rehabilitation of urban roads will be
re-programed from the existing Urban Roads Program.
</P>
<P>
Officials said last week that final approval from the bank's
Washington headquarters would most probably be given by the end
of next month, the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project to rehabilitate infrastructure and social service
destroyed by the El Nino floods later last year is scheduled to
run for two years beginning from July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government sent an appeal for international
emergency intervention last November, but preparations have taken
longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
This was because the February talks with the initial WB team
led by Peter Watson, WB Director of Infrastructure in Africa,
broke down when Kenya objected to the inclusion of the private
sector in the running of the trust fund that was to have been set
up by donors, said the report.
</P>
<P>
WB Vice-President for Africa Callisto Madavo visited Kenya in
March and raised the issue with Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae
who got permission from President Daniel arap Moi to restart the
negotiations but under different arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The private sector was excluded from taking an active part in
the talks and from the fund whose name was changed from a trust
fund to the El Nino Emergency Project.
</P>
<P>
The position of the board of directors was also changed to a
steering committee made up of between six and eight permanent
secretaries from the relevant ministries.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 companies have so far
registered to take part in this year's African Information
Technology (IT) Exhibition &AMP; Conference (AITEC) to be held in
Nairobi from June 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the event is "Developing an IT Strategy for the
New Millennium," local sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sean Moroney, the chief organizer of AITEC '98, said that the
conference and exhibition will explore the global trends in
computing and internet management as well as look at the risks,
costs and effectiveness of re-engineering old systems versus
investing in new systems.
</P>
<P>
"Since we began the AITEC shows in this region, they have
become milestones in computing development. They don't just
showcase new products but also bring information on global trends
and relate them to the local IT environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's conference will also focus on preparedness for
what has come to be known as the "millennium bug" -- a shutdown
of computer and electronic systems which are not programed for
2000.
</P>
<P>
A series of IT strategy briefings and practical workshops have
been planned to complement this year's AITEC exhibition in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The workshops are expected to attract IT managers, upper-level
operation managers, IT professionals, software consultants and
service organizations, IT vendors and so on.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 visitors attended last year's event in Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Zoologists Helping To Improve Pilose Antler Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- By regulating the amount of light,
humidity, and feed, zoologists in Harbin, capital of the
northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang, have been able to
increase the growth of pilose antlers of a stag.
</P>
<P>
The province's wild animal research center tried the new
technique on 559 sika deer and 180 red deer, both of which are
under national protection. Their pilose antlers are used in the
traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia as a tonic for invigorating the
human body.
</P>
<P>
The experiments, which started in 1992, showed that the size of
a pair of young pilose antlers could be increased by 16.4 percent
on average and of regenerated antlers, by over 73.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also found that by maintaining 74.5 humidity in the
barn, a pair of young pilose antlers of these deer would be 10
percent bigger than those of a wild deer and a pair of regenerated
antlers, 50 percent bigger.
</P>
<P>
In addition, feed additives could increase the growth of
high-quality pilose antlers by some 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
When the three means were combined, output of young pilose
antlers was a third larger, and that regenerated antlers doubled
or tripled in size.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 300,000 head of sika and red deer, and
the technology is being used on 3,000 of them.

Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have disagreed peacefully over their
lengthy border ever since 1993, when Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia, but the spat turned violent earlier this month
with both sides accusing the other of invading its territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 10,000 people have been
affected with viral fever in Kishoreganj district, about 90
kilometers northeast of here, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Women and children and the poorer section of people in the
rural areas were the most affected by the disease when it broke
out in an alarming form during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Local health facilities lacked medicines for its treatment and
most patients were only given prescriptions instead of necessary
medicines.
</P>
<P>
As dishonest medicine traders there raised the price of
medicines sharply for earning windfall profit, many people
couldn't afford to buy the medicines, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The local health department so far has not taken any effective
steps to check the spread of the disease and more people are being
affected by the disease, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Local people urged the authorities concerned to take necessary
measures for checking the disease, but it is not immediately known
why the disease has spread so fast in the region.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The blistering heat wave gripping
most parts of India has so far claimed 111 lives, press reports
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, which accounted for
48 of the deaths, remains the hottest state in the country with
the maximum temperature of 49 degrees Celsius in certain places
for the second successive day on Sunday, while the blazing sun
threw normal life out of gear in the northern plains, Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The past week saw New Delhi, capital of India, battling it out
under the scorching sun on the one hand and the power supply
playing truant on the other.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the misery was the heat wave conditions and
temperature spiraling to a whopping 45.6 degrees Celsius Sunday,
the hottest day in May in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The hottest day the capital has witnessed in the month was 47.2
degrees on May 29, 1944.
</P>
<P>
As temperatures soared in more regions in the country people
have stayed indoors, shops and business establishments remained
closed and roads presented a deserted look in most states.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorological officers in most parts of the country have
predicted no respite in day temperatures with the heat wave
conditions likely to prevail for the next couple of days.

<HEADLINE> Five Chinese Provinces Cooperate In Grain Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Three major grain producers and
two major consumers in southern China say they'll work together to
ensure balanced supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, the three
producers, and in Guangdong and Guangxi, the consumers, met
recently in Changsha, Hunan's capital, and decided to establish a
long-term purchase-and-sale relationship for planning and
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this move comes amidst increased efforts to
convert the planned grain distribution system into a
market-oriented one. The old system operated through central
planning but the reforms call for the separation of central
government and local government functions, giving the central
government macro-economic controls and the local areas control
over grain distribution.
</P>
<P>
The old production-and-purchase system was already being
threatened by varied marketing methods in recent years, and the
change is expected to improve the market, but it also presents
producers and consumers with new hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Hunan, for example, faced competition from other provinces and
could sell less than 100 million kilograms of grain last year, far
short of its plan of at least a billion. At the same time, most of
the five billion kilograms of grain that Guangdong and Guangxi
need every year didn't come from the planned sources.
</P>
<P>
The five provinces set the price of grain -- a protective price
and a minimum wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that the move will help regional grain
market coordination and will have a good effect on grain
production.
</P>
<P>
A Hubei official points out that, for producers, regional
cooperation means adjusting the grain structure, improving
quality, and cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have already seen the need for
increasing amounts of corn for fodder, which is in short supply in
the consuming provinces. So Hunan has decided to increase the
amount of corn acreage by at least 333,000 hectares this year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers on the Jianghan, Dongting Lake, and Poyang Lake plains
are giving up their traditional high-yield crops and shifting to
high-quality rice.

<HEADLINE> Thai Farmers Demand More State Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Thai farmers
demonstrated Sunday in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen,
demanding more welfare from the government, the Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The farmers said they want to be treated in the same way as the
finance sector, which obtained much of the government's attention.
</P>
<P>
Later on Monday, the parliament prepares to vote on four
executive decrees, which will allow the government to borrow from
overseas and domestic markets to ease the liquidity crunch and
restructure the debts of the Financial Institutions Development
Fund (FIDF), which spent 700 billion baht (17.95 billion U.S.
dollars) last year in a failed attempt to rescue the debt-ridden
finance sector.
</P>
<P>
In response to the four decrees, farmers, led by 11
northeastern farmer organizations, demanded the government issue
an executive decree to raise loans worth 500 billion baht (12.82
billion dollars) to lift them out of poverty and to declare a
five-year moratorium on debts they owe to the Bank for Agriculture
and Agricultural Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Farmers warned of bigger demonstrations if the demand, which
has been submitted to Deputy Prime Minister Suvit Khunkitti, could
not be deliberated by the Tuesday cabinet meeting and the loan not
raised within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The government has been criticized by the poor, democracy
groups and members of the opposition for trying to solve economic
problems at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
But the government has retorted that solving the problems of
the financial sector is a matter of life and death for the nation.
</P>
<P>
It said it attaches equal importance to addressing the social
impact of the economic crisis on ordinary Thais, especially those
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
Solving the fundamental problems of the country, including
those of the financial sector, will in the end benefit the people,
it declared.

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- By developing water-efficient
irrigation, Hebei Province, an arid area in north China, saves 1.5
billion cubic meters of water for farm use a year.
</P>
<P>
The annual per capita share of fresh water in Hebei, believed
to be one of the driest areas in the world, averages 200 or 300
cubic meters due to persistent drought and backward irrigation
ways.
</P>
<P>
Local governments launched a mass campaign to build drip,
spray, pipeline and other water-efficient irrigation systems in
the past few years in a bid to maintain good crop harvests.
</P>
<P>
So far, the areas irrigated with modern irrigation systems
across the province have expanded to 1.78 million ha. Some 133,300
ha of irrigated land will be added in each of the upcoming years,

WARSAW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Poland and Ukraine have decided to
further strengthen their economic cooperation, the two countries'
presidents announced at an economic summit between them.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit which ended Sunday in Rzeszow in southern
Poland, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his Ukrainian
counterpart Leonid Kuchma unanimously vowed to further boost
cooperation in the agricultural, construction, financial, electric
and energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed Saturday, Poland will provide a loan
of 20 million Ecus (about 19.6 million U.S. dollars) to help
Ukraine manufacture Polish-style combine harvesters.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is the fourth trading partner of Poland in the world
but the second among the former Soviet Union countries, with 600
percent increase of their two-way trade volumes at present. In
1997, their trade volumes reached 160 million U.S. dollars, up 16
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
A free trade agreement between Poland and Ukraine was proposed
to be signed as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Suit Supply Outstrips Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite growing demand for nice
suit from the nouveaux riches men, the domestic supply of suit has
far outstripped the market demand, today's China Daily quoted the
China National Garment Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Ling, an association official, China last
year turned out more than 10 billion suits, half of which were
exported, but only 13 million suits were sold in domestic market.
</P>
<P>
As more and more suits are stockpiled in the warehouses,
production costs of many enterprises are growing rapidly, which
has led to the rising price of suits, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She therefore urged potential suit manufacturers to make sure
of the market demand for their products before beginning
production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she pointed out that as people develop a better
taste for fashion, the demand for single trousers has increased
noticeably because more prefer to match their jackets and trousers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
But trousers, which remain a weak point with China's clothing
enterprises, need to be improved in quality, material and style to
cater better to the future market demand, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the shirt market this year, Chen said the nation's
shirt market will maintain a stable increase in the coming year,
with expected sales of more than 550 million pieces.

<HEADLINE> Pak Army Overpowers Aircraft Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A hijacking drama in southern
Pakistan ended early Monday morning when the Pakistani Army and
military commandos overpowered all the three hijackers of a Fokker
plane carrying 38 people in Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
After a standoff which lasted about eight hours, the army and
military commandos who had surrounded the plane took a swift
action at about 3:10 a.m. (local time) and foiled the hijacking
attempt. All the people aboard the plane escaped unhurt, according
to the local newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
During the scuffle, an army major received bullet wounds when
one of the hijackers opened fire. One of the three ethnic Baloch
hijackers also received head injuries in retaliatory action by the
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Just moments before the hijackers armed with pistols were
overpowered, they had handed over eight of their hostages.
</P>
<P>
The men had hijacked the aircraft Sunday evening demanding that
the plane fly to India. But a Pakistani Air Force fighter jet
intercepted the plane and forced it to land in Hyderabad, about
100 kilometers northeast of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The PK-554 plane was on its way from Gawadar, a coastal city in
the southwestern Balochistan province with 38 people including six
crew members.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers were identified by the Pakistani Defense Ministry
as members of a nationalist organization based in Balochistan.
According to official sources, they hijacked the plane to protest
against Pakistan's possible plans to detonate a nuclear device in
the province. And they were also protesting against
non-availability of development funds for the backward province.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the hijacked civilian plane landed at
Hyderabad Airport, the airport's lights were turned off.
Negotiations were started with the hijackers by a team of
officials led by a deputy commissioner in Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
It was the first plane-hijacking incident in Pakistan in a
decade. The last incident in the country occurred in 1988 when an
abortive attempt was made by a lone ethnic Pashtun gunman to
hijack a PIA plane to the Afghan capital of Kabul.

<HEADLINE> More Thai Youths Addict to Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- About 560,000 Thai children under
19 years of age have become smokers, according to a survey
conducted by Thailand's National Statistical Office, whose results
were available Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that most teenagers had tried their
first cigarette when they were about 13 or 14 years old. They said
peer pressure had made them start smoking.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB)
estimated that cigarette advertising would attract more women over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
ONCB said there would be more young Thai female smokers because
manufacturers are trying to produce cigarettes that are appealing
to them.
</P>
<P>
According to ONCB's statistics, 42,000 people died in 1996 of
diseases related to smoking in Thailand. Currently, there are 11.2
million smokers in the country, a number which increases by about
750,000 every year.

<HEADLINE> Herbal Medicine Used to Treat Kidney Transplant Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have found a
way to use herbal medicine to deal with an acute reaction caused
by a kidney transplant and call it an important development in
kidney transplant research.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Fifth Symposium on Kidney Disease on Monday said
that the discovery was made by researchers at the Nanjing Military
Area Command's General Hospital. Kidney transplants are regarded
as an effective means of treating chronic renal failure, but quite
a number fail because of the acute reaction. The researchers found
that the incidence of acute reject reaction could be reduced from
the generally accepted 30 to 40 percent to less than 5 percent
through the use of a medicine made from Leigongteng, or
"three-wing-nut".
</P>
<P>
Li Leishi, of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, began doing

<HEADLINE> Lake Monsters in Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar says that the
monsters that have been reported several times in Tianchi Lake in
China's Jilin Province are recorded far back in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuhai, 69, who studies early Chinese culture, says that
the Shanhaijing, a collection of fairy tales, contains many
accounts of turtle-shaped animals with a pig's head and black
skin, which are quite similar to monsters in the Changbai
Mountains, where the lake is located.
</P>
<P>
Some people have said that monsters had huge bodies, estimated
at 20-30 meters in width, and small heads and tails, and there are
similar stories in provincial chronicles.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Columbia have
also reported sightings of monsters in lakes, and Gong says he
believes that these are species similar to what are recorded in
Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
A great deal of energy has been spent trying to capture these
monsters, but to no avail. Gong believes that the monsters have
hideouts in mountains, with tunnels leading to lakes nearby.
</P>
<P>
"To keep their caves clean, they usually go to lakes to relieve
themselves at night," he explains, and that the feces left by
strange animals have been found near Tianchi Lake.
</P>
<P>
To feed their bulky bodies, the monsters are always looking for
food and eat fish, small animals, grass, and trees, Gong says, but
birds are their favorable food, and that these giants have enough
strength to suck down birds flying several meters above them.
</P>
<P>
And, there have been reports of flying birds falling into
Tianchi lake suddenly.

BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Double-decker buses face a good
future in China, since their numbers are expected to go from the
current 300 to 1,000 within three years, according to the latest
issue of "China Materials Distribution" monthly.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which is sponsored by China's Internal Trade
Bureau, said that regular buses, China's major form of
transportation, are long and less flexible than double-deckers,
and that a double-decker carries more passengers and takes up less
space.
</P>
<P>
The magazine says that nearly 20 cities now have double-decker
bus routes and that more cities are expected to follow, so that
within five years, China will have 2,000 of these buses.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian new President B.J.
Habibie will hold elections in six months to one year, chairman of
Indonesia's second largest Muslim organization Muhammadiyah, Amien
Rais, said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Amien Rais, who met with the president at his private residence
in South Jakarta at weekend, told reporters that much of the
meeting focused on the possibility of elections and the president
had responded affirmatively about the possibility of elections.
</P>
<P>
Habibie was quoted by local leading newspapers Monday as
saying: "Come on, how can I stay until 2003. I am only staying to
prepare for an election of a new MPR (the People's consultative
Assembly) and DPR (the House of Representatives) which is truly
chosen by the people ..."
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who assumed the presidency last Thursday after former
President Soeharto resigned, stressed that he needs support from
the whole nation to carry out his duties in implementing
political, economic and legal reforms at the current difficult
time when the country is facing a severe political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Amien Rais said he had rejected the president's invitation to
join an independent body to make proposals for reforms. He said
that if he joined, there could be an impression that he was being
co-opted.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Truce in Abkhaz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday urged the warring
sides in the conflict in Abkhaz, Georgia, to immediately effect a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov told reporters
that Russian peacekeepers have taken prudent steps to prevent an
escalation of the clashes which broke out on May 20 between the
Abkhaz militiamen and the civilians supporting the Georgian
government in Gali region of Abkhaz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian foreign ministry officials have also been
mediating between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze also
called for an immediate ceasefire on Sunday, reiterating the
conflict must be settled in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Georgian foreign ministry urged the United
Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
and other international organizations to take urgent measures to
stop the fighting in Gali.
</P>
<P>
The clashes began after Georgia refused to recognize Abkhaz as
a republic. Abkhaz, in the northwest of Georgia, declared
independence in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the United Nations and Russia, the two
sides signed a truce in May 1994. But the two sides remained
widely apart on a final settlement of the Abhkaz issue after many
rounds of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Protects Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang province has
for the second consecutive year maintained a balance between the
non-farming use of arable land and the reclaiming of idle and
waste land.
</P>
<P>
The province added nearly 10,000 ha of arable land in 1997. In
the meantime, some 7,000 ha of land were occupied for non-farming
use.
</P>
<P>
With per capita share of less than 0.04 ha of arable land, the
province has made great efforts to protect farming land to ensure
grain production and supply.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has set 1.6 million ha of farmland under
protection and adopted a system to issue certificates for use of
land for non-farming purposes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province accelerated the land reclamation
process. According to a long-term plan, the province will add
33,000 ha of new arable land and improve 333,000 ha of
low-yielding land over the next five years. To fulfill the target,
the province has adopted a series of preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Attracts Foreign Investment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been attracting more
foreign investment to its mining sector in an effort to exploit
and utilize its mineral resources and thus accelerate its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, rich in mineral resources such as gold, copper, lead,
zinc, iron and precious stones including gems, jade and diamond,
needs capital investment and technical know-how for the
exploitation of the resources.
</P>
<P>
The country began absorbing foreign investment in 1988 for the
exploitation of the resources by initiating joint ventures and
inviting foreign entrepreneurs to conduct prospecting, exploration
and production of the minerals.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in
Myanmar's mining sector exceeded 498 million U.S. dollars in 42
projects at the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of foreign companies including those from Australia,
Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United States
have been involved in the activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Canadian companies are dominating the exploitation
of the resources especially copper. They include Ivanhoe, First
Dynasty, International Panaroma and Palmer Resources.
</P>
<P>
Other foreign companies include Australia's Pacific Arc, the
U.S. East Asia and Newmont, Singapore's Sum Cheong, Thailand's
Nouveau and Atina Time Square and Japan's Tasaki.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at drawing more foreign investment to the sector, Myanmar
has conducted three rounds of competitive bidding since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the first two rounds, a total of 13 blocks each having 1,400
square kilometers were granted to 11 foreign firms for operation.
The third round of bidding, announced last July, designated 12
more new blocks for the investors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to absorbing foreign investment for mineral
exploitation, the Myanmar government has also been encouraging
local private enterprises, individuals and cooperative societies
to get involved in the activities.
</P>
<P>
Regarding mining of gems and jade, the government has not only
set up joint ventures with Thailand and Malaysia but also allowed
local private entrepreneurs to get involved.
</P>
<P>
Before 1990, the State Gems Enterprise was the sole
organization which had the right to produce gemstones and jade.
</P>
<P>
After the promulgation of Myanmar's new Gemstone Law in
September 1995, local entrepreneurs are allowed to produce,
transport and sell finished gemstones and manufacture jewelry at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar's jade and gems are well known in the world, the
country holds gems emporiums annually.
</P>
<P>
Through foreign investment in the mining sector, Myanmar has
made marked achievements in the respect, boosting the country's
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the GDP of Myanmar's mines
increased by 9.5 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year over the
previous year and the export of mineral and non-metallic products,
mainly copper, tin concentrate and gems, amounted to 32.5 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Herdsmen Build "Australian Style" Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Herdsman Niman's five-member family
could earn an annual income of 30,000 yuan (3614.45 US dollars)
when they led a nomadic life three years ago.
</P>
<P>
This year, this family of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
made 63,500 yuan from selling more livestocks.
</P>
<P>
Niman is now the owner of an Australian-style family farm. His
family has settled down with satellite-relayed communications
linking it with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Such farms have been mushrooming on the vast Bayinbuluke
Grassland.
</P>
<P>
Such farm is the result of an inspection tour of Australia made
by officials of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Jingxian
county in May, 1994.
</P>
<P>
To start such a farm, herdsmen have to build a permanent home,
a 30-square-meter sheep pen, a 300-square-meter heated pen, 66.66
hectares of circled grazing land, and 3.3 hectares of land for
growing grass.
</P>
<P>
At first, the herdsmen who were used to a nomadic life were
reluctant to adopt such farms, since it required new investments.
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1995, the area was hit by a severe snowstorm,
which killed about half of the young and 10 percent of the adult
livestocks. However, all animals on two Australian-style farms
survived. This triggered the enthusiasm of local herdsmen to build
such farms.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 810 Australian-style farms had been
built. This year, 600 more such farms are expected to be
constructed in the county.

<P>
Rome, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One of the Sicilian Mafia's top
bosses, an alleged extortionist and assassin, was arrested Sunday
morning in his Palermo apartment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pino Guastella, 44, was found shaving in his luxurious home in
the Sicilian capital when police officers who had been tracking
him for two months burst in.
</P>
<P>
"He was unarmed and offered no resistance," one of the
arresting officer said.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Guastella was one of the new protege of
godfathers who had taken over the Cosa Nostra, Sicilian Mafia,
after the arrest of supreme leader Toto Riina in 1993 and several
Riina's lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
He has been charged with murders and running an extortion ring,
including an aborted plan to kidnap the son of a renowned
anti-Mafia prosecutor Piero Grasso. Grasso played a major role in
the first wave of convicting Mafia bosses in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Guastella went into hiding in 1996 after several fellow
mobsters became government informants.

MADRID, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a joint operation by the
Italian and Spanish police, a top Sicilian mafia boss who had
attempted to flee Italy earlier this month just days before his
final sentencing was re-captured Sunday night in southern Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pasquale Cuntrera, convicted of drug trafficking but free
between trials on a legal technicality, was tracked down and
arrested in the southern Spanish resort of Malaga.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Cuntrera, a Sicilian extradited from Venezuela,
was convicted of running an international drug trafficking ring
between Italy and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, a court ordered him released from a prison in central
Italy on a technicality because a delay in the start of a second
appeals trial would have extended his terms of preventive
detention beyond the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
Police had been keeping an eye on Cuntrera while magistrates
prepared another arrest warrant but the wheelchair-bound gang boss
apparently managed to do a bunk.
</P>
<P>
Cuntrera was sentenced to 21 years in prison in an earlier
trial.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Silvering Technology Helps Save Silver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Silvering technology recently
developed in China's Zhejiang Province is expected to help save 20
percent of the silver used in thermoses.
</P>
<P>
Researchers use a new chemical agent in the glass liner of
thermos, improving the utilization rate of silver nitrate and say
that it will not reduce the insulation capacity or shorten the
life of the thermos.
</P>
<P>
China produces more than 350 million thermoses annually, a
process that consumes 100,000 kilograms of silver nitrate. If
the new technology is used across China, about 20,000
kilograms of silver nitrate, or 13,000 kilograms of silver can be
saved annually, the researchers say.
