<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing on Yugoslavia Damages Greek Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union of Enterprises
and Businessmen said here Thursday that the airstrikes by NATO
against Yugoslavia was affecting the Greek economy, creating
problems for almost 3,500 businesses across the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the union said that hotels in
northern Greece were already suffering from waves of cancellations
from abroad, costing Greek tourism 300 billion drachmas (about 1
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Greece's exporting companies would never receive compensation
for their losses in Yugoslavia, agricultural cooperatives were
suffering a drop in sales, transport companies faced huge problems
due to an increased transportation costs while fuel and shipping
companies would lose because of an oil embargo on Yugoslavia, the
union added.
</P>
<P>
The union urged the Greek government to start assessing the
damages suffered by all businesses and to ask for a direct
compensation from the European Union executive.
</P>
<P>
Greece's National Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
reportedly said that the new conditions created by the Yugoslav
crisis had postponed by three to four months the expected "spring"
of the Greek economy, inflation reductions and growth rate were
also expected to slow.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government said recently that the crisis in
Yugoslavia had already cost the Greek economy at least 200 billion
drachmas (about 666 million dollars) and reduced the country's
economic growth by 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> France: Yugoslav War Has No Big Impact on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France said on Thursday that the
Yugoslav war has no big impact on the morale of the French
consumers and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said at a press briefing that the French economy is
expected to grow by from 2.5 to 3 percent in the second half of
1999, as was predicted before the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
``I did not see that that (the Yugoslav conflict) had any
impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The French official statistics institution INSEE said on
Thursday that the household consumptions of manufactured goods
increased by 3 percent in the first quarter this year, which it
said was an exceptionally high rate.
</P>
<P>
The INSEE also said French industries are showing signs of
optimism about growth.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that the ``cycle of
confidence-consumption-growth continues to function properly in
the French economy,''especially among the small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that big enterprises are faced with some
problems in seeking profits.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Emergency Credit Line to Help Meet Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) declared Thursday it has opened an emergency line of
credit amounting to 200 million U.S. dollars to assist Latin
American and Caribbean countries in preparing and adapting their
informatics systems to year 2000 requirements.
</P>
<P>
The bank in a statement warned that many countries of the
region were behind in reprogramming existing data systems or
purchasing new systems that are needed to face "a technological
emergency generally known as the Year 2000 Problem."
</P>
<P>
Among the activities that will be financed by the IDB's
emergency credit line are those related to preparing contingency
plans to manage and cope with system failures that might occur
after December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Y2K problem stems from the fact that, in early
years of computer systems development, programmers to save memory
stored the years as two-digit numbers instead of four digits.
Therefore, computers beginning January 1, 2000, may read the year
2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
"This lack of numeric capability will cause programs to make
fundamental errors in the computations and processing, which in
turn could cause the collapse of many data systems now used in
public and private sector operations," the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to contingency planning, the emergency credit line
will finance training of computer personnel in preparing and
implementing upgrades in computerized systems, crisis management
and recovery, testing, and procurement of new programs, equipment
and consulting services.

The report said the destructive worms have destroyed large
tracts of farms in 11 regions with Morogora and Dodoma in the
central part being the worst affected.

<HEADLINE> S. African Iron, Steel Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South African iron and steel
giant Iscor announced in Pretoria Thursday that its steel output
fell 26 percent to 1.2 million tons in the March quarter against
1.7 millions in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Iscor said it expected a "significantly higher loss" from its
steel operations in the second half of the financial year.
</P>
<P>
Local steel sales at 621,000 tons were 12 percent down on last
year while export sales decreased by 15 percent to 427,000 tons in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Iron ore production at 5.9 million tons was nine percent down
on the same three months of 1998 (6.5 million tons).
</P>
<P>
Iscor said export markets had been under severe pressure as a
result of the drop in demand in the Far East and large scale
dumping of surplus production especially by Japan, Korea and
ex-Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIS stands for 12 republic of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"While the general consensus is that steel prices have bottomed
and that recently announced domestic price increases in the United
States and the European Union seem to be holding, it is expected
to take some time before export prices pick up meaningfully, said
the steel giant.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Enhanced Cooperation Among Stakeholders in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation and
coordination among all the stakeholders in the development process
the world economy must continue to be reinforced, the United
Nations stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of Bretton Woods leaders with the United
Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette said to achieve sustainable
development, a holistic approach was required, one that attempts
to integrate economic, social, political and environmental goals.
</P>
<P>
All actors must pull in the same direction and work together in
such a way as to maximize the impact of available resources,
Frechette said.
</P>
<P>
This was why the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the
United Nations Development Program Framework and it was also the
goal World Bank President Jim Welfensohn was pursuing with his
proposal for a "Comprehensive Development Framework", Frechette
continued.
</P>
<P>
It must be in the interest of all that these various
initiatives complement and support one another, she added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second-ever meeting of Bretton Woods leaders with
ECOSOC. Recovery of emerging market countries hit hard by
financial contagion and possible adjustments in global structures
monitoring and providing liquidity in emergency situations are
among the issues raised at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first such meeting took place in April 1998 in New York.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official on External Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official called
here Thursday on the creditor nations to take additional steps
bilaterally to ease the debt of the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, chairman of the U.N. Development
Committee, told a special high-level meeting with the Bretton Wood
institutions that although more than 6 billion U.S. dollars of
debt relief has occurred for seven countries, the results fall
short of what is needed.
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee convened Wednesday, concentrating on
international policy on external debt, economic crisis and social
policy.
</P>
<P>
Nimmanahaeminda, also Thai Finance Minister, was briefing the
special high-level meeting on the results of his committee's
discussions. The special gathering involving the U.N. Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC), the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, is the second of its kind in a year. The first was
held last April in Washington amid financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that ministers from creditor nations agreed to examine
options that would make the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative debt relief broader, deeper and faster.
</P>
<P>
However they insisted that there should be a close link between
debt reduction and helping countries achieve the goals of
sustainable development and poverty reduction, according to
Nimmanahaeminda.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank should concentrate on translating broad
principles into practical, country-specific results, based on the
Bank's considerable experience in promoting poverty-reducing
development, the Thai minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mats Karlsson, Sweden's state secretary for international
development cooperation, said at the special meeting that despite
significant progress in the developing world, "we are by far not
making sufficient progress in eradicating poverty."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in some areas there is even rising poverty, rising
mortality rates and growing inequality. Current forecasts suggest
that only South Asia and China will reduce poverty by half by
2015, assuming inequality does not worsen," Karlsson noted.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish official believed that development assistance is
not the key to everything, but "we need it badly and can make
every efficient use of it."
</P>
<P>
Karlsson pointed out that foreign aid levels are the lowest
for almost fifty years and this trend must be reversed. "We must
again approach the 0.7 percent target,"he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to facilitate the task of securing
adequate financial flows for development, adding the pattern of
distribution of foreign investment in the developing world is
uneven with 80 percent concentrating to 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business
Affairs Alan Larson underlined the social and political
foundations of resilient economies. However, he stood short of
clarifying U.S. policy on debt and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The one-day special meeting sticked to the theme of "The
functioning of international financial markets and stability in
financing for development." However, no statement is expected to
issue at its end.

<HEADLINE> Harvest Expected in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The long rains in most
areas of Tanzania are expected to continue till mid-May and bring
a harvest to the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here Thursday by the Directorate of
Meteorology said the season crops are in good condition with the
blessings of favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
The rains would mean a great relief to more than one million
people who have been plagued by a crop failure due to a drought
starting last October. The government has recently entered into
contracts with several companies to import 100,000 tons of maize
to ease food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Directorate of Meteorology advised farmers to
observe normal agricultural practices such as weeding out grass
and controlling pests in order to secure a harvest.
</P>
<P>
The statement said long rains will be followed by dominant dry
spells over the northern coast and northeastern highlands with
interruption of a few rains.
</P>
<P>
The southern and central areas of the country, added the
statement, will mainly feature dry and cool weather condition
except for a few occasions of light rains over the southern
highlands.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Victoria basin, especially in the northwestern Kagera
Region, will continue to get reduced rainfall after mid-May, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The on-going long rains have fared well ever since they started
at the beginning of March in most areas of Tanzania but sometimes
caused flooding in the low areas.
</P>
<P>
The La Nina phenomenon has continued to dominate the tropical
Pacific Ocean since March, and as a result the cold weather in
Tanzania is expected to last for at least another three to six
months, the statement said.

DAMASCUS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Syrian People's
Assembly (parliament) Abdul-Kader Kaddoura decided to form a
parliamentary friendship group with Iran on the eve of Iranian
President Mohammed Khatami's visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The decision, issued on Thursday, aims to strengthen and
develop the Syrian-Iranian parliamentary ties, the Syrian Arab News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is scheduled to pay a visit to Syria from May 13 to 15
as part of a tour that will also take him to Saudi Arabia and
Qatar, according to diplomatic sources here.
</P>
<P>
Syria will be the first Arab country to be visited by the
Iranian leader since he took office 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
He is going to hold talks with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
on the latest developments of the situation in the Middle East
especially after the mounting tension in south Lebanon as well as
the situation in Iraq and the bilateral relations between Syria
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iran enjoy very close and strategic relations since
the Islamic Revolution in Iran 1979.
</P>
<P>
Assad visited Iran twice after Khatami's assumption of power to
bid farewell to ex-president Hashemi Rafsanjani and
congratulate Khatami and to attend the summit of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) held in Tehran last year.

<HEADLINE> Germany and Russia Differ Over Kosovo Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 29 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
visiting Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin Thursday differed over
whether an international Kosovo peacekeeping force should be under
the mandate of the NATO or the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after his talks with the host he was
optimistic over Belgrade's offer to allow an international force
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
" It is a very big step," Chernomyrdin told the press, adding
that Moscow believes Yugoslavia is following a line which will
guarantee safe return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The force, he added, must be under the United Nations and would
include Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Everything possible must be done to halt the NATO attacks on
Yugoslavia and Kosovo, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed it was firm NATO policy that the Kosovar
refugees should be protected by NATO-cored troops, and NATO air
attacks would halt only after Yugoslavia began withdrawing forces
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, Schroeder warmly praised Russia's mediating endeavor
by saying, "lasting peace in the region is not possible without
the participation of Russia."
</P>
<P>
By his talks with Chernomyrdin, the positions of two sides
were certainly coming closer, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
German officials said Chernomyrdin's visit and the visit of U.S.
President Bill Clinton scheduled for next week showed Bonn's
policy of trying to bridge the gap with dialogue was slowly moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will leave for Rome after his visit to Germany,
and then fly to Belgrade. After his talks in Yugoslavia he is due
to make stop in Paris and London this Friday and Saturday.

1986 bombing of Libya's Tripoli and Benghazi and former White
House officials John Poindexter and Oliver North were among them.
</P>
<P>
Libyan U.N. representative Abuzed Dorda submitted a 17-page

victims.
</P>
<P>
The charges by Libya included carrying out with murderous
intent actions of such a nature as to endanger public safety by
causing the collapse of certain private and public
building, willfully and in cold blood murdering the named victims
and causing serious bodily harm to others.
</P>
<P>
The United States attacked Tripoli and Benghazi on April 15,

<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France said on Thursday that it
will not make with Russia a joint proposal on Yugoslavia to the
United Nations Security Council now, because there are still many
problems to deal with in the diplomatic field.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Radio France
Internationale that France is not ready yet to draft with Russia a
resolution which could be discussed immediately by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
``We are working very hard, we are making progress, but have
not made it yet, because we are still not in a position to draft a
resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are still some problems to overcome, notably
the organization of an international force in Kosovo, which is
always rejected by the Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, a future international force in Kosovo must
be efficient, not like that in Bosnia which has different
sections, some under the command of NATO, and some under the
command of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with France 2 television channel,
Vedrine said that Western countries must make diplomatic efforts
simultaneous with military pressure to prepare for a political
solution to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some French political personalities, including the National
Secretary of the Communist Party Robert Hue and former Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua, have called on the government to take

<HEADLINE> Egypt Backs Palestinians' Decision on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Thursday voiced his country's support for a Palestinian
statement including a decision on postponing declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Moussa said the statement, issued
earlier in the day by the Palestine Liberation Organization
Central Council, made clear that the council will be in session
till June when the Palestinian leadership will decide on a date
for declaring an independent state.
</P>
<P>
He said the statement has reflected the increasing Palestinian
confidence in international support for the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had hinted on several
occasions that he would declare the Palestinian state on May 4
when the five-year interim period under the Oslo Accord signed
with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
But many countries that Arafat visited recently reportedly
advised him to put off the declaration of statehood in a bid to
avoid complicating the Mideast peace process before Israel's
general elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed conviction that the Palestinian decision
has derived from "a responsible stance."

<HEADLINE> Power Supply in Iraq to Improve by June: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's electricity supply will
be improved by the end of May, said Iraqi Minister of Industry and
Minerals Hussein Kamel al-Majid on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Majid said the Patriotic Reconstruction Committee of the
ministry, which is responsible for mobilizing national efforts to
reconstruct and repair the power system, is due to fulfil its duty
by the end of May, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the supply of electricity will become
stable during this summer.
</P>
<P>
These days, power outage in Baghdad has amounted to six to nine
hours every day and the situation is even worse in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Majid said that within the framework of the oil-for-food
program, discussions with a Chinese company that manufactures
electric equipment were positive and fruitful. But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, Iraq has been allowed to
export limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused the U.S. and British representatives at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of hindering the approval of Iraqi
contracts to purchase electric equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq would implement reconstruction projects
on its own.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 Gulf War set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
U.S.-led allied forces damaged most of Iraq's infrastructure,
including that in the electricity sector.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR To Continue Humanitarian Actions in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will continue its humanitarian
actions in Angola, one UNHCR official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albert-Alain Peters, the UNHCR official in charge of the
African affairs, made the pledge at a press conference in Angolan
capital Luanda here.
</P>
<P>
The problem of refugees is very serious in the Great Lakes
region and in the war-torn Angola in particular, Peters pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The refugees urgently need protection and relief aid from the
international community so that they can return to their own
countries at the normal speed.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official disclosed that there are in Angola 12,000
foreign refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and
other countries, adding that there are over 300,000 Angolan
refugees in the DRC, Zambia and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
There are some seven million refugees in the African continent,
Peters noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that as wars and conflicts prolong, the humanitarian
situation of refugees could worsen, thereby bring further pressure
to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the purpose of his current trip to Angola is
to learn about the humanitarian situation in this southern African
country so as to prepare for the future work.
</P>
<P>
Peters who arrived in Luanda Tuesday left for South Africa
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> House Prices Decline in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- House prices in South Africa
declined in real terms by 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the
year, compared to the same period in 1998, the ABSA banking group
said in a latest review.
</P>
<P>
The average price of a house (80-350 square meters) increased
by only 2.3 percent to around 203,800 rand (33,960 U.S. dollars)
in the first quarter of 1999 as opposed to the same quarter in
1998. In real terms, this represented a year-on-year decline of
5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, house prices also declined for
the first time on a quarter-to-quarter basis since 1992, the
banking group said.
</P>
<P>
"These developments reflect the negative impact of the high
interest rates on the housing market," it said. "The declining
trend in the mortgage rate since October last year has however
contributed to a strong increase in the volume of bond
applications in the first quarter of 1999."
</P>
<P>
In the period under review, the monthly repayment of a new
mortgage on an average house over a repayment period of 20 years
at an interest rate of 21 percent came to some 2,890 rand (480
dollars). This compared to 2,545 rand (424 dollars) a month in
the same quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The difference was the result of the mortgage rate being 2.3
percentage points higher.
</P>
<P>
The review believed that with the decline in inflation and
interest rates, house prices may pick up in the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the mortgage rate would drop to about 16
percent at year end from 19 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Host Nile States Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian official said
Thursday that riparian states of the Nile River will hold a
two-day ministerial meeting here on May 12-13, 1999 to discuss
ways for equitable utilization of the common Nile basin water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water Resources Jarsso Shiferaw told journalists
here that the ministerial meeting will seek ways for the
implementation of the agreement on the equitable use of water
resources in the Nile basin which was reached in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Ministers in charge of water affairs from Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania and
Uganda signed the agreement on the equitable use of water
resources in the Nile River reaches at an Extraordinary Meeting of
the Council of Ministers for Water Affairs in the Nile Basin.
</P>
<P>
There will be two meets before the ministerial meeting,
Shiferaw said, adding that first meet scheduled for May 4-7 will
be attended by experts while a technical committee will meet on
May 10-11.
</P>
<P>
He added that the experts meeting will design the shared vision
of the riparian states and identify the measures that should be
taken to realize the goals.

<HEADLINE> 24 Iraqis Injured in U.S.- British Air Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Iraqi civilians
were injured on Thursday when U.S. and British warplanes bombed
one residential quarter in the north and civilian and military
targets in the south, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 14:00 (1000 GMT) 10 formations
of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace bombed a
residential quarter in the northern city of Mosul, leading to
the injuries of 20 residents and the destruction of 14 houses.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced the enemy planes
to flee at 16:50 (1250 GMT) to their base in Turkey, the
Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that at 9:12 (0512 GMT) and 12:55 (0855 GMT)
18 formations of enemy warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Muthana, Nasiriya and
Misan provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed civilian facilities and military
sites in Nasiriya province, injuring four civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defenses in this region fired surface-to-air
missiles at the invading planes and forced them to flee at
17:30 (1330 GMT) to their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the U.S. and British warplanes have intensified
their attacks on Iraqi targets recently.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. and British warplanes attacked Iraqi
civilian facilities in the north, killing four people and
injuring several others.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night of airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leaders have repeatedly declared that Iraq does not
recognize the no-fly zones and vowed to continue confronting
any allied warplane violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim
of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> 6 Million Weed Eating Weevils Put into Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of six million
weevils have been put into Lake Victoria to curb the rampant
growth of the hyacinth weed which have hampered the free movement
of vessels and affected biodiversity in the largest African lake.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Lake Environment Management Project
(LEVMP), Peter Mjema, said here Wednesday that the weevils,
released between August of 1997 and March this year, have been
reared in different centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Thursday quoted Mjema as telling a workshop on
environment issues that the weed eating beetles have multiplied
into billions in the lake shared by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The released weevils, he said, fall into two species which were
imported from Benin in 1995 and have been reared at the Kibaha
Biological Control Centers, Sigi and Pangani rivers in the
northern Tanga Region and in the areas around the world's second
largest freshwater lake.
</P>
<P>
Although the environment official could not say how many tons
of hyacinth had so far been destroyed by the weevils, he was
optimistic that the biological control means would succeed.
</P>
<P>
He said biological control of the hyacinth that have encroached
on all bays of the lake would be won, taking into consideration
that the weevils matured in 60 days in Tanzania, compared with 90
days in Benin.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to get as many weevils as possible to fight the
water weed in Lake Victoria," he said.
</P>
<P>
First noticed in 1989, the weed has spread like wild fire, and
has formed a dense mat, blocking sunlight for organisms below,
depleting the low concentrations of oxygen and trapping fishing
boats and nets of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
The hyacinth is an ideal habitat for snails that cause
bilharzia. Scientists have desperately tried to control the weed.
</P>
<P>
People around the lake have also used mechanical means to
control the merciless, free-floating weed which reproduced
rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Scare Reported In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police said Thursday
there was a bomb scare at the Post and Telecommunications Company
(PTC) headquarters in Harare in the morning which resulted in
hundreds of PTC staff and other workers from nearby buildings
being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Jeffrey Mahachi, officer commanding
Harare district, told the Zimbabwe News Agency that an anonymous
caller phoned the PTC's reception saying there was a bomb in the
building which could explode any time.
</P>
<P>
The bomb disposal unit searched the whole building in vain.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the public to come forward with information
which might lead to the arrest of the culprits who made false
reports about bombs, saying this disrupted businesses in the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The bomb scare at the PTC headquarters was the third in recent
weeks. On Wednesday there was another scare at the Sheraton Hotel
in the Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
Last week there was a report of a bomb scare at the Zimbabwe
Broadcasting studios in Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city, the news agency reported.

<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Ten members of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels were killed in a military
operation launched by the Turkish security forces in southeastern
Turkey, an official statement reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the Emergency Regional
Rule said that two soldiers of the security forces also died

</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by the Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been jailed on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa for
trial on the charges of treason.

PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
will visit Albania and Macedonia on Friday and Saturday to show
his support to the two countries bordering the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, announced the government on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jospin will hold talks with the leaders of
the two countries, visit refugee camps and see the French troops
stationed in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will also sign a 45 million franc (7.5 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges to Reverse Trend of Declining ODA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette on Thursday urged the
international community to take concrete steps to reverse the
trend of declining official development assistance(ODA)
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of Bretton Woods leaders with the U.N.
Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC), Frechette said the role of
trade and private investment in the development process was now
well recognized, but ODA had played and would continue to play a
critical role in many of the poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative that the decline of ODA be reversed, and that
further steps be taken to relieve the burden of external debt
carried by the highly indebted countries, Frechette said.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the recent proposals to expend the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries initiatives and to further reduce official
bilateral debt, the United Nations continued to stress that action
on debt should not be taken at the expense of ODA, Frechette
added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second-ever meeting of Bretton Woods leaders with
ECOSOC. Recovery of emerging market countries hit hard by
financial contagion and possible adjustments in global structures
monitoring finance flows and providing liquidity in emergency
situations are among the issues raised at the meeting.  Endiem

CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Thursday that he will hold "important talks" with
his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy who will be here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to the talks because Canada is an
important member of the United Nations Security Council and a key
state that plays an instrumental role in (helping promote) the
Middle East peace process," Moussa said, commenting on Axworthy's
upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy will be in Cairo for a two-day visit, during which he
will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Moussa
on the Mideast peacemaking and ways of promoting the bilateral
ties, especially in the fields of trade and investment, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa praised as positive Canada's role in its work for
refugees in the Middle East, in the country's capacity of chairman
of the multilateral working group on refugees.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Egypt's appreciation for Canada's work in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli conflicts in the past half century and
Israel's occupation of Arab lands have reduced millions of
Palestinians to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral working group was formed under the framework
of the 1991 Mideast peace conference in Madrid, Spain.

<HEADLINE> Angola-EU Fishery Pact Extended for Another Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Council of Ministers
has decided to extend for another year the agreement on fishery
cooperation between Angola and the European Union (EU), effective
as of May 1.
</P>
<P>
The government gazette issued here Thursday said both sides
think positively of the achievements in their cooperation in
fishery for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
They would pay more attention to the actual benefits of their
cooperation during the extended period.
</P>
<P>
The EU will increase scholarships for the Angolan trainees and
the Angolan government can send personnel to be trained in any of
the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has agreed to liberalize the licensing
process toward the ship owners interested in fishing in the
Angolan seas. They can now apply for fishing license from the
Angolan Ministry of Fisheries through the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
But the sales of the licensed fishing ships should be managed
by the Angolan residents formally acknowledged by the authorities
so that the Angolan government can secure the 40 percent share as
stipulated in the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the fishery accord signed on May 3, 1996, the
Angolan government may issue licenses to EU ships, allowing them
to fish in its coastal areas. The EU fishing ships should give 40
percent of their catch to the Angolan government in addition to
the EU technical support for the Angolan fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
Angola boasts of one of the richest fishing fields in Africa
with a commercial reserve of 850,000 tons of various fishes per
year.
</P>
<P>
For last year, 230,000 tons of fish were caught with 100,000
tons by foreign fishing ships.
</P>
<P>
The EU ships account for over half of the formally registered
foreign fleets fishing in the Angolan seas.

<HEADLINE> 59% of Potential Voters Back ANC in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- With less than a month to go
before the elections, South Africa's ruling African National
Congress (ANC) enjoys the support of 59 percent of the country's
potential voters, according to a new opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll conducted by the Institute for
Democracy in South Africa (Idasa) and Markinor were released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted among 3,288 South Africans on March 24
indicated that support for the ruling party has increased by five
percent since the last Idasa poll in October/November last year.
</P>
<P>
This figure was, however, well short of the 65 percent support
rate predicted by the most recent survey published by Markdata on
April 17.
</P>
<P>
The new Idasa/Markinor survey also indicated that support for
the New National Party had fallen one percentage point to eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
Support for the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) had dropped from
five percent to four percent while that for the Democratic Party
had increased from five percent to six percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement's support dropped one percentage
point to two percent.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994 elections, the New National Party, which was called
the National Party at that time, won 20.5 percent of the votes,
and the IFP, 10. 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Meeting on Gas Pipeline Held in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting involving
Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan on a massive gas pipeline
project was held here Thursday with the three parties renewing
their strong commitment to the project.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistan's minister
for petroleum and natural resources, Batyr Sardjaev, deputy prime
minister of Turkmenistan, Redjepbai Arzov, Turkmenistan's minister
for oil, and Ahmed Jan, the Taliban official for industries and
mines.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have agreed that the 2-billion-U.S.-dollar
gas pipeline project will have an immediate positive impact on the
current situation prevailing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration issued after the meeting said the
implementation of the project will not only help restore peace in
Afghanistan but also give an impetus to the process of the
economic revival of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The planned 1,280-kilometer gas pipeline is designed to carry
gas to Pakistan from Turkmenistan via Afghanistan. It will connect
the Dauletabad gas field in southeastern Turkmenistan to Multan in
Pakistan's Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline, which will be 48 inches in diameter, is
designed to carry 20 billion cubic meters of gas every year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first major investment in Afghanistan in the last two
decades and will run through the west and south of the country
which is now under the Taliban's control.
</P>
<P>
"This project will definitely have long-lasting positive
effects not only for the participating countries but also for the
people of the entire region," said the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
The three parties agreed to meet every three months to review
progress and take required decisions.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their resolve to work closely to expedite the
start of the project at the earliest time.

<HEADLINE> EU Needs Common Foreign and Security Policy: Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) needs a
common foreign and security policy (CFSP), visiting Italian
Deputy Foreign Minister Umberto Ranieri said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, Ranieri said he hopes talks about Cyprus' accession to
EU and the U.N.-led peace effort to solve the island's political
issue will yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
Italy has signed a joint statement with three other EU
member-states that the absence of a Cyprus solution may pose
problems to the CFSP.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the statement, Ranieri said "it is very
important for Europe to have a common security and foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, he said, has to march along two parallel tracks, on one
hand, the accession negotiations and on the other, the peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides said any progress on one process will
have benefits on the other.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful to conclude the negotiations successfully and
join EU, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides described his talks with Ranieri as "very helpful
and constructive".

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the State Duma of
the Russian Federation Guennady N. Seleznev Thursday asked both
Pakistan and India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
This is imperative for ensuring peace and security in the
region, Seleznev, who is here on a three-day visit, said at a
press conference Thursday evening at the Russian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia is deeply concerned with the nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Seleznev said it would be in the
interests of India and Pakistan to restrain from nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear weapons can serve as deterrence, but it does not
provide guarantee against emergence of some serious problem," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Russia considers India as its dependable strategic partner in
the region, he said, adding that these relations in no manner
jeopardize Russia's ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
To another question about the Kashmir dispute, Seleznev ruled
out military option for resolving the Kashmir issue and said this
could further deteriorate the situation.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the recent talks between India and Pakistan as well
as the Lahore Declaration signed by the prime ministers of the two
countries, describing them as a positive move to settle their
outstanding disputes.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev said third party mediation may not be forthcoming for
this purpose, as the two countries have not formally asked for it.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader was of the view that it would be more
appropriate for the two South Asian nations to settle their
disputes through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan crisis, Seleznev said, "A coalition of
broad-based government could provide a guarantee for securing
durable peace" in Afghanistan for which, he said, Pakistan can
play a more effective role.
</P>
<P>
Russia, he added, is willing to cooperate with the U.N. peace
mission for bringing peace in the region. He said the warring
Afghan factions should come closer to each other to provide peace
to their people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the smuggling of arms and illicit
drugs to his country and held the extremists groups in Afghanistan
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said the some extremists ethnic groups
working in Pakistan and Afghanistan are involved in setting up
military camps close to their border for instigating certain
elements in his country.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev, however, ruled out the involvement of the Pakistani
government in such activities in any manner whatsoever, saying he
did not believe that the Pakistani government is involved in
interfering in the affairs of his country.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev, who arrived here Wednesday, termed his visit very
successful and said it laid a strong basis for further promoting
cooperation between Russia and Pakistan in all fields of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in the federal capital, he said he held
useful meetings with Pakistani leaders and parliamentarians, which
helped promote understanding of regional and international issues
and remove hurdles to strengthening the bilateral economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks between the two sides indicated their
willingness to forget the old bitterness and start a new era of
cooperation for their mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns It's Not Time to Make Complacency of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- It was not the time to
make complacency of the world economy although the worst fears of
a global recession did not materialize, a senior U.N. official
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of Bretton Woods leaders with the U.N.
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette said the effects of the
financial crisis were still with us and it would be a grave
mistake to return to buiness as usual.
</P>
<P>
The rate of growth of the world economy had been slowing down,
and the present rate was not high enough to reduce the high levels
of unemployment in many industrial countries, or even to sustain
existing levels of imports from developing countries, Frechette
said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the price of primary commodities, which were the
principle source of export earnings for many such countries,
further dampened any hope of rapid growth in the developing world,
Frechette said.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Secretary-General said in many developing countries,
the crisis had reversed in a matter of months the social gains of
several decades, and its impact would continue to be felt for some
time to come.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the developing world remained on the margins of
the global market, and could not enjoy the potential benefits of
the liberalized world economy, and hundreds of millions of people
continued to live at a subsistence level, with little hope of a
better future for their children, she added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second-ever meeting by Bretton Woods leaders with
ECOSOC, in which the topics of recovery of emerging market
countries hit by financial contagion and possible adjustments in
global structures monitoring finance flows and providing liquidity
in emergency situations are discussed.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Warns Danger of NATO Bombing for Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The environmental organization
Greenpeace warned here Thursday that NATO's ongoing airstrikes
against Yugoslavia would have enormous repercussions for the
environment of the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greenpeace representatives in
Athens said that all conditions existed for the production of
dioxin and toxic compounds which could travel great distances
depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions.
</P>
<P>
The results of tests conducted by the universities of Greece's
Thessaloniki and Thrace showed that the levels of dioxin in the
atmosphere in the northeastern region of Thrace were increasing
when air masses arrived from Yugoslavia, they said.
</P>
<P>
There was also a threat from the recycled uranium used in NATO
bombs, they said, adding that every use of shells or bombs with
recycled uranium was criminal and should be banned by
international convention.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace stressed that only a political solution could put an
end to the bombing in Yugoslavia, guarantee peace in the region
and alleviate the suffering of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Being deeply concerned about NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and
the consequences it has on the environment, Greece has decided
recently to set up an advisory panel to monitor pollution levels
and any toxic fallout in the atmosphere.

<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An Egyptian telecommunications group called Mobinil
has announced that it intends to invest 200 million U.S. dollars
to operate telephone networks in five Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Mobinil, an affiliate of Orascom Technologies, also intends to
obtain a majority share in a telecommunications company in Jordan,
the Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia and the European Commission have concluded an
agreement, under which the EU will offer a grant of 9.6 million
Euro (5.8 million U.S. dollars) to finance a job-creating project.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday the five-year
project is designed to help some 1,000 people to set up small
enterprises and provide job opportunities to about 6,300 others.
</P>
<P>
The project will also involve vocational training to job

up to the Arab world. Lebanon signed similar documents with Syria,
Egypt and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Gulf International Bank (GIB) declared that it
would buy a leading Saudi investment bank in Britain, which will

<HEADLINE> Ex Govt Official Re-arrested after Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Police in western Rwanda
re-arrested former assistant of Kibuye prefecture Ignace Banyaga,
after a dubious acquittal by a local criminal court on Monday,
Rwandan Justice Minister Jean de Dieu Mucyo said in Kigali, the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''There is evidence that his release was questionable as the
suspect himself had confessed to some of the crimes he was charged
of,'' the head of one human rights association told RNA.
</P>
<P>
Banyaga served as the personal secretary of the then governor of
Kibuye, Clement Kayishema, now detained in the custody of the
United Nations Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha for involvement in
the genocide of thousands of Tutsis in Kibuye in April-July 1994.
He was arrested in March 1997, following protests by the
residents who knew about his involvement in the massacres.
</P>
<P>
Up to 250,000 ethnic Tutsis are believed to have perished in
Kibuye during the genocide in which Kayishema and Banyaga played a
paramount role.
</P>
<P>
During hearings, Banyaga had confessed to having been a
ring-leader in the killings of Tutsis, of manning roadblocks on
which many Tutsis were killed, and distributing fuel to vehicles
transporting marauding Hutu militia who ransacked the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The release of Banyaga on Monday by the court which claimed
that it said it had found him innocent provoked an angry reaction
from other suspects and genocide survivors who staged a protest
march on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, who had requested a death sentence for Banyaga,
had threatened to appeal against Banyaga's surprising acquittal.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the ministry of justice said that Banyaga corrupted
some judges and had incriminating evidence contained in his case
file destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The genocide survivors' organization, Ibuka (remember) has
expressed great concern over creeping corruption rocking the
country's judicial system.  Last week, the cabinet suspended the
Butare General Prosecutor, Charles Kabanda, after finding him
guilty of releasing several genocide suspects in a ring of
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
''We have many corruption cases in the trial of genocide
suspects,'' Mucyo confided, ''but we are going to crack down on
corrupt judges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 124,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons. The Rwandan government in October 1998 ordered
the release of about 10,000 suspects whose case files were
incomplete or lacked enough evidence alleviate over-crowdness in
prisons.
</P>
<P>
During a two-year period, Rwandan criminals have tried over
1,500 genocide cases, and handed down over 150 death penalties.
Twenty-two genocide suspects were executed in public in April of
1998.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) confirmed on Thursday the reports that a stray
NATO missile exploded on the outskirts of Sofia, capital of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman said that a NATO aircraft in operations early
Wednesday was illuminated by a Serb air defense radar. In response
to a possible SAM threat, pilot of the aircraft fired a missile in
self-defense. However, the missile strayed from its target and
"unintentionally landed in Bulgaria" after the Serbs turned off
the ground radar, said Jamie Shea, the NATO civilian spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that there were any injuries on the
ground," he said. "NATO commanders are reviewing the incident and
will consider ways to minimize further the possibility of such
events occurring in the future," Shea added.
</P>
<P>
"I do understand that no individual suffered loss of life from
whatever happened there in Bulgaria yesterday, so at the moment we
are in touch with the Bulgarian ambassador to tell them what
information we may have on that incident......and we are still
completing our investigation," Shea told a news briefing at NATO
headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Agrees to Be Fulltime England Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan has taken the England
coach as a full time job and ended to speculation over his short-
term, part-time tenure of the position.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who took over as caretaker in February when Glenn
Hoddle was fired amid condemnation of his reported comments on the
disabled, announced after England's 1-1 draw with Hungary in
Budapest Wednesday that "I've got to stop messing around."
</P>
<P>
His decision comes just two games into his short-term contract,
which was due to expire in July, but after weeks of public
pressure to take the job.
</P>
<P>
England's Football Association acting chairman Geoff Thompson
said he hoped to finalize a deal with Keegan shortly after the end
of the domestic season in May.
</P>
<P>
In his first match as part-time coach, Keegan steered England
to a 3-1 win over Poland in a crucial Euro 2000 qualifier at
Wembley.
</P>
<P>
His next major match is against Group 5 leader Sweden, 2-1
winners over England in the first-leg match, on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, the 48-year-old former England international
had insisted he would only fulfill his commitment to four games
with the FA and would remain full-time at Fulham, which he has
steered to promotion after clinching the Division Two championship.
</P>
<P>
His next step will be to resolve the 15 months remaining on
his contract at Craven Cottage with Fulham chairman Mohamed Al
Fayed.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Leader Sichuan Quanxing stumbled
on Thursday as it lost to Jilin Aodong 2-1 in Yanji, Jilin
Province, in the seventh round of the Chinese first division
soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has never tasted victory in the Yanji stadium since the
professional league was introduced in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At Tianjin, Tianjin Taida edged idle Beijing Guo'an 2-1,
scoring its first victory over the capital club in the five-year
league.
</P>
<P>
This was also the first win for Taida, who collected just four
points before the game at the bottom of the 14-team standings.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Haishi kept undefeatable at home this season when it
defeated visitor Qingdao Hainiu 2-0 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
While Shandong Luneng was still seeking for its first home win
after seven matches as it was held to a goalless draw in a hard-
fought tie with Chongqing Longxin in Jinan, Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Match between defending champion Dalian Wanda and Wuhan Heart K

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Rise First Time in Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Thursday that sales of new single-family homes rose 2.1
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 909,000 units in
March, following a 2 percent decline in February.
</P>
<P>
It was the first increase in new-home sales since November,
when they hit an all-time record rate of 985,000 annual sales.
</P>
<P>
Low unemployment, high stock prices and low mortgage rates are
all positive factors supporting consumers' demand for homes. Sales
of existing homes also rose in March to a record annual rate of
5.05 million units.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in new-home sales reflected 24 percent
jump in sales in the West, the biggest one-month gain for that
region since a 31 percent rise in March 1995. The increase pushed
sales up in the West to an annual rate of 221,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Sales were down in the rest of the country. The Midwest
suffered the biggest decline, a 6.4 percent drop to an annual rate
of 161,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The average price for new homes sold in March rose to a record
188,800 dollars, an increase 0.5 percent from February's 187,800
average price.
</P>
<P>
The median price for new homes was 153,000 dollars, a drop of
1.5 percent from February's median sales price of 155,400 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia, S.Africa Sign Cooperative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela signed a
declaration after holding talks in the Kremlin presidential palace
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The declaration pledged to boost cooperation in the fields of
economy, science and culture as well as to improve political
contacts between Russia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It said the two countries will develop partnership according to
the United Nation's principles and on the bases of international
law and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Yeltsin and Mandela said they were
committed to strengthening the United Nations' role in global
affairs, and spoke in support of existing nuclear non-
proliferation agreements as well as other arms control pacts.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said after the talks that the declaration "opens a new
stage in cooperation between Russia and South Africa," and that "
Russia and South Africa have huge potential for that.''
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that both nations have a common
vision of global affairs, and, in particular, resent the "unipolar
world" - which is the Kremlin's reference to the United States'
perceived global domination.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries are "against the unipolar world, in
which one states dictates its will to others," and "against
attempts to ensure security of some for the sake of others."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia and South Africa are ready to build up
partnership on the bases of equality and global security and will
play active roles in ensuring regional security and peace.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the current warm relations have "deep
historic roots that go back to the times of struggle against
apartheid."
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the talks, Mandela thanked Russia for
supporting the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said it was especially important to develop closer
economic links because the two nations control a huge share of the
world's gold and diamond production.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and South Africa have improved
considerably since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and Mandela
was elected president in the nation's first multi-race elections
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and
business leaders, arrived in Moscow on April 28.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Stresses "Cities for All" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, acting Executive
Director of the U. N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat), said
Thursday that security of tenure for all urban residents is most
important in building better functioning, safer, healthier and
more equitable cities.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer, who doubles as U.N. Under-Secretary General, told a
news conference here that only when the poor in the developing
countries are free of evictions, they are mobilized to strive for
better settlements for themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. estimates, over half the urban population
in most developing countries live in informal settlements which
are neither recognized nor serviced by city authorities.
</P>
<P>
The urban poor are the most excluded group in cities and do not
have access to formal finance and loan schemes which could enable
them to improve their living conditions, said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said that the U.N. Development Program and the Habitat
have implemented the micro-finance projects to lend small sums of
money to the poor without a collateral, which most banks consider
too trivial to be lending-worthy.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the press, saying that the 17th session of the
Commission on Human Settlements will take place in Kenyan capital
Nairobi from May 5 to 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The session of the commission will review and take decisions on
the Habitat's work program in light of the ongoing revitalization
of the agency and its new strategic focus as the U.N. agency for
cities, according to Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The 2000-2001 biennial budget for the agency, cooperation with
its partners such as municipal authorities and non-governmental
organizations will also be the focus of the upcoming conference,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The pressure of the urbanizing process is easily perceived in
the developing world with inadequate shelter, lack of clean water
and security problems.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 out of 20 mega cities with more than 10 million people
will be in the developing countries at the beginning of the next
century, a U. N. research program predicts.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Backs Debt Relief for Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Irish Foreign
Minister David Andrews pledged Thursday to support the
international debt relief campaign aimed at bailing poor countries
out of economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Talking with Tanzania President Benjamin Mkapa in Tanzania's
central city of Dodoma, Andrews said that his country is a strong
advocate of debt relief program within the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the press secretary to
the president from Dodoma, Andrews said he will spread this
campaign to all relevant regional and international fora as a
matter of urgency because Ireland understands well the plight of
poor countries burdened with debts.
</P>
<P>
Leading a nine-man delegation for a two-day official visit to
Tanzania, Andrews told President Mkapa that it is the duty of
Ireland to willingly assist developing countries in terms of
grants and aid. He also said this move does not warrant any
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa on his part thanked the government of Ireland
for its assistance in helping Tanzania build its capacity for
self-development, according to the press secretary, Geoffrey M.
Nkurlu.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also appreciated the endeavors that Ireland has made on
the debt issue and hoped that the relief pace will be speeded up
to enable the countries concerned to improve their social services
for the benefit of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president reminded the Irish foreign minister that Tanzania
did not pocket the loan money from donor countries and
international financial institutions, and that is why Tanzania has
a good social network.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa pointed out that Tanzania's problem does not lie in the
social network but rather in its maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The Irish foreign minister took this opportunity to pay tribute
to Tanzania for its constructive role in bringing together all
warring parties in Burundi to the negotiating table to find a
peaceful political solution under the chairmanship of Julius
Nyerere, former Tanzanian president.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also touched on the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and the war in Yugoslavia, but no details were
given.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete, and his deputy Emanuel Mwambulukutu,
also attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Irish delegation is scheduled to visit an Irish-backed
Community Infrastructure Project (CIP) in Dar es Salaam Friday
before leaving for Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Japan Dumps Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government moved
closer Thursday to imposing punitive tariffs against Japan as the
Commerce Department concluded that Japanese producers have
illegally priced steel in U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department ruled in February that it had evidence
that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally "dumped" steel -- sold it
in U.S. markets at prices below production costs or home-market
prices. The department concluded Thursday that Japan did indeed
dump steel.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs of up to 67 percent would be imposed on hot-rolled
carbon steel from Japan if the U.S. International Trade
Commission, an independent fact-finding body, concludes that the
dumping has injured or threatens to hurt domestic producers. The
commission is to make a final ruling in early June.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling comes as lawmakers from steel-producing
states and unionized steelworkers intensify calls for quotas on
imports, which they blame for thousands of layoffs and
bankruptcies of three U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is likely to use the threat of
tariffs as evidence that quotas and other stronger actions are
unnecessary. The administration fears that stronger sanctions
could start a trade war and hurt U.S. companies that rely on
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on Brazil has been delayed until July 6. A
ruling on Russia is due June 10, but that country may be able to
avoid tariffs if its agreement to curb steel shipments to the
United States is ratified by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's steel imports surged to record highs in 1998 in
the wake of the Asian economic crisis, which drove down demand for
steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets.
</P>
<P>
The administration announced in November that any tariffs
against Japan would be made retroactive to that month. Shipments
of Japanese steel have been dropping since then, with the
exception of a one-month increase in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
held an unscheduled and private meeting with Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams Thursday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair met Adams, whose party is the
political arm of the Irish Republican Army, but gave no details of
what was discussed.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity arose and he (Blair) took it. It was a private
meeting," Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Sinn Fein spokesman, meanwhile, said Adams urged Blair to
stick to the terms of the Northern Ireland peace agreement which
did not specify when the IRA should hand over arms.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern have so far failed
to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace process over
guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Blair also met Thursday leaders of smaller Northern Irish
parties, including the Alliance Party, the Ulster Democratic Party
and the Women's Coalition, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The leading politicians in Northern Ireland are expected to
join Blair and Ahern at Downing Street next week in further talks
aimed at breaking the stalemate over disarmament, which is
threatening the peace process in the province.

<HEADLINE> Recovery Uncertain, Growth Still Fragile, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
said here Thursday that it is by no means certain that a recovery
is fully underway and measures are needed to accelerate economic
growth, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Fulci, president of the U.N. Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), said at a press conference after a special meeting with
the Bretton Woods Institutions that hopeful signs can be
discerned, but downside risks are still substantial and growth in
the world economy is still fragile.
</P>
<P>
"Growth rates are seen as unsatisfactory, particularly in
developing countries. For many such countries a crisis situation
still prevails with unacceptably low growth rates. If these do not
improve, we will not meet our goals for poverty reduction and
social advancement.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, many agreed that measures are needed to
accelerate economic growth, especially in developing countries,"
Fulci said at the end of an one-day meeting attended by officials
from ECOSOC,the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting, the second of its kind in a year, was
designed to seek ways of achieving sustainable development through
closer cooperation and coordination between the U.N. and the
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
With focus on poverty reduction, the meeting took up the
international financial architecture, financing for development
and external debt and social dimensions for discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot pursue development without addressing the financial
fundamentals, but neither can we only focus on technical solutions
without taking the development aspirations of millions of poor
people into account," the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
As for international financial architecture, Fulci said that
many of the participants believed that although positive initial
steps have been taken to address financial crises, vulnerability
still exists.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, particular concern was
expressed at the one-day meeting about the debt burden in many
African countries, especially in view of the very low commodity
prices they are facing.
</P>
<P>
"Emphasis should be placed on faster, deeper and broader debt
relief for all poor reforming countries," Fulci said, stressing
"These objectives require additional resources and that they
should not be at the expense of development assistance."
</P>
<P>
All the participants agreed that the economic crisis has
brought the social dimensions of economic policy into sharper
focus, recognizing that the social pillar is an integral part of
dealing with the economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Bretton Woods Institutions, the U.N. systems and
governments need to build strong partnerships to meet the needs of
global economic governance to reach common global goals," Fulci
from Italy said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Ties Improvement With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government Thursday
denied reports on positive developments in ties with the
U.S. after Washington Wednesday eased sanctions on Sudan, Iran and
Libya, Sudanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton approved a major revision in U.S.
sanctions policy on Iran, Libya and Sudan, legalizing sales of
food and medical items to these countries.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. policy calls for an exemption of such items from
future sanctions, but it will not affect sanctions against Iraq,
Cuba and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The revision showed the failure of the sanctions policy
Washington adopted against nations whose political orientations
differ from the U.S., Undersecretary of Sudanese Foreign Ministry
Hassan Abidine said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift the ban on some U.S. firms seeking to
export commodities to certain countries is a U.S. domestic affair
that is not a positive indicator for the Sudanese-U.S. ties,
Abidine said.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the contradiction between the U.S. administration
and its economic groups, showing that the U.S. policy toward some
countries has harmed the interests of itself.
</P>
<P>
According to the revision, items exempted from the embargo
include wheat, corn, feed, soybeans, edible oils, meat, fish, baby
food and formula.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the U.S. policy revision might clear the way for
Iran to purchase more than 500 million U.S. dollars worth of grain
and sugar.

LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Three main European stock markets
moved lower Thursday with investors taking profits after recent
rallies.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended down 1.5
percent at 6497, despite an early rally on Wall Street.

<P>
"I think the market has suffered from a lack of buyers more
than anything else, while some heavyweight stocks have fallen
sharply," said a salesman at Teather &AMP; Greenwood.

But in a move which highlighted the current isolation of
volatile blue chips, broader indices saw only marginal movements,
with the FTSE-250 actually closing 2.9 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax closed down 29.66 points at 5323.06. Volume
was "very, very low", a trader said, adding this situation led to
exaggerated movement in some stocks.

Share prices in Paris closed slightly down as a series of

Cohen did not give any details, but other defense officials

unguided iron bombs on Serb troop concentrations.

<HEADLINE> Equatorial Guinea Official Says Oil Search too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Equatorial Guinea official urges
oil company stakeholders to practise their restraint and endurance
in exploring oil in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Nguema Lima, presidential adviser at the Ministry of
Mines and Energy of Equatorial Guinea, Thursday described the
search for oil and other hydrocarbons as a capital-intensive,
time-consuming and painstaking venture.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana News Agency quoted the official in Accra the capital
of Ghana as saying that there is, therefore, the need for
restraint and endurance by all stakeholders, especially
governments, as exploration takes a long time and is a big
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Lima, who attended the third Oil and Gas Africa '99 Conference
and Exhibition which ended here Wednesday, made the remarks at an
interview with Ghana News Agency on the intricacies of oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
When a nation makes a find in commercial quantities, he said,
the waiting and money spent on the project becomes a thing of the
past, as the profits after that override the costs incurred.
</P>
<P>
Lima said Equatorial Guinea suffered initial severe setbacks,
which nearly stopped the search for oil in the country.
</P>
<P>
"But through perseverance and goodwill from governments since
independence, we have been able to get to where we are now, as a
young dynamic oil nation."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, exploration activity has focused on
two areas: offshore Bioko, which is an extension of the Niger
Delta Basin; and Rio Muni, which lies between the producing areas
of offshore Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"All the players in the industry must do is to remain
optimistic. Another aspect is to get the kind of negotiations
that will get you the big companies to explore in your area."
</P>
<P>
He said Equatorial Guinea is privileged to be lying in the hub
of the dynamic offshore petroleum province. The size of the area
under exploration is about 40,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Miguel-Angel Ondo Angue, director-general of Mines and
Hydrocarbons of the country's Ministry of Mines and Energy, said
exploration started in the 1960s, when Mobil drilled the first
wells.
</P>
<P>
However, they did not have seismic data and previously
conducted studies, he said, adding this proved to be a big
drawback initially, but they managed to pull through.
</P>
<P>
"Our first discoveries came in 1992 in the Alba fields. This
caused us to approach Cameroon, Ghana and Gabon for technical
support, which we are glad has come in handy in our present
state."
</P>
<P>
Equatorial Guinea currently produces 75,000 barrels of oil per
day. However, production levels are expected to go up with plans
to develop new platforms that will produce over 120,000 barrels a
day.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade: NATO Launches Indirect Chemical, Nuclear Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Thursday accused NATO
of violating all major international environmental conventions in
its bombing campaign against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Branislav Blazic, minister for environment of the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia, told reporters that the military alliance, by
targeting chemical factories and using munitions with depleted
uranium in its incessant air raids, which entered the 37th day, is
in effect lunching an indirect chemical and nuclear war against
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
He said the air raids have violated dozens of international
conventions, such as those on oil pollution, benzol poisoning,
prevention of risk of cancer, across-border air pollution, ozone
layer protection, protection of the flora and fauna, and
protection of workers from occupational hazards.
</P>
<P>
By hitting facilities, which not even Hitler did during World
War II, NATO is destroying the quality of air, water and soil with
toxic materials and so indirectly waging a chemical war, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the overall chemical, radioactive and other harmful
effects to the environment after 37 days of NATO bombing are
attaining proportions that will exceed the environmental
catastrophe caused by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of explosives used by NATO in Yugoslavia exceeds
by 8.3 times that thrown on Hiroshima, Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the carpet-bombing of Kosovo province with
radioactive ammunition and cluster bombs raises the question of
whether NATO truly wants the ethnic Albanian refugees to return or
is bent on creating a scorched-earth environment where nobody will
want to live.
</P>
<P>
The minister said neighboring European countries will also
suffer as a result of environmental pollution in the wake of NATO
air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the demolition of the Pancevo industrial
zone near Belgrade, a black cloud of soot and a huge white cloud
of vinyl chloride monomer rose into the air and were taken on the
wind to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In the attack on the Zastava factory in Kragujevac, a
transformer was hit, releasing tons of Pyralene, a cancer-inducing
oil that is non-biodegradable, found its way into the Morava
River, and then into the Sava and Danube rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Danube from the northern Yugoslav city of Novi Sad down to
its delta into the Black Sea is now severely polluted and a 15
kilometer long oil slick has formed in the river, the minister
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Welcomes Recommendation to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Thursday welcomed the recommendation of the Commonwealth foreign
ministers to end the country's suspension from the international
body.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said here that the Nigerian government certainly
welcome the decision of the foreign ministers announced in London
Thursday, which is a vindication of the efforts of the government
to make Nigeria to take its rightful place in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the 54-nation grouping in 1995 after
it executed nine minority rights activists including writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa.
</P>
<P>
The eight-nation Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG),
set up to investigate human rights abuses in member states with
military governments, decided unanimously Thursday that the
suspension be lifted.
</P>
<P>
A final statement issued by the CMAG meeting said "CMAG decided
to immediately recommend to Commonwealth heads of government that
Nigeria's suspension from membership of the association be
lifted."
</P>
<P>
"The group looked forward to Nigeria fully returning to the
Commonwealth with the assumption of office by the newly elected
government on May 29, 1999," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Meka Anyaoku will now send
a letter to all member governments asking them to agree to end the
suspension on May 29, the day president-elect General Olusegun
Obasanjo is due to take office.
</P>
<P>
CMAG comprises Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, Botswana,
Barbados, Malaysia, Zimbabwe and Ghana.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Disarmament Commission on Thursday met to review, for the first
time, the responses of its members to the preliminary draft
medium-term plan for disarmament for the period 2002 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary draft was introduced last week by the U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Jayantha
Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
The general orientation of the disarmament program as outlined
in the draft plan takes into account two major areas in the field
of disarmament: weapons of mass destruction and conventional
weapons, including issues of landmines, small arms, light weapons
and practical disarmament measures.
</P>
<P>
The program's overall strategy would facilitate the efforts
of the international community to address the current and future
challenges derived from those two areas.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework, the program would continue to promote,
strengthen and consolidate multilateral principles and norms for
disarmament, with emphasis on nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
It would expand its outreach activities, and promote regional
approaches to disarmament and security through the revitalized
regional centers for peace and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament program's objectives would be pursued
through its five subprograms, namely: multilateral
negotiations on arms limitation and disarmament; weapons of mass
destruction; conventional arms; monitoring, database and
information; and regional disarmament.

WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said Thursday that NATO might use force to block
vessels form any country to ship oil to Yugoslavia in defiance of
the alliance's embargo.
</P>
<P>
Both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the

</P>

"I believe that there should be an interdiction of the supplies
coming and I believe that force should always be an option," Cohen
told a press conference in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a senior NATO official said in Washington
that force cannot be used against any vessels towards Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it would fall within the category of armed
hostilities," Cohen said, adding that NATO forces "should have
whatever flexibility is required" to achieve the goal to block oil
for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"There will be serious consequences that would flow to countries
that would openly and flagrantly supply energy" to Yugoslavia,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"I would point out that any third country that appears to be in
violation of the European Union position or that of NATO certainly
runs the risk of economic or other types of political reaction as
well as the potentiality of military " force, he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also announced that he had ordered the deployment
of 10 B-52 bombers to join the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen did not give any details, but other defense officials
speaking privately had said earlier that the B-52s would drop
unguided iron bombs on Serb troop concentrations.

<HEADLINE> First Transatlantic Dinosaur Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The first dinosaur species ever
known to have roamed more than one continent has been confirmed by
Spanish scientists.
</P>
<P>
The transatlantic dinosaur fossil was found in Leiria, west
central Portugal. When researchers examined the remains, they
realized it was identical to another creature found in Colorado,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The same flesh-eating dinosaur appears to have roamed both the
American and European continents about 200 millions year ago, the
researchers reported Thursday in the Journal of the Geological
Society, published by Britain's Geological Society.
</P>
<P>
The finding has major implications for reconstructions of the
late Jurassic world and means some current theories might have to
be revised, said the researchers from the Autonomous University of
Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic ocean was believed to be open during the
late Jurassic period. But the degree of the split and the depth of
water are still the subject of arguments.
</P>
<P>
By 150 million years ago, the Atlantic is thought to have been
200 to 300 kilometers wide, which is far too deep for dinosaurs to
cross from one side to the other.
</P>
<P>
However, the new discovery shows that significant land bridges
between Europe and North America must have remained, even when the
new ocean was quite wide.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Recovery Not Broad Based: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong has said the recovery of his country's economy is
not broad based considering the regional backdrop and the
challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the point while addressing the May Day dinner Friday
evening when he himself was awarded the National Trades Union
Congress (NTUC) Medal of Honor for "his pivotal role in
Singapore's economic development and the creation of more and
better-paying jobs for workers."
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said he believes Singapore can
outperform the minus one to plus one percent growth forecast this
year.
</P>
<P>
"But even we hit two percent growth, we will still be a long
way from the eight percent we made in 1997 or the four to six
percent we hope to make after we fully recover."
</P>
<P>
He also said, "Not all sectors are recovering as quickly as
manufacturing," singling out the commerce and financial and
business services which he said are still weighed down by the
region.
</P>
<P>
Construction too is contracting because of the overhang of
private property and the slowdown in the building program of the
Housing Development Board, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's manufacturing output increased by 6.5 percent in
the first quarter of 1999 after it gyrated to positive from
negative territory in December of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing challenges in manufacturing industry, Lee said his
country's share in electronics in both the U.S. and Japan has come
down by a quarter, falling to 8.7 percent in the 4th quarter of
1998 from 12 percent market share in 1996 in the U.S and to 7.3
percent from 9.6 percent in the Japan market in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the cost cutting measures adopted by his government in
November last year will buy time in going effect and they "will
not keep all existing industries and operations going in
Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"Restructuring and upgrading will continue. So will
retrenchments," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the recovery in the region, Lee said even if growth resumes
in the region, it will not be the ebullient boom before 1997 but a
difficult, labored recovery.
</P>
<P>
The present difficulties in the region will be a drag-on
Singapore's economy, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> French Weekly Publishes Unknown NATO Clauses on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The articles, which have been on the Internet since February,
said that "NATO should be the shelter of all legal procedure, no
matter civil, administrative or criminal" for all NATO soldiers to
be deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The personnel of NATO, in all circumstances and in a permanent
way, should benefit from an immunity vis-a-vis the jurisdiction of
the parties in contact, for all the civil, administrative,
criminal or disciplinary offenses which could be committed by them
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," said the article six in
the military part of the Rambouillet agreement.
</P>
<P>
The article number eight of the same agreement said, "The
personnel of NATO should benefit, with their vehicles, their ships,
their planes and their equipment, a right of permanent access and
a right of free passage without restriction to the republic,
including its air space and its territorial waters."'
</P>
<P>
"That should include bivouac, maneuvers, stationing and using
of any field or necessary equipment for the logistics, training
and operations," it said.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Rambouillet only touched the political part of the
agreement on Kosovo in February. The talks broke down on March 19
in Paris even before the military part of the agreement was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Western countries did not have time to present
these articles to the Yugoslav delegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said here Friday that its airstrike in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had a "most intense day" since it
started daily air campaign on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"Benefiting from more than doubled the number of aircraft we
had one month ago, benefiting also from spell of good weather,
which we understand is going to continue over the next few days,
we were able to launch 600 sorties, and a large number of those
being strike sorties," a NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, told a news
briefing at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"We hit a very impressive range of targets both at the
strategic and technical level," Shea said, citing highway and
railroad bridges, a petroleum depot and a ferronickel plant, a
border post, an airfield, several groups of military vehicles
including tanks inside Kosovo, SA-3 and SA-6 SAM sites, the main
TV transmitter at headquarters of Yugoslavia army, federal ministry
buildings and police buildings in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO is ready and willing to strike those targets again
if necessary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 4.5 Percent in First Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
rapid 4.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year
because of the strong consumer demand and tight labor markets,
according to the Commerce Department's report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the strong growth in gross domestic
product (GDP), the total output of goods and services, underscored
the U.S. economy has managed to prosper despite the nation's trade
deficit, hit by global economic turmoil, rose to a record level
from January through March, subtracting 2.4 percentage points from
overall growth.
</P>
<P>
The loss of overseas markets has been offset by the strong
consumer spending, which soared at a 6.7 percent rate in the first
three months of the year, the biggest increase since a 7.2 percent
rise in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strong spending has been bolstered by the lowest
unemployment in 29 years, a soaring stock market and record highs
for consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The GDP report showed that the U.S. is enjoying the best
combination of strong growth, low unemployment and low inflation
in three decades.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Secretariat Hails Cambodia's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta-based ASEAN
Secretariat here Friday hailed the grouping's admission of
Cambodia as its tenth member.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian
Nations) Secretariat said, with Cambodia's entry, the ASEAN region
now has a population of about 500 million, a total area of 4.5
million square kilometers, a combined gross national product of
685 billion U.S. dollars, and a total trade of 720 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia officially joined the ASEAN at a special ceremony in
Hanoi, Vietnam, Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has a population of 10.4 million and a total area of
181,035 square kilometers. Cambodia is strategically located at
the center of the mainland Southeast Asia and possesses a major
seaport of Sihanoukville in the southern province of Kampot.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that ASEAN performed a diplomatic role
in the process of restoring political stability in Cambodia, which
held parliamentary election on July 26, 1998. This process led to
the formation of the new Cambodian government on November 30 of
the same year led by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member countries were among the most dynamic newly
industrializing economies in the developing world until the
outbreak of the regional financial contagion that his most of East
Asia in the middle of 1997, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, most ASEAN economies grew at a pace
of 6 to 8 percent per annum. At the same time, social indicators
significantly improved as measured by the decline in the
proportion of the population living in absolute poverty as well as
improvements in social services.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN responded to the crisis by pursuing financial and
economic reforms and boosting the region's competitive edge
through accelerated implementation of its economic liberalization
policies and programs, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the
ASEAN Investment Area and the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation scheme.
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures to prevent a recurrence of the
financial crisis, ASEAN has launched an economic surveillance
process to help the members countries keep track of macroeconomic
trends and other economic and social indicators and thus alert
them to any impending problem.
</P>
<P>
In its recently released 1999 Asian Development Outlook, the
Asian Development Bank has projected that most ASEAN economies
will begin their recovery this year. Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are projected to
achieve an average growth rate of 1.3 percent in 1999 and 3.28
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was founded in 1967 to promote inter-governmental
cooperation in economic, scientific, social and cultural fields as
well as other transnational issues of common concern. ASEAN's
political and security cooperation is aimed at preserving the
prevailing regional peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Upgrade Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong has urged Singaporeans to upgrade themselves in a
continuing global restructuring and upgrading circumstance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the May Day dinner Friday evening, the deputy prime
minister said his government must upgrade and re-train
Singaporeans continuously to acquire new skills, to match the
investments coming in, retrain workers in older and declining
industries so as to ensure them to find new jobs before losing
their old jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said the current unemployment can not totally be attributed
to economic slowdown, underlining that "part of it is structural:
workers unable to find suitable replacement jobs because they lack
the relevant skills, or cannot adapt to new working conditions in
high growth sectors."
</P>
<P>
Citing as many as 70 percent of those out of work are
unemployable in France or Germany, Lee said employability can be
"easily become a major headache" if the problem is not tackled in
an early time.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The more workers we have who can analyze and solve
problems independently and continue to learn all their lives, the
more investments we will attract to Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"Every worker must acquire not only more 'hard' technical
skills, but also 'soft' skills in problem solving and creativity,
as well as core know how such as computers and information
technology to help him with his work," he added.

Colonel Azali Hassounani, chief of the general staff of the
Comoran army, took control of the state power in Comoros Thursday
night, repealing the constitution and dissolving government bodies,
according to reports from Moroni, capital of the Comoros.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Impose Oil Embargo on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that his country will not join NATO member
states in imposing an oil embargo on Yugoslavia despite a warning
from U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen against any violation of
the ban by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, Ivanov told reporters that Russia will deal with the
trade ban in line with the U.N. Charter and resolutions adopted by
the U.N. Security Council and there is no change in Russia's
stance on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was in response to Cohen's warning that Russia would
face serious political and economic consequences if it violated
the restriction and continued to ship oil to Yugoslavia. Cohen
issued the warning at a press conference in the Pentagon Thursday,
according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov dismissed the warning, saying Russia has repeatedly
indicated that the embargo is only binding to NATO member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia will act on its own decision and any
threat will be of no avail.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he and Axworthy focused their discussions on the
situation in Yugoslavia and both agreed that the United Nations
should play a role in putting an end to the raging conflict in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) and the U.S.-led NATO decided last week
to lay an oil embargo on Yugoslavia in order to cut off oil
supplies to the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson here
Wednesday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said if
Russia's oil tankers bound for Yugoslavia were intercepted, Russia
would take actions accordingly after taking all factors into
considerations.

<P>
He said the army had seized power to preserve the unity of the
Indian ocean republic in the face of a secessionist crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The National Army of Development decided to intervene in
order to prevent the country from plunging into chaos in order to
preserve the traditional links uniting all the citizens of our
country," Captain Abdallah was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah reportedly blamed the civilian government for its
inaction toward the secession.
</P>
<P>
The military coup followed an agreement signed at the weekend
by Tadjiddine's government to grant greater autonomy to the two
small islands of Anjouan and Moheli islands, which declared their
secession from the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sparked violent protests from opposition
politicians and youths on the main Grand Comoro Island this week.
Demonstrators said the agreement would weaken the republic.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah said the constitution had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, presidential elections should
have been held by February this year, but they were suspended
because of the secession crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tadjiddine took over as interim president last November after
Mohamed Taki died suddenly.
</P>
<P>
The Comoros islands have been riven by political unrest and
numerous coups since its independence from France in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Africa Records 3.3 PC GDP Growth in 1998: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) said Friday that in 1998 Africa enjoyed its
fourth consecutive year of positive gross domestic product (GDP)
growth at 3.3 percent, despite global financial and currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako told the 19th Meeting of
the Technical Preparatory Committee of the Whole and 7th
Intergovernmental Group of Experts here that the growth rate is
not high enough, nor sufficiently broad-based, or sustained long
enough, to make a real dent in poverty.
</P>
<P>
""This favorable outcome cannot be assumed to mean that the
average African economy has crossed the critical threshold to a
self-sustainable, poverty-reducing growth path," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said that on the eve of a new millennium, Africa faces
several challenges, key among which are poverty reduction and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that African heads of state and government have
endorsed the U.N. target of reducing poverty by half by the year
2015, saying that "this implies a reduction of poverty by four
percent per annum."
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet these targets, Africa would need to raise its
GDP growth rates to an average of seven percent per annum for the
region as a whole, compared to an average of 4.5 percent annually
during 1995-98," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official urged African countries to step up their
effort to mobilize domestic resources for sustainable development
and poverty reduction, through policies to raise savings,
including tax reforms, financial and capital market reforms, and
sound interest rate policy management.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening of the meeting, Mekonnen
Manyazewal, Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Economic Development and
Cooperation, said that in contrast to the 1980s and early 1990s
Africa has seen an improvement in a number of indicators.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1995, GDP in real terms grew by 4.5 percent between 1995
and 1997 -- registering positive per capita GDP growth," Mekonnen
said. "Export growth doubled, from an annual average of about four
percent between 1990- 1994 to about eight percent between 1995 and
1997."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Africa's financing problem, the Ethiopian
vice-minister said that African countries have lower savings, 17.6
percent of GDP in 1997, compared to 24 percent for all developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The five-day preparatory meeting will prepare an agenda for
action for the forthcoming Joint Conference of African Ministers
of Finance and Ministers of Economic Development and Planning to
be convened in Addis Ababa on May 6-8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "the challenge of financing
development in Africa".

MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanduay Rhum Masters Friday night
leaned on the heroics of veteran Pido Jarencio to come up with a
nailbiting 75-74 victory over Zoom Masters in the ongoing
elimination round of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)
All-Filipino Cup at the Philsports arena in Pasig City of Metro
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Jarencio, showing his poise and maturity at the endgame, scored
the Rhum Masters' winning basket after he made a split in the free-
throw lane for a 75-74 score with 6.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
The Zoom Masters failed on its initiative after Jerry Esplana

<P>
LAHSA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region Lobsang Thuentsok met with a visiting delegation
from the Canada International Development Agency (CIDA) here today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian delegation arrived in Lahsa to study a project to
help Tibetans develop local water resources, improve the
capability of Tibetan women, and maintain the sustainable
development of rural communities.
</P>
<P>
The CIDA plans to invest five million Canadian dollars in this
project.
</P>
<P>
Lobsang Thuentsok told the Canadian visitors that the central
government has shown deep concern for the development of Tibet,
which still remains comparatively underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese government has invested nearly one billion
yuan in agricultural development projects in Tibet in recent years,
and local agricultural production has been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet still has 147,000 people living in poverty, even though
a total of 270,000 Tibetan farmers and herdsmen have adequate food
and clothing," he said.

<HEADLINE> CSRC to Raise Quality of Listed Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said here Friday
that the opening of China's capital market to the rest of the
world should proceed step by step.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in regulating the market is one of the
conditions to open the capital market, said Zhou, when answering
questions after delivering a speech at a lecture to celebrate the
10th anniversary of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Without a perfect regulation, the opening of the capital market
would do harm to the nation and, in the mean time, the interests
of overseas investors could not be protected, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the lecture, Zhou said that raising quality of
listed companies and protecting the interests of international
investors serve as an important basis to expand channels for
international financing and are regarded as a key task for the
CSRC.
</P>
<P>
Five measures have been proposed to achieve this objective,
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, listed companies should be strictly segregated from
parent companies in operation and management, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, regulation over related party transaction will be
strengthened and transparency be enhanced, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, responsibility of directors should be stressed, and
system of independent and outside directors will be gradually
established and protected;
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, training programs will be offered to raise
qualification of senior corporate management, Zhou continued.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, enterprises operation should be segregated from
governmental affairs so as to minimize administrative interference,
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to better meet the demand of the international
capital markets, we have been improving the methods of selecting
candidates for overseas listing since the beginning of this year,"
said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Procedures to examine and approve overseas listing have been
simplified.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the former practice of selecting candidate enterprises
batch by batch, a criteria-oriented method has been adopted on the
principle of "allowing an enterprise to list as long as it is
ready", Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Condemns Coup in Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
Friday condemned the overnight coup in the Comoros and expressed
the hope that it would not undermine recent progress made in
seeking national unity in that country.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Marco Boni as saying that it was regrettable the coup
took place merely a week after talks were held to address the
problem of secessionist island Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is not a retrogressive step and that it will not
affect the progress made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Boni said he was informed by the embassy of the Comoros in
Pretoria that the situation in that country was calm, and South
African tourists did not appear to be in any danger.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said no fighting had been reported and that
citizens were going about freely.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the coup was headed by Army Chief of Staff,
Colonel Azali Hassounani.
</P>
<P>
Troops were reportedly patrolling the streets of the capital
Moroni, on the main island of Grand Comoro.
</P>
<P>
The coup followed unsuccessful attempts to reconcile Anjouan
with the two other islands of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan unilaterally declared independence from the Federal
Islamic Republic of the Comoros in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Talks were held in Madagascar last week and a preliminary
agreement was reached that each island would receive broad
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan did not sign the agreement, resulting in two days of
protests in Moroni this week.
</P>
<P>
This was reportedly the 18th coup or attempted coup since the
Comoros gained independence from France in 1975.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Lady octogenarian Zhou Renhua
deposited 388 kilograms of coins in exchange for a banknote worth
6,339.58 yuan this morning at a local bank branch.
</P>
<P>
It took some 30 bank tellers 20 hours to count the 285,903
coins.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, the elderly woman went to the bank branch,
claiming that she had a lot of coins at home and asked whether she
could "sell them to the bank." The bank promised to help her count
the coins no matter how many she had.
</P>
<P>
The tellers were surprised when 18 sacks of coins were
delivered to their door step. Zhou said the coins had been
accumulated by her late husband who sold newspapers for 25 years.

Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention said Friday it "unequivocally condemns the coup d'etat
perpetrated today by the military" in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued here after the central organ's 56th
ordinary session at ambassadorial level said that "the Central
Organ is particularly disturbed by the fact that this coup has
taken place at a time when there was a ray of hope in the efforts
aimed at finding a solution to the crisis which was brought about
by the separatist movement in Anjouan."
</P>
<P>
The Comoran parties signed an agreement in Antananarivo,
Madagascar last week, defining a new institutional framework for
the Indian Ocean islands country, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The OAU central organ expressed its full support to the
Antananarivo agreement and called on the Anjouanese party to sign
the agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ demanded the immediate restoration of
consitutional order and called on all the Comoran parties to work
together toward creating the conditions for the implementation of
the Antananarivo agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ decides to remain actively seized with the
situation in the Comoros and take appropriate measures
accordingly.

<P>
Obuchi will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton on May 3 at
the White House to discuss military relations between the two
countries and ways to revive the faltering Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for the U.S., Obuchi managed on Tuesday to
engineer a parliamentary passage of the controversial legislation
on new military guidelines for U.S.-Japanese security cooperation
in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi hoped he would win a clear statement from Clinton that
he has confidence in him after the forceful passage of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pressing for the legislation, which would
make it easier for Japan's military to cooperate with U.S. forces
in handling any military operations in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Besides military cooperation, the two leaders will surely
discuss Japan's economy, which has not yet come out of recession.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was said to be certain to urge Obuchi to implement
stimulating measures by using all tools available to push Japan's
ailing economy back on a recovery course.
</P>
<P>
There would be some friction on the issue as Obuchi has said
his policies are working and his government has no new plans at
present to work out a supplementary budget to boost growth.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi will stay in Chicago for two days before flying to
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stocks Up to One-Year High after Moody's Bank Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index was up 26.86 points, or 6.2 percent, to close at a
one-year high of 459.53 points Friday, after the Moody's Investors
Service upgraded its ratings for leading Thai banks to stable from
negative.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade applies to Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Thai
Farmers' Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and the Export-Import Bank of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the U.S. company said the upgrade reflected
progress in recapitalization process of the banks and the
diminishing risks of systemic crisis or regulatory intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement warned that the Thai banks are still
"extremely weak and substantially under-capitalized."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chief economist of the Bank of Thailand (BOT),
Atchana Waiquamdee, announced Friday that Thailand's economy has
bottomed out from the country's worst economic crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
She said BOT figures showed an improvement in the capacity
utilization index which measures actual production against
industry's total production capacity, which rose to 59.7 percent
in March from 54.7 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The index was only about 40 percent at the peak of the economic
crisis, she said.
</P>
<P>
But she also warned that the recovery would not be achieved
overnight, since the economy has been severely damaged by the
crisis.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU) Friday announced a
regulation concerning the implementation of an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia , which will enter into force on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition also covers the shipping of such products to
Yugoslavia, as well as the participation in the promotion of any
of the activities concerned, said the General Secretariat of the
Council of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement said exemptions of the oil embargo are
provided for products used by diplomatic missions of the EU member
states in Yugoslavia or by an international military peace-keeping
presence, as well as those cases where there is conclusive
evidence that it would serve strictly humanitarian purpose.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states will consider imposition of sanctions
in case of infringements of the regulation, the statement added. (

MOSCOW -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday that
his country will not join NATO member states in imposing an oil
embargo on Yugoslavia despite a warning from U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen against any violation of the ban by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was in response to Cohen's warning that Russia would
face serious political and economic consequences if it violated
the restriction and continued to ship oil to Yugoslavia. Cohen
issued the warning at a press conference in the Pentagon Thursday,
according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov dismissed the warning, saying Russia has repeatedly
indicated that the embargo is only binding to NATO member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia will act on its own decision and any
threat will be of no avail. (Russia-Yugoslavia-Oil Embargo)

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Police released on Friday a
picture of the man they want to question over the murder of BBC
presenter Jill Dando.
</P>
<P>
The picture was made public at a Scotland Yard news conference,
where detectives admitted they still had no firm evidence to link
the execution-style murder to a clear motive.
</P>
<P>
The picture was drawn up following a series of interviews with
witnesses, who said a man was in the area of Dando's home in
Fulham, west London, at about the time of Monday's killing.
</P>
<P>
Police said it took some time to release the picture because of
the number of people they had to speak to, each of whom had a
slightly different impression of the man.
</P>
<P>
Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell appealed for anyone
who saw a metallic blue Range Rover speeding close to the murder
scene.
</P>
<P>
As police gave more details of the final minutes of her life,
the detective in charge of the case revealed that the killer could
have been working with an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
There has been an increasing amount of speculation in the
newspapers about a Balkan connection to the killing, particularly
since it was confirmed that she had received a letter about the
crisis.

</P>
<P>
"We are competing aggressively with other countries and success
will depend on how high is our productivity. If we fail, the
effect will be felt by all including the workers. On the other
hand, if our productivity increases, the success will also be
shared by all," he said.

times when the country was facing economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Legendary Coach Ma's Runners to Compete in National Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, Shandong Province, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Legendary coach
Ma Junren's runners , who have not participated in domestic
competitions since 1997, will run in the fourth stage of the
National Grand Prix series to be held here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, world record holder of the women's 5,000 meters, will
lead the field of 50 runners of the Liaoning provincial team to
take part in the stage. The team consists of 28 men and 22 women.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren was promoted to be the vice president of Liaoning
Provincial Physical Culture and Sports Commission, which governs
sports of the province.
</P>
<P>
But Ma Junren did not come with his runners to Jinan for "He is
busy establishing a track and field training center", said Sun
Ripeng, a former student of Ma and now is a coach of the team. "
He's not been a coach recently."
</P>
<P>
However, Shang Xiutang, general secretary of Chinese Athletics
Association (CAA), said the magic coach may show up during the
competition.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to conclude that he will not come." Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Ma and his runners failed to qualify for the Asian Games
held last December in Bangkok because he had not competed in a
single stage of the National Grand Prix series last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the CAA's rule, a runner could never run in the
next stage to be held next week in Tianjin." Shang said. "So if
the runners can achieve good results, they could run in the World
Championships."
</P>
<P>
He said only the top eight finishers in each stage can qualify
for the Grand Prix finals in June, which will serve a qualifying
competition for the World Championships.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU) today strongly condemned NATO's wanton bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU firmly supports the Yugoslav people in their fight
against invasion, the federation said in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
While laborers all over the world are celebrating their own
festival, May Day, Yugoslavia are now suffering from wanton and
indiscriminate air strikes by NATO, China's laborers said in a
strong condemnation of NATO, led by the United States, for
neglecting the United Nations Charter and the norms of
international law, and outrageously conducting an invasion and
armed interference against a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
We firmly support the Yugoslav people's brave struggle to fight
against invasion, safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and
national respect, the announcement declared.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia has now lasted for more than one
month, and thousands of Yugoslavian people have been killed or
injured, and over 600,000 refugees have lost their homes. Economic
losses now amount to 30 billion U.S. dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, many factories, bridges, residences, schools and
hospitals have been targeted by NATO bombing, and smoke, ruins,
blood, and death are all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
Many factories have been forced to suspend production due to
NATO bombing or indirectly, by the war. A great number of laborers
have lost their jobs and have been laid-off, or even made refugees,
with their families suffering great difficulties. Yugoslav
laborers are also suffering mentally, according to the statement.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Friday
announced a regulation concerning the implementation of an oil
embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which
will enter into force on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The regulation states that it is prohibited to "sell, supply or
export, directly or indirectly, petroleum and petroleum products,"
whether or not originating in the EU, "to any person or body in

carried on in, or operated from, the territory of the FRY," the EU

</P>
<P>
The prohibition also covers the shipping of such products to
the FRY, as well as the participation in the promotion of any of

Council of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement said exemptions of the oil embargo are
provided for products used by diplomatic missions of the EU member
states in Yugoslavia or by an international military peace-keeping
presence, as well as those cases where there is conclusive
evidence that it would serve strictly humanitarian purpose.

<P>
The 15 EU member states will consider imposition of sanctions

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Unions Condemn NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and NATO have always flaunted so-called "
human rights" and "humanitarianism." However, what the Yugoslav
people are suffering clearly suggested that it is the U.S. and
NATO who are creating death and disaster. They are the ones
trampling on human rights, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Relying on great economic and military power, the U.S. and NATO
try to be everywhere. They wantonly interfere in the internal
affairs of other nations, infringe upon their sovereignty, and
create bloodshed at their will, it criticized.
</P>
<P>
Their brutality committed in Yugoslavia undoubtedly exposes
their ambition to rule the world and human society, and has torn
off their disguise of so-called "human rights" and "peace."
</P>
<P>
The invasion deserves condemnation and objection from laborers
all over the world, including China. They will unavoidably pay a
high price for their crimes, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU and Chinese workers firmly support President Jiang
Zemin's significant speech on the Kosovo issue, and the Chinese
government's solemn and just stand against NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia, it stated.
</P>
<P>
It praised the heroic Yugoslav people who have a glorious
tradition of anti-fascism. We admire the Yugoslav people's bravery
in withstanding violence and fighting against their enemies. We
firmly support them, it reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU strongly urges that laborers around the world oppose
the war and call on the U.S. and NATO to immediately end their
invasion, solve the Kosovo issue in a political way, and return
peace to the Balkans.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has reassured that the Philippines remains a haven for
business in Southeast Asia with the country's economy back "on the
growth track."
</P>
<P>
In a video teleconference Thursday night at the Presidential
Palace with foreign investors from around the globe, Estrada said
his administration's policies and programs have allowed the
country to weather the Asian financial crisis that struck the
region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president cited the following indicators to show that the
country is well on its way to faster recovery from the Asian
contagion: one to 1.5 percent GNP increase in the first quarter of
1999, remarkable progress in the agriculture sector, low interest
rates as well as the positive growth of exports.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said these factors strongly support his
administration's confident outlook for a 3.0 to 3.7 percent GNP
growth this year, attributing mainly to the agriculture, the
sector where most poor Filipinos come from.
</P>
<P>
"With our pro-market policies in place, we also foresee our
industrial sector to come out with stronger performance this
year," the president added.
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute video teleconference by the president and his
economic managers was held with foreign investor clients of the
Societe Generale Securities Asia.

<HEADLINE> ADB Opens Annual Meeting with Focus on Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
opened its 32nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors with
concentration on the development in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the meeting, Tadao Chino, president
of Asian Development Bank (ADB), vowed to help address challenges
in the region to achieve the maximum development.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the bank's role in the new century, Chino said the
bank will continue to help the region's development in a
sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening session, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada said it is an opportune time to tackle the
challenges confronting the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"An open and vibrant discussion on those challenges would
ensure that the region emerges from the financial crisis stronger
and ready to face the next century," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis-hit economies, Chino said the bank will "continue
to provide assistance to the affected economies."
</P>
<P>
"We should concentrate our assistance on restructuring of the
banking and corporate sectors," he added.
</P>
<P>
In view of the severe impact of the crisis, he said, the bank
will strengthen its assistance to directly address the poverty
problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chino also sought the support of the bank's shareholders to
accomplish the bank's challenging mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
He requested the shareholders' support for launching
negotiations this year for the next replenishment of the bank's
Asian Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will also need to continue providing
assistance for developing the region's infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will place increasing emphasis on enhancing its
members' institutional capacity for economic and sector
management, he said.
</P>
<P>
On sub-regional cooperation, he said the bank has made
continual and concerted efforts to promote the cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Close sub-regional cooperation is an effective and important
way to sustain regional development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, who is
also chairman of the Board of Governors of the ADB, called on the
bank to continue to fulfill its development mandate.
</P>
<P>
"Although the need for post-crisis support remains, the bank
must continue to fulfill its development mandate," Espiritu said
in his address delivered at the opening session of the bank's 32nd
Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
The bank can and must continue to provide development
assistance - both capital and technical - on a large enough scale
to honor its development mandate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank must play a lead role in the overwhelming task of
combating the poverty and the social inequity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third set of activities that the bank must undertake is to
strengthen regional and sub-regional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also called for the bank's efforts to provide and
stimulate regional intellectual leadership on development issues.
</P>
<P>
Governors of the bank's 57 members, including finance ministers
and central bank governors, and some 2,000 officials from banks
and the international financial institutions attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The financing needs and future role of the bank will be the
main topic of discussions at the meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will soon be in need of a fresh injection of capital
and will use this year's annual meeting to beat that drum to the
governors, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The Board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and public financial management to
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multilateral development
finance institution and has 57 members.
</P>
<P>
With 41 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Thai Champion to Skip SEA Games for ATP Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games tennis champion Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand has
confirmed that she will skip the 20th regional competition in
Brunei this year to compete in a series of warm-up tournaments for
the U.S. Open, The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The world No.67, who is also winner of the 1995 Chiang Mai
Games Women's singles title, recently met the Lawn Tennis
Association of Thailand (LTAT) official to relate her decision not
the play in the sports extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of points to defend in the American warm-up
tournaments. If I play in the Games, I will have to miss a lot of
tournaments which will severely affect my position in the rankings,
" Tamarine was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine has yet to win a match this year. Despite taking part
in four tournaments, she has slipped out of the top 40.
</P>
<P>
She said LTAT leaders understood her situation and even agreed
that she should focus on the tours, which will keep her busy from
late July until the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine said her absence will create a great opportunity for
young players to play in the national team.
</P>
<P>
"Young players need the experience major tournaments can give
them and the SEA Games will give them a major boost," she said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepal Polls May Produce Majority or Hung Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress (NC) is an
odds-on winner in the May parliamentary elections due to the split
of its arch rival Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), but there is still a chance of hung
parliament, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the untimely demise of CPN-UML Chairman Man Mohan
Adhikari on April 26 will make a dent in his party's performance
in the elections scheduled for May 3 and May 17, analysts told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Professor Panna Kaji Amatya, head of the Department of
Political Science in Tribhuvan University, said there is a strong
possibility that the NC secures a majority in the elections not
because of its performance but due to the split of the CPN-UML in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
Dhruva H. Adhikary, board member of the Nepal Press Institute,
agreed. "On the basis of what happened in the past years and on
the trends, one can say that NC is the only party which has any
possibility, if at all, of securing a majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that NC cannot get a substantial majority because
there is dissension or rebel candidates within the party and
because it has not done much to get support.
</P>
<P>
The NC, which won a clear majority in the May 1991 elections,
was reduced to second after the CPN-UML in the mid-term polls in
November 1994 due to rebel candidates.
</P>
<P>
"They take advantage of the split of UML; it's a good chance if
they utilize the chance," Adhikary said.
</P>
<P>
Daman Nath Dhungana, former speaker of the House of
Representatives, said he could not predict the outcome of the
elections. "However, in the changed circumstances I see the
prospects of Nepali Congress Party leading the future government
increasing," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Man Mohan Adhikari's death will affect the CPN-UML
in many respects. "Primarily, it would reflect in the form of
leadership crisis in the near future, most probably, reducing the
prospects of the party even in the forthcoming election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Dr. Devendra Raj Panday also believed
that the NC may emerge as the biggest party. "There is a good
possibility that it may also have a working majority in the
house," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said until its split last year, the CPN-UML stood a big
chance of winning a comfortable majority in the elections. "Since
that split, the equation got reversed, and now the Nepali Congress
has an upper hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Adhikari's death may make a dent as well. "Because,
among other things, the party was seeking votes in Adhikari's
name," he said, adding that he has seen many CPN-UML posters that
roughly translate into "a vote for the UML means a respect for the
Old and the Wise."
</P>
<P>
He added that a degree of uncertainty prevails nonetheless for
two principal reasons: first, the NC is still a highly
disorganized party, one is not sure if the election campaign is
being launched with unity and vigor in all constituencies; and
second, it is still uncertain to what extent the votes of other
left parties will be split between the UML and the Communist Party
of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) and whether the NC can benefit
from the split.
</P>
<P>
Senior freelance journalist M.R. Josse also said that
Adhikari's death could lead to serious demoralization within the
CPN-UML. But on the other hand, "it could galvanize the party to
high levels of performance and perhaps even win over a sizeable
chunk of ML supporters back to the UML from which they had split,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the decisive factor in the elections will be the
performance of the CPN-ML. "If it does even reasonably well, there
will be a hung parliament; if it does poorly, the UML could
possibly get through with a tiny majority," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Professor Amatya and Dhruva Adhikary thought it likely that a
hung parliament would emerge again this time as did in the 1994
elections. The 1994 hung parliament gave rise to six governments.
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Panday said there was an element of "wishful thinking"
in this projection.
</P>
<P>
"Smaller parties want a hung parliament, because that is the
only way they will have a share in political power, and perhaps,
in the government," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Panday held that a hung parliament means most likely
further instability. "First, our political parties and the
factions within them have yet to internalize the political culture
of a parliamentary democracy. They switch sides easily without
regard to their history and the principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, as evident from the experience in India also, the
political parties in South Asia are not very good at running a
coalition government; the dispute over the distribution of spoils
apparently becomes too acute for the process to resolve the
conflicts and contradictions amicably," he regarded.
</P>
<P>
"Third, as I said earlier, there are political interests in the
country that thrive on instability and look for opportunities to
disgrace democracy on that account; a hung parliament will provide
a convenient playing ground for them," he added.

<HEADLINE> Burundi to Tighten Ties With Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) - Burundi has invited
Tanzanian officials to visit Bujumbura in a bid to improve
bilateral relations ahead of the signing of a final Burundi peace
accord set for later this year.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Friday quoted a statement by the Burundian
Embassy here as saying that the visits will be a step forward in
creating conducive atmosphere between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian Ambassador to Tanzania, Emmanuel Rwamibigo, said
Thursday in the statement that despite the peace progress, there
are still fears in Burundi caused by some armed groups which make
cross borders incursions at night.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured that it has been confirmed the bandits are
not receiving any support from the government of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour in refugee camps in western Tanzania,
the international facilitator of Burundi peace talks, former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, warned refugees not to
undertake any devitalizing activities against their country of
origin from the soil of the host country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nyerere Thursday refuted a claim by Burundian
President Pierre Buyoya that he had refused as facilitator to
invite one rebel group to take part in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's legal representative Mark Bomani told local
newspapers Thursday that Buyoya's claim was not the true position
regarding an armed faction being excluded from the talks.
</P>
<P>
Bomania explained that in accordance with the Declaration
issued in Arusha, northern Tanzania, on June 21, 1998, new
parties' inclusion in the talks should be agreed by all the
participants who, however, declined to agree.
</P>
<P>
Bomani's comment was a reaction to some remarks by Buyoya who
has recently said that Burundi wants Nyerere to invite all
leaders of a split rebel group to take part in the Arusha talks
in order to reach a lasting solution to the Burundi conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Marine Sources Not Utilized Optimally: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Friday said the potential of Indonesia's marine sources has not
yet been utilized optimally, despite the fact that this country is
the world's largest archipelago.
</P>
<P>
To enable this nation to optimize the environment friendly
exploration of its marine sources, Indonesians must have a
development vision and national unity which is oriented to the
sea, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"In connection with this matter, it can be started by
encouraging Indonesians to be aware of the fact that they are a
maritime nation," Habibie told a conference, organized by the
Association of Indonesian Maritime Technologists here.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is a maritime country with more than 17,500 islands
and 5.9 million square kilometers of sea area, including the
Economic Exclusive Zone.
</P>
<P>
"Inside the ocean, it contains the country's wealth, namely
fish diversity which includes 8,500 species, more than 800 species
of coral reefs, and fishery potential of 6.3 million tons
annually," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, there are mineral resources, oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
"All of that wealth should be managed wisely, so it will
provide prosperity to people without damaging the environment,"
the head of state said.

<HEADLINE> Locusts Turn Back Plane in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Swarms of locusts forced an Air
Philippines plane bound for southern General Santos City to return
to Cebu Thursday noon, Philippines News Agency (PNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
PNA quoted air controllers of General Santos City as saying
they advised the plane's pilots to turn back as locusts almost
darkened the sky.
</P>
<P>
Then, after a delay of more than an hour, the plane resumed its
flight to this city.
</P>
<P>
Several residents who were at the General Santos City airport
said they thought the dark mass on the horizon were rain clouds
until they noticed that it was moving fast and saw the hoppers.
</P>
<P>
Airport authorities said there have been similar incidents of
locust swarms in the past weeks but it was only this time that
they were forced to warn an incoming aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They said it would have been dangerous for the aircraft as its
engines might suck in the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, believe that with the massive heat emitted by
the engines, the locusts could fry even before these could be
sucked into the engines.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have reportedly already destroyed several million pesos
worth of crops in General Santos City and the nearby provinces of
South Cotabato and Sarangani.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Minister for Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar, who is also chairman of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Standing Committee, has described
Cambodia's ASEAN membership as "an important milestone in the
development of ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
He was joining other ASEAN foreign ministers to welcome the
admission of Cambodia into the association here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that it is only a milestone and not the end
of the journey, referring to many challenges being faced by ASEAN,
which, he said, not everybody is convinced that expansion will
necessarily help the association cope with.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about international relations, he expressed ASEAN's
desire to make a Southeast Asia open to the world. However, he
also affirmed that "we (ASEAN) want a Southeast Asia whose future
will be determined by decisions made by Southeast Asians, not by
others in far-away capitals."
</P>
<P>
As to the regional economic crisis, he acknowledged some
tentative signs of stabilization, but added that "it is too soon
to say the crisis is over" as major uncertainties remain.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity of continued liberalization and
economic reform for integrating Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Only by a continuous process of honest self-examination and
defining and re-defining itself can the organization ensure that
an ASEAN of 10 will enhance the region's security and well-being,
he said in conclusion.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in 1967, now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Weaker blue chip industrial
stocks pulled the Australian sharemarket lower Friday, offsetting

</P>
<P>

resources," Reynolds &AMP; Co's Grant Williams said.
</P>
<P>
National turnover reached a hefty 689.09 million shares worth
1.917 billion U.S. dollars predominantly due to the expiry of

28.2 points to 5451.7.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International
Horticultural Exposition, which opened this evening in Kunming,
capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, represents a "
historic fact" as it has been the first world exposition hosted by
China, said Ole Philipson, president of the International
Expositions Bureau (BIE), here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Expo is the first internationally registered Expo in the
very long history of China, a historic fact," said the BIE
president at the opening ceremony of the Kunming Expo '99 here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Kunming horticultural show as "the result of
enormous efforts" by the Chinese government and the local
governments of Yunnan and Kunming, Philipson praised the entire
Chinese people for their great enthusiasm and warm support for the
exposition.

<P>
Philipson said that during his previous visits to China and
Kunming, he had very acutely felt the growing understanding of the
potential for China of the horticultural exposition, a "great and
truly international and multicultural event".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the fact that more than 90 countries have
wished to participate has represented "a record for this kind of
world expositions" and "a great achievement on the part of the
organizers".
</P>
<P>
"An exposition of this quality and size holds a myriad of
opportunities both for the host nation and for the participating
nations," said Philipson. "This is indeed a true forum for
international understanding, for furthering the contacts between
the nations and for bringing together people from many countries."
</P>
<P>
He described Yunnan as an "ideal location" for the
horticultural show, saying that the city of Kunming with its
beautiful and lively streets and friendly inhabitants form a
perfect setting for the Expo.
</P>
<P>
According to Philipson, who has served as the BIE president for
six years, the Paris-based BIE has maintained a long-standing
friendship with China. He expressed "sincere appreciation" of what
China has done for the Expo on behalf of the BIE and all its 85
member countries.

<HEADLINE> March Manufacturing Output Continues to Grow In Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased by 6.2 percent year-on-year in March 1999 and
registered an accumulative 6.5 percent growth in the first quarter
compared to last year, according to data released Friday by the
Economic Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has maintained a momentum to grow for
the fourth consecutive month since gyrating from negative to
positive territory in December 1999 and the growth was contributed
by the electronics and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Due to higher demand from the U.S., output in the electronics
cluster ran up 12.1 percent year-on-year in March, bringing to a
hefty 14 percent growth in the accumulative output for the first
three months of 1999 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 6.3 percent compared to March
1998 and this brought the cumulative growth for the first three
months to 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the output of petrochemicals in March increased by 24.4
percent year-on-year, the output of the pharmaceuticals industry
dipped by 0.8 percent after a substantial jump in February and the
petroleum industry declined by 2.1 percent in March with reduced
output of gasoline and diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
The output of engineering cluster in March 1999 edged up a
marginal 1.0 percent, attributed mainly to the increase in the
transport engineering sub-cluster which saw a 8.7 percent growth
in March over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the precision engineering segment and the process
engineering segment contracted by 2.9 and 7.1 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Introduces Revised Code for Print Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Press Council has
introduced a 22-clause revised code of conduct for journalists and
newspapers and news agencies, prohibiting any campaign against the
"liberation war" or communal harmony.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit and ideals of the independence and the liberation
war must be upheld and there can be no campaigns against the
spirit," the Daily Star newspaper Friday quoted the first clause
of the new code as saying.
</P>
<P>
Communalism must be strongly discouraged to uphold national
unity and the press must refrain from publishing any comments
against any person or community which might hurt or show
disrespect to their caste, creed, nationality or religion, the
code says.
</P>
<P>
The media is free to publish any report which attracts or
influences people but the report must be prepared keeping in mind
the personal rights and sensitivity of the people, the revised
code states.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors and unconfirmed reports must be identified and if they
are considered not suitable for publication, their use must be
refrained," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The code allows the press and journalists to express their own
views on any controversial issues but cautions against distorting
the facts either in the headlines or in the body of the news
items.
</P>
<P>
The journalists will be protected from any adverse
eventualities for any news items published with good intention and
based on credible information, it says, adding that a reporter
must be cautious about the justifiability and adequate backup
information to ascertain the truth.
</P>
<P>
The code directs the press to be quite cautious before
publishing reports on the male-female relations or involving a
woman alone.
</P>
<P>
If any person protests that he has been affected by wrong
report, the editor must publish the corrected report regretting
the mistake on the same page where the original report was
published, it further says.
</P>
<P>
The code adds that if a published news item turns out to be
harmful or improper, it must be immediately withdrawn, corrected
with explanation and in such cases the concerned newspaper must
apologize.
</P>
<P>
The Press Council directives, which were approved in its ninth
general meeting of the 10th council early this month, also
introduced two separate specimens of oaths for journalists and
publishers.
</P>
<P>
A brief code of conduct for the press was formulated, first in
1983-84 and later updated and revised in view of the changed
situation in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Be Self-sufficient in Salt by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola will be self-sufficient in
salt by 2000, after a salt plant with an annual capacity of 20,000
tons went into operation Thursday, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the salt plant in Farta Bay
of Benguela province, Maria de Fatima Jardim, Minister of Fishery
and Environment, said that the salt plant, which will help double
the country' s salt output, will make the country self-sufficient
in salt supply, the Angola Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to produce 20,000 tons of iodated salt
and crude salt to meet peoples' daily needs and those of the fish
preserving industry.
</P>
<P>
Angola produced 35,000 tons of salt in 1998, while it needs to
turn out 60,000 tons per year to meet the needs of total domestic
consumption, Jardim said.
</P>
<P>
The salt plant, named Calo Mbolo, is jointly invested by Angola
Credit Bank and Portugal's Overseas Development Bank with a total
investment of 1.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Angola has been heavily dependent on imported iodated salt, the
lack of which has led to serious iodine-deficient diseases in some
inland provinces of the country.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Exports 130,000 Cubic Meters of Teak in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 133,717 cubic
meters of teak in 1998, 9,198 cubic meters less than the previous
year, according to the latest Economic Indicators issued by the
country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange earning through the export amounted to
94.6 million U.S. dollars, 11.4 million dollars less than the
previous year which was 106 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, Myanmar also exported 235,739 cubic meters of
hardwood, earning 29 million dollars. The export quantity and
foreign exchange earning respectively increased by 161,452 cubic
meters and 16 million dollars as compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Forestry Ministry's figures indicate that Myanmar's forest
area is reducing year by year, dropping by 7 percent compared with
 36 years ago. The 1962 data showed that 57 percent of the
country's total area was then covered by forests. The percentage
dropped to 50 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cause of forest depletion was attributed to indiscriminate
felling and cutting of trees including firewood plantations for
fuel and burning of charcoal.

Myanmar has worked out projects for greening the arid districts
under which revival of firewood plantations is among the measures
taken. The country also introduced firewood substitute fuel such
as briquette, micro-wave ovens and agricultural wastes in its
effort to prevent forest depletion and preserve the nation's
forest and environment.

<HEADLINE> China Can Increase Exports: Trade Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists, encouraged
by the number of transactions and the positive mood at the
country's most important trade fair which ended today, believe
there can be at least a limited growth in exports this year, a
step forward from earlier predictions of a tough battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months signs have emerged of economic recovery in
Asia and China has also taken certain measures to encourage
exports, so we are confident about increasing them to a degree,"
Chen Xinhua, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), told Xinhua in an interview following the
winding up of the 85th China Export Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
He added that the demand for Chinese goods on the international
market is already recovering.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the more than expected effects of the Asian
financial crisis, which has lasted since July 1997, China is
simply expecting its exports drive to strive towards an
undetermined growth level rather than designating a specific value
as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's exports reached 183.76
billion US dollars last year, up 0.5 percent from 1997. The growth
rate was in a sharp contrast to a 20.9 percent rise in 1997 and an
average of double-digit growth in the past couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the results of the fair, however, trade experts are
convinced that China's export situation this year is better than
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics show that the 15-day fair, often considered
as a "thermometer" of China's foreign trade, has set new records
this year in terms of both the number of participants and the
transaction volume.
</P>
<P>
Deals clenched during the fair were worth a total of 11.55
billion US dollars, up five percent on the figure for the previous
fair last year. A record number of 79,500 overseas business people
from 170 countries and regions participated in the fair, a bi-
annual event that was first launched in 1957.
</P>
<P>
"As shown by the trade fair, China's hardest time in exports
since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis has passed," said
Zhou Jie, an official of MOFTEC's Department for Trade and
Development. He added, though, that the effects of the crisis are
still there.

<HEADLINE> China's Leading Newspaper Highly Values Role of Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, hails the major role of the working class in
promoting reforms and maintaining social stability, calling on
officials at all levels to work to protect the interests of the
workers.
</P>
<P>
The world is created by the laboring classes and history made
by them, the newspaper said in an editorial to mark the
International Labor Day on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The great progress and brilliant achievements made by the
workers should be enthusiastically eulogized, the editorial says,
adding that to deepen reform, greater efforts must be made to
develop productive forces and to encourage the workers' enthusiasm
for labor and renovation.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government protect
the achievements made by the workers and create conditions for all
workers to get rich through labor.
</P>
<P>
Any behavior or attitude despising labor and the laboring
classes is erroneous, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The working class makes up the majority of those who labor,
implement the reform and open-up policy, and safeguard development
and stability.
</P>
<P>
As the reform and opening-up develops into a pivotal period,
most large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises can only
eradicate their predicaments through restructuring. Changing the
enterprises to modern corporations must become a decisive battle
during the strenuous reform process.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise restructuring in China nowadays plays a very
important role in speeding up the progress of modernization, the
editorial says.

<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial calls on various ranks of Party leaders and
officials to consistently depend on the working class and bring
the important role of the workers into full play in the cause of
reform and construction.
</P>
<P>
While wisely guiding, protecting and encouraging the workers'
initiatives, the authorities must extensively safeguard their
legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders and officials should improve their style of work
in order to draw up effective measures to solve existing problems
and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises in China have experienced a
development history of half a century and workers in those
enterprises have performed immortal feats through the sweat of
their labor for strengthening the state.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, central and local authorities are focusing on
improving the conditions of laid-off workers, and plans have been
worked out to ensure their basic life and create opportunities for
re-employment, in addition to paying full pensions to those who
have retired.
</P>
<P>
However, laid-off workers must constantly strive to become
stronger, surmount difficulties and blaze a new trail in life, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on all workers to fully understand the
country's hard-won favorable political, economical and social
situation, and vigorously safeguard the current stability.
</P>
<P>
The editorial finally urges the workers to bravely resolve
difficulties and make further achievements.

<HEADLINE> Man Held over London Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A man was arrested on Friday in
connection with the Brixton and Brick Lane nail bombings in London
that injured dozens of shoppers.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the man was in custody at a central
London police station after being arrested overnight.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that a number of further arrests could soon be
made by officers.
</P>
<P>
The arrest follows a "steady stream" of calls to Scotland Yard
since it released CCTV footage on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The video film showed a white man wandering around the crowded
streets of Brixton up to 90 minutes before the bomb.
</P>
<P>
But Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner David Veness said
this one individual "may be a loner acting for his own perverted
reasons."
</P>
<P>
The first blast happened nearly two weeks ago at the busy
Brixton market in south London, injuring 39 people.
</P>
<P>
It was followed a week later with a second nail bomb in Brick
Lane, east London.
</P>
<P>
Four far-right extremist groups have claimed responsibility
for the two bomb attacks.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Churches Urge Mozambicans to Participate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Catholic churches in
Mozambique are urging all Mozambicans to participate in the
general elections scheduled for October this year.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.1 million Catholic followers in the southern
African country with a population of 16.5 million. The Catholic
church played a very important role in bringing peace to the
country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In a pastoral published on Noticias daily newspaper Friday,
bishops in Maputo urged Mozambicans to participate in the
elections in a "responsible and orderly way", and neither to be
influenced by any party nor vote in dishonest and illegal ways.
</P>
<P>
The success of the country's second elections depends on the
participation and cooperation of the people, which is taken as
criteria for the civilization standard and political maturity of
the people, the pastoral said.
</P>
<P>
Catholic bishops reaffirmed, as they did during the 1994
elections, that any abstentions or neutral stand in the elections
will be regarded as irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
Though peace and national reconciliation have been consolidated
over the past five years in the country, the pastoral said,
poverty and starvation still exist, and unemployment is still on
the rise while living standard is still decreasing.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia's Membership in ASEAN: Opportunities, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Finally, Cambodia became the
10th member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
fulfilling the vision of ASEAN-10 as envisaged by the founding
fathers 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong stated: "Cambodia is
in ASEAN region, therefore, we cannot stay out of a strong
association in the region."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in July, 1997 along
with Laos and Myanmar. However, its admission was put on hold
after the heavy factional fighting which broke out in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia regarded ASEAN as a strategic window of opportunities
not only to the outside world but also to regain its regional role
as well as promote its national interests.
</P>
<P>
But at home, there were still some controversial opinions on
Cambodia's entry into the association. One says Cambodia gains
only political and diplomatic benefits whereas, economically, it
will be greatly damaged as the country has just survived from
decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy maintained that "it's
not a proper time for Cambodia to join the Association," adding
that "they will take Cambodia, they will use Cambodia as a big
market and this just to kill our nation, our young industries
because those countries have larger industries than our local
ones."
</P>
<P>
But Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong insisted that
"Cambodia's entry into ASEAN serves the interests and needs of
both Cambodia and ASEAN. With Cambodia's entry, ASEAN will become
stronger politically, culturally and economically."
</P>
<P>
Politically, as an ASEAN member, Cambodia will be able to act
more effectively in regional and international politics. In
addition, Cambodia's entry will further promote peace, stability
and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Economically, joining the group will speed up the integration
of the local economy into regional and global economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is traditionally based on agriculture.
ASEAN's huge marketplace will provide Cambodia with vast
opportunities to export such commercial crops as rice, coffee and
canned foods.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Cambodia's geographic location in between
Laos, Vietnam and Thailand has forced it throughout history to
worry about incursions, but now, the central location could prove
an asset and Cambodia could become a convenient spot for traders
and manufactures, and regional distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
However, as a member of ASEAN, Cambodia will also face many
challenges. Membership is not a panacea for the problems that
Cambodia face.
</P>
<P>
In signing the documents to join ASEAN and abide by its
agreements, Cambodia has to speed up the reform efforts to carry
out its commitments.
</P>
<P>
And Cambodia's pressing issues are: the lack of a large group
of trained technocrats, large holes in its legal code, and
institutional weaknesses in the way its ministries communicate,
many experts say.
</P>
<P>
The national budget is heavily dependent upon tariffs on
imports, and the ASEAN membership will oblige the country to
reduce tariffs to between zero and five percent in a decade which
will be sure to hurt the nation's revenue greatly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, joining the ASEAN will cost Cambodia several
million U.S. dollars, including attending more than 300 meetings
annually, contributions to ASEAN operations and opening five other
new embassies in member nations.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership in ASEAN offers both opportunities and
challenges. But Cambodia views the benefits of ASEAN membership as
outweighing the costs from a long-term point of view.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Inflation Rate Rises in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's inflation for April 1999
has risen to 5.4 percent, up from three percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index for April, according to a report
issued Thursday by the statistics department, also registered a
rise in the monthly headline inflation rate to 1.7 percent in
April from 0.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices of staple foods also went up significantly in
Kampala, Mbale, Masaka and Jinja.
</P>
<P>
Sugar price alone went up by over 20 percent in the country.
The composite food group index rose by 3.5 percent while other
group indices have remained relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rise in headline inflation, the report said, the
underlying inflation fell to 3.4 percent from 4.6 percent in
March. This drop was mainly attributed to lower price levels of
milk in the country's capital and the southwestern district of
Mbarara, which provide milk for most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Headline inflation takes into account all items including food.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepalese Voters Cherish Expectations From Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese voters cherish high
expectations for the parliamentary elections scheduled for May 3
and May 17, though with different concerns.
</P>
<P>
For dwellers in the capital city of Kathmandu, issues like
political stability and law and order are their major concerns.
</P>
<P>
Krishna Parajuli, a government official, complained that
development works have been stopped completely during the last
four years due to the emergence of coalition politics.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom had witnessed six governments after a hung
parliament emerged in the mid-term polls in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The economic condition of the nation is very bad," Parajuli
told Xinhua. "Unemployment, corruption and irregularities should
be stopped, there should be a consensus among the political
parties about the development of the country."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that one party wins in the election to
avoid inconsistencies in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"If one party cannot garner a majority, then there should be
the coalition of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. The Nepali
Congress and the CPN-UML should work unitedly for the welfare of
the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal
(Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) govern the country with the
Nepal Sadbhavana Party.
</P>
<P>
Anju Khatiwada, a college student, said, "Law and order,
development, end of corruption should be the main agenda of the
new government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A single-party government is needed for the development of the
nation and I hope the forthcoming election will give a majority to
one party," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mamata Sharma, a housewife, agreed. "It is better if one party
wins in the election. Coalition government is the root cause of
corruption," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the new government should first of all maintain
law and order in the country. She hoped that the new government
would bring down the soaring prices of goods, work for the welfare
of the low-income people and heed such problems as drinking water,
health, education and garbage.
</P>
<P>
For farmers, employment, drinking water and road are their main
worries.
</P>
<P>
Kumar Basnet, a 23-year-old farmer, wishes to join the army or
police or get a low-level office job because the land cannot
support his four-member family. He has to depend on his parents
for livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He said the villagers need drinking water and road as well, but
no changes have taken place in the village in the past years;
after election, the candidates forgot their promises.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Bank, the official
unemployment rate in Nepal was 14 percent in 1997 but
underemployment is widespread with about 50 percent of the working
population working less than 40 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
Dol Bahadur Karki, a farmer living in Nasika Village
Development Committee of Bhaktapur district, said, "the candidates
should work for the welfare of the people and the nation. They
should focus their attention on the country."
</P>
<P>
He said the villagers want the candidates to solve the problems
of drinking water, road, education and everything necessary for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll conducted on 7,841 eligible voters
in 104 of the 205 constituencies in the country, major concerns of
the voters are rising prices and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted in late February and early March by ORG-MARG
Nepal, a leading market research company, found that nearly 28
percent of the respondents termed rising prices as their main
problem while more than 18 percent regarded unemployment as their
major concern.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 29 percent of the respondents were worried about lack of
development works in their vicinity whereas 7 percent referred to
corruption as their worries, the poll found.

KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Weather conditions have turned

International Horticultural Exposition, scheduled to open this

experts with the Yunnan Provincial Meteorological Station said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The weather forecast issued by the station says that from
Friday evening through Saturday, weather conditions in Kunming
will be cloudy to clear, with a temperature ranging from 14 to 23
degrees centigrade and a light to gentle breeze.

<P>
The opening ceremony of the horti-expo '99, the first world

rainfalls during this period, though Kunming has witnessed several
small rains and a sharp drop of temperature in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"We have also taken some precautionary measures," said one
expert. "Even if some rain clouds drift over Kunming in the
following a few days, we can manage to prevent the rains from
falling."

<HEADLINE> Shas Delays Netanyahu Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- As storm brews around Shas
party leader Aryeh Deri's video cassette blasting the judiciary
and police, the Shas Council of Torah Sages has postponed its
meeting until next week to decide whether to support Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 copies of the 72-minute-long video, on which Deri
said his bribery conviction was the result of a frame-up and
blasts the judiciary and police investigations over his case, had
been publicly distributed by the party during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Shas sources as saying Friday that several
Likud officials Thursday criticized Shas for releasing the video
cassette.
</P>
<P>
They condemned Deri as a criminal who carried out serious
offenses and said he can not be allowed to involve in public life
or harness the whole Shas party as his tool.
</P>
<P>
Deri was sentenced to four years in prison on April 15 by the
Jerusalem District Court for bribe-taking and breaching of
justice. Deri said that his trial was not a fair one.
</P>
<P>
The video cassette has crossed all the lines and is an attempt
to distort the facts with the aim of brainwashing the public,
commented State Attorney Edna Arbel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Shas party, the ruling coalition partner of the
Likud, has 10 deputies in the current 120-member Knesset
(parliament).

<HEADLINE> Horti-Expo Propels Yunnan Development: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International
Horticultural Exposition, which is opening here this evening, will
serve as a major propellant to the social and economic development
of its host, Yunnan Province in southwest China, Yunnan Governor
Li Jiating said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The current horticultural show is the first world exposition
ever held in a developing country. The central government of China
has chosen Yunnan as the venue. This is really an opportunity in a
lifetime to us," said Li in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the horticultural exposition has
provided Yunnan, a secluded plateau province in deepest China,
with a golden opportunity to make itself better known to the rest
of the world, thus enabling the province to attract more foreign
visitors and investment.
</P>
<P>
The horti-expo '99 has drawn 95 participating countries and
international organizations. More than 2,000 journalists from all
over the world have gathered in Kunming, capital of Yunnan and the
main exposition venue, to cover this six-month-long garden
festival.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the Kunming Expo has stimulated the province to
step up its efforts to clean up the Dianchi Lake, China's sixth
largest fresh water lake near Kunming. The lake has become one of
the country's most seriously polluted lakes over the past two
decades as a result of urbanization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past five years and more, the central government and
local governments in Yunnan have invested more than three billion
yuan in the Dianchi cleanup project. Another 10 billion yuan are
expected to be injected into the project in the next few years,"
noted Li.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the horticultural show, Li said, Yunnan Province
and the city of Kunming have spent over 20 billion yuan on
building the expo venue and upgrading infrastructure facilities.
This has greatly helped boost domestic demand in Yunnan and
provided an impetus to the local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, this big spending will be paid off through
the rapid growth of the local tourism sector. Some 10 million
domestic and overseas tourists are expected to visit Yunnan for
the horti-expo, and the expo venue in Kunming suburbs, which
boasts rare plants and horticultural masterpieces across the world,
will become a permanent tourist attraction in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
"Kunming owes much to the holding of the exposition in
realizing its urban development plan several years ahead of
schedule. The roads and flyovers once planned to be built by 2008
have been already accomplished now," added the governor.

<HEADLINE> Rosy Prospects for S. Africa's Economy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Although South Africa is
still technically in recession, growth prospects for the next year
are surprisingly good, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
Releasing his latest Economic Monitor on Thursday, Rian le
Roux, head of Old Mutual Asset Managers' economic research unit,
predicted that growth rate would average 0.5 percent in 1999,
compared with last year's 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth is expected to move up to at least three
percent next year, edging up to five percent or more thereafter.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that interest rates would fall to 16 percent
by year end from the present 19 percent, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit for 1999 is expected to be five
billion rand (833 million U.S. dollars), or 0.7 percent of the
GDP, against 13.5 billion rand (2.25 billion dollars), or 2.1
percent of the GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain under control, dropping from
7.9 percent at present to below four percent by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that a firm anti-inflationary policy would
be necessary as salary rises would keep core inflation at around
seven percent, three times higher than the international norm.
</P>
<P>
Le Roux based his optimism about the overall direction of the
economy on the "surprisingly early" recovery of Asian economies
after last year's slump and the continued strength of the U.S.
economy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Recommends Charging Sharon With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police have recommended
that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon be indicted for allegedly
bribing a former general in return for his favorable testimony in
Sharon's libel suit against local daily Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz Friday quoted reports leaked from the police as saying
that investigators have also recommended the indictment of the
former general, Avigdor Ben Gal, and Russian tycoon Vladimir
Gusinski for their alleged part in the affair.
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said that the police have
turned the file over to State Attorney Edna Arbel. But she would
not confirm or deny the reported recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior legal sources said that Arbel and Attorney
General Elyakim Rubinstein would delay their decision on the
matter until after the coming general elections, which is due to
begin on May 17 and may last until early June.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the ruling Likud Party expressed surprise
that the police might make its recommendation two-and-a-half weeks
before the elections, and concluded that "inappropriate
considerations" had guided the police's timing.
</P>
<P>
Sharon had sued Haaretz and its journalist Uzi Benziman over a
1991 article in the newspaper stating that, as defense minister in
1982, Sharon led Israel into a full-scale war in Lebanon without
the consent of then prime minister Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
After Tel Aviv District Court ruled against Sharon in early
1997, Sharon appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Defending its report, Haaretz requested testimony from Ben
Gal, who fought in Lebanon and was on record as saying during a
1987 lecture that Sharon had acted without Begin's knowledge and
had imposed a secret plan to expand the war on the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ben Gal at first refused to testify, but changed his mind
after returning home from a trip to Russia with Sharon, then
national infrastructure minister, in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
He then said in court that he had erred in the lecture and that
Sharon had not deceived Begin. He also signed a statement
declaring that he and Sharon had not discussed the case.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Ben Gal, who went into private business
after leaving the army, would get part of a lucrative natural-gas
deal with Russia as a result of the trip.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Haaretz filed a complaint with police over the
possible bribing in the case.

PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontiere has published
an investigation report on the exodus of Kosovo refugees on the
basis of hundreds of testimonies.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

domination by the Americans.
</P>

Japanese chief of government in 12 years to be officially received
by the White House on Friday. He will discuss with President Bill

force in the 21th century and a new version of ``Star War'' anti-
missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> North China Aims at Transnational Operations Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin
Municipality will focus its economic development on transnational
operations, trying to establish its own multinational enterprises
within five to ten years, noted Wang Shuzu, vice-mayor of the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Wang, in charge of the city's foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that the government plans to carry out the
strategy in three phases. First, provide the transnational
enterprises with the city's own products, becoming one part of the
international production and sales markets in one or two years'
time. And up to now, such enterprises buy products worth 50
million U.S. dollars from the municipality.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, cooperate with transnational corporations by various
means, and upgrade the city's technological level within three to
five years. Over 200 transnational firms have up to now invested
an amount of over 8 billion U.S. dollars in more than 300 projects
in Tianjin. And the technological level of related industries,
electronics, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and food processing, has
been developing at fast speed.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, develop transnational enterprises in the city within
five to ten years or longer. The municipality is now making
efforts to encourage the enterprises to set up branches or sales
networks abroad.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that they will focus on the development of three
industries, manufacturing, commercial and trade, and information
consultation. And the city is also encouraging the investment to
pillar or high and new-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Over 12,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been established in
Tianjin, the largest coastal city in north China. And the amount
of foreign investment now has been more than 10 billion U.S.
dollars, becoming the city with the largest foreign capital in
north China.

<HEADLINE> China Export Trade Fair Breaking New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The 15-day China Export
Commodities Trade Fair which closed here today has broken records
with both the number of participants and the transaction volume.
</P>
<P>
Total export transaction worth 11.55 billion U.S. dollars
changed hands at the fair, up 13.1 percent on that made in the
previous spring session.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a "thermometer" of China's foreign trade, the
biannual event this time attracted about 79,500 overseas buyers
from more than 170 countries and regions since it opened on April
15. The number of new comers accounted for over 20 percent of the
total participants.
</P>
<P>
There was a sign of resurgence of exports to the Republic of
Korea (ROK), Malaysia and Thailand, which rose by 20 percent on
the previous spring session.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business with the Middle East, Latin America, Africa
and Eastern Europe has been increasing drastically.
</P>
<P>
Products with chic brands, high added value and new
technological contents have shown the fastest export momentum. For
example, machinery products and articles for daily use became hot-
sellers, which earned 3.96 billion U.S. dollars and 5.78 billion U.
S. dollars, respectively. Together made up 84.25 percent of the
total transaction volume.
</P>
<P>
Famous Chinese home appliance producers, such as Haier, Gree,
Meidi and Chunlan, have done positive business at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Four of the 74 major private firms that had just been granted
the right to conduct foreign trade this year were allowed to enter
the fair. They clinched deals worth more than 8 million U.S.
dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has

<HEADLINE> China Suffered Most From Comfort Women Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China suffered most from the
comfort women practice introduced by the Japanese army during
World War II, a Chinese scholar has confirmed recently.
</P>
<P>
Su Zhiliang, professor and head of Shanghai Normal University's
history department, has just published his research results in a
book, Research on Comfort Women, revealing that more than 200,000
Chinese women were forced to serve as sex slaves, accounting for
about half of all comfort women at that time.
</P>
<P>
Comfort women, or sex slaves, refer to those who were forced to
provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers during the war.
</P>
<P>
Su, also director of the Chinese Center of Comfort-Women Issue
Studies, began his research on the issue in 1992, when he was a
visiting professor at Japan's Tokyo University. He gathered
evidence from the Japanese Defence Agency, Japanese veterans and
former comfort women.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, comfort women were first introduced in
Shanghai. And the city became home to over 80 comfort centers
after the first, the so called Yangjiazhai Recreational Center,
was set up by the Japanese army.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops established and operated such comfort centers
wherever they invaded in China during the eight-year war, Su said,
although these centers bore different names.
</P>
<P>
Su has also discovered and confirmed more than 60 comfort
centers in Nanjing, where Japanese intruders perpetrated the
Nanjing Massacre in December 1937, killing over 300,000 unarmed
Chinese soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The comfort women practice was a systematic crime authorized
by the then Japanese government, and China had the largest number
of victims," said Su in his book.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ready to Sell National Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
prepared itself for the selling of Uganda Airlines Corporation
(UAC), the national carrier, and is to directly negotiate with
South African Airways (SAA).
</P>
<P>
Friday's New Vision daily quoted government sources as saying
that the Divestiture Reform and Implementation Committee (DRIC)
resolved Tuesday to cancel the tender process after receiving no
bids for the airline by last Friday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to SAA, Privatization Minister Manzi Tumubweine
said the government is to enter direct negotiations with SAA with
a view to reaching an agreement by not later than May 31 this
year.
</P>
<P>
DRIC also accepted some conditions SAA gave as reasons fro
withdrawing from the bidding process, including changing the
airline code from QU to SA and the brand name from Uganda Airline
to one linked to SAA.
</P>
<P>
SAA also requested that the B737-500 aircraft leased from
Ansett be government's responsibility rather than the buyer's and
that the business and capital investment plans for the airline be
non-binding.
</P>
<P>
The buyer also rejected a requirement by which the Strategic
Equity Partner takes on all liabilities whether listed or not by
sale time.
</P>
<P>
DRIC rejected the conditions on April 21, two days before
bidding and SAA withdrew.
</P>
<P>
A working parliamentary committee was formed early this year
at the insistence of President Yoweri Museveni to examine and
advise on the privatization of the national carrier.
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended that the government transfers all UAC
 assets to a company newly-formed as national carrier, then call
for bids for the 49 percent shares to a strategic partner and
privatize the airline by April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Other airlines that had expressed interest in UAC were Air
Mauritius, Sabena, British Airways and Kenya Airways.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Fails to Get Offshore Oil Bidder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has closed the offer
for the rights to explore its offshore oil after receiving no
bids, South African Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Roger Swart, technical manager of Namcor, a state-owned
advisory agency, was quoted as saying that Namibia had become a
victim of lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Some of the world's biggest oil companies, including the Shell
Group and Mobil, cut their exploration budgets by about one fifth
because of a 35- percent drop in the crude oil price last year.
</P>
<P>
The cuts have affected drilling around the world, including
sites in the North Sea, Alaska and Angola.
</P>
<P>
"This has happened worldwide but particularly in Africa," Swart
said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia would not invite new bids until oil companies had
increased their exploration budgets, he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Quality of Domestic Gasoline Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the State
Bureau of Quality and Technological Supervision shows that all the
domestic gasoline products it inspected have reached state
standards.
</P>
<P>
The bureau asked the Center of Quality Supervision and Testing
of Petroleum Products to carry out the survey of 20 petroleum
manufacturers in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Gansu,
Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, and Beijing, Tianjin
and Shanghai cities during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
None of the petroleum products failed the tests, the bureau
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The products of those enterprises demonstrated the general
quality of the nation's petrol," said Xu Guoliang, deputy director
of the center.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the average lead content of the
petrol that was tested was only 0.005 gram a liter, a much smaller
content compared with the state standard of 0.013 gram a liter,
said Xu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the petroleum industry in China
is still facing various challenges.
</P>
<P>
One is that domestic petrol products still contain some kinds
of pollutant, which have not been strictly controlled by relevant
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that petrol companies have to keep improving the
quality of their products and provide more environment-friendly
products for the public.

"We young people should not only review the past history and
know the significance of the May 4th Movement, but also should
carry on further this spirit and face up to the future challenges,
" said Chan Yun Kun, chairman of the Alliance of Hong Kong Youth
Groups, while delivering a speech at a ceremony to mark the
beginning of a series of activities to commemorate the May 4th
Movement.
</P>
<P>
To mark the 80th anniversary of the Movement, nearly 1,000
middle school and college students and representatives of youth
groups gathered at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center
here Friday morning to review and commemorate the Movement.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was sponsored by the Alliance of Hong Kong Youth
Groups.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Chan Yun Kun urged the young people in Hong Kong to
devote themselves to the development and construction of the
motherland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A photo exhibition was shown and a forum conducted immediately
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee Hwa and Director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch
Jiang Enzhu and other officials and distinguished guests were
invited to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After seeing the photo exhibition, Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa said to the press that it is highly significant to review the
Movement, an important historic event for the Chinese people and
the Chinese nation, at the moment when "one country, two systems"
policy is being implemented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The May 4th Movement enlightened the young people to have
their own aspirations. But more important is that when the new
millennium is on the threshold, our young people must try hard to
study knowledge so that, instead of being rejected by the fast
changing society, you can use the knowledge to serve the society,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the youths in Hong Kong will dedicate themselves
to the society, the country and the nation.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier speech at Radio Television Hong Kong Friday
morning, the Chief Executive urged the Hong Kong youths to study
hard, dare to blaze a new trail and make contributions to Hong
Kong and the great motherland.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the Beijing University Prof. Wang Dengfeng
and two students from the University were present at the forum
which was also participated by students from Guangdong, Shenzhen
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Beginning early May, various commemorative activities will be
held here in Hong Kong, including photo shows, website discussions,
questions and answers contests, forums, souvenir making and story
book publication, under the theme of "carrying on the May 4th
spirit and encouraging the youths to shoulder tasks."

<HEADLINE> China Branding Products to Promote Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese companies have
realized the crucial fact that establishing a sleek brand image is
the key to promoting exports, according to sources with the on-
going China Export Commodities Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
The largest export event in the country, the fair held in this
capital of south China's Guangdong Province has been considered a
golden opportunity for domestic brands to make an impression on
overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the country's plummeting exports, many Chinese
companies have found their brand appeal still works at the fair.
Haier Group, which is China's most famous home appliance producer,
has closed deals worth 80 million U.S. dollars within 14 days of
the fair.
</P>
<P>
In order to foster more world famous brands, the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation announced 33 brands that
will be given preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister Chen Xinhua stressed the importance of protecting
the intellectual property rights of famous brands, especially with
Chinese companies making bigger strides in their overseas
operations.
</P>
<P>
Large Chinese exporters were invited to pass on their
experience of establishing brand images at the fair. Haier Group
boasts a successful overseas sales network with 30,000 sales
outlets abroad and the Ordos Cashmere Product Co. has registered
its trademark in more than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
Chunlan Group disclosed its idea for the key survival of a good
brand. The leading home appliance company has a 3,000-member
research and development team, and this guaranteed a 70-percent
export increase last year to 40 million U.S. dollars amidst
mounting foreign trade difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Harare's White Collar Crime Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- White collar crime is increasing
sharply in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, especially in the
government and banking sectors, with over 100 million Zimbabwean
dollars (2.6 million U.S. dollars) lost in 216 criminal incidents
in the first three months of this year, the daily Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the same period last year, 11 million Zimbabwean dollars
(280,000 U.S. dollars) was lost in 177 cases, Chief Superintendent
Ernest Kangara told the Herald Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the 216 cases reported this year, 168 people
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
President of Bankers' Association of Zimbabwe Elisha
Mushayakarara expressed concern at the prevalence of fraud in the
banking sector, saying while the rise could be attributed to
economic hardships, most of the culprits defrauded their companies
out of greed.
</P>
<P>
He said although fraud could initially go unnoticed, the
advanced technology presently being employed in the sector was
ensuring that culprits were being detected and brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
"Fraud in financial institutions, as in other institutions, is
basically attributable to the dishonesty of individuals. While
some blame the current environment for the high incidence of
fraud, the large sums involved seem attributable more to a desire
to get rich quickly than to desperation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Curbing Tian'anmen Billboards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Some experts in China's capital
are warning that the increasing number of advertisement billboards
around Tian'anmen Square and other tourist sites in the city are
spoiling the views.
</P>
<P>
They have urged that the municipal government draw up
regulations to control the spread of random commercial advertising
which is ruining the architectural style and landscaping of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Youth Daily, these experts are also
members of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, an advisory body of the government.
</P>
<P>
They have complained that Tian'anmen Square is almost
surrounded by billboards which destroy the views for tourists from
the Qianmen rostrum to the Temple of Heaven, another of Beijing's
internationally acclaimed symbols.
</P>
<P>
They also oppose the burgeoning number of commercial banners
which are hung in front of shopping malls and complain that many
buildings in downtown streets are totally obscured by those wildly
colorful banners, which should be regarded as another form of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The experts also appeal to the authorities to prohibit
commercial ads on public facilities, such as subway entrances.

<HEADLINE> Israel's New Strategy Against Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon have applied new tactics to avoid themselves sufferings the
deadly effects of roadside bombs planted by Lebanon's resistance
fighters, Lebanon's Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the new strategy is to replace some 1,000
Israeli troops with militiamen of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA), the paper quoted security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has started to train SLA personnel to man positions
that were particularly vulnerable to roadside bombs," one source
said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Israeli forces are studying the possibility of
drafting all Lebanese males living in the occupied zone,
regardless of their age, to serve in the SLA.
</P>
<P>
They have recently made some redeployment of the SLA to ensure
that the policy of drafting everyone can be more easily enforced,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new measures began almost immediately
after Brigadier General Erez Gerstein, Israel's most senior
commander in the south, was killed in a roadside bomb ambush in
February. Two Israeli soldiers and a journalist were also killed
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
"SLA militiamen now man 70 percent of the zone's outposts. The
Israelis want to increase this figure to the maximum without
having to withdraw completely," the source said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Israelis also plan to widen roads that they
frequently pass through up to 20 meters to allow troops to march in
the middle and reduce the impact of roadside bombs on targeted
patrols.
</P>
<P>
"They are also uprooting roadside trees to prevent resistance
fighters from using them for cover or hiding their bombs behind
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include new rules forbidding troops from leaving
their heavily guarded posts during the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israelis and SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> CDB Issues Floating Rate Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The China Development Bank (CDB)
announced today that it has successfully issued 10 billion yuan in
10 year floating rate bonds through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CDB said that the basic spread margin was
defined at 0.821 percent while the exercise rate for the first
year was 4.601 percent, which was down 1.429 percentage points
compared with the first batch of such bonds issued earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that 31 underwriters tendered the bidding, with the
total bidding volume reaching 26.72 billion yuan. The successful
bidders include the China Construction Bank, China Ping'an
Insurance Company Ltd., Huatai Insurance Company Ltd. and China
Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the major reason for the successful
bidding is that all the underwriters cherish a strong market for
the long term floating rate bonds, of which the investment value
has been gradually emerging.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Wheat Production Exceeds Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi farmers produced two
million tons of wheat this year, 0.1 million tons more than the
fixed target, the Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This good result was attributable to increased acreage of wheat
cultivated land, the report quoted a source in the Agriculture
Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The department fixed the target of 0.85 million hectares of
land for wheat cultivation but the farmers cultivated 0.857
million hectares of land, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, wheat production target was fixed at 1.6 million tons
but the country produced about 1.8 million tons, because the
farmers cultivated about 0.8 million hectares of land against the
fixed target of 0.7 million hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The country's food requirement was estimated at 22 million
tons, and this two million tons of wheat will be able to meet
one-eleventh of the country's total food requirement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Study Group on Helen Snow Ends Visit in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An American group studying the
noted writer and journalist Helen Snow, has wound up a week long
visit in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Helen Snow, born in Utah, came to China in 1931 at the age of
23. She wrote many books on China and was devoted to the promotion
of friendship and understanding between people of China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The study group, headed by Eril Hyer, a scholar of China issues
from the U.S. Kennedy Center for International Studies, is
preparing a documentary film on the life of Helen Snow. They are
visiting the places where Helen Snow had worked including Yan'an,
formerly headquarters of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and
the former offices of the Red Army and Red Army University. They
will also talk to people who have witnessed major Chinese
historical events.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. film crew is expected to arrive in Shaanxi in August
this year to commence shooting the documentary. The film is
expected to be premiered at the first International Workshop on
Helen Snow to be held at Brigham Young University next year.

<HEADLINE> Gala Performance Marking Expo '99: A Romantic Melody of Heaven and Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A grand gala is to be held in a
stadium here tonight to celebrate the opening of the China '99
Kunming International Horticultural Exposition.
</P>
<P>
With the beautiful name "a romantic melody of heaven and earth",
the gala performance is designed centering round the Expo theme "
man and nature". In the form of singing and dancing against
spectacular lighting background, it depicts the harmonious co-
existence between man and nature in the open space between heaven
and earth.
</P>
<P>
The melody is divided into four movements, namely the blue,
golden, green and miscellaneous colors. The first movement depicts
the earth, the eternal home of man. With colorful imagination, it
leads the spectators from the star-dotted universe created by the
lighting effect gradually down to the earth. Amid the roaring
music, a voice over the music seems to cry out: "We have only one
earth. Let us cherish it as it is our common home."
</P>
<P>
The second movement, "Golden Movement", brings the spectators
closer to the theme of the Exposition. A massive flock of Yunnan
golden monkey, the mascot of the Exposition, occupy the center
stage, doing traditional operas, acrobatics and dancing amid
lively music, depicting harmonious coexistence of man and animals.
</P>
<P>
The Green Movement brings the multifarious gardens of the five
continents before the spectators. Cleverly blended with exotic
singing and dancing, it conveys the message that man can get
bountiful returns from nature if kind enough to it and that nature
has bestowed us with life and the environment for survival and we
must, in return, create more beautiful woods and gardens to
beautify and protect our environment.
</P>
<P>
The last movement presents to the audience a picture of Yunnan,
where the Expo site is located. Set against a gigantic peacock,
symbol of propitiousness and luck, there is a dazzling array of
singing and dancing performances by people of different minority
nationalities inhabiting the province. The lively songs and
beautiful dances suggest that the future of humankind is bright
and the people of the whole world should march hand in hand into
the new century and the beautiful future.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 performers take part in the gala performance
tonight, starring such well-known dancers and singers as Yang
Liping, Zhou Jie, Peng Liyuan and Song Zuying.

the country's laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
 The project, initiated by the All-China Federation of Trade

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Method for Oil Extraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Oil scientists from northwest
China's Qinghai Oilfields have developed a new oil-extraction
method, using acidifying technology, to increase oil recovery
rates, reports the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The method involves using a chemical compound injected deep
into the earth with dehydrated crude oil as a carrier, causing a
chemical reaction to produce a strong solvent to remove blockages
on the inner sides of oil wells.
</P>
<P>
The compound can also decrease the density of crude oil for
better and smoother extraction and has no corrosive effects.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese oilfields have had low oil recovery rates and lack
the means to break well blockages.
</P>
<P>
Research on the technology started in 1996 which became
perfected through practice and improvements. The new method has
been applied to some oil wells in the Qinghai Oilfields, and has
produced good results. Six increased crude oil output by 30,000
tons, valued at 26 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimate that the ratio of investment to return for
the technology is one to eight and the rate of oil recovery in the
country's oilfields can be greatly raised if the technology is
adopted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China will step up reform of its
fiscal system and enhance the proportion of its revenue in the GDP
to 20 percent in three to five years, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice finance minister Lou Jiwei was quoted by today's China
Securities News as saying that the country will also expand
revenue for the central government to make it account for 60
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"The pro-active fiscal policies adopted by China last year,
especially the issuance of the extra 100 billion yuan treasury
bonds, have proved to be effective," Lou said, adding that China
will pay more attention to the coordination of fiscal and monetary
policies as well as the exercise of macro-control by the
government.
</P>
<P>
China's revenue in 1998 accounted for 12.4 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the central government will gradually scale down
its deficit and debts beginning next year aiming to keep them at a
reasonable level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reform on the management of the government's budget will take
some time as there is a lot of work to be done, but the government
is committed to the development of an effective fiscal system,
according to Lou.

engineers and technicians, to prevent the alleged further
destruction of property, acting Postmaster-General Sizo Mhlanga
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Posts and Telecommunications board was concerned
about the sabotage which had characterized the strike, badly
crippling the country's communications and business transactions.
</P>
<P>
He said such action, which affected commerce, industry and
state security, could not be condoned. Police investigations were
underway and the law would take its course.
</P>
<P>
Measures were, however, being taken to ensure that any
disruption of services was minimized, he said, the daily Herald
report Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this, the Posts and Telecommunications board has
authorized the dismissal of all striking PTC engineers and
technicians and those who incited such strike actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the serious disruptions of telecommunications services
amounted to unpatriotic and selfish actions on the part of a small
number of well- paid people in secure jobs at a time of national
economic hardships for the majority of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The PTC engineers and technicians started the national strike
Tuesday, demanding a 200-percent salary increment.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Needs $662 Million to Bridge Financing Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia still needs a total of 662
million U. S. dollars to bridge its financing gap this year
following an agreement of 219 million dollars debt relief granted
by Paris Club creditors a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Friday quoted Finance and Economic
Development Permanent Secretary Boniface Nonde as saying the
government needed both multilateral project and program assistance
in order to bridge this gap.
</P>
<P>
Nonde disclosed Thursday during the second convention on the
economy of Zambia being held in Lusaka, the government reached an
agreement with Paris Club creditors on the re-organization of debt
service payments falling due in the 1999-2001 period.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, debt relief in 1999 is expected to be 219 million
dollars, thus leaving a financing gap of 662 million dollars. To
fill this gap, both multilateral and bilateral project, commodity
and program assistance is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the performance of the economy last year was greatly
affected by the withholding of balance of payments support and
debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had to pay 132 million dollars to its creditors, 89.4
million dollars of which was paid to multilateral creditors and
the United States while 29.7 million dollars was paid of Paris
Club creditors. About 12.8 million was paid to Bank of Zambia and
parastatals, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges U.S. to Lift Sanctions on Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has called on the United States to lift sanctions on
Iranian products.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Friday that
Kharrazi made the appeal Thursday in a response to recent
U.S. lift of sanctions against sale of U.S. food and medicine to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. sanctions against Iranian products should be lifted
and the American public must have access to Iranian caviar,
pistachio and other Iranian products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration announced Wednesday to permit sales of
food and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan. The sanctions
change would cover sales of wheat, corn, feed, soybeans, edible
oils, meat, fish, baby food and formula.
</P>
<P>
The change will pave the way for the U.S. administration to
approve a request by Iran to purchase more than 500 million
U.S. dollars worth of grain and sugar.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian minister said that despite Washington's
recent move, the U.S. political position towards Iran is exactly
the same as it was before.
</P>
<P>
The decision serves only to protect the interests of American
producers, he said, noting the U.S. sanctions against purchase of
Iranian commodities continue to exist.

<HEADLINE> No Problem With Visas: Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Oman's top immigration
official has denied reports that foreign tourists face
difficulties in obtaining visas to visit the country, the
Dubai-based Khaleej Times daily said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some press reports said that Oman delays in issuing visas and
charges high fees, said Director-Gerneral of Passports and
Residence Said bin Hilal Al Kindy. "Such reports are totally
baseless," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Oman had significantly improved and sped up
formalities for issuing visit visas in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Tourists arriving in groups were now granted visas on the basis
of a single application submitted by travel agencies or tour
operators, instead of separate applications from each member, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a team specially devoted to issuing tourist visas and
working two shifts," he said, observing that the delay was often
caused by the tourists themselves by supplying inaccurate or
incomplete data.
</P>
<P>
He said tourist groups applying collectively through travel
and tourism companies could get their visas within hours.
</P>
<P>
For individual tourists, it usually takes 24 to 36 hours to get
their visas.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of visa costs, the official said that fees
charged by Oman were "very reasonable" compared to those levied by
neghboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said that citizens of countries that charge higher
visa fees for Omani citizens should not complain if they receive
the same treatment in Oman.
</P>
<P>
This was strictly a "bilateral issue," he pointed out, adding
that tourists or businessmen belonging to countries that charge
too much for visas should not in turn "point the finger at us."

JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. officials Thursday refuted a claim by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he had helped the U.S. write
the letter which was sent to the Palestinians before they began
to discuss the postponement of a statehood declaration early
this week. A U.S. official stressed in Tel Aviv that "the
Israelis had nothing to do with the writing of the letter."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council
Thursday voted to delay a decision on statehood until after
the coming Israeli elections. The delay allows the Palestinians
to keep the international community's goodwill while avoiding a
pre-election crisis with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a public opinion poll conducted early this
week, both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
opposition party Labor leader Ehud Barak will get 37 percent of
the votes in the first round of elections on May 17. But if the
second round of elections is held in early June, Barak will get
50 percent of the vote while Netanyahu will get only 42
percent.

</P>
<P>
"This is only the beginning. The coming days will witness a

The heat wave has seriously affected normal life with the
temperature soaring above 45 degrees Celsius in many regions of
the country. Cities wear an almost deserted look even on weekdays,

State, 1,015 km southeast of New Delhi, have been closed for
summer vacation from May 1 as a "precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
The entire Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh States in northern
India have continued to reel under intense heat wave as the rising

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States scored nine
goals against nil in a women's soccer friendly against Japan in
Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the most lopsided game for the United States who had its
50-game unbeaten home record snapped four days ago by China, with
Tiffeny Milbrett had her third four-goal feat for the national
squad.
</P>
<P>
"Japan came up against a team with a lot of incentive, and we
got some things done tonight," said Tony DiCicco, coach of the U.S.
nationals who had improved to 11-0 in the series against Japan,
including shutouts in seven of their last eight meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The Japan team is not that bad, but I was very proud of our
team," said DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
"My teammates gave me great passes," Milbrett said, "I found
some spaces when they found me, and we were able to get it in."
</P>
<P>
The other scorers included Cindy Parlow, Michelle Akers,
Kristine Lilly, Tisha Venturini and Aly Wagner.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese were seldom in control of the ball with only about
two minutes on the U.S. side of the field in the first half, and
that total didn't increase significantly in the second.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan will play again in Atlanta on
Sunday to tune up for the Women's World Cup in June.

According to the U.N. estimates, over half the urban population
in most developing countries live in informal settlements which
are neither recognized nor serviced by city authorities.
</P>
<P>
The urban poor are the most excluded group in cities and do not
have access to formal finance and loan schemes which could enable
them to improve their living conditions, said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said that the U.N. Development Program and the Habitat
have implemented the micro-finance projects to lend small sums of
money to the poor without a collateral, which most banks consider
too trivial to be lending-worthy.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the press, saying that the 17th session of the
Commission on Human Settlements will take place in Kenyan capital
Nairobi from May 5 to 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The session of the commission will review and take decisions on
the Habitat's work program in light of the ongoing revitalization
of the agency and its new strategic focus as the U.N. agency for
cities, according to Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The 2000-2001 biennial budget for the agency, cooperation with
its partners such as municipal authorities and non-governmental
organizations will also be the focus of the upcoming conference,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The pressure of the urbanizing process is easily perceived in
the developing world with inadequate shelter, lack of clean water
and security problems.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 out of 20 mega cities with more than 10 million people
will be in the developing countries at the beginning of the next
century, a U. N. research program predicts.

<HEADLINE> Angola-EU Fishery Pact Extended for Another Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Council of Ministers
has decided to extend for another year the agreement on fishery
cooperation between Angola and the European Union (EU), effective
as of May 1.
</P>
<P>
The government gazette issued here Thursday said both sides
think positively of the achievements in their cooperation in
fishery for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
They would pay more attention to the actual benefits of their
cooperation during the extended period.
</P>
<P>
The EU will increase scholarships for the Angolan trainees and
the Angolan government can send personnel to be trained in any of
the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has agreed to liberalize the licensing
process toward the ship owners interested in fishing in the
Angolan seas. They can now apply for fishing license from the
Angolan Ministry of Fisheries through the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
But the sales of the licensed fishing ships should be managed
by the Angolan residents formally acknowledged by the authorities
so that the Angolan government can secure the 40 percent share as
stipulated in the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the fishery accord signed on May 3, 1996, the
Angolan government may issue licenses to EU ships, allowing them
to fish in its coastal areas. The EU fishing ships should give 40
percent of their catch to the Angolan government in addition to
the EU technical support for the Angolan fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
Angola boasts of one of the richest fishing fields in Africa
with a commercial reserve of 850,000 tons of various fishes per
year.
</P>
<P>
For last year, 230,000 tons of fish were caught with 100,000
tons by foreign fishing ships.
</P>
<P>
The EU ships account for over half of the formally registered
foreign fleets fishing in the Angolan seas.

<HEADLINE> 6 Million Weed Eating Weevils Put into Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of six million
weevils have been put into Lake Victoria to curb the rampant
growth of the hyacinth weed which have hampered the free movement
of vessels and affected biodiversity in the largest African lake.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Lake Environment Management Project
(LEVMP), Peter Mjema, said here Wednesday that the weevils,
released between August of 1997 and March this year, have been
reared in different centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Thursday quoted Mjema as telling a workshop on
environment issues that the weed eating beetles have multiplied
into billions in the lake shared by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The released weevils, he said, fall into two species which were
imported from Benin in 1995 and have been reared at the Kibaha
Biological Control Centers, Sigi and Pangani rivers in the
northern Tanga Region and in the areas around the world's second
largest freshwater lake.
</P>
<P>
Although the environment official could not say how many tons
of hyacinth had so far been destroyed by the weevils, he was
optimistic that the biological control means would succeed.
</P>
<P>
He said biological control of the hyacinth that have encroached
on all bays of the lake would be won, taking into consideration
that the weevils matured in 60 days in Tanzania, compared with 90
days in Benin.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to get as many weevils as possible to fight the
water weed in Lake Victoria," he said.
</P>
<P>
First noticed in 1989, the weed has spread like wild fire, and
has formed a dense mat, blocking sunlight for organisms below,
depleting the low concentrations of oxygen and trapping fishing
boats and nets of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
The hyacinth is an ideal habitat for snails that cause
bilharzia. Scientists have desperately tried to control the weed.
</P>
<P>
People around the lake have also used mechanical means to
control the merciless, free-floating weed which reproduced
rapidly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Palestinian Delay on Declaration of Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it welcomed the Palestinians' decision not to
declare a Palestinian state on May 4 when the Oslo interim peace
accord expires.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the decision," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We've said that we think it's very important for neither the
Palestinians nor the Israelis to pursue unilateral acts or
declarations.... And so the fact that the Palestinians have
indicated that they do not intend at this time to declare a
Palestinian state is something we welcome warmly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council agreed on Thursday to delay a
decision on statehood until after Israel's May 17 election.
</P>
<P>
The decision not to decide for now gives Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat new room to maneuver at a critical time when Israeli
voters are closely watching his every move.
</P>
<P>
It also robs Israel's hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of fear-mongering material for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council also agreed on Thursday that it
will meet again in June to review its stance.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday proposed that the
Israelis and Palestinians complete their talks within a year,
starting after Israel's election, so that the core issues,
including the final status of Jerusalem, and the creation of a
Palestinian state, could be settled.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Signs Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday signed the Education Flexibility Partnership Bill, giving
states greater freedom in spending federal education dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows all states to receive waivers of certain
federal education requirements in order to improve school and
student performance.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton, before painstakingly marking his signature on the
bill with more than a dozen pens that would become the lawmakers'
souvenirs, threatened to undo the legislation if it didn't work
the way Republican sponsors promised.
</P>
<P>
He pressed the Republican majority in Congress to take up his
own education agenda: massive new federal funds for hiring
teachers, modernizing and building schools, and testing students
against national standards.
</P>
<P>
Republicans had criticized the Democrats' agenda as a "one-size-
fits-all" approach to fixing the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
The bill, commonly called "Ed-Flex", was the first substantive
act to emerge from the post-impeachment Congress. It was approved
overwhelmingly in the House and Senate last week. Its passage was
cheered by Republicans who advocate allowing more local authority
over nearly 11 billion U.S. dollars in education spending this
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The legislation covers all 50 states and the District of
Columbia with a program established in 1994 that freed 12 states
and school districts from some rules for obtaining federal funds
and let them establish their own programs under which they would
be accountable for academic results.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans High-Level Meeting on Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced plans for a White House meeting on youth violence as the
last victim of the Columbine school shooting was buried in
Colorado State on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would summon Hollywood leaders and others for
the meeting on preventing violence like last week's massacre at
the Colorado high school in which 15 people died.
</P>
<P>
"I plan to bring some high-level folks from the entertainment
industry and from other sectors of our society that I think can be
active here together at the White House in the near future and
then figure out how we can put together the elements of a national
campaign," Clinton said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
The campus tragedy has shocked the whole nation and triggered a
heated discussion on its causes. People have blamed the killings
mainly on easy access to weapons, a culture of violence promoted
by the entertainment industry, and the explosion of the largely
unregulated Internet.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 people attended a memorial service for 18-year-
old Isaiah Schoels, the only African-American among those killed.
</P>
<P>
The four-hour service was attended by Colorado Governor Bill
Owens and Martin Luther King III, who attributed youth violence to
American culture, especially to movies and video games.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Praises Joint Statement of Serb, Ethnic Albanian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Thursday praised a joint statement by Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and Kosovar ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova on political and peaceful efforts to solve the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
It was the first joint victory of Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
their search for peace during the adversity of war, Milosevic said
here at a meeting with senior government officials on the
political process of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Milutinovic briefed the meeting on his Pristina
talks with Rugova and their signing of the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic praised the statement as "a significant threshold to
completely implement the comprehensive self-rule of Kosovo
residents with the equality of all ethnic nations."
</P>
<P>
All real advocates of a political solution should support the
on-going process and firmly oppose NATO aggression against
Yugoslavia, which is the biggest obstacle to a political solution,
said Milosevic. Only a political and peaceful solution could bring
the Kosovo people permanent peace and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement signed in Pristina on Wednesday,
Milutinovic called for an immediate resumption of direct talks
between the Serbian government and ethnic Albanian political
leaders as well as an early political agreement, which will grant
Kosovo comprehensive self-rule with full equality of all other
ethnic groups and with respect to the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Serbia and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Chino On ADB's Role in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tadao Chino, president of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), Friday vowed to help address
challenges in the Asian Pacific region in efforts to achieve the
maximum development.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the bank's role in the new century, Chino said the
bank will continue to help the region's development in a
sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the bank's 32nd Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors, Chino said the bank will
"continue to provide assistance to the affected economies."
</P>
<P>
"We should concentrate our assistance on restructuring of the
banking and corporate sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the severe impact of the crisis, he said, the bank
will strengthen its assistance to directly address the poverty
problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also need to continue providing assistance for
developing the region's infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will place increasing emphasis on enhancing
its members' institutional capacity for economic and sector
management, he said.
</P>
<P>
On subregional cooperation, he said the bank has made continual
and concerted efforts to promote the cooperation. "Close
subregional cooperation is an effective and important way to
sustain regional development."
</P>
<P>
Chino also asked for the support of the bank's shareholders in
accomplishing the bank's challenging mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu, chairman of the Board of Governors of the ADB, called on
the bank to continue to fulfill its development mandate.
</P>
<P>
"Although the need for post-crisis support remains, the bank
must continue to fulfill its development mandate," Espiritu said
in his address delivered at the opening session of the bank's 32nd
Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
The bank can and must continue to provide development
assistance -- both capital and technical -- on a large enough
scale to honor its development mandate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank must play a leading role in the
overwhelming task of combating the poverty and the social
inequity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third set of activities that the bank must undertake is to
strengthen regional and subregional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also called for the bank's efforts to provide and
stimulate regional intellectual leadership on development issues.
</P>
<P>
Governors of the bank's 57 members, including finance ministers
and central bank governors, and some 2,000 officials from banks
and the international financial institutions, are attending the
three-day meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The financing needs and future role of the bank will be the
main topic of discussions at the meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will soon be in need of a fresh injection of capital
and will use this year's annual meeting to beat that drum to the
governors, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The Board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and public financial management to
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multilateral development
finance institution and has 57 members.
</P>
<P>
With 41 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Top Italian Banks Under Probes for Collusion Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy, the Italian central
bank, Thursday opened an investigation into 13 of the largest
Italian banks for alleged "systematic exchange of information"
about customer accounts and property holdings.
</P>
<P>
A long list of Italy's top banks, including Cariplo, Bank of
Rome, Italian Commercial Bank, are under suspicion for collusive
actions that could harm competition. These banks account for 55
percent of the country's deposits.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Italy, which regulates the Italian banking system,
launched the investigation after findings at Cariplo revealed
meetings between representatives of the banks.
</P>
<P>
This so-called "Friends of the Bank Group" has reportedly met
monthly since 1997, rotating the gatherings among the banks'
premises.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Italy said it has discovered documents that laid
out discussions on commercial strategies to allow for the
coordination of policies of the respective parties.
</P>
<P>
The information allegedly shared by the banks includes the
balance between lira and foreign currencies, deposits, savings
management, investment, interest rates on loans and deposits, and
commissions for various services.
</P>
<P>
In its action on April 19, the Bank of Italy said the meetings
"were susceptible to opening the way for accords or practical
agreements that, by design or by effect, could constrain, impede
or falsify internal competitions" in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The national bank said it would not rule out the possibility
that these meetings could have led to the "direct or indirect
fixing of prices and other contractual conditions."
</P>
<P>
The 13 banks, which account for 60 percent of Italian
investment in the banking industry, have 30 days to respond to the
allegations. The entire investigation should conclude within 150
days of the original notice.

time, Cambodia missed various opportunities to join ASEAN due to
its political turmoil and a protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
October 1994: Cambodia submitted a formal application for
observer status in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>

amendment of the Cambodian Constitution and formation of the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Espiritu Calls on ADB to Fulfill Development Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu, chairman of the Board of Governors of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), Friday called on the bank to continue to
fulfill its development mandate.
</P>
<P>
"Although the need for post-crisis support remains, the bank
must continue to fulfill its development mandate," Espiritu said
in his address at the opening session of the bank's 32nd Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
The bank can and must continue to provide development
assistance -- both capital and technical -- on a large enough
scale to honor its development mandate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank must play a leading role in the
overwhelming task of combating the poverty and the social
inequity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third set of activities that the bank must undertake is to
strengthen regional and subregional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also called for the bank's efforts to provide and
stimulate regional intellectual leadership on development issues.
</P>
<P>
Governors of the bank's 57 members, including finance ministers
and central bank governors, and some 2,000 officials from banks
and international financial institutions, are attending the
three-day meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The financing needs and future role of the bank will be the
main topic of discussions at the meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will soon be in need of a fresh injection of capital
and will use this year's annual meeting to beat that drum to the
governors, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors, the ADB's highest policy-making body,
comprises one representative from each member and meets annually.
</P>
<P>
The Board elects the Board of Directors every two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the bank also holds seminars on issues
ranging from poverty reduction and public financial management to
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB is a multilateral development
finance institution and has 57 members.
</P>
<P>
With 41 of its members from the Asian and Pacific region, the
bank engages in a wide range of social and economic development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people of the
region.

<HEADLINE> 69 Pct of Eligible Voters Register For Indonesia's Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-nine percent of eligible
voters have already registered themselves to take part in
Indonesia's general election scheduled for June 7, media reports
said Friday, quoting General Election Commission (KPU) Chairman
Rudini.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-nine percent have already registered and we still have
seven days to go. Although I am relieved, I am still hoping the
figure will increase to exceed 70 percent," Rudini said after a
meeting with President B.J. Habibie here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rudini reported to the president on ongoing preparations for
the elections and the tasks already executed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
The figure was impressive, "so rumors that people reject the
elections are not true," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rudini ruled out the possibility for a voter to cast a ballot
more than once, as every voter will be given a special mark on his
or her finger made with a special ink that cannot be erased for
three days.
</P>
<P>
He admitted there was a possibility for a voter to register at
two different places. But "remember if the act is found out, the
voter could be sent to jail for three years," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration nationwide started on April 5 and will end
on May 4, but it will be extended until mid-May in provinces such
as Irian Jaya, Maluku, East Timor and Aceh which have been hit by
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Rudini also said the KPU stuck to its decision not to allow
cabinet ministers to campaign for parties contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
"But we will give special treatment to ministers who happen to
chair political parties. They can campaign provided they can take
leave and the president names their temporary replacements," he
was quoted by national newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rudini was referring to Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung,
who is chairman of Golkar Party, and State Minister of Investment
Hamzah Haz, leader of the United Development Party.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the People's Consultative
Assembly decided in November last year to hold a multiparty
general election on June 7 this year. Out of 140 political parties
in the country, 48 parties have the qualifications to participate
in the election.
</P>
<P>
In the past 32 years when former president Soeharto was in
power, only three parties -- the ruling Golkar, the United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party -- were
allowed to contest the general election.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21 last year amid the worst
political and economic crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Fights against Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
has pledged to clear the air of its heavily polluted capital city
in five years.
</P>
<P>
Urumqi suffered from fourth-degree air pollution for eight
weeks and fifth-degree pollution for 13 weeks last year as the
city's 7,000 industrial and household stoves consumed 7 million
tons of coal each winter. In addition, discharge of motor vehicle
exhaust and dust particles in the air are regarded as the main
source for the serious air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city government has decided to replace the use of coal with
gas and oil in major urban districts. The residential quarters
covered by the central heating system will be expanded to 25.7
million sq. m., or making up half of the total urban districts, in
two years' time.
</P>
<P>
As of this year, all coal-fueled stoves at commercial
establishments and construction sites in downtown area will be
replaced with those that consume gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
A 180-km-long pipeline will be laid this year to provide
natural gas for 30,000 households in Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
The driving licenses of over-used motor vehicles, which
discharge heavy pollutants, will be revoked this year. The
government will also ban the production and sales of leaded
gasoline from July 1.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Institutions to Invest 40 Mln Dollars in PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Four Philippine government
financial institutions (GFI) with stakes in Philippine Airlines
(PAL) would raise up to 40 million U.S. dollars in fresh capital
for the country's flag carrier to support its rehabilitation plan,
Philippine Daily Inquirer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said this was after PAL made a 200 million U.S.
dollar call for a capital increase, of which 100 million U.S.
dollars had already been infused by the flag carrier's dominant
stockholder, tobacco and beer magnate Lucio Tan.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu as saying
the four GFIs' subscription to the capital call would be subject
to certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The program must ensure that PAL is going to be viable and
that there's going to be a retrenchment," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, there's going to be an initial public offering so
that there'll be an exit mechanism for the GFIs. The GFIs will
exercise their option, then within three to five years, they can
demand redemption of the shares at par value," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The four GFIs -- Philippine National Bank, Land Bank of the
Philippines, Development Bank of the Philippines and the
Government Service Insurance System -- would only raise the amount
to prevent the dilution of their stakes in PAL, Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the four GFIs, which were previously unwilling
to heed any capital call, had a change of heart because they
wanted to help save the beleaguered airline as well as their
existing investments in it.
</P>
<P>
The four GFIs together control 14 percent of PAL, equivalent to
three board seats, an investment that many had all along
considered ill-advised especially when PAL stared losing in the
early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
approved a 250-million-euro (264.78 million U.S. dollars)
reconstruction aid package for Central America, Nicaragua's
Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These funds, to be given in the next four years, will go to the
countries most affected by Hurricane Mitch which struck Honduras,
Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental objective of the package is to reconstruct the
education and sanitary systems and ease the external debt load in
Central America, said an official from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The package is also aimed at reinforcing the norms of law and
improving living standards in the region, added the official.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's ambassador to the European Union (EU) Leonel Teller
Sanchez said that together with the above aid package, the EU has
also approved 100 million euros (105.9 million dollars) of
emergency aid to mitigate the effects of Hurricane Mitch and
another 35 million euros (37.07 million dollars) for private
sectors in Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan diplomat explained that in addition to the
reconstruction plan, the European Commission has approved 8.2
million euros (8.7 million dollars) for technical assistance.
Total assistance for the Central American countries affected by "
Mitch" is over 416.8 million euros (441.4 million dollars), said
the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Athletes' Field Test Results Disappoint Indonesian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) is disappointed with the results of the physical
fitness tests conducted by six of the sports bodies preparing
their athletes for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
Moch. Hindarto, KONI's official in charge of athlete
development, urged officials from the six sports bodies to use the
results of the tests to review their training programs in order to
increase their athletes performances in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking for a scapegoat. We will consult with our
experts tomorrow (Friday) about how to boost athletes performances
to enable them to win medals at the Games. We are responsible for
making sure they win medals," he said after chairing a meeting
with the six sports organizations here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The six sports bodies which conducted the test, supervised by
KONI's sports science commission, are basketball, tenpin bowling,
boxing, diving, golf and karate.
</P>
<P>
Imron ZS, head of KONI's training center and the training
director for the SEA Games, said two of the basketball players
showed excellent fitness, two others were considered poor and the
rest of the players had fair results. All of the female tenpin
bowlers received bad marks in the tests.
</P>
<P>
He also said all the boxers scored high in the test. The male
divers did very well while the female divers scored good results.
The male golfers earned good marks in the test while the female
golfers had fair results.
</P>
<P>
Imron added female karatekas got bad marks while male karatekas
had good results.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the poor results on the training programs.
</P>
<P>
"Sports organizations must train their athletes before and
after they compete in tournaments. The test results indicate we
always start from zero when we face multievent tournaments like
the SEA Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto called on sports bodies to be more serious in training
their athletes, saying the bodies should put their athletes on a
continual training program to keep prepared for tournaments.
</P>
<P>
KONI would conduct another test in six weeks to re-evaluate the
athletes condition, he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as
saying.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hawk Fighters Ordered From Britain Arrive in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Hawk 200 jet fighters
Indonesia has bought from Britain arrived on Thursday at Supadio
airport in Pontianak, capital of West Kalimantan province, Antara
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the hand-over ceremony, Deputy Chief of Staff of the
Indonesian Air Force Air Vice Marshal I.G. Sudana said possession
of the Hawk 200s would strengthen the Indonesian Air Force's
capability to protect the country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The two jet fighters that had just arrived constituted the
first batch of 16 Hawk 200s ordered by the Indonesian Air force.
The entire lot of 16 jet fighters is scheduled to arrive in
Indonesia in batches of two at two-month intervals.
</P>
<P>
To operate the Hawk 200s, the Indonesian Air Force had trained
12 pilots, Sudana was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Supadio airport would be the base of the British-made fighter
planes as it is strategically located to secure the western part
of the country. The length of the airport's landing strip has been
extended to 2,250 meters from 1,850 meters, and a special taxiway
and apron has been constructed as well.
</P>
<P>
The airport's supporting facilities now also include office and
housing complexes, a safety equipment test stand, a computer aid
learning system and fixed based trainers.
</P>
<P>
Together with scores of Hawk M-209s, the Hawk 200s would make
up the Air Force's First Squadron and boost the Air Force's
capability to protect the country from possible foreign
intrusions, Sudana added.
</P>
<P>
The Hawk 200 is a single-seat, light weight, multi-role combat
variant of the Hawk. The airframe and systems bear a high degree
of commonality with the Hawk 100 Series.
</P>
<P>
It is equipped with Westinghouse APG-66H multi-mode radar
giving it comprehensive air defense and ground attack
capabilities.

<P>
The first ASEAN summit was held in the Island of Bali,
Indonesia, from February 23 to 25, 1976. At the summit, two
important documents -- the Declaration of ASEAN Concord and the
Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia -- were signed
to accelerate and intensify ASEAN cooperation in all fields. It
also made a decision to establish the ASEAN Secretariat and locate
it in Jakarta to cater to ASEAN's organizational requirements,
specifically in the monitoring of projects and activities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The second summit took place in Kuala Lumpur from August 4 to
5, 1977, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ASEAN and to
assess the progress in the implementation of the decisions taken
at the Bali summit. The Kuala Lumpur summit approved the
restructuring of the ASEAN machinery and set out policy directions
for ASEAN's external relations.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, as a complementary undertaking, the ASEAN
heads of state held a dialogue with the prime ministers of
Australia, Japan and New Zealand on bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in trade, investments and finance. The occasion
ushered in the start of an annual meeting between ASEAN and its
partners in the industrialized world that included the United
States, Canada and the European Community.
</P>
<P>
The third summit meeting, the first in 10 years, was focused on
discussing new directions and solutions to closer intra-ASEAN
economic cooperation. It also took up political issues concerning
peace and security in Southeast Asia. They included the Vietnamese
troops' continued occupation of Cambodia, and the establishment of
a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN) and a
nuclear-free zone in the region.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, 1987, the third ASEAN summit approved "the
Manila Declaration of 1987" and major economic agreements. They
are the revised basic agreement on ASEAN industrial joint ventures
(AIJV); the agreement on the promotion and protection of
intra-ASEAN preferential trading arrangement (PTA); and the
agreement on the standstill and rollback of non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
On February 18, 1992, the Singapore Resolution was signed by
the ministers who attended the fifth ministerial meeting on
environment of the ASEAN region. The Singapore Resolution set out
the directions for ASEAN to enhance its ongoing and future
regional cooperation and the ASEAN common stand on global
environmental and developmental issues.
</P>
<P>
At ASEAN's fourth summit meeting in Singapore in January 1992,
an agreement was signed on the establishment of the ASEAN free
trade area (AFTA) which will be in place by 2008.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, 1995, the two-day fifth ASEAN summit ended in
Bangkok after adopting a number of important documents that would
guide the seven ASEAN members and their three close neighbors into
the 21st century. The ASEAN leaders agreed that the grouping would
accelerate the pace towards the actualization of the ASEAN free
trade area (AFTA).

On December 16, 1998, the two-day sixth summit ended in Hanoi
of Vietnam, and ASEAN leaders agreed in principle to admit
Cambodia as its 10th member and adopted a number of measures to
revive the region's economy and address the economic problems that
have been plaguing their countries since the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting approved the Hanoi Declaration, the Hanoi Plan of
Action and "bold measures." In the Hanoi Declaration, the ASEAN
leaders admitted that the economic and financial upheaval
afflicting the region's economies "has severely set back many of
the gains that our nations and our association have achieved."
</P>
<P>
The leaders approved the "bold measures" to improve the
investment climate in member countries in order "to regain
business confidence, enhance economic recovery and promote
growth." In the Hanoi Plan of Action, a plan for implementing the
ASEAN Vision 2020 up to the year 2004, the leaders pledged to
restore confidence, regenerate economic growth and promote
regional financial stability through maintaining sound
macroeconomic and financial policies and strengthening the
financial system and capital markets so as to avoid disturbances
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About ASEAN (5) - Existing trade Arrangement Among ASEAN Member States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Basic Agreement on the Establishment of ASEAN Preferential
Trading Arrangements was concluded in 1977, but by mid-1987 the
system covered only about 5 percent of trade between member
states, since individual countries were permitted to exclude any
'sensitive' products from preferential import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In December 1987 the meeting of ASEAN heads of government
resolved to reduce such exclusions to a maximum of 10 percent of
the number of items traded and to a maximum of 50 percent of the
value of trade, over the next five years (seven years for
Indonesia and the Philippines).
</P>
<P>
In January 1992 the heads of government, meeting in Singapore,
signed an agreement to create an "ASEAN Free Trade Area" (AFTA),
by 2008. In accordance with the agreement, a common effective
preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme came into effect in January
1993.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993 ASEAN trade ministers agreed to modify the
CEPT, with only Malaysia and Singapore having adhered to the
original tariff reduction schedule.
</P>
<P>
The new AFTA program, under which all member countries except
Brunei were scheduled to begin tariff reductions from 1 January
1994, substantially enlarged the number of products to be included
in the tariff reduction process and reduced the list of products
eligible for protection.
</P>
<P>
In September 1994 ASEAN ministers of economic affairs agreed to
accelerate the implementation of AFTA: tariffs were to be reduced
to 0-5 percent within seven to 10 years, or within five to eight
years for products designated for accelerated tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, ministers failed
to adopt a unified approach to a proposal to create an APEC
Free-trade zone by 2020 that was to be discussed at a meeting of
APEC ministers of foreign affairs in Jakarta, Indonesia, in
November.
</P>
<P>
In July 1995 Vietnam was admitted as a member of ASEAN and was
granted until the year 2006 to implement the AFTA trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, ASEAN economics ministers, meeting in
Brunei, advocated a further acceleration of the tariff reduction
deadline, to 2000.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995 the heads of government, meeting in Bangkok,
agreed to maintain the objective of achieving AFTA by 2003, while
pursuing efforts to eliminate or reduce tariffs to less than 5
percent on the majority of products by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997 Laos and Myanmar became members of ASEAN and were
granted a 10-year period, from January 1998, to comply with the
AFTA schedule.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998 ASEAN's Working Group on Customs Procedures
completed a draft legal framework for regional cooperation in
order to simplify and harmonize customs procedures, legislation
and product classification. The customs agreement was to
complement AFTA in facilitating intra-ASEAN trade. It was signed
in March 1997 at the inaugural meeting of ASEAN finance ministers.

<P>
HANOI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is to be formally admitted
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on April
30, when Vietnam will host a special admission ceremony in Hanoi
for Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's road map to join ASEAN started in 1993. Before that
time, Cambodia missed various opportunities to join ASEAN due to
its political turmoil and a protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
October 1994: Cambodia submitted a formal application for
observer status in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
January 1995: Cambodia acceded to the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation in Southeast Asia. The accession of Cambodia to the
treaty was the first important step for Cambodia to become an
observer in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
July 1995: On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, then
foreign minister Ung Huot officially signed the Treaty of Amity
and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. Accordingly, Cambodia was given
observer status in ASEAN at the 28th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in
July 1995 in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
April 1996: Then foreign minister Ung Huot officially submitted
the formal application in person to become a member of ASEAN to
the Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
July 23, 1997: Laos and Myanmar were officially admitted into
ASEAN. Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN along with the
two countries, but its admission was put on hold after the
factional fighting in July in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
December 1998: The sixth ASEAN summit in Hanoi agreed in
principle to admit Cambodia as its 10th member since it had a new
coalition government, but without setting the specific date for
the official admission. Some maintained that the conditions set
for Cambodia's accession had not been fully met yet, including the
amendment of the Cambodian Constitution and formation of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
March 5, 1999: The day after the National Assembly passed an
amendment to create a Senate, Foreign Minister Hor Namhong met
with ASEAN ambassadors to ask them to speed Cambodia's entry into
ASEAN.

HAIKOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Hainan Province and
Taiwan totaled 10 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of
this year, up 75.9 percent from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
During that period, Hainan bought 7.4 million dollars worth of
goods from Taiwan and sold 2.67 million dollars worth of goods to
Taiwan, up 141 percent and 0.7 percent respectively over the same
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now has more than 1,000 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with
actual use of Taiwan funds amounting to one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Hainan are located in the subtropical zone.
Similar conditions for agricultural development are the main
reason for Taiwan businessmen to invest in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
So far, Taiwan businessmen have spent nearly 200 million

<HEADLINE> Chinese Botanists Discover 500 Edible Wild Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Without carrying any food,
botanist Li Yanhui and a group of field soldiers lived for months
in the tropical jungle in southwestern China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
"A handful of salt is all each of us had, and we survived on
the knowledge of edible wild plants that I acquired from local
residents," recalled 69-year old Li, who has worked in tropical
Xishuangbanna for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of more than 500 species of edible wild
plants, including over 200 varieties of flowers, according to the
latest botanical research. Some of them have been put on show at
the China '99 Kunming International Horticultural Exposition. They
include ornamental rhododendron, Yunnan ottelia, white-flower
bauhinia, and Yunnan bushbeech.
</P>
<P>
Although botanists hold that it is impossible to make edible
wild plants food substitutes in the near future, they say that
such plants can well serve to improve the food structure for their
deliciousness and wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
"Many wild plants are rare delicacies," Li Yanhui said. "
Coiledflower nightshade, for example, is very palatable if fried
with egg. Moreover, the plant has the function of removing
internal heat."
</P>
<P>
Such plants are also ideal remedies for some diseases common
among urban residents who usually have fatty and high calorie diet.
Hairyleaf monkshood, a common food for residents in central Yunnan,
has once helped Li's wife relieve pain and regain strength.
</P>
<P>
Once staple food for the mankind, wild plants have been
gradually replaced by vegetables bred in gardens and grain grown
in fields, and only people living in remote regions still keep to
the traditional eating habit.
</P>
<P>
The Dai people in southern Yunnan is an example in point. About
four-fifths of the vegetables in their menu grow in the wild. They
also use wild plants for treating a number of diseases. Dai women
can identify and collect at least 100 species of such edible
plants.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan bushbeech, which is exhibited at the site of the
Expo '99 Kunming, is one of the traditional foods for the Dai
people. They mix rice flour with the beautiful and fragrant flower
and make them into cakes, which can be preserved for about a week
in very hot days.
</P>
<P>
Actually a total of 120 edible wild plants have been discovered
in Xishuangbanna, a major habitat of the Dai people. They include
22 serving as supplementary food, 34 as fruit, 56 as vegetables
and the others as edible oil, beverage, or condiments.
</P>
<P>
Not only a favorable food choice for the mankind, edible wild
plants can serve as a protospecies for scientists to breed new
plant varieties to enrich the current food structure.
</P>
<P>
"Artificially-developed species of grain and vegetables will of
necessity degenerate after being popularized, and scientists have
to rely on protospecies available only in the wild to breed new
varieties," explained Li.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Silver Symbol Plate Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have found
a rare gold-plated silver symbol plate dating back to the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368) in Qingshuihe County near this capital of
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
An archaeologist says that the Yuan Dynasty has a complete
system of using symbol plates, but there are only eleven of such
plates unearthed in the world. One of them is a decree plate of
Genghis Khan, a famous emperor of the dynasty, excavated in 1934.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered plate is 30 cm long, eight cm wide and 0.1
cm thick with a small string-hole at the top. The two sides of the
plate are carved with Chinese characters and Mongolian characters
which read: "The name of the emperor is holy and those not obeying
him shall be sentenced to death."
</P>
<P>
The three plates of the dynasty ever found in China are round-
shaped, the expert said, adding that this is the first square
plate unearthed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The plate will provide valuable clues for archaeological
research into the dynasty's system of symbol plates, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Start Research on Genetic Structure of Ancient Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish a state lab
to launch large-scale molecular genetics studies of ancient human
groups and other organisms.
</P>
<P>
The lab will enable China to start its independent research of
molecular structures of the ancient man. The lab is affiliated
with the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) -- China's highest scientific research body.
</P>
<P>
Wang Li, researcher and head of the lab says a large-scale
molecular genetic research is already underway on ancient human
groups in Anyang of central China's Henan Province where Yin Ruins
(1000 B.C. or earlier) were discovered, in cooperation with
Japan's Tokyo University and Institute of Archaeology of Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said, the four-year research program, launched this year, is
to learn the formation of Mongolian race, its inter-marriages with
other races and habitations in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The researcher explains that their future study on molecular
genetics of the ancient man aims at finding clues to the evolution
of ancient man's genetic structure, migration of human groups and
their divisions.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the research is of great importance as it will
shed lights on the evolution of the mankind and its future
development.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the lab hope to be able to determine whether the
"Peking Man" is the forefathers of the Chinese nation when they
collect enough materials and evidence.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Join EU's Oil Embargo Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania will enforce the
decision of the European Commission to impose an oil embargo
against Yugoslavia and stop providing oil and petrochemical
products to its neighbor, a government spokesman said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government, which made the decision at a regular
meeting on Thursday, is expected to introduce specific rules for
the embargo and begin enforcing them next week in the hope of
keeping pace with the European Union (EU), said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the official added that the oil and petrochemical
products relating to humanitarian aid will not be included in the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The EU on Friday decided to impose a wide-ranging ban on oil
sales to Yugoslavia in a "strong signal" meant to further isolate
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision met strong objection from the
opposition parties, some of which even insisted on increasing oil
exports to Yugoslavia to lessen Romania's economic losses brought
about by the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, NATO's month-long
bombardment of Yugoslavia has cost Romania 750 million U.S.
dollars.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Appropriations
Committee on Thursday approved a 12.9 billion U.S. dollar spending
package for the Kosovo crisis and military construction.
</P>
<P>
The panel approved the spending by a voice vote, with
supporters saying it offered a sorely needed boost to a military
sapped by the air strikes in Yugoslavia and extended deployments
around the world.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton requested six billion dollars to pay for
the U.S. share of NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, which
started March 24.
</P>
<P>
The approved package, which goes to the full House next week,
includes money to replenish military equipment and spare parts,
about one billion dollars for military construction, and 1.8
billion dollars for a military pay raise.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen
announced that he had ordered the deployment of 10 B-52 bombers to
join the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to intensify this air campaign. And I signed a
deployment order for some 10 B-52s that will be leaving shortly to
join the forces in Europe in order to intensify that air campaign,
" Cohen told a news conference at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"We will start to attack ... for more hours, more targets and
from more directions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen did not give any details, but other defense officials
speaking privately had said earlier that the B-52s would drop
unguided iron bombs on Serb troop concentrations.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cloning May Cause Long-Term Health Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The cloning technique that
produced Dolly the sheep, the first animal cloned from an adult
cell, may result in serious long-term damage to health in the
clones, French scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Renard and colleagues from Institute National de la
Recherche Agronomique, France, said that a cow cloned with DNA
from an adult cell may have died because of errors in its DNA's
genetic reprogramming.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been many reports of clones dying during
pregnancy or shortly after birth, this is the first study
indicating that cloning may have long-term harmful effects on the
clone.
</P>
<P>
In their research, published in The Lancet medical journal, the
scientists took an ear cell from a healthy adult cow and used it
to create a new clone. The adult cow was itself a clone, but was
made using an embryonic cell.
</P>
<P>
Six weeks after the calf was born, there was a sudden, dramatic
fall in its red blood cell count and it died a week later.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the calf had also lost many
lymphocytes, a white blood cell important for the immune system.
</P>
<P>
A post-mortem showed that the lymphoid tissues, spleen, thymus
and lymph nodes, had not developed normally.
</P>
<P>
Making a clone with DNA taken from an adult cell requires that
the cell's genes to be reprogrammed, or reset, back to the
embryonic state.
</P>
<P>
The new study by French scientists suggested that some part of
this cloning process might have interfered with the clone's
genetic reprogramming and prevented the normal development of the
lymphoid system.

It sets a salary scale for draft picks of $50,000 for the first
four players chosen, $44,000 for the fifth through eighth players
and $37,500 for the rest of the players selected in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
Second-round picks get $30,000, third-rounds $27,000 and fourth-
rounders the rookie minimum of $25,000. The deal includes increase

Players will receive a guaranteed percentage of all royalties
from the sale of player-identified licensed products, with a

</P>
<P>
The league and union agreed to a contract earlier this month,
but the deal failed a week ago when both sides insisted the other
attempted to change the terms at the last minute. That caused the
league to postpone the draft, which had been scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talks Monday and Tuesday resolved most of the outstanding
issues, with the final deal reached in a four-hour meeting
Thursday. The parties also agreed players would be allowed to
participate in up to two not-for-profit, charitable events.

<HEADLINE> Nets Forward Van Horn Undergoes Thumb Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Star forward Keith Van Horn of
the New Jersey Nets underwent successful surgery on his broken
left thumb today.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn will wear a cast for 4-6 weeks before rehabilitating.
The second-year forward was sixth in the league in scoring before
falling awkwardly on his hand in Saturday's 120-98 victory over
the Indiana Pacers. He was placed on the injury list Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn's injury added to New Jersey's long list of
disappointments this season. The Nets had to petition the league
to put Van Horn on the injured list since Jayson Williams, Jim
McIlvaine and Eric Murdock already were disabled.
</P>
<P>
An All-Rookie selection a year ago, Van Horn averaged a team-
high 21.8 points per game while recording 12 double-doubles and
scoring at least 30 points three times. He also chipped in 8.5
rebounds per contest and was 11th in the NBA in free-throw
shooting at 86 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nets lost Williams, who made the All-Star team last season,
to a season-ending broken leg in late January. Their tumultous
season also included the acquisition of guard Stephon Marbury in a
multi-player, three-team deal and the firing of coach John
Calipari.
</P>
<P>
They have the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference at
14-32, ahead of only the Chicago Bulls.

that China is building a ferry passage project linking the port
cities of Dalian and Yantai in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 170-kilometer ferry passage costs 3.5
billion yuan (290 million U.S. dollars) with a designed annual
transportation capacity of 11 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This is a key part of a major railway network that is in
construction starting from Harbin, capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, and ending in Changxing in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The railway network will wind its way through China's economic
hubs including Shanghai and Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the project will shorten the distance from
northeast to south China by 400 to 1,000 kilometers and is
expected to cut transportation costs by 6 billion yuan annually,
today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Sources also told the paper that the government is considering
to use the Yantai ferry port as a link to the Republic of Korea
and Japan's railway network and enable their trains to reach
Europe via the new Euro-Asia Continent railway crossing China.

<P>
SHANTOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tariffs collected by the customs
in Shantou, Guangdong Province, reached record 1.7 billion yuan
last year, up 44 percent from 1997, thanks to intensive anti-
smuggling efforts.
</P>
<P>
An anti-smuggling team set up by the customs following a
national anti-smuggling conference in last June has effectively
cracked down on smugglers at sea.
</P>
<P>
In the later half of 1998, the customs solved 64 cases of
smuggling, with goods confiscated valued at 125 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The customs cracked 105 smuggling cases and turned over 39
cases to public security departments last year.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smuggling campaign has led to the sales recovery of
electrical appliances in Shantou and helped to improve the import
and export order of the city and to protect the national
industries.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Forward Pippen Has Hearing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Seven-time All-Star forward
Scottie Pippen of the Houston Rockets had today's scheduled
hearing on a drunk driving charge delayed to a later date.
</P>
<P>
Pippen made a brief appearnce in court this morning with his
attorney, Rusty Hardin, who filed papers to postpone the hearing.
The request was granted, although no new date was set immediately.
</P>
<P>
Pippen was arrested last Thursday morning and charged with DWI.
</P>
<P>
According to a Houston police spokesman, Pippen failed a field
sobriety test and refused to take a breathalyzer after he was
pulled over running a red light at about 1:30 a.m., hours after
the Rockets were beaten at home by the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
"He passed a few cars and ran a red light into the oncoming
lane when police pulled him over," said police spokesperson John
Leggio. "The officers noted the alchol odor on his breath and he
shoed signs of intoxication. He failed a field sobriety test and
refused to take a breath test."
</P>
<P>
Pippen was booked on a DWI charge and later released on bail.
</P>
<P>
"I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game and I'm
confident the evidence will support me in the end," Pippen said
last week.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, 33, had just four points, three rebounds and three
assists in the Rocket's 109-95 loss to Dallas. He hit just 2-of-8
shots, and missed all four of his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, one of the NBA's premier all-around players, is in his
first year with the Rockets after teaming with Michael Jordan to
win six championships in eight years with the Chicago Bulls. But
despite starting on a front line with stars Hakeen Olajuwon and
Charles Barkley in Houston, Pippen has struggled at times to
adjust to his new role.
</P>
<P>
Houston (28-17) is currently the fourth seed in the Western
Conference, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-Year-Old Woodcuts Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A number of woodcuts dating back 1,
000 years have been excavated in an ancient tomb in the eastern
part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Shao Guotian, curator of Aohan Banner (County) Museum, said the
woodcuts were obtained from two fragmentary coffins and a well-
preserved wooden door inside a tomb which is situated near
Nuluerhu Mountain near northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, the woodcuts belonged to the Liao Dynasty (
916-1125 A.D.) that was founded by a minority ethnic group of
Qidan living in north China.
</P>
<P>
One woodcut, which is considered by specialists as rare and
precious, vividly describes a scene of an ancient Liao army
marching for a battle: a mounted commander, a hawk hovering in the
sky, the flying army flag, and five members of a military band
beating drums and ringing the bells.
</P>
<P>
Shao added that the woodcuts, which are now all kept in his
museum, are of great value for studying history of the Liao
Dynasty and the history of minority ethnic groups living in north
China in ancient times.

<P>
KUNMING April 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign participants in the 99'
Kunming Horticultural Exposition were exulted to see the
meticulous and superb preparations done.
</P>
<P>
"You Chinese have done a wonderful job," said Dr. Abul Quasem,
general manager of Hortest Foundation under the Ministry of
Agriculture of Bangladesh. "The Exposition will be an eye-catching
event. It shows China's ability to organize big international
exposition."
</P>
<P>
He said that the garden provides Bangladesh participants with
enough space to display various vegetables and products. "We are
very happy to be here. The event will help strengthen friendship
between China and Bangladesh. Similar expositions should be held
in more developing countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Expo, the first sponsored by a developing country, has
attracted 95 countries and organizations. China has so far spent 1.
5 million yuan building the Exposition site, the largest in the
Expo's history.
</P>
<P>
The grand opening ceremony will be held today with theatrical
performances and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
"It is incredible that China has invested so much in building
the gardens," said Kokou Agbessi Zomblewou of Togo embassy in
China.
</P>
<P>
Cristina G. Ortega, minister and consul general of the embassy
of the Philippines, said that China has done full preparations
for Expo'99. The quality of exhibits, the overall design, the
overall effects and safety have all impressed her very much. "It
is a great success," she said.
</P>
<P>
Calisto Karimanzira, market adviser from Zimbabwe's Zim Trade
Company, said that the event will show a real China to the world.

large exhibition. The Chinese garden is special. I have not seen
such a garden before. Everything is very large." Simmerman has
visited China for more than 20 times and are quite obsessed with
gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Alain Torrelli, a French horticultural engineer, said that he
was not very confident of the Expo when he first arrived in
Kunming in 1997 to design the French Garden. "now it is no doubt
that it will be a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a miracle that China has built such a world-
level garden comparable to that of the West in just two years.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the right time to comment too much," said Georges W.
liby, a member of the jury of the Expo. "But frankly speaking, the
Chinese garden is better than a lot of other gardens in the world.
"
</P>
<P>
Nancy Peres, general director of the Tropiflora of Cuba,
expressed the hope that Chinese horticultural workers would one
day build a garden in her country."
</P>

BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Tommy Haas of Germany and Wayne
Ferreira of South African became the last victims of seeds when
they failed to make the quarterfinals of the 525,000 US dollars
BMW Open in Munich on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the tournament has seen all its seeded players wiped
out before the stage of the quarter finals.
</P>
<P>
After Boris Becker being ousted in the first round, the German
fans hope Haas to attain more feats but only to see him to bounce
out 6-2, 6-7 (1/7), 6-1 against Franco Squillari in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
The 20th-ranked German managed to convert only one of 14 break

</P>
<P>
"I haven't got my timing yet, but my main goal is the French
Open," said the 20-year-old Haas.
</P>

Also bowing out the Open was 1995 holder fifth-seeded Ferreira
of South Africa who was eliminated by German wild card entry
Michael Kohlmann, 136th in the world, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-5.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday
voted to limit President Bill Clinton's ability to widen the
Kosovo war, saying the president should get congressional approval
before injecting "ground elements" into the ever-expanding
conflict with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The 249 to 180 vote showed a great contrast to Clinton's appeal
for a "single voice" in Congress on the Kosovo crisis as he said
NATO had done. Majority-party Republicans said Congress was merely
exercising its constitutional responsibility and forcing Clinton
to keep his word on not sending ground troops to Kosovo. (US-

WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration on Wednesday announced
a major revision in U.S. sanctions policy that will permit sales
of food and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The new policy calls for an exemption of such items from future
sanctions, but will not affect sanctions against Iraq, Cuba and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Undersecretary
of State Stuart Eizenstat told reporters that the announcement was
the result of a two-year review of overall U.S. sanctions policy
which concluded that allowing food and medicine sales to above-
mentioned countries "doesn't enhance a nation's military
capability or ability to support terrorism." (US-Sanctions-

deployment order for some 10 B-52s that will be leaving shortly to
join the forces in Europe in order to intensify that air campaign,

attack during -- from more hours, more targets and from more
directions," he added. (US-Yugoslavia-Bombers)

<HEADLINE> Marseille, Bologna Fined over UEFA Match Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bologna and Marseille were fined
180,000 US dollars on Thursday for their brawl after the UEFA Cup
semifinal second leg match last week.
</P>
<P>
UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella said a fine of 150,000 Swiss
francs (99,000 dollars) would be imposed on Bologna and three
players would be suspended, while Marseille would be fined 125,000
Swiss francs (82,500 dollars) and two players would be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Gonnella said Marseille coach Rolland Courbis faced a fine of 5,
000 Swiss francs (3,300) and his son Stephane, a member of the
French club's backroom staff, would be suspended from official
functions at UEFA club matches for a year.
</P>
<P>
Marseille's Christophe Dugarry and Hamada Jambay would be
banned for five and four matches respectively, and Bologna's
Amadeo Mangone would be banned for five games, Giancarlo Marocchi
would be suspended for four and Giampiero Maini for three matches,
Gonnella said.
</P>
<P>
The match in Bologna on April 20 ended 1-1, sending Marseille
through to the final thanks to their away goal. The first leg in
France had finished 0-0.
</P>
<P>
As the players headed for the dressing room, Bologna fans threw
firecrackers and oranges on to the pitch and Bologna player,
identified as Mangone, threw a punch which started the fracas
involving about six or seven players.
</P>
<P>
According to Bologna officials, Stephane Courbis punched Maini
and left him with a badly swollen eye.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA spokesman said both clubs had the right to appeal
against the punishments by May 2.

<HEADLINE> Global Plants Gathering in China for Horti-Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the '99
International Horticultural Exposition scheduled to open Saturday,
organizers in Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, announced that they have successfully moved plants from
all over the world, many of which are rare and precious species,
into the exposition venue in the northeastern suburbs of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
"At the time when we just chose the site for the horticultural
show, there were only some 10,000 trees and shrubs of about 130
species in the area," said an official with the exposition's
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 400,000 trees and shrubs of more than 2,
000 species planted in the site, which covers 218 hectares about
four kilometers from the city proper.
</P>
<P>
Many of these trees and shrubs were transplanted from other
parts of Yunnan, reputed as China's "kingdom of plants" boasting
some 60 percent of China's 30,000-strong species of plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, among the three and plants moved to
the venue, nine tree species are under China's first-class state
protection, including the 140-million-year-old manglietiastrum
sinicum and the "food of dinosaurs" Cyatheaceae spp., 22 species
under second-class state protection and 76 other rare and precious
species.
</P>
<P>
Gardeners at the exposition venue have also set the country's
new horticultural records by successfully transplanting a 300-year-
old incense cedar and a 150-year-old cactus, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Also moved into the venue are famous trees and flowers from the
rest of the world, such as redwood from North America, the tallest
tree known in the world and the precious Brazilian ornamental
plant Acutifoliate Jacaranda.
</P>
<P>
"You can also see here plants with distinct characteristics of
Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that apart from planting the trees and shrubs,
workers at the venue have also laid more than 500,000 sq m of
turfs and cultivated countless flowers.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to display more than three million pots of fresh
flowers from all over the world during the six-month run of the
horticultural show," said the official. "They will be taken out
and put in the venue according to changes of season and weather
conditions so as to ensure the expo venue always looks like a sea
of flowers."

<HEADLINE> Italy Sees Reason for Hope in Resolving Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said Thursday that he saw reason to hope for a resolution
to the Kosovo conflict after his meeting with visiting Russian
Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema told the press Thursday evening, "The situation is in

D'Alema voiced his appreciation for Russia's diplomatic

Annan showed that a solution must be sought out and can be found.

"NATO must stop the bombing and refugees must return to their
homes, and we must be sure their return and their lives will be

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Dismisses Equality Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Organisers of the Wimbledon
Championships have dismissed calls to reward women winners with
the same amount of prize money as men.
</P>
<P>
The All England Club has increased the total prize fund at this
year's championships to more than 7.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles champion will receive 455,000, an increase of
20,000 from last year, but the ladies champion will take home 409,
500, a sum that has risen by 18,000 on 1998.
</P>
<P>
John Curry, chairman of the All England Club, said the ladies
doubles prize had been increased to reflect the renewed strength
of the competition entry.
</P>
<P>
But he accepted that such a move is unlikely to satisfy the
growing clamour for equal prize money in the men's and women's
game.
</P>
<P>
"We've had representations from the Women's Tennis Association
and there is supposed to be a petition signed by 90 players which
we've heard about, but haven't seen, in which they say they
deserve and demand equal prize money at the Grand Slams," said
Curry.
</P>
<P>
"We do surveys on a regular basis and 70% of people say they
want to watch men's singles. It's not commercially reasonable to
be demanding equal prize money.
</P>
<P>
"They have every right to request increases but to demand them
and suggest we're being unreasonable is hurtful to the
championships.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the players themselves are that concerned. Prize
money is a small proportion of their total income. I can't believe
they're not reasonable people.
</P>
<P>
"Jana Novotna earned more than Pete Sampras last year and the
top 10 women earned more than the top 10 men," he said.
</P>
<P>
In all the total prize fund for British tennis' centrepiece,
which runs from June 21 to July 4, has been increased by 5.4% from
7.208m to 7.595m.
</P>
<P>
Winners of the men's doubles will win 186,420 pounds between
them and their women's counterparts will take 167,770 pounds.

<HEADLINE> English Soccer "Fat Cats" in Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The wages of English Premiership
football players rocketed by 40 percent last season, according to
a study by accountants Deloitte &AMP; Touche on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study claims that with top players picking up around 30,000
pounds a week, wage bills are threatening to cripple clubs.
</P>
<P>
The total wage bill for the Premiership in the 1997-98 season
was three-and-a-half times higher than in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Bosman ruling, which ended the
requirement for clubs to pay transfer fees for certain players out
of contract, longer-term contracts and players' increasing use of
agents, were behind the huge jump.
</P>
<P>
The report said: "These sorts of salaries make even the 'fat
cats' of the City look decidedly slim."
</P>
<P>
The figures did not include lucrative boot deals, sponsorship
and other endorsements.
</P>
<P>
The best-paying club was Chelsea, with a wage and salary bill
for last season of nearly 27 million pounds, followed by
Manchester United's 26.9 million, Liverpool's 24.1 million and
Newcastle United's 22.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's wage bill jumped by an enormous 81 percent over the
previous year, although this included the business travel payroll
for the club.
</P>
<P>
The poorest payers were those playing for Barnsley, Crystal
Palace, Southampton and Bolton Wanderers.
</P>
<P>
The massive rise in wages has been attacked by the Football
Supporters Association (FSA) as "short-sighted" and "unsustainable
".
</P>
<P>
FSA chairman Alison Pilling said: "Club chairmen and directors
need to understand that when they sign a new star they can't just
shove the transfer fee and wages on to the ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
"That is short-sighted and not a way to build a successful and
sustainable football club. Clubs need to concentrate more on youth
policy.
</P>
<P>
"As ticket prices go up to pay for these players, an increasing
number of future customers, spectators, are being priced out of
the market."
</P>
<P>
PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor has hit back at claims of
greed among players, however, saying: "The fact is that these
wages are paid by the clubs in the demand for success and the game
has never enjoyed as much income from gate receipts, television
and sponsorship in particular.
</P>
<P>
"If the game is hoping to try and attract the best players from
all over the world, it is inevitable that they must offer the best
wages.
</P>
<P>
"In the top flight, the game is about players and players'
wages are, for the most part, covered by gate receipts alone.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to clubs to balance budgets and it is only fair that
players should share in the income the game is getting now from
many sources and, for the first time in a long time, top
professionals are getting more than other professions like racing,
motor racing and golf, " he added.

WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Second-seeded Jason
Stoltenberg defeated his Australian countryman Mark Woodforde in
straight sets 6-2, 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals of the ATP
clay court tournament in Georgia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Sabastien Grosjean of France and eighth-seeded
Magnus Larsson of Sweden also advanced to the quarterfinals, with
Grosjean beating Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay 6-4, 6-2 and Larsson
outwitting Galo Blanco of Spain 7-6 (8-6), 2-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, a finalist in the 1997 and 1998 tournaments,
committed few errors in his consistent play as the two Australians
struggled to hold serve throughout the match, with Stoltenberg
breaking five times and Woodforde two.
</P>
<P>
Grosjean, a Frenchman who cares little for clay courts, played
aggressively to defeat clay specialist Filippini, the 1997
Challenge champion.
</P>
<P>
After winning the Cherbourg challenger in February, Grosjean
had reached the semifinals at Copenhagen and the final in Key
Biscayne, and was eager to continue his high level of play.
</P>
<P>
"I used to be happy to win just one or two matches, but in the
last few months, I have tried to drop that attitude. I want to win
more matches now. I look more toward winning tournaments," said
Grosjean who ranked a career-high 40th.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Troops Recapture Masiaka in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG recaptured Masiaka Thursday and will open the highway which
runs from capital Freetown to all the regional capitals, a report
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Olukolade, spokesman of the ECOMOG
supporting President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, said ECOMOG troops had
used planes and tanks during the attacks to recapture the town.
</P>
<P>
He said the battle for Masiaka was fierce but the ECOMOG troops
overran their positions and have taken firm control of the town.
</P>
<P>
Masiaka is on the main road from the capital Freetown to the
interior parts of the west African country and the rebels holding
the town had blocked road traffic to the interior from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that "with Masiaka now in our hands, we
will open the highway which runs from Freetown to all the regional
capitals," adding supplies of food and fuel to the interior could
resume.
</P>
<P>
"Masiaka was one of the rebels' biggest bases in the country.
Its recapture will put more pressure on them to talk peace
sincerely," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Kabbah government is implementing a dual track approach,
according to Septimus Kaikai, spokesman of the Sierra Leonean
government. He said Wednesday that the government would continue
dialog with the rebels but at the same time would continue to
fight to clear them from strategic positions in the country.

<HEADLINE> Single Gene Controls Embryonic Limb Formation: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have found that a
single gene can transform embryonic tissue destined to form a wing
into a leg.
</P>
<P>
The gene, called Tbx4, was found to contain "all the
information needed to make a leg" in chickens, said researchers
from the Salk Institute, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published Thursday in the British science journal
Nature, found that the gene also appears to be involved in limb
formation in mammals as well, including humans.
</P>
<P>
In their experiments, the researchers infected tissue in the
wing area of chickens embryos with a virus carrying the gene Tbx4.
</P>
<P>
The study began when the embryos were one day old before limb
identity is set. Then, a day later, the scientists transferred the
nascent limbs to the gut areas of younger embryos and eventually
found the majority of the transferred limbs grew into legs.
</P>
<P>
In control studies, transferred wing tissue that did not
receive any Tbx4 genes always developed into wings, the scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we know Tbx4 contains the `leg blueprint,' we need to
learn more about which genes it turns on and off and how the Tbx4
gene itself gets switched on," said Belmonte, one of the authors.
</P>
<P>
The researchers hope their findings may help to study the
problems like limb malformations, which are among the most common
human birth defects.
