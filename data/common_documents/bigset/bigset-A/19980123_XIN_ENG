<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said
Thursday that the Russian capital has applied to the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) for the right to host the summer Olympic
games.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow could win the right to host the 2012 Olympics, when a
European city would again be in line for the games," Luzhkov told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow has experience in organizing Olympics. The 1980 games
were perfectly planned, but international political complications
prevented many athletes from taking part in them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to hold full-scale Olympic games with a complete
number of participants," Luzhkov added.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov also voiced his desire that the International Youth
Games, to take place in Moscow next July, be held under the
patronage of the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unlikely to Get Targeted Annual Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is unlikely to
fulfill its targeted annual growth rate of 6 percent in the
1997-1998 fiscal year, the country's central bank said in a report
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A less than expected cotton crop and the continued sluggish
production in the large-scale manufacturing sector during the
first six months of the current fiscal year (July 1, 1997-June 30,
1998) are likely to contain annual economic growth rate to be
around 5 percent, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
The SBP also pointed out that there was a considerable
shortfall in revenue collection in the first six months of the
fiscal year both in relation to the historical trend and the
target for the year as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the finances of public sector corporations and of
some provinces remained weak in the first half of the year
contributing to the budget deficit, it said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said substantive measures are needed to
improve export performance so that narrowing of the trade deficit
continues in the context of recovery and growth of imports,
particularly of capital goods and raw material.
</P>
<P>
The bank also recommended the adoption of a careful strategy to
finance the current account deficit through long-term private
capital inflow rather than through short-term borrowing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the existing stock of short-term foreign exchange
liabilities has to be reduced through a well-designed program of
their conversion into medium- and long-term liabilities, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign exchange reserves need to be built up
keeping in view the volume and variability in trade as well as
large size and volatility of short-term foreign exchange
liabilities, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian airlines will make an
inaugural flight from Lusaka to London in April, Zambia News
Agency (ZANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Linton Bell, General Manager of Zambia Express, confirmed the
move today and told ZANA that his company has leased a Boeing 767
from Air Zimbabwe to be used for the Lusaka-London route.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plane will leave Lusaka in the morning for
London on April 2 and return to Lusaka the following day.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Dawson Lupunga, the Transport and Communication
Minister, announced at a State House press briefing that the
Zambian government has given Zambia Express the Lusaka-London
route after Aero Zambia, the privatized former state-owned
company, declined to take up the route because it wants to
consolidate its local routes.
</P>
<P>
At the same press briefing, Lupunga challenged local airlines
to apply for the Ndola-Londa route which is still vacant.
</P>
<P>
Ndola, Zambia's copper mining center in central Copperbelt
Province, has been allowed to have a direct flight to London and
it is the hope of the Zambian government that one local airlines
will apply for the route.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Great Hural of Mongolia
passed an anti-pornography and anti-soliciting law Thursday,
prohibiting prostitution and pornographic publications, the
Mongolian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Law on Combating Pornographic Activities" prescribes
severe punishments to individuals or groups involved in
pornographic activities.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution has become rampant in Mongolia in recent years.
The capital city alone is estimated to have more than 800
prostitutes, and police crackdown efforts have not born much fruit.
</P>
<P>
A Cameroonian man with AIDS was reported to have infected a
Mongolian prostitute with the fatal disease in Ulan Bator late in
1997, evoking panic in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government vows to take tough action against
pornographic crime in an effort to uphold social morality, as well
as guarding against a widespread incidence of AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government's Reforms Proposals Battered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The proposals raised by the Sri
Lankan government for constitutional reforms came under fire at a
seminar held here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
An organization called the Movement for Protection of the
Motherland sponsored the seminar, at which about 300 people,
including some senior Buddhist monks, Catholic priests, MPs of the
main opposition the United National Party (UNP), gathered to show
their opposition to the proposals from the ruling People's
Alliance (PA) government.
</P>
<P>
S. L. Gunasekera, a former MP, said one of the most dangerous
aspects is that once the proposals are adopted, the central
government will have no chance to reach consensus with the
regional councils, which under the proposals will be granted more
powers, on issues of national importance.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the proposals, which the PA initiated with
a view to realizing peace with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), have already been rejected by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the proposals could only be implemented after
peace is restored in this war-torn nation. However, there's no
need to have such a package if peace is already there, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Professor C. Madduma Bandara, former vice
chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, said he found it
difficult to believe that the proposals will create ethnic
harmony.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposals will create more problems, instead
of ethnic harmony, for the country, where an ethnic war of 14
years has claimed more than 55,000 lives and rendered many
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The new constitutional package proposes to change Sri Lanka
from the current unitary state to a union of regions and give more
autonomy to regional authorities.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has been trying to convince the country
that the package is the only possible way to lead the nation out
of the war, much has to be done for it to win enough support both
in the parliament and from the people.
</P>
<P>
The UNP so far has not submitted its alternative proposals to
the government. Without the UNP support, the package will not be
able to be adopted in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government has threatened to hold a referendum on the issue
in Eastern Province if the UNP cannot meet the January 31
deadline for submitting its proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP, which holds 94 seats in the 225-seat
parliament, is defiant enough to ask for six more months for it to
discuss the constitutional reforms package.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Slip in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. housing starts
slipped 0.8 percent in December, however ending a good year for
builders for 1997, the Commerce Department said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The December drop to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.52
million units followed three consecutive monthly growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of housing units started for all of 1997 reached
1.48 million, just 1,100, or 0.1 percent, short of the 1996 total,
an eight-year high.
</P>
<P>
The strong economic growth last year reduced the nation's
unemployment rate to a 24-year low and boosted a surging stock
market. Both developments as well as low mortgage helped new home
starts and house purchase.
</P>
<P>
But, in view of the wide-spread financial crisis in some Asian
nations and impact this country, some analysts believed that the
U.S. construction activity would slip somewhat this year, though
not too much. A survey by the National Association of Home
Builders showed confidence remained high among builders in early
January, about the same as a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
In December, single-family home construction fell 5.9 percent
while apartment building rose 15.4 percent. By region, starts
plummeted 18 percent in the Northeast, dropped 5.7 percent in the
West and moved 0.6 percent lower in the South. They shot up 16.4
percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
For the year, single-family started declined 2.4 percent while
apartment construction rose 8.3 percent. Starts increased 3.5
percent in the Northeast and 1.5 percent in the South. They fell
5.6 percent in the Midwest and 0.8 percent in the West.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: "I'm not Asking for the Moon" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat is going to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday, aimed at getting what the Palestinians should get
under the 1993 agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Washington on Wednesday while Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is heading home with no agreement
reached on further withdrawal from the West Bank after two
rounds of discussions with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters on Wednesday night before his talks
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel should
abide by its promise to cede occupied territories of the West
Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking for the Moon," he said. "I'm asking for what
has been signed at the White House under the supervision of
President Clinton (in 1993) to be implemented accurately and
honestly."
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached in Oslo, the capital of Norway, between
the Palestinians and the former Israeli Labour government, and
signed in Washington in 1993, stipulated that Israel should pull
its troops from the occupied West Bank through three phases.
</P>
<P>
While 27 percent of the territories were handed over to the
Palestinian Authority, Israel under the Likud government, headed
by Netanyahu who won a victory in the 1996 elections, refused to
any further redeployment because of what it said was for
security consideration.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks between the U.S. and Israeli leaders,
Clinton offered some fresh ideas for further withdrawal to
Netanyahu so that U.S. officials said the peace process in the
Middle East could be revitalized, which has been stalled for ten
months since last March.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. officials the U.S. president suggested
that rather than making the next phase of the withdrawal in one
swoop, Israel should carry it out in a series of smaller steps.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the Palestinians should adopt a series of
concrete security measures, including intelligence sharing and a
crackdown on Palestinian militants, they said.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli leader would not accept that formula and the
U.S. officials said "gaps" between the United States and Israel
remain and could not be solved over night.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said what the U.S.-Israeli talks on Tuesday had
achieved was the two leaders agreed more talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with Albright last night and said after
their discussion on the peace process that the atmosphere was
positive and constructive. But he added Washington had not yet
outlined new ideas for breaking the stalemate in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at Wednesday's
briefing that President Clinton might put some heat on Arafat
when they meet.
</P>
<P>
"He needs to understand the linkage between any movement
forward by the Israelis and the question of security," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly both sides have a lot of work to do if we're going to
get the peace process back on track," Rubin added.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Unity to Resolve Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today opened the one-day national economic consultative
forum retreat with a call for all Zimbabweans to work in unison
to solve crippling economic problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of people from the private sector, civic
organizations, the academia and the government, Mugabe said lack
of common purpose and action is likely to lead into more
negative consequences for the country.
</P>
<P>
The plea comes at a time when Zimbabwe is rocked by a series
of demonstrations this week against rising food prices which
turned violent leaving millions of Dollars worth of business
property destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "We must pull together as Zimbabweans with a
total commitment to the progress and prosperity of all our people
or else we shall sink and collapse quarrelsomely and separately."
</P>
<P>
He said the unprecedented disruptions in the economy in recent
months, the high unemployment figures, low economic growth rate
as well as cash flow difficulties and high interest rates for
businesses are important issues to be considered at the forum.
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing the forum is "to assess and critically
analyze the various policy measures to be implemented of the
preferred strategy with determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
The forum is the first national dialogue bringing together
nearly 500 participants from the private sector, the government,
non-governmental organizations, academia, to discuss the way
forward for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The forum seeks to foster cooperation between the government,
private sector and other stakeholders in the formulation of
economic social policies.
</P>
<P>
The participants slammed the government for failing to
implement recommendations coming from other stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to quickly solve the problems of
unemployment, high interest rates, a ballooning budget deficit
and restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
They said unless these issues are resolved, Zimbabwe will
continue to display signs of instability citing the just ended
food riots as one deterrent to investors.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in N.Irish Still in Good Shape--Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Thursday he believed the peace process in Northern
Ireland was still in "good shape."
</P>
<P>
Blair told the cabinet there was nothing to indicate that there
was any problem with the IRA ceasefire, according to Blair's
official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair stressed that the recent killings must
not be allowed to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"They (the killers) must not be allowed to derail the peace
process," the spokesman quoted Blair as saying. "That is what they
want. That is what the democrats among us must prevent from
happening."
</P>
<P>
But Blair believed only a tiny number of people were involved
in the murders while thousands wanted peace.
</P>
<P>
In the latest of a spree of tit-for-tat attacks, one man was
killed and two injured on Wednesday evening. The violence was
widely blamed on pro-British Protestant extremists, who have
launched random attacks on Roman Catholics in retaliation for the
murder of a top Protestant guerrilla on December 27.

<HEADLINE> River Pollution Causes Fish to Change Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Male roach, one of Britain's
most common freshwater fish, are undergoing sex changes caused by
sewage effluent in rivers throughout Britain, the Independent
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that, according to a study unveiled yesterday,
100 percent of male roach examined in two rivers, the Nene in
Norfolk and the Aire in West Yorkshire, showed signs of
feminisation.
</P>
<P>
In the worst cases, large parts of the sperm-producing testes
had turned into egg-making ovary tissue.
</P>
<P>
It has been known for years in Britain that sewage effluent can
feminise fish.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest research, by a team from Brunel University,
is believed to be the first to firmly ascribe the feminisation of
male fish to discharges from sewage works and factories.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, covering 2,000 fish at 20 different sites in
England and Wales, found that sex of up to 60 percent of the fish
caught in river downstream from discharges was changed severely.
</P>
<P>
But, on average, only up to 25 percent of fish upstream
suffered this fate.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that previous research had linked fish sex
changes with human and synthetic oestrogens, indicating that
something in the way these hormones are treated at sewage works
makes them more potent.
</P>
<P>
But the latest study showed that chemicals, ranging from
detergents and pesticides to adhesives and plastics, may also
cause male fish to change sex.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNOMIG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Misson in Georgia (UNOMIG) for a further period
of six months until July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said that much
groundwork has been laid down towards achieving substantive
progress in the Georgian/Abkhaz peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the United Nations efforts in that
regard have been further revitalized, the role of the group of
Friends of the Secretary-General has been clarified and agreed
upon, and the Concluding Statement adopted at Geneva on November
19 now provides an implementation plan.
</P>
<P>
Annan said political machinery to address the military,
political and economic ramifications of the peace process in now
in place: the coordinating council and three working groups have
been established and have already met for the first time in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said progress, therefore, depends more than ever
on the determination of the two sides to negotiate in earnest and
to work constructively to achieve substantive results.
</P>
<P>
Annan said progress in the area of the return of refugees and
internally displaced persons is urgently needed in order to give
additional credibility to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General noted the presence of UNOMIG continues to
be a stabilizing factor in the area and to provide useful support
for the political process.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the steps already taken to promote substantive
progress in Georgian/Abkhaz peace process, he recommended that the
Security Council extend the mandate of UNOMIG for an additional
period of six months, ending July 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Farms Decrease in Last Two Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of the U.S. small
farms has dropped by 300,000 in the past two decades as big
agribusiness grows ever more centralized, according to a federal
commission's report here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 120-page report was prepared by a 30-member commission,
appointed last summer by the U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman, which has made 146 recommendations on ways to bolster
small farms. The commission held 10 meetings around the country on
the future of farms grossing less than 250,000 U.S. dollar a year
and primarily run by families.
</P>
<P>
Although 94 percent of the nation-wide 2 million farms fit this
definition, they receive only 41 percent of all farm receipts.
</P>
<P>
"For decades, we have watched our small farms disappear,"
Glickman said after receiving the 120-page report. "I want to see
small farms grow and prosper and get ahead, not just survive."
</P>
<P>
The commission found that most profits in agriculture are
earned by companies that process food and sell products such as
fertilizer to farmers. As a result, the share of agriculture
income received today by farmers is one-quarter what it was at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The panel attributed the decrease to the increasing
centralization in part on government decisions made over the past
20 years that primarily benefit large agribusiness companies, such
as tax policies that encourage big firms to expand.
</P>
<P>
Many farm experts believe the development means more efficient
food production and lower prices for consumers, but the commission
said that doesn't take into account the environmental damage
caused by large livestock operations and the lack of competition.
</P>
<P>
In order to revive small farms in the country, the commission
put forward some recommendations which include:
</P>
<P>
--Ensure levels of spending on research and credit are high
enough in programs targeted toward family farms. Research should
focus on least costly ways of farming and those that require lower
capital investment.
</P>
<P>
--Promote more market access for farmers, including development
of farmer-owned cooperatives and more regional markets.
</P>
<P>
--Launch a "beginning farmer" program aimed at teaching younger
people the best way to make a profit and form farmer networks to
share information.
</P>
<P>
--Establish a high-level small-farms administrator within the
Agriculture Department to implement changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
--Repeal a law placing loan restrictions on any farmer whose
previous debt was written off.
</P>
<P>
--Investigate whether excessive profits are being made by dairy
processors and retailers and prohibit most beef packers from using
forward contracts to procure cattle or from owning and feeding
them.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department plans to form a group to implement
many of the recommendations. The department will propose full
funding of lending programs in its fiscal 1999 budget and plans to
ask Congress to repeal the loan restrictions law.

The world wheat area is projected to decline slightly to 225.7
m. ha, compared with 227 m. ha. Consequently, the eventual outturn
will depend mainly on average yields, which are unlikely to match
the record highs of the current crop year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, IGC stresses it must be emphasised that these
initial forecasts are necessarily based on the assumption that
normal weather will prevail throughout the growing season.
</P>
<P>
As far as market expectations are concerned, the economic
difficulties in some Far East Asian countries remained a major
focus of interest within grains trade circle here.
</P>
<P>
But trade sources are reluctant to quantify any likely effect
on grain imports. The general sentiment was that the impact would
be reflected firstly in purchases of value-added products.
</P>
<P>
According to IGC, the US, Australia and Canada sought to
maintain trade levels by extending new credits to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was granted a second extension of the oil for food
arrangement involving a partial lifting of UN sanctions, which IGC
believes should soon lead to substantial purchases of of grain.

<HEADLINE> Asian Turbulence Leaves Its Mark on Top FT 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) Turbulence in Asia's stock markets
has left its mark on the list of the top FT 100 Asia-Pacific
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to a Financial Times survey released today the top
10 places for 1997 are dominated by companies from HKSAR with
HSBC Holdings displacing Singapore Telecom in head position.
</P>
<P>
That largely reflects the movements in currency and equity
markets over the year, the survey comments.
</P>
<P>
Though the HongKong market has been way below its peak since
July, the Financial Times said the local dollar has remained
stable and the equity market has outperformed most others in Asia
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For similar reasons, Taiwan Semiconductor has moved up to 10th
place from 56. The Taiwan currency has falled less than those of
other regional countries and its market has been the best
performer, the survey states.
</P>
<P>
When companies are measured by capitalisation, the rankings
inevitably reflect relative market performance rather than
fundamental changes to individual businesses.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that many companies which dropped out of the
list in 1997 are those from the worst performing equity markets in
south-east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Krung Thai Bank, which in 1996 was secure at 45th position on
the list, has slipped out altogether. Five Malaysian flagship
companies have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the list of new entrants reflects the strong
investor interest in China-related companies in HKSAR in the first
half of the year, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Beijing Enterprises, Cosco Pacific, Shanghai
Industrial Holdings, and Kah Wah Bank make their appearance for
the first time.

<HEADLINE> UK Better Regulation Task Force Publishes Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) - The Better Regulation Task Force
today published its first piece of work - a set of principles of
good regulation.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force plans to use the principles as a template for
checking Government regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Better Regulation Task Force is an independent advisory
body appointed by the Public Service Office and assisted and
advised by its Better Regulation Unit.
</P>
<P>
Launching the new guide, Christopher Haskins, Chairman of the
Better Regulation Task Force, said: "Everybody knows we have
regulations that are outdated, poorly targeted and ineffective."
</P>
<P>
"Government needs to act to modernize the statute book for the
21th century. We are giving them today a 'critic's guide' to judge
the quality of their regulations over the next few years," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the Task Force is applying the principles
to the four issues it is currently examining - Employment Law,
Consumer Affairs, Charities and the Voluntary Sector, and Social
Services.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Vice-president Concludes Visit to Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice-president and
Defense Minister Paul Kagame is expected to conclude a four-day
working visit to Belgium today, state-run Radio Rwanda announced
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
While addressing reporters in Brussels on Wednesday,
Kagame is optimistic about the future relations between Rwanda
and Belgium which had not been really warm in the past.
</P>
<P>
As for security prevailing in the country, the Rwandan
vice-president said that compared to what it was in the past
months, the situation has tremendously improved.
</P>
<P>
"The main activities have continued in the northwestern part
of our country," he told reporters, adding that security forces
have been able to prevent terrorist activities by armed Hutu
militia from spreading all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"The way it has been three months ago is not the way it is
now," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the situation in totality, I think there is
great progress in the areas of Ruhengeri and some parts of
Gisenyi prefectures," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Rwanda is collaborating with the Congolese
authorities to root out armed elements causing insecurity along
the common border and which have been causing havoc in the
north-west of the country.
</P>
<P>
While in Brussels, the Rwandan vice-president was received by
Belgian authorities, including King Albert II, with whom he
exchanged views on how to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed the EU Parliament which he asked to increase
aid to the rehabilitation of Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> London Oil Price Falls Below $15 on Bulging US Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The price of North Sea Brent
crude on the London market tumbled to a fresh 45-month low
Thursday morning following bearish news of bulging stocks in the
US, the world's biggest energy market.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent crude slumped below the psychologically
important $15 a barrel level to trade at $14.87 on London's
International Petroleum Exchange this morning after hitting a low
of $14.78.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that crude in US storage now stands a full 32
million barrels higher than a year ago, also much higher than had
earlier been expected.
</P>
<P>
Further pressure came from suggestions that Iraq may be allowed
to raise exports under the United Nations oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
These factors weighed heavily on world oil market which is
already worried about mild winter weather in the northern
hemisphere, rising supply by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries and falling Asian oil demand due to the
financial troubles in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another bearish factor is that demand for crude will
further cut because of an impending refinery maintenance season in
several regions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the oil price outlook for 1998 is bleak unless
OPEC acts early to cut its output.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Arafat Start Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday set some principles for the Middle East peace process
before his talks with Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the principles included "mutual obligations and
the concept of land for peace so that Israelis can live in
security, recognized by all their neighbors, and the
Palestinians can realize their aspirations to live as a free
people."
</P>
<P>
"If we can focus on these principles, I am convinced we can
make some progress," the U.S. president told reporters at a
photo session with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his hopes that after his meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday and with
Arafat on Thursday the United States could move the two sides
"closer together."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has offered some fresh ideas to re-start the Middle
East peace process, which has suspended for 10 months.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said Clinton suggested a series of smaller
steps for withdrawals by Israel from the West Bank rather than one
big swoop, and a series of concrete security measures by the
Palestinians, which he believed could bring the Israelis and
Palestinians closer together.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his confidence over U.S. mediation on peace
process, saying: "As long as there is pressure and efforts by
President Clinton, I'm confident that the peace process will be
protected and will be succeeded."

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah's German Agent Indicted for Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Charges were formally
brought against Hezbollah's (Party of God) German agent Stefan
Josef Smirak Thursday at the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court for
planning suicide attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Smirak, 26, a convert to Islam, was arrested on November 28 on
arrival at the Ben-Gurion Airport. He has been put on trial since
December 25 with charges of spying, attempting to carry out terror
attack and being a member of a terror organization.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Smirak was recruited by Hezbollah, which
has been waging a guerrilla war against Israeli occupation of
south Lebanon, during a visit to Lebanon between August and
November last year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Smirak was sent to a training camp in the
Bekka Valley in Lebanon, where he was taught to use light weapons
and operate explosive devices, according to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said Smirak, provided with video cameras and
electronic communication devices, was sent to Israel to collect
information and film densely-populated areas in Tel Aviv and
Haifa in order to target a site for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Smirak's attorney Dan Asan claimed that his client could
not get a fair trial in Israel and demanded for a trial in
Germany, where criminal proceedings were also launched against
Smirak.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Smirak will face a maximal sentence of life
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Violence Rampant in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The 91-year-old Koppel
Patishnik was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by the Tel
Avia District Court Wednesday for stabbing to death his
81-year-old wife Hannah last July.
</P>
<P>
Hannah was one of the 106 women killed by their husbands or
boyfriends in Israel in domestic violence between 1990 and 1997,
said latest police statistics.
</P>
<P>
Each year for the past seven years, an average of 18,000
complaints were filed regarding domestic violence, or at a rate of
one in every half an hour.
</P>
<P>
The statistics further said that one in every seven women in
the country has one-time suffered physical abuse by her husband or
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
About 74 percent of all domestic complaints were filed by women
against their husbands or boyfriends, who were said to have beaten
them or their children.
</P>
<P>
But only one in 10 incidents of violence against women was
actually reported to the police, so the actual number of incidents
is estimated at 150,000 to 200,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
The domestic violence has caused great concern among the
public celebrities. Reuma Weizman, wife of President Ezer Weizman,
said on Wednesday that "the frequence of violence against women
has become unbearable and dealing with the situation has become
urgent."
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk has
also expressed his concern over this issue. He said on Wednesday
that the police could do more, but that the legal and education
systems must also take part in solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September 1997, Israel has a total population of
5.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition Opens in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition
entitled ''Peace, Democracy and Development Pathfinder''
officially opened here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the photo exhibition, which was opened by Ethiopian Deputy
Speaker Petros Olango at National Museum, 328 photos displayed at
the exhibition depicting the achievements made by the Ethiopian
people in political, economic and social, diplomatic and other
sectors in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
According to the introduction of the exhibition, Ethiopia
reaped 11.7 million tons of crops in 1996 and there was 1.7
million tons of crops in surplus than the actually needs to feed
its people for one year.
</P>
<P>
The third conference of the ruling Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) held recently adopted a
resolution to produce a surplus of one million tons of crop every
year, thus to ensure food-self sufficiency in the country.
</P>
<P>
The introduction said that the ethiopian government plans to
have no less than 850,000 telephone lines and over 300 rural
towns will be benefited from the telecom program in the coming
one or two years, compared with only 160,000 telephone lines now.
Meanwhile, the country's power generation capacity will be
doubled within 5 to 7 years from now.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will remain to open until January 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Pledges Support for Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
reiterated its support for the peace process in Angola following
reports that a South African private aircraft had been forced
down in Angola for violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The cargo plane was forced down in southeastern Angola as it
flew into the territory held by the opposition National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to deliver construction
materials. Three crew members of the plane were detained, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the process of bringing peace to Angola, South
Africa will take vigorous steps to ensure the strict observation
of sanctions against UNITA," the Foreign Affairs Department of
South Africa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed diplomatic, air and travel
sanctions on UNITA last year for violating a peace accord that
ended years of civil war in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government would like to make it quite
clear to those opportunists who are attempting to prolong the
misery of the Angolan people will have to face the consequences
of their action," warned the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the UN resolutions were designed to bring peace to
Angola and "offer hope to its war-weary population".
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will do all in its power to ensure that a
lasting peace unfold in Angola which will unlock the vast
potential of that country for the benefit of all Angolans," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Most Cypriots for EU Entry: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority of
both Greek and Turkish Cypriots want Cyprus to become a member of
the European Union (EU), Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remark at his daily press briefing in
response to the Turkish Cypriots' rejection of the EU decision at
Luxembourg summit last month to begin accession negotiations with
the Cypriot government in next spring.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for full EU membership in
1990. But the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insisted that
Cyprus can join the EU only after a political settlement on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Denktash ordered a suspension of bi-communal contacts with the
Greek Cypriots last month in retaliation for the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the EU accession is desired by the Republic
of Cyprus, welcomed by the Greek Cypriot community, the Turkish
Cypriot community, and supported and encouraged by the U.N., the
Commonwealth, the Non-Aligned Movement, except Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said the interests of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
require the completion of the European course. "The road to
Europe should remain open," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot
leadership to "set aside excuses and pretexts because it is not
right to sacrifice the interests of the Turkish Cypriots to serve
the interests of Turkey or those of the Turkish Cypriot
leadership."

<HEADLINE> Levy Launches Bid to Run for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy Thursday launched his bid to run for
premiership in the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who resigned early this month over disputes with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made the announcement at the congress
of his Gesher (Bridge) Party.
</P>
<P>
His bid pitted himself against Netanyahu and leading opposition
Labor Party's leader Ehud Barak in the tough battle for the
premiership in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Gesher, which took part in the 1996 elections in a joint list
with the ruling Likud and Tsomet parties, has five allocated
seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament). Levy founded Gesher
early 1996 after he split from the Likud due to his rivalry with
Netanyahu, his long-term political rival within the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Yehuda Lankri, a Gesher lawmaker, said Levy would run on a
platform with strong stress on the social problems.
</P>
<P>
Levy, an immigrant from Morocco, has been regarded as a
representative of the working class and the Sephardi Jews of
Middle East and northern African origins. His resignation was
largely due to his protest against the government's budgetary cut
in welfare benefits to the lower class.
</P>
<P>
Lankri said that Gesher's appeal would not be limited to the
working class, but to all the nation as a whole. "Our main
struggle is social one, but we're appealing to all Israelis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed Levy could launch a strong challenge against
Netanyahu and Barak in the run for premiership. "Levy is
wonderful, one of the most performing political and state leaders
in Israel. He can in this option appeal to all Israelis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lankri pointed out that the Gesher's platform is very similar
to the Labor's. For example, he said, both stress the social
issues and support the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian
Oslo peace process. But he ruled out Gesher's joining hands with
the Labor in the next elections, saying Levy is determined to run
alone.
</P>
<P>
Levy's departure from the Likud-led government dealt a serious
blow to the coalition, reducing its parliamentary majority to the
minimal 61 seats needed to continue. This has also triggered
speculation that earlier elections could be held if the coalition
faces any new crisis.

<HEADLINE> Joint Commission Established for Russian-Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of a joint
Russian-Japanese commission was announced by Moscow and Tokyo on
Thursday to work towards the signing of a peace treaty between
the two countries, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first round of bilateral consultations on the
peace treaty held in Moscow the Russian ministry of foreign
affairs announced the commission will be headed by the ministers
of foreign affairs of Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the ministers of the foreign affairs from
Russia and Japan, Yevgeny Primakov and Keizo Obuchi, as the
co-chairmen of the Commission will be held in Moscow in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a peace treaty had been hampered by the
unresolved territorial dispute over the islands of Iturup,
Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, because Japan refused to recognize
Russian sovereignty over the South Kuril islands which it regards
as its own "Northern territories".
</P>
<P>
A landmark achievement in the movement towards the peace treaty
was made during Russian president Boris Yeltsin's official visit
to Japan in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
A further breakthrough was made in bilateral relations during
the informal meeting of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister of Japan Ryutaro Hashimoto near Krasnoyarsk, Russia, on
earlier November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries for the first time committed
themselves to making every efforts to sign a peace treaty between
Russia and Japan before the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Enhance Mineral Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
set up a unit to shoulder responsibilities of promoting, marketing
and sustaining investment in the country's solid minerals
sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The outfit would be one of the two units that would be carved
out of the present department of geological surveys, sources at
the ministry of solid minerals development said today.
</P>
<P>
the scheduled restructuring exercise, which is said to be in
the pipeline, will give birth to a new department of mineral
investment and marketing, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
Also expected to see the light of day is a new section that
would provide for all necessary geological information, including
the proposed minerals data bankilities.
</P>
<P>
Kaloma Ali, Minister of Solid Minerals Development, has
earlier disclosed a plan to computerize the operations of the
ministry and develop a geological information system.
</P>
<P>
He said the main objective of the program was to attain
effective and efficient geological survey coverage of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Development of the solid minerals sector is part of the
efforts by the Nigerian government to change the country's
over-dependence on crude oil, which accounts for about two-third
of the government's foreign exchange income and revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a seasoned geologist and former
university teacher is being slated to head the planned department
of mineral investment and marketing.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Returns from US Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu returned home on Thursday after winding up his
two-day visit to the United states.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Netanyahu held two-round of
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on reviving the Mideast
peace process, particularly on the issue of Israel's troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
No details of the Washington talks were disclosed upon his
arrival, but officials in Netanyahu's delegation said a new
U.S. formula that would have Israel cede small parcels of land in
phases while the Palestinians take matching steps against
terrorists, emerged on Wednesday after Clinton met with Netanyahu
for the unexpected second time in the White House.
</P>
<P>
The main idea that evolved from their discussions was that the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would redeploy in relatively small
stages, as the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fulfills each
of its commitments under the Oslo Accords, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But this procedure will have to win the approval of PNA
President Yasser Arafat, who is to hold talks with Clinton in the
White House Thursday, and must be approved by the Israeli cabinet,
they said.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting is scheduled on Sunday, during which
Netanyahu will brief the ministers about his Washington trip.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of State for
Agriculture Frank Adejuwon said in the capital Abuja today that
farmers in the country will be given necessary incentives toward
reviving the agricultural sector this year.
</P>
<P>
The incentives, according to the minister, are in consonance
with the government's 1998 budget which focuses on agricultural
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are gearing toward an aggressive effort at revamping the
agricultural sector to turn round the country into the agrarian
force," he was quoted by the official News Agency of Nigeria as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was famed for its "agricultural feat" until the 1970s,
when the country became devoted to the booming oil industry, said
Adejuwon.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, did not give any details of the
promised incentives.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Will for Peace Blamed for Conflicts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, January 22 (Xinhua) - Participants here at
an international workshop on African conflicts today blamed the
lack of the will for peace among conflicting parties as the major
reason for failure to settle conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Felix Mosha, a former United Nations representative in
Somalia, said in a presentation today that the U.N. did not fail
in Somalia, the Somalis themselves failed because the faction
leaders did not want peace.
</P>
<P>
"A failure of a settlement to a conflict must always be
attributed to the parties involved in the conflict considering
that the Somalis had blamed others, they never succeeded in
achieving a settlement by themselves," Mosha said.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, a negotiated settlement of a conflict
is only possible if the parties to the conflict favor a peaceful
solution."
</P>
<P>
A United States-led U.N. peace-keeping mission in Somalia was
forced to withdraw from Somalia in 1994 without helping the
country out of its unrest.
</P>
<P>
Former Portuguese foreign minister, who was a major mediator
in the Angolan civil war, also pointed out in his presentation
that prolonged conflicts in Angola were due to the UNITA leaders
who refused to accept the general election outcome in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bethisel Kiplagat, former Kenyan ambassador to Tanzania, said
Wednesday that the most dangerous thing in African conflicts is
the idea that one can succeed to seize power through the barrel
of a gun.
</P>
<P>
If one could come to power through the barrel of a gun, then
he could also be overthrown by another person with the same idea,
Kiplagat said. "The vicious circle must be ended."
</P>
<P>
Some 200 former peace-makers, diplomats, government officials,
representatives of world and regional organizations and
non-governmental organizations are gathering in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha to exchange experiences in mediating
African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar under the theme of "Learning from
Conflict Resolution in Africa", is jointly organized by the
Tanzanian Foreign Ministry and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hopes for Early End to Dispute With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Thursday expressed the
hope that the dispute with the U.N. International Labor
Organisation (ILO) over the appointment of Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat's brother-in-law as director of its Beirut-based
regional office be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese radio Voice of the People quoted Foreign Ministry
sources as saying that the Lebanese government wishes that the
problem be resolved before it becomes a crisis which could lead to
the transfer of the regional office from Beirut to another Middle
Eastern country, most likely Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The crux of the problem is the Lebanese government's refusal to
grant Ibrahim Souss an entry visa due to potential "negative
results" in Lebanon brought about by him as the director, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Souss, who assumed the post on January 1 this year, was the
Paris representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) for a decade in the 1980s and has also lived in Lebanon as a
politician of the PLO for a long time. He is currently running the
ILO regional office in Beirut from the U.N. headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has long been particularly sensitive about the
Palestinians, holding them responsible for the outbreak of the
1975-1990 civil war. Now, there are about 360,000 Palestinians in
the country as refugees.
</P>
<P>
The government has been applying difficult visa restrictions
on Palestinians in the last three years on grounds of national
security requirements.
</P>
<P>
"Although Souss holds Canadian, French and Yemeni citizenship,
Lebanese government couldn't forget his Palestinian identity," the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The office of ILO in Beirut Thursday refused to comment on the
issue and said that it is a matter of the director-general of ILO
in Geneva Michel Hansenne, who favored the appointment of Souss.
</P>
<P>
The radio also quoted the press officials in the office as
saying that they had not so far received any order to apply a visa
for Souss.
</P>
<P>
"Now, he is working as the regional director in Geneva.
There will be remarks when something happens," the officials
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana today reaffirmed his government's commitment on the
pursuit of the on-going peace initiative for the Somali and
Sudanese conflict.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a press conference here today when he
arrived here from the first ministerial meeting of the joint
Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) held over the
weekend in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the meeting appealed to warring
factions in Somalia to forget their differences and to return to
the negotiation table in April at a venue to be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
All peace initiatives designed to find a lasting solution of
the conflicts in the region especially the Somali and Sudanese
conflicts will be continued, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that IGAD member states expressed satisfaction
at the meeting over the efforts to promote economic integration
and conflict resolution in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the minister said, IGAD member states were
mandated to achieve closer economic integration, secure food and
other instruments to settle the current disputes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the seven IGAD member states brokered the first
peace talks in seven years between Khartoum government and John
Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
The October meeting produced no cease-fire in the Africa's
biggest country but both sides agreed to meet again in April in
Kenya's capital of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
From next month, Kenya which is in the current IGAD chair will
engage in shuttle diplomacy among the IGAD member countries to
prepare for the April talks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Kenyan foreign minister had already
asked both sides to relax their positions and make efforts to
move closer together between now and April.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Talks with Clinton Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat on Thursday described his meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton as "warm, constructive and important", and said he
would hold another talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It is a "very warm, very constructive and very important
meeting," Arafat said when he emerged from the talks and he said
he was encouraged.
</P>
<P>
"There are some ideas which we were discussing and which will
continue this after noon," he said. Arafat will return to the White
House later in the day to meet Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said before his talks with Arafat that the United
States were trying to figure out "how to close the loop and get
an understanding on what the next steps are" for the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to just keep dragging this out. I think we
have a sense of urgency here," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Palestinian sources said Clinton was trying to set up
a meeting between Chairman Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to revive the stalled peace process
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, reports said, would
mediate between Netanyahu and Arafat at a still to be determined
site in Europe, hoping to close a deal based on a large Israeli
pullback from the West Bank, in phases linked to Palestinian
move against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters on Thursday that the Palestinians were
entitled to another 60 percent of West Bank under agreements
with Israel, signed in 1993. That would be in addition to the 27
percent Israel has already turned over, along with Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Mr. Netanyahu will understand that peace is not
only a Palestinian need. It's a Israeli need, it's a Palestinian
need, it's an Arab need, it's an international need," Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Mr. Netanyahu will turn his words to deeds and
comply with the agreements," He added.

<HEADLINE> Major Nigerian Daily Begins Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Daily Times of Nigeria (DTN)
plans to begin a massive lay-off of its staff to revamp the
country's leading newspaper Daily Times.
</P>
<P>
The company announced here this afternoon that it is going to
reduce 1,125 of its staff with immediate effect, the Nigerian
Television Authority reported.
</P>
<P>
The number represents 45 percent of the company's 2,500 work
force nationwide, said Peter Enahord, administrator of the
company, which also runs the weekly Business Times.
</P>
<P>
Enahord also announced that survivors of the downsizing
exercise would benefit from a comprehensive enhanced new salary
structure, which means an increase of between 60 and 110 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to him, government financial intervention is one of
the reasons leading to the downsizing of the grossly over-staffed
company, which is 60 percent owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
Several criteria have been devised by the management to assist
in ensuring that the exercise is done "even-handedly with
transparent fairness and justice", he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the criteria are diminishing productivity over a
period of time, indiscipline including unauthorized absence from
duty, fraud and fraud-related cases and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
The staff reduction will also affect those who have been on
the payroll for years but whose jobs are either actually no
longer available or relevant or have been made redundant because
of duplication of functions.

is on good take-off.
</P>
<P>
"The government's economic reform has been proven right," he
said, adding that products of several flourishing privately owned
companies like the Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) have
dominated domestic and even foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
TBL's success is a result of the government's policy to
encourage the public to control the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed satisfaction over the quality of
products and workmanship after touring Associated Breweries and
Tanzania Cigarette Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has a number of experts whose professional
skills should be made best use by investors.
</P>
<P>
The minister also inaugurated a new brand of beer named
"Serengeti-Kick," the third beer producer of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
TBL officials have told the minister that the company's tax
revenue in 1997 is expected to reach 48 billion Shillings (about
75 million US Dollars), compared with 39 billion Shillings in
1996 and 12 billion in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Only 7,500 Tigers At Most, WWF Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The world today has only 5,000 to
7,500 tigers compared with over 100,000 at the end of the last
century, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned Thursday in
Frankfurt shortly before the beginning of the Chinese Year of
Tiger.
</P>
<P>
According to the WWF, most of the remaining tigers are living
within national parks or nature reserves. Beyond these areas,
tigers only have very limited surviving chances.
</P>
<P>
The main factors threatening tigers are the intrusion of the
animals' natural habitats as a result of the rapid expansion of
human population, as well as illegal hunting and trafficking of
tigers for medicine purpose in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent tigers from dying out, the organization
Thursday presented a new action program which included a
one-million-dollar fund to finance international efforts against
illegal hunting and trafficking of tigers.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Surprised at Iraq's Release of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali said Thursday it is surprising that 80 Jordanian
prisoners in Iraq were set free on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"(I wonder) why the decision was taken (by Iraq) at this
particular time," Majali told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He described the decision as a surprise to him as it came one
day after the massacre of six Iraqis, including the charge
d'affaires at the Iraqi embassy in Jordan and a millionaire
managing business for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan earlier had made efforts at the highest level to ensure
the release of the prisoners, but got no response from the Iraqi
authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jordanian prime minister said he has not found any
political motive or special plan behind Iraq's decision. "This put
a question mark on why the release of the prisoners happened at
this time, but so far there is no indication on the inclination or
any political motive or plan that we can point at."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the bilateral ties are always warm and that
Jordan always stands with the Iraqi people and calls for the
lifting of the crippling economic sanctions imposed by the United
Nations on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq released the 80 Jordanian prisoners on Sunday, 59
of whom returned to Jordan Wednesday night and the rest, including
students and businessmen, chose to stay in Iraq.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- It is the time for the
United Nations to close Iraq's nuclear file, Chinese Ambassador
to the United Nations Qin Huasun stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Qin made the remarks after the Security Council finished
reviewing the report on the field of Iraq's nuclear weapons by the
International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said great progress in some areas has been made
during the IAEA team's last visit to Iraq. Iraq has responded to
the inquiries with regard to the five areas raised by the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the IAEA has no evidence to contradict Iraq's
response. Therefore we believe that the remaining issues in the
nuclear field have been basically solved," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time to close the nuclear file. We fully agree that
at this stage the IAEA should focus on the implementation and the
strengthening of its ongoing monitoring and verification plan,"
Qin stressed.
</P>
<P>
"China's position on Iraq is consistent. We believe that Iraq
should implement fully relevant resolutions of the Security
Council. At the same time, the council should also give a timely
and objective evaluation of the progress so far made," Qin added.

JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Government officials of
Botswana and Namibia are meeting today over Situngu, a tiny
disputed island between their countries.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, which took place at Katima Mulilo, capital
city of Namibia's north-eastern province of Caprivi, are about
possible withdrawal of Botswana's troops from Situngu island.
</P>
<P>
The officials will also be discussing the fate of Namibians
farming on the island, reports reaching here from Namibia quoting
the country's defense ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has denied media reports that two Namibian
generals had supported Botswana's claim to Situngu.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the office of Botswana President Ketumile Masire,
alleged that Namibia's army commander had held talks with the
chief of defense force of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
It indicated, after the meeting on Situngu, that the Namibian
army commander had given his blessing to Botswana's claim to the
island.

The Namibian authorities have appealed for calmness until the

LUANDA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The France-Angola Chamber of
Commerce was established here today in a bid to forge stronger
economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate who was
present at the founding ceremony, stressed the importance of the
Commerce in promoting bilateral ties, saying that it will help
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Roberto de Almeida, president of Angola's National Assembly,

efforts by Angola's Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the
French Embassy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to Almeida, the launch of the Chamber will add a
cornerstone to relations between the two countries, which have
been based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Monory arrived in Angola today for a visit aimed at enhancing
inter-parliamentary exchanges and the friendly cooperative

He was the highest-ranking French leader to visit Angola in

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Gov't Agencies to Buy From Local Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
directed some of its parastatals to purchase some of the products
they need from local founders in a bid to boost the development
of the foundry industry.
</P>
<P>
The government arms include such big state-owned companies as
the National Electric Power Authority, Pipeline and Product
Marketing Company, Nigerian Coal Corporation and Nigerian Mining
Corporation, which all enjoy monopoly in their respective
industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Concord today, some of the
components needed by the agencies are now in the custody of the
Foundry Association of Nigeria (FAN) for local production.
</P>
<P>
The association is collaborating with the family economic
advancement program, a national poverty alleviation program, in
identifying and fabricating plants and machinery required for the
establishment of small-scale cottage industries across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Due to the over-dependence on oil, industrial development in
all other sectors remains at a very low level so that the country
has to import most of manufactured goods needed for both
production and daily consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been eager to improve the
situation but past efforts failed to produce satisfactory
results.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of local foundry products by government agencies
under government directive is expected to be a useful experiment,
according to observers.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Tells Israel to Talk Security Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali said Thursday that Israel should not emphasize too
much on its security needs and implement the signed peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Talking to foreign reporters, the prime minister urged the
Israeli government to temporarily put aside its demand for
security and return to peace negotiations on all tracks and
implement the already signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
"There is slowness in implementing the peace agreements," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Security is an important issue for the Israelis, the
Palestinians, the Syrians, the Lebanese and the Egyptians
alike. It is important for the entire parties concerned in peace,
not only for the Israelis," he said.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came after the Tuesday meeting between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The meeting produced no major breakthrough for the Middle East
peace process because Netanyahu insisted that Israel's security
needs be the foremost and the Palestinians should first fulfill
Israel's demand for security if it wanted peace with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli government's obsession with the
security issue, Majali said that "peace and security are linked
together. Peace ensures security. Without peace, security can not
be ensured. Security is one of peace's elements."
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the current Israeli government has stopped the
peace process. This harms the entire region, the Palestinians in
particular," added Majali, who signed the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty on behalf of the Jordanian government.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries that have reached peace
treaty with the Jewish state. The other is Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to show
patience and not to give Israel any excuse to stop the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Majali
reaffirmed Jordan's consistent position of supporting the
Palestinians to achieve their rights of self-determination and
establishment of their independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the whole situation in the region, the prime
minister denied that the peace process failed.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is an international strategy. Stumbling here and there
does not mean the end of the peace process," he said, adding that
comprehensive peace would finally prevail in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> ANC Defends Abolition of Death Penalty in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today reaffirmed its commitment
to a justice system without death penalty, saying its restoration
was a "short-term apartheid-oriented" solution to the crime
issue.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a call to reinstate death penalty from the
biggest opposition party, the National Party (NP) earlier today,
ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said that death penalty could not
deter criminals and it would be dangerous if the accused is
eventually found innocent after his execution.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC urges the government not to concede to short-term
apartheid-oriented solutions to crime," South African Press
Association quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The NP renewed its call for the death penalty today after an
armed ambush Wednesday of a security van transporting money in
Johannesburg, in which four security men were injured, one
seriously, and more than 3 million Rand was robbed.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest of a spate of cash-in-transit heists, which
have claimed dozens of lives and caused losses in millions of
Rand.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said South Africa was a newly established democracy
and was certain to experience a wave of crime similar to trends
experienced in countries undergoing transition, such as Russia
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
No empirical data existed to support the notion that the
capital penalty served as a deterrent to crime, he said, citing
the failed effort by the former NP government to bring crime
under control by using the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was convinced that the only deterrent to crime
remained crime prevention program by addressing the fundamental
social and economic conditions of the country, and through
combined efforts of the government, the police and the
communities, Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC government has come under mounting fire from the
public and media to reinstall the death penalty, which is revoked
by a 1996 criminal law amendment.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that the government's excessive leniency on crime
contributes to increasingly rampant crime in the country. The
rate of murder and rape in South Africa topped all countries of
the world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the NP called for a referendum and a multi-party
summit to decide whether the death penalty should be
reintroduced. A poll in last year showed that more than two
thirds of white and half of black South Africans preferred to
restoration of the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> UN Observers Condemn Violation of Angolan Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations observers in
Angola today issued a communique, condemning the South African
plane carrying cargo for the former rebel UNITA movement for
violating Angola's air space.
</P>
<P>
The South African airplane was forced down Tuesday near
Menongue, a city in southwestern Angola by the Angolan air force
for transporting cargo for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the fact that the plane had
entered Angola's territorial space without approval from the
Civil Aviation authority, has violated both the country's
sovereignty and the resolution passed in October 1997 by the U.N.
Security Council which imposes sanctions on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the communique also expressed dissatisfaction that
the Angolan government did not allow U.N. observers to send
investigation teams to Menongue to examine the detained plane,
and deny them any contact with the crew.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued today by the Angolan government said the
three crew members and five passengers on the plane had been
handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. At the moment,
the ministry has placed the case on file for investigation before
turning them over to the justice department for trial.
</P>
<P>
The government communique added that a preliminary probe shows
that the plane is privately owned by Johannes Porfurio Parreira,
a South African citizen who now works for a transport company
Interstate whose headquarters is in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Some of the eight people detained on the plane had been flying
cargos for UNITA including ammunition and food, the communique
said.

ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian rider Daniele Pontoni, the
World cyclo-cross champion, tested positive in a dope test earlier
this month, an Italian Cycling Federation (ICF) official said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A second test was to be carried out on Saturday morning,
according the ICF.
</P>
<P>
"If he fails that too, he will be suspended pending full

The 31-year-old Italian, who won his second world cyclo-cross
title last February in Germany and was world amateur champion in
1992, could face a ban of one to two years if the charges were
finally upheld, he added.
</P>

The doping case is the second scandal to hit Italian cycling in

The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) made a surprise U-turn
earlier this week when it dropped doping charges against Olympic
mountain bike champion Paola Pezzo.
</P>

CONI reversed its earlier stance and said there was

nandrolone.

CHENGDU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu Aircraft Industry
Corp. (CAIC) today delivered the 100th MD airplane nose, the most
complicated and difficult part to make on MD passenger jets, to
Boeing Co., the world's largest commercial airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
CAIC has won the appreciation of leading American carriers such

Program Manager Douglas Products Division of Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, at the delivery ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
CAIC has handed over 75 MD-80 noses and 25 MD-90 ones. When the
production contract expires in the middle of 1999, CAIC will have
supplied 100 noses for each model.
</P>
<P>
The company will also start producing 176 Boeing 757 tail
sections in July.
</P>
<P>
The 100 noses already delivered have brought 400 million yuan
in sales income (55 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange), and
income from production contracts with Boeing accounts for 10-to-15
percent of the company's total income.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hainan Official Arrested For Taking Shares, Cash in Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Hainan
Province in Southern China was arrested and stripped of his Party
membership for taking bribes in the form of stock shares and money.
</P>
<P>
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the
Chinese Communist Party has decided to dispel from the Party Xin
Yejiang, former vice chairman of the standing committee of the
People's Congress of Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has also approved Xin's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Xin, who also was deputy director of the provincial Security
Committee, reportedly accepted 50,000 yuan worth of shares given
in 1993 by a pharmaceutical company that was filing for public
listing.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he allegedly accepted 1,000 U.S. dollars and 20,000
yuan given by a shipping firm for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
He voted for the two companies' share-listing plans and signed
the documents submitted for approval to the China Securities
Regulatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
CCDI and the Ministry of Supervision recently issued a circular
banning Party officials and members from accepting bribery.
</P>
<P>
The circular said Xin not only violated Party discipline, but
also broke relevant laws and has "seriously damaged the Party's
image."
</P>
<P>
After he was arrested, Xin repeatedly changed his confession,
which created obstacles for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The circular demanded that Party officials at all levels draw a
lesson from Xin's case and discipline themselves. The Party supervision
and discipline departments also were told to increase efforts to
prevent the practice of trading power for money to ensure the
healthy growth of the share-holding system.

GUANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Traffic was resumed in the
Guangzhou section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway, which had
been temporarily closed after a train collision Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The section was reopened to traffic at 1:10 p.m. this afternoon
after workers spent 15 hours clearing the wreckage and repairing
the rails.
</P>
<P>
Road builders are continuing to remove mud and stone from the
accident area.
</P>

A train collided with a locomotive at 8:45 p.m. Thursday on the
section between the Guangzhou and East Guangzhou stations. One
locomotive driver was killed and five others injured, three
seriously.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened after a section of wall along the railway
suddenly collapsed in the rain. The mud behind the wall buried the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
Just at that time a locomotive from the East Guangzhou Station
was heading for the Guangzhou Station. It de-railed and overturned
onto a nearby track.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded Friday afternoon in an exchange of fire with Lebanese
guerrillas in south Lebanon, a local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They were hit as clashes broke out in the village of Sujud,
just on the edge of the Israeli occupation zone in south Lebanon,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters, warplanes, artillery and tanks took part
in the battle and its warplanes raided Sujud and the nearby
village of Armitai twice. But the radio didn't mention if there
were casualties on the guerrilla side.
</P>
<P>
As conflicts flared up in the south, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah,
secretary general of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, was calling his
supporters at a mass rally celebrating the Jerusalem Day on
Beirut's southern suburbs to fight with Israeli enemies for "more
than 1,000 years."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His call came after Israeli Chief of Staff Maj-Gen Ammon Shahak
declared that if without security guarantees from Lebanon and
Syria, Israeli troops will remain in Lebanon for "another 1,000
years."
</P>
<P>
The tit-for-tat conflicts between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas have never stopped since Israel carved out a
1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south Lebanon to protect
its northern residents from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Visit India This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
is expected to visit India during the first half of this year to
receive the Jawaharlal Nehru Prize for Peace for his contribution
to promoting peace in the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Indian Ambassador to Egypt Kanwal Sibal
in an interview with the Middle East News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian ambassador voiced his country's concern over the
deadlock in the Mideast peace process which threatens regional
stability and lead to deterioration of conditions in the area.
</P>
<P>
"India profoundly understands the Palestinian issue and will
continue to use political and diplomatic ways to effect
comprehensive peace in the area, through cooperation with the
Palestinians, the non-aligned countries or on the humanitarian
arena," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that relations between his country and
Egypt have changed, especially in the economic and trade fields,
citing the recent visit to India by Minister of Trade and Supply
Ahmed Goweili and the inauguration of the Egyptian Business
Council in India.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on partnership is being prepared in conformity
with the Memorandum of Understanding on Trade, signed during
Goweili's visit, he said, adding that the MOU includes exchanging
data and facilitating trade between them and holding symposiums on
production and services in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Rural Development Mahmoud Sherif will visit India
later this year to study India's experiment in rural development
and in introducing small-scale industries in the countryside, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Trade cooperation between Egypt and India increased 10.9
percent in 1997 over 1996, reaching 274.8 million dollars,
including 158.7 million dollars in Indian exports and 116.1
million dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade between the two countries was close in
1997 due to the increase of Egyptian oil exports to India, Sibal
said.
</P>
<P>
The capital of Indian investments in Egypt recorded 453
million dollars covering 32 projects, making India the second
largest Asian investor in Egypt, after Japan.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to Egypt include base metals, transport
equipment, machines, chemicals, textiles, vegetables, tea,
tobacco and mineral materials.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to India include crude oil, raw cotton,
chemicals, fertilizers, raw and junk metals.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Says He Will Not Meet Ranariddh in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Friday that he will not hold talks with
ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The King (Norodom Sihanouk) has proposed informal meetings in
Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, which I turned down -- why should I go
and meet Ranariddh in Bangkok?" Hun Sen told reporters after
meeting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson at his Takhmau residence outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen accepted this week an invitation from his Thai
counterpart, Chuan Leekpai, to visit Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that I have received an invitation from the prime
minister of Thailand to discuss bilateral relations between
Cambodian and Thailand, but not for talks with Ranariddh," Hun Sen
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He did not name the exact date for the visit to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who is staying in Bangkok now, said recently that he
would like to have peace talks with Hun Sen if the latter agrees.
</P>
<P>
Some press reports then speculated that Thailand would host a
meeting for the two Cambodian leaders to end their present
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted from power in early July over charges of
illegally importing weapons, and the movement of anarchic forces
of the former Khmer Rouge to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between government troops and resistant forces loyal
to Ranariddh has been continuing since July along the
Cambodia-Thai border in northern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, leader of Cambodia's opposition Khmer Nation Party,
has been trying to mediate a cease-fire between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen said: "The ceasefire will start when Ranariddh
gives the order to his forces to stop pulling their triggers."
</P>
<P>
Other conditions Hun Sen described as necessary for a
cease-fire included the withdrawal of Ranariddh's nomination to
command the armed forces and his cutting-off of all relations with
the former Khmer Rouge.

<HEADLINE> French Army Launches Second Modernization Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The French army has began the
second phase of its modernization drive during which it will
abandon its two-century old organization over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the French Army General Yves Crene said the
army will no longer be grouped under divisions. Instead there will
be nine brigades consisting of from 5,000 to 12,000 soldiers each,
to be commanded by four commanding staffs.
</P>
<P>
Crene's order issued Friday said the brigades will consist of
two armored brigades, two mechanized brigades, two light armored
brigades, one airborne brigade and 19 back-up regiments.
</P>
<P>
A general command of the territorial action force will be
established in Lille, in northern France, and a command of
logistic support will be established in Essonne, south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
France also plans to cut its military personnel from the
present 230,000 to 136,000 by the year 2002, the last year of its
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of the French armed forces, the biggest since
the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962, was launched two years ago by
President Jacques Chirac to build a purely professional military.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Team Gets Giant Ice Cores for Global Warming Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-U.S. expedition has
pulled three giant ice pillars down from the untraversed snow peak
of Mount Xixabangma, 7,100 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious feat is part of a scientific endeavor to unravel
the mystery of global warming, team leader Yao Tandong told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member scientific team tried all out to meticulously
haul the 10-ton ice pillars and precision instruments from the
frigid peak, which has an average temperature of 40 degrees below
zero Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Local yaks loaded the three ice pillars at the scientific bases
at the 5,800-meter level in the mountains of Tibet and neighboring
Nepal. They were carried by relay to the nearest airport for a
special flight to Lanzhou, China's only center for glacier
research.
</P>
<P>
The ice cores, a scientific term for the 480-meter long
pillars, penetrate the thousands of layers of glaciers which have
trapped air and chemicals during its formation.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, worldwide glaciologists have analyzed the
inside elements of glaciers to rebuild the climatic and
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
After 40 days on the frigid peak in October, the international
research team obtained the ice cores which have an average
diameter of 11 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The cores will provide scientists with accurate information to
study the climate and environment during the past 2,000 years,
said Yao, vice-director of Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and
Cryopedology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The ice cores tell us the tremendous change of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and how regional warming greatly affected
neighboring areas and even the whole Northern Hemisphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Chinese team members are zeroing in on the air bubbles
and oxides in the low-temperature labs in Lanzhou. They also
expected to explain the cause of El Niqo, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
World scientists have depicted the climate picture of the past
200,000 years as a result of their research on ice cores from the
South and North poles and Greenland.
</P>
<P>
However, to finish the global giant climatic backdrop they
needed to study ice cores from mid- and low-latitude areas.
</P>
<P>
"The team has retrieved the most detailed and valuable data
featuring climate and environment in mid latitudes," said Zheng
Du, research fellow with the CAS's Institute of Geophysics.
</P>
<P>
The climate of the Northern Hemisphere is directly influenced
by the Asian monsoon and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which
scientists regard as the ideal place for ice-core research.
</P>
<P>
In addition, geographers can unveil mystical codes of the Asian
monsoon by studying the plateau's glaciers.
</P>
<P>
The latest scientific endeavor for obtaining and transporting
ice cores has cost China one million yuan (about 120,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Scientists say they still face many difficulties in completing
the lab portion of the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A State Guest House which had
destroyed a forest by the side of the country's most beautiful
lake has triggered wide public anger and the local government has
ordered an investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
A wooded area covering 1,200 square meters of ground in the
scenic West Lake Park in eastern China's Zhejiang Province has
been demolished to make way for a tennis court at a state guest
house.
</P>
<P>
In mid-December leaders of the Xihu (West Lake) State Guest
House ordered its gardening crew to leveled a 980-square-meter
hill in the middle of the woods to construct the tennis court. The
guest house was adjacent the woods on the southern slope of
Dingjiashan Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Local forest police said a cluster of ancient tombs dating back
1,500 years also was completely ruined in the most serious case of
forest destruction in the West Lake area.
</P>
<P>
Members of the gardening department who cut down the trees said
their protests that the move was a violation of the greenery
protection law were ignored by guest house officials.
</P>
<P>
The workers cut all the trees in the area in one week. The
trunks reportedly were sold for as little as 1,200 yuan to a local
timber firm.
</P>
<P>
Guest house officials had the tree roots buried and stakes
thrown into a pond near the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Dingjiashan is considered one of the most beautiful spots in
West Lake with a bird's eye view of the whole park, plus its own
unique scenery. Hundreds of thousands of tourists, both domestic
and foreign, visit the park every year.
</P>
<P>
The case has triggered public anger and caused the city
government which to order an investigation into the
matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed in
Indonesia this year is expected to hit 7.1 million, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on the present number of 4.4 million
jobless plus the 2.7 million people who will lose their jobs this
year, Antara News Agency Friday quoted Secretary General of the
Indonesian Cooperation Council Agus Sudono as saying here.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment rate which accounts for 8 percent of the
total workforce of 90 million is considered alarming since the
growth rate of the country's workforce is 7 percent," said Sudono,
former general chairman of the Indonesian Workers Federation.
</P>
<P>
He said however that the unemployment rate in the country is
still considered "not that bad" compared with other countries like
Canada whose unemployed people account for 11 percent of its total
population, Australia 10 percent and the United State between 8.5
and 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"One thing you should remember, however, is that unlike those
countries, we don't have any social insurance for jobless people,"
 Sudono said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's fourth biggest country with more than
200 million people, is currently facing a serious economic crisis
with its currency rupiah continuing to plunge against the U.S.

PHNOM PENH, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Friday revealed to visiting United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson his displeasure with
U.N. human rights envoys in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"I told Madam Robinson frankly that we could not have good
cooperation with people who violate us, who abuse us or who
distort us," Hun Sen told reporters at his residence just after
the meeting with Mary Robinson who arrived here Thursday on her
first visit to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
United Nations human rights officials have accused the
Cambodian government of human rights abuses and failing to
investigate the killings last July of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
supporters, and a March 30 grenade attack on an opposition rally
in which 19 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he had challenged U.N. reports of political
killings during the 90 minute meeting with Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
"We need further investigation of the people reported dead," he
said. He expected more people who it was claimed were dead by the
U.N. report would be found alive.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Threaten to Boycott Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A major Philippine Muslim rebel
group warned Friday that it would boycott a scheduled peace
meeting with the government next month if the military continue to
attack their positions in southern Mindanao Island.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, vice-chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) for political affairs, issued the warning following a
spate of mortar shelling between MILF guerrillas and government
troops last week in Buldon Town, Maguindanao Province.
</P>
<P>
"If the Army and MILF forces in Buldon would continue trading
mortar shells, there is no reason for pushing through with the
scheduled meeting as there is no atmosphere of peace," Jaafar was
quoted as saying by the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The latest skirmishes broke a general cease-fire agreement
signed last December by the two sides, leaving at least 15 MILF
fighters dead and eight government soldiers injured.
</P>
<P>
The technical committees from the MILF and the government are
scheduled to meet on February 4 and 5 in Marawi City, capital of
Lanao del Sur Province in Mindanao, to discuss the possibility of
reaching a preliminary peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
But Jaafar said the MILF Central Committee could make a swift
decision to boycott the forthcoming meeting "should the Buldon
conflict escalate."
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is one of the two remaining Muslim rebel
groups still fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a permanent peace treaty with the government in
1996. But the peace accord was rejected by the MILF, which wants a
separate one with the government.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 12,000 guerrillas, the MILF is presently the
strongest Muslim rebel force in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Another Muslim rebel group, the extremist Abu Saayaf, has
shunned peace talks with Manila.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Red Cross Society
(CRCS) announced here today that it has received more than 2.5
million yuan (300,000 U.S. dollars) in donations for areas of
Tibet and Qinghai hit by the worst blizzards in decades.
</P>
<P>
Since late September, parts of southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province have suffered a series of
major snowstorms which have led to fatalities and property damage.
</P>

An official with the CRCS said the society allocated 100,000
yuan in relief funds to the disaster-hit areas as soon as it
received the report, and the provincial Red Cross Society of
Qinghai also contributed 30,000 yuan for local relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
As the situation worsened, the official said, the CRCS issued
on an urgent circular on Jan. 21 to local Red Cross societies
across the country calling for more aid.
</P>
<P>
"Red Cross organizations at all levels should carry forward the
humanitarianism they have displayed in helping the earthquake-hit
areas in Zhangjiakou, and shift their focus to disaster-stricken
areas in Tibet and Qinghai," the circular said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Financial Resources Adequate for Energy Sector: WEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Energy Council (WEC)
has concluded that global financial resources are more than
adequate to meet the vast needs of the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
But, the funds will be mobilized in sufficient quantities only
if certain conditions are met, the WEC said in a statement
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WEC estimated in its 1998 Statement that the world will
require up to 30 trillion U.S. dollars during the 1990-2020 period
to finance energy projects to meet a 70 percent increase in global
energy demand.
</P>
<P>
This figure equates to 1.5 times the world's 1990 GDP and
includes 5 trillion U.S. dollars which may be needed for
environmental protection and emissions abatement.
</P>
<P>
The world energy organization stated that there are two major
views among energy circles all over the world:
</P>
<P>
The first fears that, given the considerable forecast increase
in the demand for commercial energy, there could be an overall
shortage of finance for the investment required in the energy
sector which could lead to local and regional energy shortages.
</P>
<P>
The second believes that, although a shortage of overall
finance was unlikely, there could still be an increasing problem
in mobilizing finance for energy investments in many developing
countries, where 90 percent of future energy demand growth is
expected to occur.
</P>
<P>
However, the WEC concluded in its study "Financing the Global
Energy Sector -- The Task Ahead" that global capital resources
will be adequate to meet all potential investment finance needs
provided that certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
Annual energy investment requirements are likely to continue to
equate to 3 percent - 4 percent of world GDP 1990-2020, or 15
percent -20 percent of global investment, it said.
</P>
<P>
The WEC is a non-governmental, non commercial, multi-energy
organization with membership in 97 countries representing over 90
percent of world energy consumption.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
during a meeting here today with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine, said that China is willing to work with the French to
maintain the momentum of development in Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine told Jiang that both President Jacque Chirac and the
French government are expecting to advance France-China relations
within the framework of the all-around partnership established by
the two countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Sino-French relations are growing smoothly,
with a fruitful cooperation in the fields of politics, economy,
trade, science, technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sino-French relations have both a large potential
and good prospects, and China is ready to work with the French to
intensify bilateral cooperation in every area.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also recalled the history of Sino-French exchanges and
Vedrine said that France hopes to carry forward the good
traditions of bilateral exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international issues, Jiang said that China and
France share a common view toward the current international
situation, which is moving toward multi-polarization and the fact
is helpful to world peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and France should strengthen their
consultation and cooperation on some major issues in the
international field.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that France hopes that China would play an even
bigger role in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that it's very important for China and Europe to
maintain a long-term relationship of friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It's not strange for China and Europe to have different views
and values since they have different social systems and they are
in different stages of development, Jiang said, adding that the
two sides could improve mutual understanding through more
exchanges, and they could also seek common ground while preserving
differences to continuously advance bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries Urged not to Compromise with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) - Iranian former president Hashemi
Rafsanjani Friday called on the Arab countries to give up the
"so-called Middle East peace process" and not to make any
compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayer congregations following the
International Qods (Jerusalem) Day rallies, Rafsanjani, who is now
Chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council, said that the talks
with Israel over the past few decades had simply aggravated the
plight of the Palestinian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
If the aspirations of true struggling Palestinians were taken
seriously they would have attained success in their just
struggle, he said, adding that any talk for peace with Israel has
proven to be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Iranians turned out Friday morning throughout the
country to hold anti-Israeli rallies on the occasion of the
International Qods Day set by late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators in Tehran issued a seven-point resolution
at the end of the rallies, voicing Iran's supports for the
Palestinians for their struggles against Israel and condemning
any compromises of Arab countries with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani termed Israel as a racialist state, saying that
the crimes committed by the Israelis in Palestine were much
more than that of the German Nazis headed by Hitler.
</P>
<P>
"Hitler's Nazi forces killed some 200,000 Jews during the
World War II but the Israelis martyred over one million
Palestinians and made several million Palestinians homeless," the
former Iranian president said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the establishment of the Jewish state, Rafsanjani
blast Britain and the United States for their "full supports for
racist Israeli Zionism."
</P>
<P>
However, he stated, the Israeli Zionists will never find
"promised lands" and the Middle East cannot tolerate Israel as
part of the region.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that in the future we will have the Islamic
Palestine, on that day the so-called promised land will not exist
and the wishful expectation of the Israeli government will never
come to reality," Rafsanjani said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment New "Economic Apartheid" for S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The present serious
unemployment in South Africa could still worsen and lead to an
"economic apartheid" for the country, according to a
newly-published study.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's unemployment rate of 20 to 25 percent is among
the top five or six countries in the world, and it is likely to
rise considering the current labor market pattern and economic
growth at around 2 percent, the Star paper today quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment among African women is at a crisis level of
nearly 40 percent, and among 18 to 24-year-old African youth it
is above 40 percent, according to the report entitled "The
Unemployment in South Africa: The Facts, The Prospects and
Exploration of Solutions".
</P>
<P>
Africans account for 78 percent of South Africa's 41 million
population.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the country and among certain population
groups, unemployment becomes a lifelong condition in which the
victims lose all aptitudes and motivations for gainful jobs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for quick improvement is poor, it said, adding
that even with an extremely good economic performance, the
country could barely stabilize the joblessness level at the turn
of the century.
</P>
<P>
This could lead to a "socio-economic apartheid" in which the
employed sector of society progresses while the margin of
unemployed in the whole population rises with the state's
improving ability to provide survival benefits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Calling unemployment one of the biggest problems in
post-apartheid South Africa, it said that the issue "has replaced
race as the major factor in inequality" and become " the greatest
single cause of deep poverty", prompting other socio-economic
ills, including crime.
</P>
<P>
Although the government is trying to solve the problem through
its job creation initiatives, such as liberalizing labor market
and cutting wage and non-wage costs relative to output, it could
not successfully implement them due to bureaucratic opposition to
fiscal discipline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It called for a concerted private-public effort in creating
jobs in the informal sector.

<HEADLINE> HK to Turn Crisis Into Opportunity: Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is able to
transform the current Asian economic crisis into a good
opportunity for its economic development, a senior trade official
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Chinese
Enterprises Association, Stanley Ying, deputy director-general of
the SAR Trade Department, pointed out that for many times in the
past Hong Kong had transformed crises into opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Ying attributed the transformation to the ability of Hong
Kong's enterprises to adjust themselves to the changing situation
and the free trade policy adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's competitiveness may not necessarily be weakened by
the devaluation of other Asian countries' currencies because
nowadays competitiveness relies not only on prices but also on
quality and service.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's enterprises enjoy good reputation for the quality
of their products and services they offer, Ying said in his
address titled Opportunities and Challenges for Hong Kong's Trade
Prospect.
</P>
<P>
Those countries whose currencies have devaluated in the
financial turmoil also have problems such as increased raw
material prices and production cost, which have an adverse effect
on their competitiveness, Ying noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic instability caused by the currency devaluation in
these countries made overseas buyers worry whether companies in
these countries have the ability to fulfill their contracts, Ying
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will benefit from the globalization of world economy
because it remains a separate customs territory and is a full
member of the World Trade Organization after it returned to China
on July 1, Ying said.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of the world telecommunications, information
technology and monetary markets will offer opportunities to Hong
Kong's service sectors, which account for 85 percent to Hong
Kong's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also enjoys its geographical advantage as a window of
China's mainland, which has rich resources and is a big market,
Ying said. No other Asian countries can match Hong Kong in this
regard, he added.

<HEADLINE> German Inflation Expected to Ease in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's annual inflation rate in
January is expected to drop due to drastically lower oil and
petrol costs, down to between 1.0 and 1.3 percent, according to
data from four key German states released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The projected inflation rate is compared to December's 1.6 to
1.7 percent in the four states of North-Rhine Westfalia, Hessen,
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, which comprise the bulk of
Germany's population and economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The prices for oil in the four states were reported to be up to
20 percent lower than in January 1997, while petrol and diesel
fuel also cost less.

<HEADLINE> China Starts National Project in Business Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China has initiated a national
project to train more enterprise management personnel to learn
modern business administration expertise and improve the general
management standard in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by the State Economic and Trade
Commission and the organizing committee of a nationwide economic
efficiency investigation, has won the attention and support
of senior Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has wished the project a success. He
said: "Management science is the fundamental way to improve an
enterprise's efficiency, and qualified management personnel are an
important guarantee for carrying out modern enterprise management,
the execution of a management training project is a task of top
priority."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the organizing committee of the nationwide
economic efficiency investigation, Vice Premier Li Lanqing called
the project an important measure in implementing the policy of
invigorating the nation through science and education, and
promoting the improvement of the overall quality and efficiency of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
When China is introducing the market economic system and the
market competition is getting more acute daily, Li pointed out,
the improvement of economic efficiency increasingly relies on the
improvement of people's quality and competence, especially that of
management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Li, Vice Premier Wu Bangguo said that scientific
management is an important factor for an enterprise's existence
and development under a market economy.
</P>
<P>
There are now 108,000 people attending business administration
courses across China. The current project will last from the
beginning of 1998 to the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Economic and Trade Relations Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
expressed the hope during a meeting with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine here today that bilateral trade between China and
France would maintain its growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, in 1997 bilateral trade with France increased
more than the average growth rate of trade between China and the
European Union as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China regards France as an important and cooperative partner,
Li said. The considerable achievements in bilateral economic and
trade cooperation include the signing of a series of important
contacts in recent years which signal bright prospects for future
coordination, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Sino-French relations have maintained sound
development momentum as both sides have cooperated in various
fields and produced considerable results in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Li told Vedrine about China's policy to actively absorb foreign
investment, and expressed the hope that more French entrepreneurs
would invest in China.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the French delegation on a series of measures
taken by China to stabilize and stimulate its economy in the face
of the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said the purpose of his visit is to put into practice
the determination expressed by the two heads of state last May to
establish a comprehensive partnership.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China, as an important partner of France, is
playing an increasingly important role, and that France is ready
to expand its cooperation with China in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived in Beijing Thursday on an official two-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Melts Spindles to Cut Textile Overproduction  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China today took an extreme
measure to cut its excessive textile production capacity by
melting down 120,000 spindles.
</P>
<P>
At 10:50 this morning and following an official order, a huge
iron hammer fell down on a pile of dismantled spinning frames on
the ground of Shanghai Pudong Iron and Steel (Group) Company,
marking the start of China's serious effort to cut its large
amount of redundant spindles.
</P>
<P>
The smashed frames were then melted in a smelting furnace. The
spindles which were melted today were manufactured before 1979,
accounted for 17.65 percent of the total the country's largest
industrial city planned to reduce this year.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that China has been forced to take such extreme
measures mainly because its textile industry has been plagued by
financial difficulties arising from repetitive construction and
excessively redundant production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Currently China has 46 million spindles, a number that is 10
million more than necessary.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has sought to solve the problem of
excessive production capacity by moving some of its spindles to
the less developed areas in the west.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts, though effective in the short run, have failed to
fundamentally solve the problem of overall imbalance in textile
production.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese State Council, or the cabinet, has selected the
textile industry as an area in which a breakthrough should be
achieved in its campaign to reform the state-owned sector and
reduce losses. The government has decided to cut production
capacity to increase efficiency.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Promote Freedom of Religious Belief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese official Li
Ruihuan has called on government departments and the religious
circles to conscientiously carry out the Party's policy to
guarantee citizens' freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, made the remark while meeting
with religious leaders here today.
</P>
<P>
"The policy has been proved correct by practice. It is a
fundamental and long-term policy instead of an expedient measure,"
said Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau Standing
Committee of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the principle of maintaining the sanctity of
the laws, safeguarding the interests of the people, and
guaranteeing the unity of all the ethnic groups and the
unification of the motherland, put forth on a meeting for the
search of the reincarnated soul boy of the tenth Bainqen Lama, is
in harmony with the policy of the freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Li extended New Year's greetings to all the
patriotic religious figures and followers across China on behalf
of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and
expressed his appreciation for their contribution to maintaining
social stability, and promoting national unity, economic and
social development over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Many religious doctrines such as those concerning ethics and
morals, he pointed out, are consistent with the trends of social
development and the promotion of cultural and ethical progress in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also urged religious organizations to attach more
importance to the training of their young practitioners to ensure
that the fine tradition of loving the country and religion is
carried forward.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the State Council and the CPPCC National
Committee, and leaders of China's Buddhist, Protestant, Catholic,
Islamic and Taoist associations attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
The State Council has decided to reduce the country's number of
spindles by 10 million and reduce its number of textile workers by
1.2 million in three years. China this year plans to scrap 4.8
million spindles and displace 600,000 textile workers.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, a special team led by Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren has
been formed to oversee the work to reduce redundant spindles and
workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Shanghai will retain just 910,000 spindles by
the end of this year, about 36 percent of the all-time high
figure, while reducing its textile workers to 271,600, half of the
historical peak number.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will extensively restructure its textile industry into
12 state-owned textile enterprises to pursue economies of scale,
according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He added that Shanghai will also attach greater importance to
science and technology in rejuvenating its textile industry, which
is expected to generate 400 million yuan in profits this year, up
from 300 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai axed its textile industry payroll by 270,000
workers while maintaining its textile output value at roughly the
same as that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the textile sector accounted for 10 percent of the
losses suffered by all of China's state-owned enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Airport
Railway has reached another significant milestone with the arrival
of the first Airport Express train at Tsing Yi Station in Hong
Kong on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The train traveled all the way from Siu Ho Wan Depot, via the
Lantau Link, to Tsing Yi Station, to celebrate the commencement

project director of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, said at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Railway project is progressing well with all civil
works substantially complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Effort is now focused on the installation of the remaining
electrical and mechanical works as well as the integrated testing
between different systems," Black said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shanghai
municipality, a financial center in the country, witnessed a
balanced capital market in 1997, with dropping inter-banking
loaning volume and brisk intermediary business.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shanghai Fund-Raising Center show that it
dealt with inter-bank loans of 105.883 billion yuan during the
year, down 40.65 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the intermediary business volume of the center
reached 12.63 billion yuan, four times that of the previous year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, have issued a series of regulations to guard against risks
in the capital market. Financial organs have also strengthened
their internal funding management. Both the efforts have helped
restrain the abnormal need for funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the ceiling Chibor (China inter-bank offering rate)
stood at 12.96 percent with the bottom line at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks with Chinese approval to run Renminbi business
borrowed 638 million yuan and lent 104 million yuan during the
year on the secondary market.

<HEADLINE> UN Peacekeepers to Supervise Disarmament in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic sources in
Freetown said today that the United Nations has earmarked up to
1,600 peace-keepers to supervise the disarmament program in the
west African state of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to one diplomat, the peacekeepers "will supervise
the exercise when it gets underway early February."
</P>
<P>
However, observers said: "A sticking point still remains the
disarmament of the Sierra Leonean army which the military junta
has reportedly rejected, claiming that it was never a warring
faction in the six-year long rebel war."
</P>
<P>
"The junta has also demanded the release of rebel leader Foday
Sankoh from Nigeria and called for the end of the dominant role
of Nigerian forces in the west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG," the observers added.
</P>
<P>
A junta spokesman said that these issues need to be
resolved for the disarmament program to be devoid of friction and
undertaken peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot see ourselves disarmed by the Nigerians who were
combatants in the civil strife. We can only be disarmed on the
release of Corporal Foday Sankoh who gave us the guns, " said the
number three man in the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Eldred
Collins who is now Minister of Works, Energy and Power in the
junta cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is not
trork," he noted.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG information officers said 15,000 troops will be
deployed in Sierra Leone for the exercise. Majority of the troops
will be Nigerians who are being drafted to Sierra Leone from
Liberia as the organization winds up its military presence in
neighboring Liberia by February 2.

JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Foreign Ministry
is planning to streamline its embassies abroad, gradually reducing
the size of the diplomatic corps in the face of the current
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We will streamline the organization. Fewer officials will be
sent abroad," Abdul Irsan, the ministry's secretary general said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 1,100 diplomats posted in embassies and missions
around the world and in the next three to four years, the number
will be cut to 400, Irsan said.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency, diplomats will need a wider range of

</P>
<P>
Irsan noted that future Indonesian diplomats should master all
aspects of diplomatic affairs, including political, economic,
social and cultural.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy has been badly hit by the current monetary
crisis in the region. The country's currency, the rupiah, has

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today said that China and France
should strengthen cooperation, keep long-term relations, push the
multi-polarization process forward, and promote peace, stability
and prosperity in the world.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who
is here on a two-day official visit, Qian said the Chinese believe
that China and France both have great responsibilities in
international affairs, and that they share many common views on
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
He praised the development of bilateral relations over the past
few years, and singled out the joint statement during President
Jacques Chirac's visit to China last May to establish an overall
partnership for the 21st century. This is significant for
bilateral relations, he said, and has a positive influence in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Qian went on to say that Sino-US, Sino-Russian and
Sino-Japanese relations have all seen progress recently, and he
hopes that Sino-European relations will have great achievements
this new year.
</P>
<P>
France plays an important role in European and international
affairs, Qian said, and China has always paid a great deal of
attention to its relations with France. Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's coming visit to China is a great event in bilateral
relations, he went on to say, and the Chinese are willing to join
hands to make preparations for a successful visit.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said he wanted to reiterate that the French government
will push for the growth of bilateral relations within the

<HEADLINE> Amazon Tropical Forest Tragedy Not to Recur in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Yongqing and Hu Xin
</P>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- People may never forget the
tragedy resulted from the denudation of the Amazon forests in
South America during the 1980s, but Chinese specialists say such
tragedy will not recur in China.
</P>
<P>
In a period of only ten years, the vigorous Amazon forests
decreased by ten percent. The following scenario was soil erosion,
climatical deterioration and extinction of some species like
the once vivacious Amazon monkeys.
</P>
<P>
In a recent international symposium in south China's Hainan
Province, Chinese forest experts were convinced that tropical
forests in Hainan are well protected and utilized.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the Chinese government has paid
increasing attention to environmental protection, replacing the
logging-oriented operation of forestry departments with
diversified management.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China banned the cutting of tropical forests which
in turn began to undergo differentiated forest management. On one
hand, commercial timber are turned out in the way of grain
production, and on the other hand, tropical woods which were
felled are given the opportunity to prosper again.
</P>
<P>
"Although China has a small number of tropical forests, our
practice will provide new experience for the sustainable
development of tropical forests around the world," forest expert
Hong Jusheng said.

<HEADLINE> 51,000 Inland Children Born to Permanent Hong Kong Residents Move to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 51,000 children born
on the mainland to permanent Hong Kong residents had gone to Hong
Kong to live by the end of last year, according to China's Public
Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
There are still some 24,000 children that meet the residence
requirements of Hong Kong who are still waiting, and thousands
more are applying.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, public security departments and their Hong Kong
counterparts have been cooperating in this matter. According to
Article 24 of the Basic Law, the children have the right to settle
in Hong Kong and parents can apply to immigration offices if they
can prove that they are permanent Hong Kong residents, and the
application is approved by the Hong Kong immigration department.
</P>
<P>
Because of Hong Kong's high population density, it can not
accommodate a large number of immigrants, and public security
departments on the mainland have set a daily quota for children
wanting to move to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jianmin, an official in charge of the Public Security
Ministry's Hong Kong and Macao immigration affairs, says
immigration departments in inland areas have strict measures for
dealing with mainland residents' requests to go to Hong Kong,
whether for residence or tourism or any other purpose.
</P>
<P>
Applications for settling in Hong Kong are processed in turn,
based on a point system, Zhu said, adding that any illegal
entrance into Hong Kong will be seriously punished.

<P>
Freezailan, acting chairman of the International Tropical
Timber Organization, said that the Chinese wisdom contributes to
resolving the world's puzzle of sustainable development of
tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
Along with global economic expansion, there is mounting demand
for timber. However, the excessive cutting of tropical forests has
become severe in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation conducted by the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, 170,000 sq
km of tropical forests on the Earth disappeared each year in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
The world's total area of tropical forests disappeared in ten
weeks equals to the territory of the Netherlands. In a year,
tropical forests in an area as large as Britain are lost.
</P>
<P>
"As to populous China with less arable land, the contradiction
between economic growth and tropical forest protection is even
more outstanding," said Hong Jusheng.
</P>
<P>
"But we think that the contradiction can be addressed with the
application of technology and scientific management," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's tropical land covers 264,900 sq km which accounts for
2.8 percent of the country's territory, located in Hainan,
Guangdong, Yunnan and Taiwan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region. In this sense, tropical forests are precious
for China.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong, high-quality and fast-growing trees are
cultivated in areas fit for commercial returns, natural tropical
forests are well protected, and large multi-functional forest
areas integrating timber production and ecological preservation
will be established.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister Discusses China's World Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said here today that he highly values
China's important role in safeguarding peace and stability in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In his report to a seminar sponsored by a forum on the reform
and opening-up of China, Vedrine said that China has implemented
the agreement on border issues which it signed with Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan and Tadzhikistan in 1996 by reducing its
troops stationed along the border.
</P>
<P>
This move has enhanced the mutual trust between China and
Russia and countries in central Asia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, through its economic cooperation with central Asian
nations, China has helped to strengthen security in the region,
Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy of consolidating trust between China and
India has improved bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon French-Chinese relations, Vedrine said that
during the French president's China visit last year, the two
countries signed a document on the establishment of an all-around
cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the document has become the new foundation for
the advancement of bilateral ties because it not only helps to
improve two-way trade between the two countries, but also
expresses their common views on various fields.
</P>
<P>
Only by establishing such a partnership can a flexible and
close relationship be set up between various countries and
regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also spoke highly of China's economy,
which enjoys stable development despite the current financial
turbulence in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that France supports China's efforts to become a member
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) because China's membership
would be beneficial both to itself and members of the
organization.

"The demonstration program, which we carried out with concerted
efforts of the International Tropical Timber Organization, has
shown that timber production in one-tenth of local forest lands
was able to exceed the current amount," Hong said, adding that
many natural woods are saved consequently.
</P>
<P>
Diversified management, which makes it possible to achieve
sustainable development of forestry, has been taken as an official
policy to boost forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
Hainan plans to cultivate 780,000 ha of ecological forest. In
addition, the province is considering man-made woods to produce
paper pulp with the introduction of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
In Guangdong Province, more than 30 percent of its forest lands
will be regarded as ecological woods.
</P>
<P>
Hong Jusheng noted that in the entire world, residents living
close forests have been the greatest menace. Developed countries
can give the residents subsidies or relocate them, but developing
countries can not afford copying that method.
</P>
<P>
"We managed to guide local residents in diversified management
to raise their income, so that they can lead a better life without
illegal logging," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
In many forest areas of Hainan, local people, who used to be
loggers, have been taught to grow sweet potato, corn and sugar
cane and breed pigs, cattle and fish. And they use methane for
lighting and cooking.

<HEADLINE> HK's Future Full of Hope: Jiang Enzhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, has said that he is fully
confident in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "Bauhinia Monthly" to be published in
February, Jiang extended his festival greetings to the Hong Kong
residents at a time when the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year,
which falls on January 28, is coming.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the six million Hong Kong
residents, under the leadership of the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa and with the support of the motherland, are bound to
overcome any difficulties and score new and brilliant
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the progress that the Hong Kong SAR has made over the
 past half year since its founding, Jiang said that the operation
of the SAR has won a full recognition from the central government
and a wide praise from local people and the international community
as well.
</P>
<P>
Half year's practice in the SAR shows that the state's basic
policy of "one country, two systems", "the Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy is incomparably
correct.
</P>
<P>
The fact also shows that the Hong Kong residents mostly
composed of the Chinese are completely able to govern Hong Kong
well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current problems that have cropped up due to
the affection by the financial turmoil in Southeastern Asia since
last July, Jiang said it is understandable that some residents
are worried about current temporary difficulties in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that no country or region can make its
economy rise at a straight line, adding that economic
fluctuation is frequent at some time.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the new year is confronted with new challenges and
opportunities as well.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the people throughout the world have started
countdown to greet the coming new century, he said: "we have the
reasons to be confident in Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
This is because Hong Kong which is empowered to carry out a
high-degree of autonomy in accordance with the principle of "one
country, two systems", has sound economic and legal systems,
a reasonable economic structure, strict financial supervisory
systems and rich foreign exchange reserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also has the sufficient ability to resist the financial
crisis and its six million people are hard working, bold in making
innovations and good at adapting their thinking to the
every-changing situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said the sustained, rapid and healthy economic
growth in China's inland areas gives a powerful support for Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said sharing weal and woe with the Hong Kong people for
more than half a century, the Xinhua News Agency has kept close
contacts with all sectors of the Hong Kong society.
</P>
<P>
It has done much work to link the ties between Hong Kong and
the inland areas, widely solicit opinions and suggestions of the
people from various walks of life, safeguard interests of the Hong
 Kong compatriots and promote the smooth return of Hong Kong to
the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a working body authorized by the Central People's
Government, he said: "The Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch will
firmly implement the central government's instructions and
earnestly perform our own duties and obligations, support the
SAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic
Law."
</P>
<P>
"It will never interfere in SAR's own affairs," he stressed.

people think that the term Gaullism, which refers to the movement
created by General Charles de Gaulle, is out of time and no longer
fits any particular political group in France, said a poll
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted through telephone by the SOFRES polling
institute for the Figaro magazine from January 9 to 10 among 1,000
people above the age of 18 and representing all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Only 21 percent said that they belong to the Gaullist movement,
while 15 percent said they don't and the rest of them think the
term Gaullism is "an outdated classification," according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll was made on the eve of a conference to be held by the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) from January 31 to February
1 in Paris, during which the RPR chairman Philippe Sequin will
present a new party statute for adoption.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that 41 percent of those polled think the RPR
still represents "the heritage of General de Gaulle," while 51
percent said that the ideas of the former French president can be
found in all big political parties of France today.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent think that President Jacques Chirac is the
person who is closest to the ideas of de Gaulle, as compared with
25 percent who recognize Seguin as the inheritor of Gaullism.

<HEADLINE> Selfishness Begets Conflict, Says Woman Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Shang Xuqian &AMP; Zhang Dacheng)
</P>
<P>
ARUSHA, TANZANIA, January 23 (Xinhua)-- "Political selfishness
plus economic backwardness is conflict," that is the simple
formula of former UN Assistant Secretary-General, Getrude
Mongella.
</P>
<P>
Mongella, better known as "Mama Beijing" as she was
Secretary-General of the Fourth International Conference on Women
held in Beijing in September 1994, is now in Arusha for a
three-day international seminar on African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"There are many reasons (for conflicts in Africa), political
and economic ),... selfishness of those who are in power and who
want to get power."
</P>
<P>
Another major reason for conflicts, she said, is poverty and
backwardness.
</P>
<P>
Selfishness of political figures and economic backwardness
would lead to conflicts, she concluded.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the means to resolve conflicts, she replied that
the best way is to prevent conflicts from taking place.
</P>
<P>
Mongella, a Tanzanian, denied that there is a culture of
violence in Africa. Instead, she said, there are traditions of
reconciliation and negotiation.
</P>
<P>
But the good traditions disappeared after Western colonialists
invaded the continent, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Key to prevent conflict, she said, is education.
</P>
<P>
People should be taught to respect other people's rights and
dignity and care for other people's needs.
</P>
<P>
She called for cooperation between African countries and the
outside world to develop the economy of the continent.
</P>
<P>
She said that women should play a special role in conflict
resolution and prevention in view of the fact that in Africa,
women could belong to a different clan after she is married, thus
serving as a bridge between clans.
</P>
<P>
She said that women, who are usually victims of war
atrocities, had to act as the major force in reconstruction after
the war since men were killed in it.
</P>
<P>
African women are contributing much to the reconstruction of
war-torn areas in Africa, said Mongella.
</P>
<P>
She called for the empowerment of women through education.

<HEADLINE> 25 Incidents of Violence Reported in North S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 incidents of
election-related violence had been reported during a poll campaign
in the north of Sri Lanka, an independent and non-partisan
organization based in Colombo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said 25
incidents had been reported since December 19 last year in the
campaign for the local government elections in the Jaffna and
Kilinochchi districts.
</P>
<P>
Of the incidents, 19 had been reported to the police and two to
the Army, while the rest to the CMEV office in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil parties contesting the polls have accused each other
of carrying weapons, assaulting, threatening or intimidating
campaigners. There were also three attempted murders, the CMEV
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commissioner's Office, which is in charge of the
polls, the political parties and the security forces in the north
had been "extremely cooperative" with their monitoring work, and
they had met no problems, the CMEV said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general feeling that the election is not the most
important thing in the lives of the people at the moment," one of
the CMEV members said. He had just returned from a trip to Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
People in Jaffna care much more about transport, electricity
and other things than the polls, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some other people believe the elections at least can
serve as the beginning of a process to restore normalcy and this
process is essential to them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections in the north, the first in more
than a decade, will be conducted on January 29. Political parties
and independent groups are campaigning vigorously in the north to
win supporters.
</P>
<P>
The Army and police forces have tightened security in the
regions to prevent any possible sabotage against the polls.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Revises 1998-99 Budget Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia Friday revised the
state budget draft for the fiscal year 1998-99 from 133.491
trillion rupiah to 147.22 trillion rupiah, making an increase of
45.6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the revised budget draft to the House of People's
Representatives here, Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said the
changes were based on the recent talks between the Indonesian
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Under the revised draft budget, the rupiah (national currency)
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was adjusted from 4,000 per
dollar to 5,000 per dollar, economic growth was set at zero,
inflation rate at 20 percent, oil price at 17 dollars per barrel,
oil production at 1.52 million barrels per day, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that nominally, the increase in the revised draft
budget was due to the adjustment of the rupiah-dollar exchange
rate, affecting revenues and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said domestic revenues, previously projected at 107.687
trillion rupiah, now stands at 114.965 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Oil/gas revenues were raised from 27.286 trillion rupiah in the
original draft to 34.581 trillion rupiah while non-oil/gas
revenues were reduced from 80.401 trillion rupiah in the original
draft to 80.384 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The minister also explained to the House that his ministry has
been aiming to present a revised draft budget that is both
balanced and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have also revised the state expenditure," he added.
</P>
<P>
Routing expenditures, previously projected at 92.384 trillion
rupiah, are now envisaged to reach 97.829 trillion rupiah due to
an increase in interest rates and debt servicing from 32.086
trillion rupiah to 39.740 trillion rupiah, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fuel subsides were reduced to 7.453 trillion rupiah from 10.077
trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"The fuel subsides had to be reduced due to plans to increase
domestic fuel prices in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's savings were raised from 15.303
trillion rupiah in the original draft to 17.136 trillion in the
revised draft, also raising the total government savings and
development revenues from 41.107 trillion rupiah to 49.391
trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie also disclosed that there will be a surplus of 2.627
million dollars in the revised draft budget. The surplus will come
from the increase in oil/gas and non-oil/gas exports, he added.

MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Indonesia

of the region from the ongoing financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
which includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,

He told President Fidel Ramos during a visit to the

Philippines may acquire some of its needed military aircraft from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines, Indonesia and the rest of ASEAN will
facilitate the region's economic recovery if we will patronize our
own. It is for our self-interest for the future," he said.

Ramos welcomed Habibie's idea but said that it must be
discussed thoroughly by concerned officials from both sides.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Mayor Jia Qinglin,
speaking to the recent Eighth Beijing Municipal Congress of the
Communist Party of China, said that service will be a leading
sector in the Chinese capital's economic development, followed by
industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has classified five economic growth areas: hi-tech
industry, the service trade, modernized agriculture, pillar
industries, and residential housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Beijing needs to fully reflect its status as the country's
political and cultural center, Jia said, and rapid economic growth
will provide a material base for improvement for the city as a
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
After ten years of development, the service trade now outweighs
agriculture and industry and has become a major force for economic
growth. Last year, it accounted for 53.8 percent of the city's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will increase service, tourism, finance, insurance,
transport, telecommunications and real estate development to reach
its goal of making the service trade account for 60 percent of the
city's GDP by the end of the century.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stockmarket
rose Friday as a buoyant resources sector surged in late trade
ahead of the long weekend to offset softer banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 23.9 points higher at 2,623.3
with the continuing fall in National Australia Bank (NAB) shares
capturing most attention.
</P>
<P>
"NAB dragged down the market this morning," Steve Mayne from
Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"Resources are very strong and led the market higher and I
think there was some kind of futures play Friday because the
market really took off this afternoon. It all happened in the last
hour," he said.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was only tepid in the morning but closed at a
strong 304.03 million shares at a value of 679.8 million US
dollars with falls near rises at 525 to 527 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 24.9 points higher at 4,503.9
with banking stocks weaker. The banking index was down 66.1
points, or 11.2 percent to 5,451.2.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank shares fell 56 cents to 20.19
Australian dollars following Thursday's worse than expected
December quarter results and Friday's news of the departure of the
company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
NAB's weakness spread to other banks, with ANZ and Westpac
banks dropping ten cents to 9.70 Australian dollars and 10.07
Australian dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank bucked the trend to add two cents to 18.52
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index jumped 25.4 points to 1,122.0, with
major stocks strong on steadier and better commodities prices.

<P>
Resource giant BHP jumped 42 cents to 14.07 Australian dollars
and global miner Rio Tinto leapt 55 cents to 19.50 Australian
dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases Final Results of State Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria released the final results of the last
December 6 State House of Assembly election Thursday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced in a statement that the United
Nigeria Congress of People (UNCP) won a total of 637 seats, with
majority seats in 29 states.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria followed with 199 seats and
majority seats in four states.
</P>
<P>
The Congress for National Consensus came third with 61 seats,
and have majority seats in one state.
</P>
<P>
The Grassroots Democratic Movement and the National Center
Party of Nigeria got 50 and 23 seats, respectively. Neither of
them could win majority seats in any state.
</P>
<P>
Last December's State House of Assembly is a major step in the
Nigerian military government's transition to civil rule program,
announced by general Sani Abacha in October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Elections of state governors, national assembly members and
the president are scheduled to take place before August, to pave
the way for the inauguration of a civilian government in October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the transition implementation committee, one of the
top government agencies in charge of the transition program,
announced Thursday night that the much-talked alliance of the
four minor parties against the UNCP is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, justice Mamman Nasir, made the
announcement in Abuja after a meeting between the national
electoral commission of Nigeria, the five political parties and
his committee.
</P>
<P>
"Constitutionally, five political parties have been
registered. The parties are free to meet but they can't afford to
form another association," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the last December 6 election, there have been rising
cries for a coalition of the four minor parties in coming
elections against the UNCP, dubbed as a government party by some
people.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Rallies to Support Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Millions of fasting Iranians
Friday poured into city streets throughout the country to mark the
International Qods (Jerusalem) Day, showing their support for the
Palestinian struggles.
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards with pictures of the ancient mosque of
Jerusalem, pictures of Iranian leaders as well as anti-Israel and
anti-U.S. slogans, the people in Tehran marched from six main
avenues to Tehran University, where the Friday prayer congregation
was held.
</P>
<P>
Shouting "Death with the U.S.," "Death with Israel," "We will
liberate Jerusalem," some demonstrators burned Israeli flags in
front the Tehran University, although Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said last month that he and the leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei was against such kind actions.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the people marched quietly along the streets
and it is said that the rallies were held in a much milder way
compared with that of previous years.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the rallies in Tehran, a seven-point resolution
was read, announcing Iran's supports for the Palestinians
for their struggles against Israel and condemning any compromises
of Arab countries with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators announced to support the recent speech of
the leader Khamenei rejecting any talks and ties with the United
States, voicing their readiness to continue their combat against
the world arrogance headed by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also condemned the massacres of innocent people
in Algeria, callinup and put an end to the massacres in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini announced the last Friday of the Islamic holy fasting
month of Ramadhan as the International Qods Day in order to call
for international support for the Palestinians to "liberate"
Jerusalem from the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mayor Outlines Economic Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Technology and related industries are essential to the
capital's economy and will be given priority, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Because Beijing has about 100 colleges and national research
institutes, with 1.1 million scholars and scientists, the
municipality gives precedence to hi-tech industries. And, since
its Hi-tech Development and Experiment Zone has been listed as a
technical industrial zone, the municipal government plans to
develop 10 to 15 giant hi-tech groups, each doing at least 5
billion yuan (600 million US dollars) in business annually.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will try to develop hi-tech industries in electronic
information, biotechnology, new medicines and new materials to
make them new pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The capital has an open economy, he said, and over the past
five years has used 9.41 billion US dollars worth of foreign
funds, and 143 of the world's top 500 multinationals have invested
in the city.
</P>
<P>
He says Beijing will expand its service trade to encourage
foreign financial institutions to set up Beijing branches,
introduce foreign retailers, and establish Sino-foreign joint
travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also pay more attention to environmental
protection and tighten pollution controls, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had a good economic growth rate of 9.5 percent and
inflation of 3.8 percent last year, and in the next few years will
try to have GDP growth of 9 percent and inflation below 5 percent,
Jia said. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Promises to Clear Wage Arrears Within Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
promised to repay all wage arrears within the next few days, the
Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his first 1998 radio address, Yeltsin noted that despite the
efforts made by himself and the government last year, "the problem
has not been settled finally".
</P>
<P>
The wage debts have not been settled yet in six regions,
although Moscow allocated money to them on time, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"Large sums got lost in the republics, territories and
regions," Yeltsin continued, criticizing the local leaders for
mishandling the funds.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin urged the government "to find out how this could have
happened and punish those guilty".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that wages are not the only debt the State owes
to its citizens. Not yet everything has been done for the
servicemen and their families. There is a bad state of affairs
concerning the payment of allowances and compensations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Yeltsin had urged the federal and
regional authorities to fully clear wage arrears by January 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, the
government had fulfilled its obligations by transferring 11.3
trillion rubles to the local authorities.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- A former intern of the White House, Monica Lewinsky, affirmed
having a liaison with U.S. President Bill Clinton for one year and a
half. The American press affirmed that Clinton had tried to impose
silence upon the young woman. In the wake of of the hearings on the
Paula Jones affair, this new revelation threatens a procedure of
impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia announced Wednesday the
reinforcement of the policy to arm civilians in self-defense groups
and the creation this year of 100 new brigades of policeman to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- It is thanks to the votes from women that Bill Clinton won
twice the White House. But could he be fallen by women too, as he is
facing ``Womengate'' which could turn into a repetition of the
Watergate which fell Richard Nixon? The American justice has
launched an inquiry into the assumed liaison of the president with a
young intern at the White House.
</P>
<P>
-- Catherine Bruno, the mayor of the southern French city of
Vitrolles from the extreme-right National Front, is playing the game
of ``national preference'' by creating a municipal allocation for
the families with new-born babies in which at least one of the
parents is French and another from the European Union countries.

<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's first "boot camp" for young offenders is to

The Independent:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Lower on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed weaker on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) fell by 9.66 points to end at 1,259.83 points on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the share prices finished lower but above the
day's lows as a modest recovery in the Indonesian rupiah spurred
bargain hunting. The main influence on the market was the movement
of the regional currencies, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the market sentiment was also dampened by
worries over higher interest rates after most banks here raised
their prime lending rates to 7.5 percent over the week.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 277.09 million units, valued
at 619.47 million Singapore dollars (about 351.97 million US
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 234 to 98, while 277
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 81.97 million units. It was followed
by Renong Bhd which had 10.27 million shares traded. Promet was
next with 9.18 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 50 cents to end at 33.9 Singapore dollars.
Venture Warrant9907 increased by 26 cents to close at 3.96
dollars, while Venture was up by 25 cents to finish at 5.25
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Asean Fund was the biggest loser as it
declined by one dollar to close at 6.7 Singapore dollars. Alcom
fell by 67 cents to finish at 33 Singapore cents. The Singapore
Press Holdings (SPH) and SPH Foreign lost 60 cents each to end at
15.7 and 21.6 Singapore dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices at Lowest Level: ACWE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian crisis continued to
cut into market confidence at this week's wool sales, driving
prices to their lowest this season.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator fell 18 cents to close at 655
Australian cents (432 US cents) a clean kilogram after sales in
Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator finished the week at 612
Australian cents (404 US cents) per kg, down 21 cents.
</P>
<P>
"Both indicators are now at their lowest levels for this
season," the Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said in
its weekly review.
</P>
<P>
The AWEX national price indicator slid 20 cents to end at 683
Australian cents (450 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
About 80,395 bales were offered, with a pass-in rate of 24.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
"While the very good wool on offer continues to attract good
competition, overall there is very little confidence in the trade
at the present time."
</P>
<P>
Reports of wool tops originally destined for Asia being
diverted to Europe could signal an adverse effect on new orders in
coming weeks, the Council said.
</P>
<P>
"Like many other Australian exporters of goods and services,
wool buyers do not know how long it will take for the global
economic environment to change, or whether the current market
sentiment will deteriorate further pending this change," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Council said the build up of outstanding letters of credit
from South Korean and Chinese customers, combined with pressure
from Australian banks to cut back on credit lines, was severely
impacting the working capital base of many exporters.
</P>
<P>
About 59,300 bales are rostered for sale next week in Sydney
and Adelaide.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Commodity Market Expects First Quarter Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The commodity market in
Shanghai, China's largest commercial center, is expected to
witness continued steady increases in the first quarter of this
year, according to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The municipality's retail sales for the first three months are
expected to hit 36.8 billion yuan (4.43 billion U.S. dollars), up
9.8 percent on the 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the optimistic outlook for a surging market
to last year's 7.1 percent rise in the city's average income and
interest rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise reform has proceeded smoothly in Shanghai and the
privatization process for small sales outlets during 1997 also
injected great vitality into the market.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 State-owned enterprises have introduced shareholding
systems, with employees in more than 60 commercial enterprises
purchasing related shares.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the New Year holiday and the Spring Festival
during the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year (which falls on
January 28) have been stimulating consumption throughout the 30
day period. Various sales promotion is well underway in the city.

FUZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight state-owned
industrial companies were reorganized as company groups through
mergers and acquisitions in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian
Province, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The companies manufacture color TVs, computers, monitors, and
machinery products, and produce potassium chlorate, cloth, and
silk, which sell well on domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the city totalled 23.4 billion yuan (2.92

1996 figure and it now has 367 specialized markets for farm and
sideline products, such as grain, vegetables, fruit, aquatic
products, poultry and tea.
</P>
<P>
The city has also built the largest real estate market in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Its booming export-oriented economy is also bringing big
changes to Fuzhou. A total of 2,400 overseas-funded enterprises
have become operational so far and 420 overseas-funded projects
were approved in 1997, involving 1.15 billion U.S. dollars in
overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Auto Industry Facing Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's auto industry
is on the horns of a dilemma due to the prevailing economic and
financial problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysia's currency and stock market collapsed in the
regional financial turmoil since last July, the total industry
volume for the car sector is expected to plunge by 60 percent in
1998 if the current economic situation in the country persists.
</P>
<P>
As the Malaysian Motor Traders Association (MMTA) predicted,
motor vehicle sales in the country for 1998 are forecast to drop
to only 160,000 units from 404,837 in 1997 due mainly to a credit
squeeze following the currency and economic crises.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the credit squeeze introduced by the government is
lifted and the market improves, the motor industry will be
severely hit this year," MMTA chairman Aishah Ahmad said Thursday
while releasing the statistics of the industry for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This downturn is really very, very sudden and people in the
motor industry are in a state of shock," she said.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated decline in demand for vehicles in the current
year was attributed to the following factors:
</P>
<P>
-- The continued weakening of the local currency unit -- the
ringgit which has depreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 45
percent and the fall of stock market which has resulted in a sharp
capitalization drop, affecting the purchase power, since last
July;
</P>
<P>
-- The difficulty in obtaining vehicle finance due to a
reduction in credit growth from 25 percent in 1997 to 15 percent
in 1998 and due to the credit squeeze imposed by the government on
non-productive sectors;
</P>
<P>
-- Higher hire-purchase interest rate which shot up from 6.5
percent last July to 10 percent now; and
</P>
<P>
-- The substantially higher duties for bigger capacity
passenger cars, vans and four-wheel drive (4X4) vehicles announced
in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a 60 percent plunge in auto sales expected this
year, the industry wants an urgent meeting with Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim to avert further
losses.
</P>
<P>
The MMTA president disclosed Thursday that a letter was sent to
Anwar last month seeking a meeting to brief him "on the dilemma we
are facing".
</P>
<P>
"It was a great shock to the industry as everything suddenly
came to a standstill," Aishah said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the anticipated decline in demand, most of the
country's 13 car assembly plants have decided to shut down for
three weeks during the Chinese New Year and Lesser Bairam (the
Festival of Fast-breaking) holidays beginning at the end of this
month to reduce the cost.
</P>
<P>
Some plants are also considering closing down some of their
assembly lines from March or April. Cutting the operation period
to only four days a week is also being considered by some others
as part of their cost-cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all 28 MMTA members were reported to gradually
increase the prices of vehicles effective in the second half of
this year to cover some losses due to the increasing cost and the
higher duties imposed in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
MMTA said the retrenchment of employees would be the last
resort, but the first stage is to send back foreign workers at the
plants, each of which employs between 200 and 300, as some
production lines are not operating at all.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the past year however was a good year for the
industry except for the last two months of the year when the
impact of the 1998 budget, the continued weakening of the ringgit,
the depressed stock market and the credit squeeze took effect.
</P>
<P>
The MMTA statistics released Thursday show that the local
automotive industry ended the year of 1997 with a growth of 11
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car sales totaled 307,907 units last year or 76
percent of the total motor vehicle market compared with 75.6
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
National cars (Proton and Perodua) recorded very high sales of
255,061 units or 82.8 percent of passenger cars last year from
80.9 percent in 1996. Non-national passenger car sales recorded
52,846 units last year with a market share of 17.2 percent against
19.1 percent market share in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For commercial vehicles, sales totaled 70,334 units or 17.4
percent share of the total motor vehicle market last year, up 1.3
percent from 1996. Perodua Rusa, the national van, captured 14.9
percent of the market share with 10,476 units sold, from 7,240
units in 1996 with a market share of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of 4X4 vehicles increased 34.8 percent to 26,596 units in
1997 from 19,729 units in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Sell Some Superior Aged Imperial Liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A small amount of liquor that
has been aging for more than 150 years will be sold to the public,
China Youth Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The liquor was discovered in cellars at a construction site of
the Lingchuan Brewery in Jinzhou in northeast China's Liaoning
Province in 1996.
</P>
<P>
About four tons of the drink were found in four huge wooden
barrels bearing inscriptions in Chinese and Manchu, saying they
were sealed in the 25th year of the Daoguang Emperor during the
Qing Dynasty, or in A.D. 1845.
</P>
<P>
They also bear the seal of Tongshengjin, an imperial brewery,
which was founded in 1801 and produced liquor for the emperor. The
China National Food Industry Association and Liaoning
Archaeological Research Institute say that the liquor is the
oldest in China.
</P>
<P>
After remaining in casks for such a long time, it has a unique
flavor, and after being tested by a government department, was
declared to be in line with the state standards.
</P>
<P>
The money from the sale will be used for further study
of this precious heritage, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Dismisses Zimbabwe's Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the European
Union has dismissed reports that the two organizations had been
given written undertakings endorsed by Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe that the Zimbabwean government has abandoned the
planned acquisition of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Acting Head of the European Commission delegation in Zimbabwe
J.C. Laerke said yesterday the agreement with the Zimbabwean
government had not changed, The Herald reported today..
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, the Zimbabwean government assured the
commission that implementation of land reforms would not
jeopardize the budget deficit target of 8.2 percent of the gross
domestic product for the 1997/98 budget.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that the implementation plan would aim to
avoid negative repercussions on agricultural production and on
the welfare of the workers employed on the farms to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the whole process would be conducted in a
transparent way, fully compatible with the rule of law and the
constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know where the reports from the South African press
are coming from. There is no truth in them and people should not
listen to them. What we agreed on with the government of Zimbabwe
still stands," he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the World Bank office in Harare also dismissed
the reports, saying he was surprised that after talking to some
of the correspondents for the South African media and having made
the World Bank position very clear, they wrote completely false
things.
</P>
<P>
"Our earlier position on the issue has never changed. We
reiterate that the Zimbabwean government has confirmed to the
bank that the land reform program will be implemented on a
timetable and scale consistent with its administrative and
financial capacity to acquire and resettle land successfully," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that their position on this and other aspects
relating to the land issue has not changed.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe Monday reiterated that the government would go ahead in
acquiring the farms and there would be no going back on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently released a list of 1,480
commercial farms for compulsory acquisition and decided to
redistribute these farms to landless families in its efforts to
accelerate the land resettlement program.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes EU for Inciting Kurdish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said that the European Union (EU) is adopting a wrong policy
which could lead to an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local newspaper Daily News,
which was published Friday, Cem stressed that the EU policy
concerning the Kurdish issue will not help stabilize situation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"In my point of view, the EU is taking a very unsophisticated
and incorrect step which could upset the balances in the Middle
East," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that what the European body is
doing is trying to provoke separatism on the grounds of racial
differences between Turks and Kurds, an ethnic nationality in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU has always accused the Turkish government of taking
a discriminative attitude toward the Kurds, who mostly live in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It also attributed the recent illegal immigration of Kurds to
Italy to Turkey's internal policy over the Kurdish issue,
demanding Turkey take emergency steps to stop the exodus.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charges, Cem noted that the terrorist activities
from the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is a major
factor leading to the deterioration of situation in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Since an authority vacuum was imposed in northern Iraq,
the terrorist organizations easily established themselves there and
got the opportunity to strike Turkey from their bases there, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which has been fighting the Turkish government for
autonomy since 1984, had reportedly built many camps in
northern Iraq since the 1990 Gulf War, launching hit-and-run
attacks on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that some Europeans are now trying to divide
Turkish citizens into Kurds and non-Kurds so as to serve their
own political interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous game. I hope that Western Europe's
more prudent circles will carry out more cautious policies," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the EU summit in Luxembourg excluded Turkey
from the present stage of EU enlargement process due to a
number of differences with the Muslim country, one of which is
the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has repeatedly rejected the EU criticism regarding this
issue, saying that its military operation in southeastern region
and northern Iraq aims to wipe out the terrorist threats
against the state security.

<HEADLINE> Most of World's 500 Major Multinationals Come to Invest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred of the world's
500 major multinationals have invested in China, according to
Zhang Xiaoqiang, a foreign investment division chief of the State
Planning Commission, who spoke at a foreign investment policy
meeting today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rapid economic growth, improved investment
environment, market potential, and business opportunities in China
are the main reasons overseas investors are interested in China.
</P>
<P>
China had drawn a direct investment of 45.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, an increase of 8.5 percent over 1996, and it
has ranked first among all developing countries in use of foreign
investment for five years in a row, he said. The country has at
least 300,000 overseas-financed enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As the number of multinationals in China increases, the use of
overseas funds improves, and there has been an increase of
projects involving 10 million U.S. dollars each and increased
overseas investment in agriculture, energy, and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China signed a joint finance agreement with the US's
General Motors on an automobile project in Shanghai involving 1.5
billion U.S. dollars. It also signed a contract with Japan's NEC
for a large integrated circuit project in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Laibin Power Plant in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
the first Sino-foreign power is a BOT (build, operate, transfer)
project that began construction work last September.
</P>
<P>
The first Sino-foreign chain store has opened for business in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China will continue to expand the use of overseas
funds and will improve the investment environment to attract
more. A list of possible areas for overseas investment was
released on January 1, and the removal of ceilings on mechanical
and electronic product imports will increase the flow of overseas
funds, he says.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was sponsored by the China Economic Herald,
which is published by the State Planning Commission, and Nokia
(China) Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Describes Republic as "Potent Cocktail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday described a republic with an elected president in
Australia as a "potent cocktail for political instability."
</P>
<P>
During an address in Melbourne to mark the Australia Day, which
falls on next Monday (January 26), Howard repeated he was not a
republican.
</P>
<P>
He said the only argument he recognized in favor of a republic
was that it was an anachronism for Australia to share its head of
state with a number of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, it is the symbolism of the present system
rather than the system itself which should be discarded," he was
quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in next month, who
were appointed by the Australian government or elected last year,
are expected to make a proposal whether Australia should become a
republic and how a head of state will be elected.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he thought no president could match the political
neutrality of a governor-general, but the worst possible scenario
would be one elected by a popular vote.
</P>
<P>
Since it would be impossible to stop political parties from
running presidential candidates, it raised the possibility of a
political rift between president, senate, and prime minister, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a system would produce a potent cocktail for political
instability," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Finances Agricultural Reforms in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to provide a concessional loan of 50 million U.S.
dollars to support Nepal's efforts to reform its agriculture
sector, the bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The second agriculture program loan to Nepal since 1985 is part
of the Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) which the Nepali
government prepared with assistance from the ADB, the bank said in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
The bank said as agriculture accounts for 42 percent of the
gross domestic product and 80 percent of the labor force in Nepal,
sustainable agricultural growth is a prerequisite to economic
development and poverty reduction in the country.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture program includes implementation of a
medium-term strategy which focuses on better allocation of
resources and the deregulation of the fertilizer market by phasing
out public interventions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the program aims to promote more efficient use of
water resources, develop rural infrastructure, organize the safe
disposal of obsolete pesticides and strengthen institutional and
legal frameworks, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
The loan is interest-free with a service charge of one percent
per annum and repayable over 40 years including a grace period of
10 years, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Manila-based bank plans to approve the
35-million-dollar-worth Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector
Project which will be co-financed by the Canadian International
Development Assistance, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Other projects for the agriculture sector in 1998 include Rural
Finance (30 million dollars), possibly Rural Electrification and
the preparation of three other projects for future financing, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is a member of the Nepal Aid Group.

<HEADLINE> SKorea to Retaliate Against Japan Over Pact Nullified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today announced that
it will take retalitary measures against Japan over the country's
unilateral repeal of a bilateral fishery pact.
</P>
<P>
"We point out that Japan is responsible for every situation
incurred by its decision to put an end to the fishery pact "signed
with South Korea, said Lee Kyu-Hyung, spokesman of South Korean
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Among the possible retaliatory measures, analysts said the first
one will be lifting of the self-imposed ban over operation by South
Korean fishing boats in waters near Japan's terrortial waters which
has abundant fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
Revising the 1965 fishery agreement has ailed the two nations
for a long time as they had to redraw their sea boundaries under a
new UN maritime convention.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral scrapping of the pact came after South Korea
refused to accept "unreasonable demands" by Japan in the past two
years' 10 rounds of negotiations for revision of the agreement,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The rescinded pact stipulates that the pact remains effective
one year from the time it is unilaterally nullified by one side.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha sumonned Japanese
Ambassador Kzuo Ogura this afternoon to deliver the nation's strong
protest against Japan's unliateral scrapping of the fishery
agreement.
</P>
<P>
All South Korean political parties strongly-worded statements this
afternoon, accusing Japan of hurting the Seoul-Tokyo relations by
unilaterally revoking the fishery agreement.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Receive Quality Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,200 Chinese firms
have been awarded quality certificates issued by authorized
authentication organizations.
</P>
<P>
The majority of firms are located in coastal areas which enjoy
rapid economic growth rates, including Beijing and Shanghai
municipalities and provinces such as Guangdong and Jiangsu,
according to the State Accreditation Commission.
</P>
<P>
China launched its quality authentication drive in 1992, with
major efforts focusing on improving product quality by setting up
and adopting international quality standards such as ISO 9000 and
ISO 9004.
</P>
<P>
In December 1992, Shanghai took the lead by establishing the
Shanghai Accreditation Center to issue qualification certificates
to firms offering high quality products.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 31 accreditation organizations which employ
approximately 3,500 people.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that accreditation gives enterprises the
incentive to improve quality and achieve greater economic
efficiency. A recent survey indicated that 98.4 percent of the
accredited firms have improved product quality, with some 84.3
percent enjoying increased profits.
</P>
<P>
To date, two thirds of Shanghai's top 50 industrial firms have
received accreditation.

<HEADLINE> Harare Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Peace returned to Harare and
Chitungwiza near the capital city Thursday after three days of
riots which ended in 2,300 people in prison for destroying and
looting property worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The central business district was a hive of activity as
normalcy returned to the city and most of the suburban shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
Industry, which had also closed due to the riots, opened
yesterday although there were some who were not sure of the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
Although there were isolated cases of the military manhandling
suspects and members of the public, the situation had reverted to
normal.
</P>
<P>
Residents from Chitungwiza complained that even the innocent
were being harassed by the military as they helped the police
conduct door to door searches.
</P>
<P>
In all suburbs, goods worth thousands of dollars were
recovered during the door-to-door searches. Most of the loot
included toiletries, blankets, electronic items and clothes.
</P>
<P>
It was brisk business for most shops yesterday as they opened
for the whole day for the first time since the riots began
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of residents in Harare and Chitungwiza staged
demonstrations in protest against recent prices increases Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some of them looted shops, stoned cars and destroyed property,
causing millions of dollars losses.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily reported today that members of the Zimbabwe
national army, who were deployed Tuesday, kept guard at most
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Although the government appealed to schools to open, most
schools in Harare and Chitungwiza were closed. The schools are
expected to start lessons Monday.
</P>
<P>
The food riots have spread to smaller towns such as
Beitbridge, Norton, Chegutu, Chinhoyi, Mutoko, Ruwa and Murewa
where thousands of dollars worth of property has reportedly been
destroyed and looted.

YINCHUAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Completion of a road in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has provided
poverty-stricken mountain people with a more colorful life and
contact with the rapidly changing outside world.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Hui farmers gathered to celebrate the opening
of the road which links Gancheng Township with Gaotao Township,
Guyuan County in Xihaigu, reportedly China's most impoverished
region.
</P>
<P>
"The road has helped us escape seclusion and embrace a better

vehicles passing by his home for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The area, home to 810,000 members of the Hui nationality,
initiated a program to improve transportation almost a decade

and construction projects on some 80 highways and country roads
stretching about 4,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 local farmers, or 30 percent of the total, have
enjoyed the benefits of the poverty relief program by working in
various transportation projects.

Improved transportation has greatly increased both the local
traffic volume and revenues, with a constantly increasing volume

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda celebrated his 30th
birthday with a third round win over American Vince Spadea at the
Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech No.1 beat Spadea 6-2, 7-6, 6-2, setting up a fourth
round meeting with Cedric Pioline of France.
</P>
<P>
While the past year was the best of Korda's 11 on the
professional circuit, the world No.7 said he might have been among
the top 10 for a lot longer had he not had a phobia about going
under the knife.
</P>
<P>
For almost 18 months up to late 1995, Korda had endured a
nagging groin injury which he refused to do anything about.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem had stopped him from practising properly or
doing any conditioning work for three years during which time he
still maintained a place in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
1997 began only moderately, but a glimpse of form appeared at
Wimbledon where Korda dropped the first two sets to Pete Sampras
of the United States before going down 6-4 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
He had revenge on the world No.1 at the US Open, beating him
five sets in the fourth round, only to be forced into retirement
from his next match against Jonas Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
Another operation followed, this time on his sinuses, which
troubled him again during today's match.
</P>
<P>
On a positive note, Korda said that by facing up to the facts
about his health, he had removed any pressure to perform and as a
result had climbed back almost to his career-best level in the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Pete Sampras defeated Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
7-5, 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Karol Kucera of Slovakia beat Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-2, 7-6
(7-3), 6-1 in the third round today.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams of the United States beat Amelie Mauresmo of
France 6-1, 6-4 in the third round of women's singles.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The first shipment of a
domestically-built cement plant bound for Iran departed
Shanghai Port on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shipment was the first of five contracted cement plants the
Shanghai Machinery Equipment Corporation (SMCEC) will export to
Iran. Exports of the remaining four shipments will be handled by
the China Technology Import and Export Corporation, and the China
Trust and Investment Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The plants, which were designed and produced by 10-odd
State-owned enterprises, cost 11 million U.S. dollars each and
have a daily production capacity of 700 tons. The plant will be
installed in the Iranian city of Yasuj and will begin production
within the next two years, according to SMCEC Vice-President Dai
Benci.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exporters will also be responsible for providing series
of services, including the staff training, equipment installation
and turnkey facilities.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the terms of the export contract call for the
Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China to provide buyer's credits is
seen as promoting a good mode of cooperation between banks and
companies.
</P>
<P>
"This represents Shanghai's first move to export turnkey plants
and equipment to markets in the West Asia and marks a major
development trend in the city's foreign trade activities and
participation in the international machinery market," said Zhou
Hongli, deputy-director of Shanghai Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai's 1997 machinery exports hit 5.1
billion U.S. dollars, 35.5 percent of the city's exports.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Urged to Grow Non-traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian farmers have been urged
to grow more horticultural produce because of high demand in
Europe, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Export Growers Association (ZEGA) on Wednesday
urged Zambian farmers to grow roses and summer flowers for the
British and other European markets while the Export Board of
Zambia (EBZ) has revealed a high demand for paprika in Spain and
other continental markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to farmers in Ndola, Copperbelt Province, ZEGA chief
executive Steve Humphreys said the demand for horticultural
produce such as roses and summer flowers has risen in Europe
especially in Britian.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned the potential exporters to be ready to face
the challenges of horticultural farming.
</P>
<P>
"This type of farming is not easy but the benefits are great
and the market is readily available especially in the United
Kingdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZEGA chief executive also said that Zambia has the ideal
climatic conditions with good rains and abundant land hence the
need to diversify into other farm produce apart from the usual
maize, groundnuts, potatoes and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
However, competition has increased in the export of roses and
other horticultural produce with Zambia now rated third in
Africa, behind Kenya and Zimbabwe, according to the ZEGA
official.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The greatest achievement made by
Bulgaria in the past year is that all the political parties have
reached agreement on the basic issues concerning national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said this Thursday in a
national televized speech on the first anniversary of his
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Now, he added, every major political party backs the
introduction of economic reforms and the fight against crime and
corruption, and agrees that Bulgaria should pursue a foreign
policy that will guarantee Bulgaria's peace and stable development.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, though the government has made
progress in stabilizing the country's financial situation and
curbing inflation, the living standard of the Bulgarians has not
been raised remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the reform, Stoyanov said, the reform can not be
fulfilled overnight and it is a task that needs continuous efforts
from the government instead.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Stoyanov said, it is the government's top
priority to join NATO and the European Union. This will in no way
affect Bulgaria's strategic partnership with Russia, rather, it
will contribute to the development of Bulgaria-Russia bilateral
ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgaria-U.S. strategic partnership, Bulgaria's traditional
friendship with Japan, India and China are also "very important",
said Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov was elected president on November 3, 1996, and sworn in
the office on January 22, 1997.

<P>
YANTAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Yantai, a coastal city in east
China's Shandong Province, has become a key fishery base in the
province, with an output of 540,000 tons of aquatic products in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Its fishery output value last year reached 11 billion yuan,
local statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The city government has made great efforts to speed up the
development of aquatic product breeding and deep-sea fishing,

the city began to cultivate more luxury sea products such as sea
cucumbers and abalones.
</P>
<P>
To ensure offshore fish are safe from sea pollution, the city
government has set up several monitoring stations in key fishing
areas.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- France's Cedric Pioline
tumbled 11th-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain in straight sets in a
third-round match on Friday in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon finalist Pioline headed into the last 16 of the Open
with a 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Corretja, the fifth and last
Spaniard seeded by the Open who was bounced out.
</P>
<P>
Four other Spaniard seeds, including last year's runner-up
Carlos Moya, didn't reach the third round.
</P>
<P>
Pioline received little resistance untile the third set when he
made a series of sloppy returns and was broken.
</P>
<P>
But the France's top-ranked player, ranked 21st in the world,
broke back at 5-4 and grabbed his own serve before he wasted
several match points to pocket the victory.
</P>
<P>
Pioline will face next sixth-seeded Czech Petr Korda, who
ousted American Vincent Spadea 6-2, 7-6, 6-2.
</P>

In other matches, Zimbabwe's Byron Black sent American
qualifier Steve Campbell packed in a 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 ousting.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government to Levy General Sales Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to levy the General Sales Tax (GST) at the retail level
from February 1 this year in a bid to improve its revenue
collection situation.
</P>
<P>
The Central Board of Revenue has issued a notification about
the imposition of three percent GST on selected items including
electronics, automobile, auto parts, sanitary-ware and fittings,
watches and types, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The GST at retail level was announced in the budget in June
last year, but the imposition was deferred to hold negotiations
with traders, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of GST at retail level is a step to improve the
country's situation of revenue collection, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released recently by the Central Board
of Revenue, the government collected tax revenue of 135 billion
rupees (3.07 billion U.S. dollars) during the first half of the
current financial year starting from July 1, 1997, showing 27
billion rupees (614 million dollars) short of the target.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that the government is facing a shortfall of at
least 10 percent against the revenue target for the financial year
which is 324 billion rupees (7.36 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It also means that the Central Board of Revenue is facing an
uphill task to generate 189 billion rupees (4.29 billion dollars)
during the remaining six months.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Launch of Spy Satellite Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel failed to send a spy
satellite into the designed orbit in a secret launch Thursday,
local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the launch of the Ofek 4 satellite was timed
to coincide with the ending of service by Ofek 3, Israel's first
spy satellite launched in April, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the failure remained unclear, and the Ofek
4 satellite is expected to burn up when reentering Earth's
atmosphere, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Local English daily The Jerusalem Post said the failure of
Ofek 4 means Israel will soon be without its own "blue and
white" satellite coverage.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the Ofek 4 failure was the latest
in a series of blows dealt to Israel's military aircraft
industry. In last August, the launch of the fifth test of
the anti-missile Arrow-2 missile failed and a fire struck one
of Israel's Aircraft Industry's plant in Beer Yaacov which makes
the Arrow and Shavit missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched Ofek 1 as an experiment in September 1988, and
the Ofek 2 in April 1990, both of which reentered the Earth's
atmosphere within six months. Ofek 3, also referred to as EROS
(Earth Resources Observation System), was designed to operate two
years in orbit, but has already been in the orbit nine months
longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Ofek spy satellite costs hundreds of millions of dollars
and is the fruit of Israel's most advanced defense
industries. Israel embarked on its own spy satellite program over
two decades ago, when the United States turned down requests for
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the Israeli Army has been seeking to
acquire an orbital capability to monitor military activities in
Iran and Iraq, two leading regional foes of Israel.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Warring parties in Papua New
 Guinea signed a peace agreement Friday in New Zealand's South
Island city of Christchurch, ending nine years of civil war on
PNG's Bourgainville Island.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ reported that the agreement includes an extension of the
current truce to April 30, and a following permanent and
irrevocable ceasefire, phased withdrawal of the PNG Defense Forces
from the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the present New Zealand-led truce
monitoring group is asked to extend its stay on Bourgainville, UN
observers will oversee the gradual pullout of the PNG troops and
there will be a domestic election at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony was delayed for several hours because of
differences over the timing of the withdrawal of the PNG soldiers.
Bourgainville rebels wanted an immediate pullout of PNG government
troops, and the agreement is seen as a compromise between
different factions.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley welcomed the agreement
and said New Zealand has been pleased to play a central role in
encouraging dialogue between the parties involved in the conflict.

DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were killed
and three others seriously injured in a fire that broke out at a

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Women in Singapore Urged to Have HIV Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Healthy Ministry of
Singapore has asked all doctors to encourage all pregnant women in
the country to be screened for HIV infection, the Straits Times
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the call in a letter, dated January 7, to all
the doctors in the country after four children were diagnosed HIV
positive last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that of the four infected children, one had died, while
the other three, aged between six months and three years, are
undergoing treatment. The four children were said to be infected
by their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the ministry urged doctors to encourage pregnant
women to be screened for HIV to reduce the risk of transmission to
their babies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that studies showed that the risk of the
mother transmitting the HIV virus which causes AIDS to her child
is about 25 to 30 percent. The child may be infected while in the
womb, during labor and delivery, or through breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
A woman who discovers she has the virus can reduce the risk of
transmission by about two thirds, with the use of anti-viral
medication, it said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that if the virus is detected in early pregnancy,
the couple is given the choice of whether they want to continue
with the pregnancy. If they decide to have the baby, the mother
will be treated at the Communicable Disease Center at the Tan Tock
Seng Hospital here, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Launches Program to Provide Electricity to All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The first stage of a project to
provide all houses in Sri Lanka with electricity by the year 2006
is now underway, an official of the Irrigation and Power Ministry
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Assistant Secretary Ananda Dharmapriya said the cost of
the first stage of the massive project, which aims to provide
44,000 rural houses with electricity within this year, is
estimated to be around 1.28 billion Rupees (20.65 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes to make electricity available to 110,000
houses by the year 2000 and to all the people by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Dharmapriya said 53 percent of houses in Sri Lanka now have
power supply, compared with 41 percent before 1994.
</P>
<P>
Around 72 percent of Sri Lanka's population live in rural areas
and providing electricity for them was a great challenge, as
houses in remote areas could not be reached through the main
supply lines, the ministry says.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry hopes to carry out wind power projects,
minor hydro electricity schemes and other alternate energy
resources development programs to overcome the obstacle.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Belarus President
Alexander Lukashenko said on Thursday he hoped Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan would join the Russia-Belarus union.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who began his visit to Russia on Wednesday, said he
raised the hope in a meeting with officials from Belarus, Russia,
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
He said trade between Russia and Belarus increased by more than
40 percent in 1997. He hoped the existing union could serve as a
model when Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan decided to integrate.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus-Russian union was formally established in June to
speed up economic and political integration between the two
neighbors. Russia supplies 90 percent of its industrial raw
materials and buys 86 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus maintain their own sovereignty within the
union. But the union will have its own flag and emblem, a common
budget, and joint border defense as well as a common currency and
market in the future.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is a former Soviet republic with a population of 10
million; neighboring Russia has a population of 150 million.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have also called for closer links
among former Soviet republics.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The campaign for local
government elections in the north of Sri Lanka is hotting up with
less than a week to go before the polls, in which it would be the
first time in more than a decade for people there to elect
representatives to local bodies.
</P>
<P>
Visitors arriving from the Jaffna peninsula said Friday that
all the political parties and independent groups are now
vigorously campaigning in the war-ravaged region.
</P>
<P>
A poster war is going on in the Jaffna city. Walls and
building, though still bearing the scars of fighting, are now
covered by various posters and party symbols.
</P>
<P>
Party activists speeding around the town in cars, vans and
three wheeler taxis and exhorting voters through loudspeakers to
cast their ballots are a common sight.
</P>
<P>
They also started a house to house campaign to distribute
booklets which outline their programs for the development of the
north.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TV and radio time has been granted to all the
parties.
</P>
<P>
Those who visited Jaffna recently said residents there view the
polls, scheduled for January 29, as an opportunity to exercise
their rights and a chance to revive local administration.
</P>
<P>
However, some Tamil parties, though participating in the
elections, still have reservations about holding the polls,
arguing that both the ground situation and the political climate
are not conducive to such an election.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Daily News said only 286,000 of Jaffna's 564,021
registered voters are resident in the region at present.
</P>
<P>
The campaign ends at midnight on January 26. On January 29,
voters will cast their ballots in 422 polling stations to elect
234 representatives for 17 municipal, urban and village councils
in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts in the north.

JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide a loan of
400 million U.S. dollars in the 1998/99 fiscal year to support
Indonesia's economic reform program, the Japanese embassy here
said.
</P>
<P>
The loan, offered under Japan's Overseas Development Assistance
(ODA), will be extended as part of the annual 1998/99 loan
package, the embassy said in a statement available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said arrangements had been made for the
disbursement of a 20 billion yen (160 million dollar) loan which
Japan agreed to give Indonesia in December. The 20 billion yen
loan was in addition to the 1997/98 ODA assistance worth 195.25
billion yen (1.56 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Soeharto held talks with Japan's Vice
Foreign Minster Masahiko Komura here Thursday and asked Japan to
help Indonesia find a solution to its private debt problems.
</P>
<P>
"The president hopes that Japan will help Indonesia in this
difficult environment and help Indonesia boost non-oil exports,"
Minister/ State Secretary Moerdiono said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the Japanese delegation, which arrived here on
Wednesday, also promised to provide 20 billion yen (160 million
dollars) for quick disbursement within the framework of the
Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI).
</P>
<P>
The CGI, made up of governments and donor agencies, pledged 5.3
billion dollars to Indonesia during its annual gathering in Tokyo
last July.
</P>
<P>
"The major concern is that most Indonesian private debt is
short-term (while the funds) are used for long-term projects. When
the debt matures, they rush to secure dollars and this helps to
weaken the rupiah," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 billion dollars of Indonesia's total foreign debt of
nearly 140 billion dollars is owed by the private sector with 20
billion maturing in the short term.

<HEADLINE> Japan Scraps Fisheries Pact with S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government decided
Friday to unilaterally scrap its 1965 fisheries pact with South
Korea after two years of bilateral negotiations failed to produce
a new accord.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai officially informed
South Korean Ambassador to Japan Kim Tae-zhee of the scrapping
after the government endorsed the decision at a cabinet meeting
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea had held 10 rounds of bilateral talks on
a new treaty since May 1996. But the negotiations have came to a
standstill due to a disagreement over provisional fishing waters
around a disputed group of islands.
</P>
<P>
Under a provision in the existing accord, the 1965 pact remains
valid for one year after either party announces abandoning it.
</P>
<P>
Japan hopes to resume negotiations on the new agreement after
South Korean President-elect Kim Dae-jung takes office late next
month, government sources said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Romania Join Hands to Monitor Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 23 (Xinhua) - Bulgaria and Romania have agreed
to jointly monitor air, water and soil along their common border,
the Bulgarian Deputy Environment Minister Neno Dimov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the the third meeting of the Bulgarian-Romanian
intergovernmental committee on the environment, the two neighbors
decided to set up a single monitoring system on the Danube River,
said Dimov, head of the Bulgarian delegation.
</P>
<P>
In order to seek financial help at a European environmental
ministerial meeting in Denmark in June, experts from the two
countries will work out a plan for a monitoring network by the end
of March, Dimov said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was convened in the city of Rousse, Bulgaria,
Thursday, agreed that round-the-clock monitoring of air,
water and soil should start soon, while other elements of the
environment can be included in the project at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee also agreed in principle that Bulgarian and
Romanian laws be brought in line with European environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
Romanian State Secretary for Environment Janos Kis proposed at
the meeting that the two countries create environmental corridors
across the Danube.
</P>
<P>
Kis complained about chlorine emissions from the Verachim
chemical plant in Giurgiu, Romania, which have polluted Rousse's
air for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Kis also expressed concern over the rise in exports of
protected species from Bulgaria and Romania to western
Europe.

<P>
CARACAS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 47,000 workers and
employees in 1,500 health centers staged a one-day strike Thursday
to protest authorities who were not complying with collective
bargaining clauses.
</P>
<P>
The walkout, organized by the Federation of Public Employees
and the Unique Union of Public Employees, was conducted as a
"warning" to health authorities.
</P>
<P>
There was a conflict between authorities and health employees
in December 1997 when hospital and dispensary employees said an
accumulated debt was not in compliance with collectively bargained
clauses.
</P>
<P>
Union Executive Committee President Adolfo Padron accused the
government of not making any proposals for solving the conflict
during the talks between the government and health unions. The
government said a Health Ministry commission would audit the
debt.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Grain, oil and byproduct exports during the

previous season's 7.944 billion dollars, a Brazilian official said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He also said the this seasons agricultural harvest is expected

</P>
<P>

<P>
Exports increased by 9.9 percent, compared to the previous

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Uses Overseas Funds to Develop Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Laizhou, a major agricultural
city in Shandong Province, east China, has so far utilized about
20 million U.S. dollars of overseas funds to develop agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The city has already set up 39 overseas-funded agricultural
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Funded by investors from a dozen countries and regions, the
enterprises are engaged in a wide range of developments including
vegetable processing, flower growing, seed breeding and milk
processing. They earn 35 million US dollars a year by exporting
their products.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Dongfang Foodstuff Co. Ltd., a Sino-Japanese
joint venture, is capable of exporting 1,800 tons of processed
vegetables every year, making about 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Laizhou is also a major agricultural player in the
country, ranking fifth among all the county-level cities in the
output value of farming, animal husbandry and fisheries in
1996. Its agricultural output value that year was 4.56 billion
yuan (550 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Congress Cautious in Reacting to Clinton Affair Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Faced with an alleged sex
scandal against U.S. President Bill Clinton, lawmakers on the
Capitol Hill said little in public about it on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Congressional staffers from both Republican and Democratic
parties and experts on Congress said it made sense for Clinton's
critics to stand back while damaging headlines about alleged
sexual affairs keep pouring out and for his allies to wait and see
what comes next.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was accused of having an affair with a White House
intern and then urging her to lie about it under oath. He has on
several occasions vehemently denied any improprieties since
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said he would
have no comment.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of Representatives
reportedly said in Columbus, Georgia Thursday, "I have no comment
on what's happening, but I think every citizen ought to slow down,
relax and wait for the facts to develop."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, few prominent Democrats commented.
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt said in a brief
written statement: "My view is that no one should draw any
conclusions in this matter until the investigation is allowed to
determine the facts. The President deserves that, and the American
people should expect as much from the people who serve them."
</P>
<P>
"Not saying anything is the better part of wisdom and valor,"
Brookings Institution congressional expert Stephen Hess said.
"This is a very messy situation. We don't know all the facts. Half
of what we're told is untrue, and we don't know which half," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Most key Republicans declined to comment publicly beyond urging
fair investigations through proper channels.
</P>
<P>
However, Representative Bob Barr, a Republican, said, "For
those in the House who have been waiting for a smoking gun, both
barrels are smoking," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrat John Glenn of Ohio, regarded as one of
Clinton's leading defenders during 1997 Senate campaign finance
hearings, had no comment, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona warned against
leaping to judgment about the allegations but said if Clinton had
broken the law, he would have to face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
A "frenzy of speculation over the truth or falsehood" of
allegations against the president would be damaging to the
country, new reports quoted McCain as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I pray the allegations are false and will believe in the
president's innocence unless there is persuasive evidence to the
contrary," McCain said. But he said if "conclusive evidence"
emerged that the president broke the law, "he is unlikely to avoid
the penalties prescribed by the Constitution."

<HEADLINE> Intern Gets Reprieve on Testifying in Case Involving Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky, received an indefinite reprieve in having
to decide whether to stand by her earlier assertion in an
affidavit that she did not have an affair with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, take the Fifth Amendment or change her story.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas where Clinton was once
governor, postponed a deposition that had been scheduled Friday
for Lewinsky, 24, to testify in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky remained secluded, telling CBS News by phone that she
had no comment.
</P>
<P>
"The deposition of Monica Lewinsky has been indefinitely
continued," U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright wrote in a
one-line statement.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Clinton again made a firm denial to Ms. Lewinksy's
claims in taped conversations with a friend that she had an affair
with Clinton and that he and his friend Vernon Jordan asked her to
deny it to Jones' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody to do
anything other than tell the truth," Clinton said. Lewinsky
herself has denied the claims she made in tape-recorded
conversations with her friend Linda Tripp, a former White House
staffer.
</P>
<P>
Jordan added to the denials at a press conference Thursday
afternoon, "I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally that
Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have a
sexual relationship with the president."

<HEADLINE> Further Gas Exploration Planned in Sichuan Basin of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will further tap
natural gas resources along the upper and middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, according to an official with the China Oil
and Gas Corp.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas is distributed mainly in the Sichuan Basin,
which stretches from southwest China's Sichuan Province to
Chongqing Municipality and central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Total gas reserves there are estimated at seven trillion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the proven gas reserves are 510 billion
cubic meters, 260 billion cubic meters of which is dispersed in
Chongqing, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the basin produced 7.5 billion cubic meters of
natural gas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest gas field, the Sichuan Basin has
produced 163 billion cubic meters of natural gas since 1949, and
relaxed the fuel tension in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province,
and Chongqing and other cities in the basin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Utilizing the natural gas as raw material, China's largest
nylon plant was built in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period, the Sichuan
Basin's gas production capacity is expected to top 10 billion
cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China Oil and Gas Corp. would further develop the
gas-processing industry and establish a six-billion-yuan ethylene
factory, cooperating with overseas companies, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Once the factory is operating it will annually produce 1.43
million tons of methanol, 300,000 tons of ethylene, 195,000 tons
of acryl and 60,000 tons of butene.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the corporation would invest 10 billion
yuan to explore natural gas in Chongqing during the 1996-2000
period. Besides Sichuan and Chongqing, the gas produced in the
Sichuan Basin will be transported to other Chinese provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Ruins recently unearthed by
Chinese archeologists on the banks of a Yellow River tributary
date back well over 6,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The site, which covers 200,000 sq.m., was discovered by workers
while constructing an expressway in Sanmenxia City, central
China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Local archeologists say the ruins belong to the early
period of the Yangshao Culture, a Neolithic Age culture which
lived in central and north China as far back as five to six
millennia.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have determined that the ancient people lived in
huts built over pits or caves, and that most of the structures had
stone foundations. They also found numerous relics, including
pottery, stone and bone articles.
</P>
<P>
The site also yielded tombs and relics dating to the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.-220).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Answers on Affair Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday promised to answer questions on his alleged affair
with a former White House intern as his friend Vernon Jordan
admitted he tried to get the young woman a job when she left
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Monica Lewinsky, 24, remained out of sight as she prepared for
a deposition scheduled for Friday in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has firmly denied all accusations. He made his firmest
denial yet to Ms. Lewinsky's claims that she had an affair with
Clinton and that he and Jordan asked her to deny it to Jones'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody to do
anything other than tell the truth," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky has denied the claims she made in tape-recorded
conversations with her friend Linda Tripp, a former White House
employee.
</P>
<P>
Jordan added to the denials at a press conference Thursday
afternoon. "I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally
that Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not
have a sexual relationship with the president," Jordan told
reporters, refusing to answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
Jones' attorneys had a wide-ranging subpoena served on the
White House Thursday seeking all documents and evidence concerning
Lewinsky's employment there, her contacts with the president and
others and other information sought in a similar subpoena issued
by Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr a day earlier, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest denials from Clinton and Jordan came as details
emerged about Ms. Lewinsky's entries to the White House and gifts
she got from the president. FBI agents working for Starr were
contacting other interns, including some who apparently still work
at the White House, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Starr said he would move swiftly to sort through allegations
that were the talk of the nation. Starr, a Republican, rejected
suggestions he might be out to "get" Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to gather facts and to evaluate those facts and to
get at the truth," Starr said. adding the investigation would be
pursued "consistent with the presumption of innocence."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, when faced questions about the Lewinsky matter during
a photo session with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday,
told reporters, "You and the American people have a right to get
answers."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will give you as many answers as we can, as soon
as we can, at the appropriate time... and that's not a dodge."
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly met earlier Thursday with his legal advisers
about how to comply with subpoenas demanding documents related to
the matter.

<HEADLINE> Textile, Garments Become China's Top Foreign Exchange Earner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Textile and garments regained
its position as China's top foreign exchange earner in 1997,
recovering from a sharp decrease in export volume in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted the China National Textile Council
as saying that China exported a record 46 billion US dollars worth
of textile products and garments in 1997, a year-on-year increase
of over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since China's imports of textile and garments last year were 13
billion US dollars, the sector contributed a trade surplus of 33
billion US dollars, accounting for three fourth of China's total
trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
After export restructuring, China sold abroad a total of 32
billion US dollars of garments and accessories last year,
accounting for 70 percent of the country's total textile trade
volume, and an increase of 28 percent over the previous year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
A council official predicated that garments and accessories
will continue to be a major factor for growth, and
medical textile products, which experienced an average increase of
8 percent, will have a very promising future.
</P>
<P>
Processed products made up 48 percent of China's textile
exports last year, up 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises was a major contributor, with their
export value and volume accounting for 33 percent and 20 percent
of the total respectively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Nominate 10 judges Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is planning to nominate 10 more federal judges when Congress
returns next week, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The administration is pressing Republican-controlled Senate to
approve its stalled judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important that we make sure that the judiciary
has the judges that Congress has authorized, Congress has paid
for," Reno said at a new conference Thursday. "It's not a matter
of expanding. It's a matter of filling vacancies, and I hope with
all my heart that we can get at it in a bipartisan spirit when
Congress returns.''
</P>
<P>
Nearly one out of every 10 federal judgeships currently remains
vacant.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997 alone, the president nominated 80 candidates," Reno
added. "The Senate confirmed only 36. I think the first order of
business has got to be to have hearings on and have votes on those
whose nominations are pending now."
</P>
<P>
In his year-end report on the federal judiciary, Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court William H. Rehnquist Rehnquist blamed the
Senate for "serious delays in the appointment process."
</P>
<P>
He said 82 of 846 federal judgeships are vacant, and 26 of
those vacancies have existed for 18 months or longer.
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican,
responded previously that "there are more federal judges on the
bench today than at any point during the Reagan or Bush
administration."
</P>
<P>
Hatch also has complained that Clinton has been slow in
nominating judges.
</P>
<P>
Hatch also has noted that the Senate only considered 47
judicial nominations last year and has indicated others were not
given hearings because Republicans fear they would become
"activist judges who continue to find laws that aren't there and
expand the law beyond the intent of Congress."
</P>
<P>
But Reno said Clinton's judges have proved to be "people of
real ability, with good judicial temperament, who are serving this
nation's judiciary with distinction."

<HEADLINE> China Expects Major Growth in Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will give a major shot in
the arm to the development of its service sector in a bid to prop
up growth of the national economy, the State Planning Commission
(SPC) has announced.
</P>
<P>
China will breed new growth in the burgeoning service industry,
said an SPC official in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
New economic growth areas could include tourism, housing, chain
stores, community services, information, advertising, cultural
undertakings, sports, technical services and finance.
</P>
<P>
China expects the sector to grow rapidly in the coming decade
and the government has promised to take a series of supportive
measures to spur its development.
</P>
<P>
The growth of these industries, which can accommodate more
employees and have bright market prospects, will be given the
green light, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism was listed high on the agenda, as it was considered
internationally as the third consumption item following food and
housing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that foreign exchange gained from tourism which
surpassed 10 billion U.S. dollars for the first time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The housing industry will maintain rapid growth rate, predicted
the official, adding that the industry may also help promote the
development of another 50 sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the output value added for real estate accounted for 6
percent of the service industry.
</P>
<P>
The information service industry is expected to grow at an
annual rate of 25 percent in the next 15 years, with business
volume reaching 54 billion yuan by the year 2000 and 400 billion
yuan in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Advertising has grown at an annual rate of 40 percent for the
past several years. Business volume should surpass 100 billion
yuan (12 billion US dollars) in 2000, with a growth rate of 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The stocks-and-bonds market also should have bright prospects,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Revises Economic Growth Targets for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The sustained financial turmoil
in Asia has forced the Philippine government to reduce for the
second time the major economic targets this year, local press
reports said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Budget and Management Secretary Salvador
Enriquez as saying that the real growth of gross national product
(GNP), the economy's total output, is expected at only 3 to 4
percent, down from the 4.5 percent target announced last December.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP), or GNP minus
the income from abroad, was also cut to 2.4 to 3.5 percent from
the 4 to 5 percent target set earlier, Enriquez said after
attending a meeting of the country's Development Budget
Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the pre-peso depreciation targets, the current
goals represent approximately a 50 percent drop in total output
with the peso realignment affecting almost every pocket in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the projected inflation rate was also raised to
between 7.5 and 8.5 percent from 6.5 to 7.5 percent due to the
price hikes caused by the peso's fall, the El Nino phenomenon and
wage increases, Enriquez said.

SAN JOSE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 17,000 households in
Costa Rica, or 2.4 percent of the total, rose above the poverty
level last year, said a poll made here by the Direction of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
This reduction could be attributed to last year's economic
recovery. After a slight drop in 1996, the Costa Rican economy
grew by nearly 4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 139,000 households, almost 20 percent of the total,
remain under the poverty line, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
According to the criteria used, a family is considered below
the poverty line when its per capital monthly income is less than
17,599 colones (71 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Families in extreme poverty are those which do not get an
average income for each of its members of 8,073 colones, some 32
dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Poor families are those which cannot cover their basic
necessities, but can only buy food. Those in extreme poverty are
the ones that cannot even afford the food they need.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia detained a Bosnian Serb
war-crimes suspect in Bijeljina in northeastern Bosnia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted SFOR spokesman Louis
Garneau as saying in Sarajevo Thursday that the arrest did not go
beyond the limits of the SFOR authorities.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR had sought permission from the NATO general secretary
and the top commander of the NATO troops in Europe before
detaining the suspect called Gofan Jelisich, Garneau added.
</P>
<P>
Jelisich was indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands on charge of genocide, especially the killing
of muslims at his camp in May 1992. Jelisich had been the prison
camp commander at that time.
</P>
<P>
Garneau said that Jelisich was detained without incident and
was sent to The Hague soon.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that this was the third time for the SFOR to
seek out and arrest a Bosnian war-crimes suspect.

Pudong's industrial output value last year was 135.7 billion
yuan, which is more than one-fifth of Shanghai's total, while its
foreign trade reached 3.6 billion U.S. dollars, or one-fourth of

4,928 projects in Pudong, with total investments hitting 23.7
billion U.S. dollars. Actual overseas investment in Pudong, which

NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The fourth modified Boeing 767
aircraft was delivered to the Japan Defense Agency during a
ceremony at Paine Field in Washington State, according to a press
release from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group today.
</P>
<P>
The delivery completed the direct commercial sale phase of the
Japan 767 AWACS program, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft then was transferred back through the U.S. Air
Force to Boeing. During the next phase of the program, Boeing will
complete mission system installation prior to final delivery of
the aircraft two months later.
</P>
<P>
AWACS is the world's standard for Airborne Early Warning
systems. Currently carried on-board militarized 707 aircraft, it
fills the need of both airborne surveillance, and command, control
and communications functions for tactical and air defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Production of the 707 airframe ended in 1991, with the 767
platform chosen as its replacement.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said the 767 AWACS offers countries self-defense
capability well beyond the range of current ground-based systems
and its maritime surveillance ability allows long-range monitoring
of ships in regional and territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is on contract to build four 767 AWACS for Japan. The
first two will be delivered in March 1998 with the rest to be
delivered next year.

<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for the shooting, but
it was reported as looking like the latest in a spate of guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Up to now eight people have been shot dead in the past four
weeks and at least one other has been seriously wounded in rival
guerrilla attacks which cast a fresh shadow on the Northern
Ireland peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Violence in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today condemned recent violence in Northern Ireland and urged the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) to support a proposal calling on
Catholic and Protestant officials to govern the province together.
</P>
<P>
Three Catholics and a Protestant have been shot to death this
week as multi-party negotiations on Northern Ireland's future
continued in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"The president condemns these acts of violence and every attack
on the peace process," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Now is not the time to surrender to a very tiny extremist
minority opposed to peace and democracy," said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
The IRA and its political wing, the Sinn Fein party, have
rejected a joint proposal by the British and Irish governments
that politicians representing Catholic and Irish factions govern
together in the new Northern Ireland assembly.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the IRA to honor the spirit of the proposal, McCurry
said that the two sides should use the proposal "as a basis for
forming the content and shape of a peace that would mean so much
to the people of all Ireland."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of a 199 million U.S. dollar credit
equivalent for a Vietnam transmission, distribution and disaster
reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve Vietnam's transmission and
distribution network and support power sector reform and
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million dollars of the project will be used to help
restore economic activity in 10 southern provinces by
reconstructing the electricity distribution network devastated by
Typhoon Linda.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is estimated at about 332 million
dollars. In addition to the World Bank credit, the Swedish
International Development Agency will contribute a 13 million
dollar credit and a 3.6 million dollar grant as well as a 0.8
million dollar grant from the Asian Development Bank. The
remaining 115.6 million dollars will be raised from the government
of Vietnam's internal sources and local borrowing.

lending wing for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates Arrest of Bosnian Serb Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton today
welcomed the arrest of a Serb indicted for war crimes, and urged
the rival factions to extradite remaining suspects.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the news that Goran Jelisic has been detained by
SFOR forces, led by American units, in the (Bosnian Serb) city of
Bijeljina," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia snatched Jelisic as he
emerged from his home in the Serb-held town some 70 miles north of
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The International War Crimes in The Hague, the Netherlands, has
indicted Jelisic, 29, on charges of genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate the SFOR troops who participated in this
effort," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I call again on all parties to the Dayton accords to
fulfill their obligations to bring all indicted war criminals to
justice," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The State Department also hailed the arrest, describing it as a
warning to the dozens of suspects still at large that they will be
held accountable for their actions.
</P>
<P>
"They should surrender voluntarily like the 10 Bosnian Croat
indictees in October 1997," State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall for Second Consecutive Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street pulled
back again today after big American companies such as Microsoft
and Sears Roebuck joined the world computer giant IBM in
expressing concerns about their profits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.52 points or 0.81
percent, closing at 7,730.88, extending Wednesday's 78-point
slide.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's fall was mainly the result of IBM's pessimistic
warnings about its profit this year late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators also fell today for the second straight
session despite some solid profit reports from General Electric,
United Technologies, and, late Wednesday, Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft rose as the most active Nasdaq issue after beating
analyst expectations with a 52 percent surge in profits for the
final quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft also said that the Asian economic crisis may drag
its revenues lower over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 5-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,119 up, 1,835 down
and 500 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 640.40 million shares as of 4 p.m., up from
625.12 million Wednesday, and the 12th time in 14 sessions this
year that more than 600 million shares have changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock list fell 7.77 to 963.04, and
the NYSE composite index fell 4.11 to 503.79.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.40 to 1,576.52, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.83 to 665.61.

<HEADLINE> British Government Launches Millennium Bug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
unwrapped its campaign to get businesses prepared for the year
2000 computer bug, calling on large corporations to lead the fight
in tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
Large businesses should help raise awareness of the problem
among their smaller competitors, said Don Cruickshank, chairman of
the British government's Action 2000 organization, at the launch
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
One of the main tasks of the drive, run by Action 2000, is to
collaborate with large companies so that they could sponsor events
intended to help smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
Cruickshank was fairly confident that most large companies
would be able to complete most compliancy tasks before 2000,
although even they would have to make contingency plans in case of
unexpected computer failures.
</P>
<P>
But the lack of preparation for the problem among small and
medium-sized enterprises is of real concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem is the inability of many older computers
to distinguish between the 20th and 21st centuries, because many
computers store year as last two-figure dates rather than
four-figure dates.
</P>
<P>
While warning that there are just 100 working weeks left before
the deadline, the campaign unveiled its first initiatives, mainly
for small and medium businesses, which included a national
hotline, a website and a Millennium Bug logo, to raise the
awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair backed the campaign in a
statement in which he said, "Companies of all sizes must grasp the
fact that this Bug could be inside their business and that they
must act now."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most serious problems facing British
business and the global economy today." he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Falls to Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar fell to the
historic low today despite central bank interventions.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed today at 68.81 U.S. cents, almost down
four-tenths of a cent from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada was reported to intervene at least twice,
buying the Canadian buck in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the central bank failed to halt the continuing slide.
</P>
<P>
The dollar started tumbling Wednesday after Bernard Bonin,
senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, hinted earlier that
interest rates might head lower because of the Asian financial
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Strike Brings Greece to Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece almost came to a
standstill today as transport workers staged a 24-hour nationwide
strike also joined by employees at post offices, state banks, and
electricity, telecoms and water companies.
</P>
<P>
The General Confederation of Greek Workers called the strike in
protest against a provision in the Greek government's new tax bill
that allows a change in the status of workers at loss-making or
bankrupt public enterprises and corporations in the framework of
their reform.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government introduced the provision in order to speed
up restructuring of money-losing utilities such as Olympic Airways
and the Athens public transport companies, but trade unions
believe that such state interference impedes the bargaining
process and as such is contrary to international labor agreements
and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions were reportedly considering to call another 24-hour
strike next week.

<TEXT>

BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A German survey has showed that a
large majority of German investors in China are satisfied with
their presence in the country, the German news agency DPA reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 58 percent of the questioned German
companies are satisfied, 22 percent even very satisfied, with
their overall business performance since the founding of their
Chinese projects. Only 20 percent of the firms gave the negative
answer.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Munich-based business
consultant company Roland Berger in cooperation with the German
embassy in Beijing, and 199 German companies which represent half
of the 2.5 billion dollars of total German investments in China
took part in the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 47 percent of German companies in
China have been able to report profits by 1997. Another 11 percent
said they are expecting profits in 1998.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Defends Bailout Programs for Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) defended its rescue programs for some Asian nations on
Thursday, stressing that the costs would have been higher and
slowdown faster if the IMF had not taken action.
</P>
<P>
The IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer told the
Midwinter Conference of the Bankers' Association for Foreign
Trade that austerity measures the lending organization imposes as
part of these rescue packages are critically important to
restoring the ailing economies in Asia and boostering stability in
an increasingly globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted the 182-nation IMF was "not a charitable institution,
nor does it carry out its operations at taxpayers' expense. On the
contrary it operates like a credit union" with subscriptions
called quotas that earn market-rate interest when they are used in
IMF lending programs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have received billions of
U.S. dollars from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said IMF's reform programs were aimed to restore
confidence in falling currencies. "Once confidence is restored,
interest rates can fall," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown would be much more dramatic, the costs to the
general population much higher and the risks to the international
economy much greater without the assistance of the IMF, the World
Bank and bilateral sources, including the United States," he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is seeking Congress approval of
roughly 19.5 billion U.S. dollars for the IMF, which include 16
billion dollars for the organization's regular resources and 3.5
billion dollars for an emergency bailout facility to be used in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the U.S. contributions were not a taxpayer
expense, but an investment "in the narrow sense that they earn
interest" and "in a broader sense an investment in the stability
and prosperity of the world economy."

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants to See Turkey at London Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The British ambassador to Turkey
Thursday indirectly expressed the hope that Turkey could
participate in the European Union (EU) meeting scheduled for March
in London, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey can profit from "some substantial profits" provided by
the EU, David Logan told a press conference here, which was
jointly held with EU representative in Ankara, Michel Lake.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the present bitter relations between Turkey and
EU, Logan noted that Ankara should not negatively evaluate the
Luxembourg summit last December from an overall point of view.
</P>
<P>
He, however said that he understands Turkey's frustration over
the EU decisions.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders excluded Turkey from the ranks of the
prospective candidates for the EU expansion process during the
summit, smashing Turkey's dream of becoming full EU member state
in this century.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Turkey announced a halt of political dialog
with the European body to protest its "discriminative attitude"
toward the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Britain, which holds the term
presidency of the EU, hopes it can persuade Turkey to attend the
London meeting which deals with the EU accession issues.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Lake said that maintaining a good relationship is
in accordance with the economic interests of both Turkey and the
EU.
</P>
<P>
"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in
Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said,
referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite its compliant over the Luxembourg decision, Turkey has
made it very clear that it would continue to develop economic
cooperation with the 15 EU nations.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the largest trade partner of Turkey with traditional
links.
</P>
<P>
Turkey submitted its formal application for the EU membership
in 1987, but so far the goal has not been achieved due to its
various differences with the EU, such as on human rights, economic
problems as well as the Cyprus issue.

LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all kept on declining and ended weaker on Thursday, dragged down
by continued Asian financial turmoil, a weak opening of the Dow
and profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares staged a steep dive
earlier the day on concerns over the impact of the Asian crisis on
corporate earnings in the U.S. and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, merger activity in the telecommunication, drug and
supermarket sectors and a round of late covering after the close
of futures trade helped the index pull away from session lows
along with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The index closed down 19.20 points at 5,2531.1 with volume of
747 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt closed the session at 4,220.25,
down 62.59 points.
</P>
<P>
German shares ended lower but off their lows in thin trade with
sentiment dampened by losses on Asian markets, the lower dollar
and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 9.52 points lower at
2,988.59 as share prices closed easier, but off lows, after a
weaker start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Some profit-taking ahead of the monthly trading account's last
