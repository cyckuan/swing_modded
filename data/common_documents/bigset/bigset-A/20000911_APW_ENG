<HEADLINE> Survey: Many Kids Home Alone  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite attempts to lower child-care costs and
expand choices, many children are left alone after school ends and
before their parents come home from work.
</P>
<P>
   One in five children ages 6 to 12 are regularly left without
adult supervision after school, according to a survey of working
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are more likely to spend their after-school hours
home alone rather than in day-care, activities at school or under
the supervision of a relative or baby sitter, researchers at the
nonpartisan Urban Institute reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that more affluent, nonminority workers reported
leaving children home alone even if they worked 9-to-5 jobs. That
surprised some analysts and parents who believed the main barrier
to supervision was cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Self-care among school-age children is clearly a fact of life
for millions of working families,'' said report co-author Gina
Adams, an Urban Institute researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on a telephone survey of more than 44,000
households in 1997, does not explain why parents make the choices
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they are anguishing and struggling and talking to
their kids on the phone as frequently as they can, cobbling things
together from one day to the next,'' said Lois Salisbury, director
of Children Now, an Oakland, Calif.-based group that deals with the
affect on families of health care, media and tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, policy-makers and child advocates say the time any
child spends unsupervised is filled with risks such as injury, drug
use, falling behind in studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of children without care in the hours after school
are in harm's way,'' President Clinton said in a statement. He is
seeking $1 billion for after-school programs for more than 2
million children.
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury said parents face new challenges in caring for their
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working parents could once count on a neighborhood of caring,
watchful adults to fill in the gap,'' she said. ''Neighborhoods are
ghost towns during the day, and that is regardless of economic
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents surveyed tended to find care for the youngest of
children, regardless of income level or work hours; 10 percent of
6- to 9-year-olds were in ''self-care,'' compared with 35 percent
of 10- to 12-year-olds who cared for themselves until their working
parents get home.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 55 percent of children 9 and younger were sent
regularly to supervised care or activities while parents worked; 35
percent of the older children in the study were usually supervised
after school.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by Westat Inc. of Rockville, Md.

<HEADLINE> Indiana U. Fires Coach Bob Knight  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana University fired coach Bob Knight on
Sunday, ending three tumultuous decades at a school where he was
one of basketball's best coaches but also one of its most volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of university President Myles Brand's
announcement, thousands of Knight supporters were marching toward
Brand's home in the heart of campus, chanting: ''Hey, hey, ho, ho!
Myles Brand has got to go!'' Outside the home, police in riot gear
stood watch.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans cursed Brand, while others burned an effigy of Kent
Harvey, the freshman whose Thursday run-in with Knight was the
final straw.
</P>
<P>
   Fliers were being circulated on campus with the teen-ager's
photo and the words: ''Wanted: Dead.'' And Harvey's stepfather said
the teen-ager and his brothers had received numerous threats.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's temper finally did him in last week when he grabbed
Harvey by the arm to lecture him about manners and respect. The
freshman had greeted the coach by saying: ''Hey Knight, what's
up?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight -- who said in a news conference Friday that he had merely
told Harvey he should address him as ''Coach Knight'' or ''Mr.
Knight'' -- had been under a ''zero-tolerance'' school policy that
included no ''inappropriate'' physical contact with students.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was warned in May about his behavior after an
investigation into accusations he choked one of his players during
practice in 1997, an act caught on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   But his conduct became even worse, Brand said. In the 17 weeks
since the school put him on notice, Knight bad-mouthed the
administration and alumni, threw a tirade at a female athletic
department official in his office and refused to show up at a
handful of important IU functions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not fulfill the promises he gave me,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he gave the 59-year-old Hall of Fame coach the option of
resigning, but Knight refused. He said Knight was fired for a
''continued pattern of unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new coach will begin immediately. Knight, who
reportedly was fishing in Canada, will be paid for the final two
years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Knight's players had driven to Indianapolis to watch
Brand's news conference and were pondering whether they would
finish out their college careers wearing Indiana's crimson and
cream.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that IU is a great university, but we came here to
play for coach Knight,'' junior forward Tom Geyer said. ''Right
now, you just have to consider what all your options are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank O'Bannon, who Brand informed of the decision to fire
Knight before Sunday's announcement, said: ''I have known Bob
Knight for many years and am personally saddened by this outcome
and the chain of events that led to it. Nonetheless, I am confident
that IU's action today is in the best interest of the university,
and I fully support its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight won three NCAA championships with the Hoosiers and guided
the U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in 1984, but his behavior,
which has included verbal and physical abuse of players, has been a
problem since he took over the team in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has had one of the game's most notorious tempers:
throwing chairs across the court, stuffing a fan in a garbage can,
scuffling with Puerto Rico police and even kicking his own son on
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, following the school investigation into the 1997
claim that Knight had a choked a player, university officials
warned Knight that he must adhere to the zero-tolerance policy. The
university also suspended him for three games and fined him
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   As word of Knight's firing swept across campus, car horns blared
and chants of ''We love Bobby'' echoed off the university's
limestone walls.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the freshmen, we came here to see Bobby. Now we can't see
him. It's ridiculous,'' said Matt Schildkret, 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the arena parking lot, someone had ignited a pile of red and
white Indiana apparel in the arena's parking lot. A police officer
moved in with a fire extinguisher, while security guards videotaped
it.
</P>
<P>
   University officials assured Harvey and his family they will do
whatever is necessary to ensure the student's safety. ''We'll have
to see how that plays out. It's terrifying,'' said Mark Shaw,
Harvey's stepfather and a long-time critic of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey wasn't the first of Knight's critics to feel the wrath of
the coach's supporters. Death threats drove English professor
Murray Sperber to take leave for a year after he criticized the
university's handling of the coach earlier this year during the
investigation in the choking incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''No person, a coach or anyone else, is bigger than the
university,'' Sperber told The Associated Press on Sunday. ''And
finally the trustees are biting the bullet on this and putting the
good of the institution ahead of a basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to the day when I see Indiana University in the
news about an educational endeavor, a great school of music, or
business, or something. It's long overdue, very long overdue,
frankly.''

<HEADLINE> Buffalo Teachers Back At School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Classes were expected to resume Monday for
47,000 Buffalo students after a teachers strike canceled two days
of school.
</P>
<P>
   A contract agreement still hasn't been reached, but union and
district officials announced late Sunday that the strike would be
suspended while negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers will still conduct informational picketing before
school, said Philip Rumore, president of the Buffalo Teachers
Federation. But he said the union had agreed to a recommendation by
a state labor mediator to return to classes while talks continue.
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,800 teachers have been without a contract since
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers want pay raises of 3.5 percent in four out of five
years of the contract. The district's latest offer, reported
Friday, contained across-the-board yearly raises of 2 percent in
three out of four years.
</P>
<P>
   The strike violated the state's Taylor Law, which forbids public
employees from striking. Teachers could face fines of two days' pay
for every day off the job, and the union could face additional
penalties for violating a judge's order Wednesday barring it from
engaging in a strike or other illegal job actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are working very hard, and we haven't reached a
settlement yet,'' Rumore said Sunday. ''I can't give any
predictions as to how long it will go on.''

<HEADLINE> Emmy Voters Bypass Nancy Marchand  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a sentimental Sunday night at the
Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Although Emmy voters bypassed the late Nancy Marchand of ''The
Sopranos,'' giving the award for best supporting actress in a drama
series to Allison Janney of NBC's ''The West Wing,'' Janney took a
moment to pay tribute to Marchand during her acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm standing here for one reason: because of the sheer
inspiration I've received from watching other actresses over my
life, particularly in the theater,'' Janney said. ''Four of them
are in this category, especially the exquisite, elegant Nancy
Marchand.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand, who won acclaim as the scheming mob matriarch in ''The
Sopranos,'' died of lung cancer June 18, a day before her 72nd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy Marchand wanted to work. She wanted to work until the
end,'' said her co-star James Gandolfini, who won for best actor in
a drama series. ''She was a trooper and I never heard her
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   While sentiment was on Marchand's side, the Emmys have an uneven
history of handing out awards posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year after Raul Julia died of stroke complications,
he won an Emmy for lead actor in a miniseries or special for his
performance as murdered rain forest activist Chico Mendes in HBO's
''The Burning Season.''
</P>
<P>
   But the late Phil Hartman of ''NewsRadio,'' who was considered a
favorite in 1998, lost in the supporting comedy actor category to
David Hyde Pierce of ''Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Jessica Tandy was nominated for 1994's ''Hallmark Hall
of Fame: To Dance With the White Dog,'' but lost to Kirstie Alley.
In a bittersweet victory, Tandy's husband Hume Cronyn won for lead
actor in the CBS miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox didn't get a best comedy actor trophy last year
after he announced his Parkinson's disease, although many Emmy
forecasters said he would. But he won this year after announcing he
was leaving the show to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand was also nominated last year for ''The Sopranos'' and
didn't win, although she won a Golden Globe award earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   She won four consecutive Emmys from 1979 to 1982 for her role as
the proper newspaper publisher Margaret Pynchon on ''Lou Grant.''

<HEADLINE> 103-Year-Old Returns Olympic Flag  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Eighty years after he shinnied up a
15-foot flagpole to grab a souvenir, a former Olympic diving
medalist handed back his ripped-off trinket -- the original Olympic
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Haig ''Harry'' Prieste, now 103 and confined to a wheelchair
most of the time, said Monday (Sunday night EDT) that he took the
flag as a dare at the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium, and kept it
in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is now regarded as the first to feature the five rings
on a white background that have become the Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste only discovered its importance during an interview at a
U.S. Olympic Committee awards dinner in 1997, when a reporter told
him the original flag had gone missing and never been located.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I ain't going to be around much longer -- it's no
good in a suitcase,'' Prieste said after handing the folded linen
flag to International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch at the start of the IOC's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was no good to me -- I won't be able to hang it up in my
room,'' said Prieste, who is considered the oldest living Olympic
medalist. ''People will think more of me for giving it away than
keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz introduced Prieste to the
session as a ''living legend,'' adding that he had run in the
Olympic torch relay at Atlanta in 1996 at the age of 100. At that
age he was still doing push ups and had just quit ice skating.
</P>
<P>
   He also was greeted by IOC member Jacques Rogge, a
representative of Belgium, where the flag was snatched.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is slightly discolored and is tattered along the edge
where Prieste ripped it off the flagpole, but otherwise in good
condition, the USOC said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, Prieste returned to California
and embarked on an entertainment career, becoming one of the
original Keystone Kops and appearing in 25 movies.
</P>
<P>
   He said Charlie Chaplin was a pal and that he was in the studio
when the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy was formed.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved to Broadway, working vaudeville before joining a
circus as a comedian and skating in the Ice Follies.
</P>
<P>
   Always the entertainer, Prieste, who is hard of hearing and
going blind, ensured he upstaged the IOC meetings going on inside
the Regent Hotel in downtown Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining some momentum after a slow start, the veteran showman
managed to stand up from his wheelchair on occasions and hold court
for a throng of reporters and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't want the curtain to come down when officials tried
to usher the impromptu press conference outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's the TV camera gone,'' Prieste said as he was being
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   He flew into Sydney late Sunday, two days after leaving his
nursing home in Camden, N.J., and said he hopes to attend the
opening ceremony Friday before departing Australia next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud to be part of the ceremony,'' he said. ''When I give
(the flag) away, it makes me feel good, I made good use of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be selfish about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn La Maina, a long-time friend who accompanied Prieste
Down Under, said the springboard bronze medalist from eight decades
ago still enjoyed pizza and root beer and the occasional
chocolate-coated cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in great shape really, but he's losing his sight and he
can't hear very well, so his sense of taste gives him something to
live for,'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a landslide any politician would envy, NBC's
idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The West Wing,'' won a
record-tying eight Emmy awards Sunday night. James Gandolfini, the hulking mob
boss on HBO's ''The Sopranos,'' ended the dry spell for his show, which was

White House Faults GOP Drug Plan

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House says a plan pushed by Senate Republicans
falls seriously short of the goal of helping lower-income senior citizens obtain
needed but expensive prescription drugs. The Senate legislation, sponsored by
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., would offer up to $31 billion for temporary,
immediate prescription drug assistance under Medicare. It is similar to
proposals made by GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush and would operate
under control of the states. The analysis was prepared by budget chief Jacob J.
Lew, head of the Office of Management and Budget, for President Clinton's chief
of staff and made available by the White House.

Survey: Gas Prices Rise 6.5 Cents
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The price of gasoline in the United States rose
more than 6.5 cents a gallon in the past two weeks as a result of soaring crude
oil prices and tight supplies at U.S. refineries, an industry analyst said
Sunday. The weighted average for all grades of self-serve and full-serve
gasoline was roughly $1.62 a gallon, an increase of nearly 30 cents from the
same period a year ago, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. service
stations. An agreement Sunday by OPEC to boost crude output by 800,000 barrels a
day was expected to do little to ease rising pump prices. Members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries already are producing at least
700,000 barrels above their current quotas.

members, was compiled by officials of Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002
Winter Games, at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in Olympic
history. The word ''geld,'' which means money in German, was written next to the

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- No defections appear imminent among the players

All 12 of Knight's players attended Sunday's news conference where university
president Myles Brand announced the firing. Several hung their heads and a
couple wiped away tears. Guard Dane Fife said the players hope to stay together
and win a championship for Knight this season. Knight was fired for a ''pattern
of unacceptable behavior'' at Indiana. He will be replaced by an interim coach
for the upcoming season.

   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Anti-globalization protesters
battled police and formed a human barricade around the site of an
international economic forum on Monday, delaying its start.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of demonstrators waved placards and attacked the cars
of delegates outside the hotel and casino complex in the southern
city of Melbourne, which was hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic
Summit of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   One delegate, Western Australia state Premier Richard Court, was
trapped in his official car for about 20 minutes as a crowd of
protesters jumped on it and slashed its tires. Angry clashes broke
out as police, some on horseback, broke through the crowd to allow
Court's car to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ''They jumped up and down on the car, let down the tires and
painted it,'' Court said later.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said two officers were taken to hospital with
injuries sustained in the crush. Two protesters were arrested ''on
suspicion of assaulting police.'' They were released but would be
charged later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence quieted quickly, although tense standoffs between
police and protesters continued at several entrances to the
complex. Organizers said most delegates had entered the complex,
and the summit would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of government leaders and senior business executives,
including Microsoft's Bill Gates, are due to attend the summit to
discuss future economic developments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event is organized by the Davos, Switzerland-based
World Economic Forum, a group that brings together business and
government heads to discuss the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizer David Glanz said the demonstration was a
success despite the violence, which he said was limited to the
''fringe'' of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing it would be targeted by violent protests similar to
those that marred last year's World Trade Organization talks in
Seattle, Nike closed its flagship Melbourne store on Sunday and
boarded up the windows.
</P>
<P>
   One group inconvenienced by Monday's protest was the U.S.
Olympic women's basketball team, which missed a 9 a.m. training
session after being stranded in the casino hotel lobby because its
bus could not penetrate the protest cordon.
</P>
<P>
   The team, in Melbourne to play exhibition matches before the
Sept. 15-Oct.1 Sydney Olympics, later walked through the protest
cordon and caught a bus from the city.

<HEADLINE> Michael J. Fox Picks Up Emmy  </HEADLINE>
With BC-Emmys, Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael J. Fox, who bid farewell to ABC's
''Spin City'' this year to fight Parkinson's disease, said after
picking up his fourth Emmy on Sunday that he is feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said backstage that he is taking medication that makes him
feel ''functional.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful. It's all about using your brain without losing
your mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sentimental favorite, Fox received a standing ovation from the
audience in the Shrine Auditorium when he walked on stage to accept
the award for best actor in a comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just want to hug every one of those people because they
don't have to do that,'' he said afterward. ''I'm grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the television audience, ''Thanks. It's been a great
ride and stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 38, left the ABC sitcom in May to devote more time to being
an advocate for research into Parkinson's, a progressive
neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   This was his first Emmy for ''Spin City.'' His three other
statues were from the 1980s for his role as Alex P. Keaton in
''Family Ties.''

<HEADLINE> New Legislature in Hong Kong  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Amid gripes about Hong Kong's unpopular leader
and the lack of full democracy here, voters and special interests
chose a new legislature Sunday that critics say will be unduly
dominated by pro-Beijing forces and big business.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa wasn't even on the ballot but came
under harsh attack from voters who accuse him of bungling the
governance of Hong Kong in the three years since it returned from
British to Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary citizens were able to vote for just 24 of the 60
Legislative Council seats Sunday. Special interest groups -- such as
business leaders, lawyers and doctors -- picked 30 candidates. Six
were selected by a committee in a convoluted arrangement that
opponents say ensures control by pro-Beijing figures and business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the public balloting, final results had been reported by
three of Hong Kong's five districts by Monday morning.
Pro-democracy candidates took eight of 13 seats that were directly
elected, with five going to Hong Kong's top pro-Beijing party.
</P>
<P>
   Final results were not expected until sometime Monday afternoon.
Exit polling conducted for television ATV showed pro-democracy
candidates were expected to win two-thirds of the 24 public-chosen
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The special interest groups, meanwhile, came down squarely in
favor of the pro-Beijing and business candidates. Only four of the
candidates chosen by the special interests are seen as firm
supporters of more democracy, although a few winners are
little-known newcomers whose alliances aren't yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout came to just 43.6 percent Sunday, compared with
53.3 percent two years ago. Some experts say dissatisfaction with
Tung's job performance -- and too much campaign mudslinging -- turned
off many of the 3.05 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   The end result will be a situation where the political
opposition can do little more than use the Legislative Council as a
platform to clamor for more democracy and intensify their attacks
on Tung's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly undemocratic and unfair,'' said Martin Lee, the
opposition Democratic Party boss, who appeared to have won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The social undercurrent is very bad,'' said one voter, Jimmy
Leung, a 62-year-old retired restaurateur. He said many influential
Hong Kong people were going against their consciences to curry
favor with China. ''They've become pro-Beijing imperialists,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tung voted in a park where a small group of protesters led by
longshot candidate Leung Kwok-hung were chanting ''Down with
Tung.'' One sat in front of the polling place to scream anti-Tung
slogans, setting off a minor scuffle as police moved her back.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, visiting a vote-counting center early Monday, was asked if
his low popularity had discouraged people. ''There's not just one
reason, but we will study it,'' Tung said. Noting Hong Kong's first
direct legislative elections were held in 1991, Tung predicted
''the voters will learn from their experience and I think our
political system will gradually become more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's economy is showing double-digit growth, but numerous
citizens feel left behind and they blame an alleged collusion
between government and business.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gap between the rich and the poor has widened,'' said
construction worker Chan Tai-man. ''Our wages haven't gone up. I
hope to vote in some voices of opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My son and daughter are worried about the security of their
jobs,'' said housewife Poon Hau-mei. ''We used to go out every
weekend, but we don't go out much now because we're always worried
about their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung has not said whether he will seek another term when an
800-member committee fills the chief executive post in 2002, but
his unpopularity has hung over the election even as concerns about
mainland China's control have largely faded.
</P>
<P>
   Among likely voters, 62 percent are dissatisfied with Tung's
performance -- a new low point for the former shipping tycoon,
according to a recent survey. The margin of error was plus or minus
4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign full of mudslinging, the biggest bombshell came
when a newspaper reported that the vice chairman of the major
pro-Beijing political party seen as being aligned with Tung's
government -- the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong
Kong -- leaked government secrets to a public relations client.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cheng quit his party post but stayed on the ballot and
appeared to have won election, exit polls showed.

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Envoy Arrives in Seoul  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In a new sign of the thaw on the
divided Korean peninsula, a high-ranking envoy from the North
arrived in Seoul on Monday for a four-day visit expected to include
talks on a planned visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun, a close confidant of the North Korean leader, was
met at Seoul's airport by South Korean Vice Unification Minister
Yang Young-shik and national security adviser Kim Ha-joong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come to Seoul with a strong yearning of our people for
unification,'' the envoy said upon his arrival at Kimpo Airport.
''I hope our delegation's visit will create a new, big momentum for
national unification.''
</P>
<P>
   His visit is the latest reflection of improving ties between the
two Korean states following the first-ever summit of their leaders
in June. The summit provided the best hope yet for peace on the
divided Korean peninsula, the world's last Cold War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun heads the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a
semiofficial organization which handles the North's policy with the
South and other countries that have no formal ties with the
reclusive communist country.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials attach great significance to Kim Yong
Sun's visit. He was the only North Korean official who sat in on
the June summit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun's itinerary in South Korea was not fully made
public. Seoul officials said only that he will pay a courtesy call
on South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and visit Cheju, a resort
island off the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, and Kyongju,
an ancient capital.
</P>
<P>
   A major topic of discussion in Seoul is expected to the promised
return visit to Seoul of the North Korean leader following the June
summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has said he is obliged to visit Seoul, and a visit
would set another milestone. The Koreas have never signed a peace
treaty since the 1950-53 Korean War. They share the world's most
heavily armed border with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have warmed dramatically since the June summit.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes from the two Koreas will march under a reunification
banner at the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, Olympic officials announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They have since stopped propaganda broadcasts against each other
and allowed 100 people each to cross the border in mid-August for
temporary family reunions. Two more family reunions are expected by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, South Korea repatriated 63 former North Korean
guerillas and spies who had been freed after serving decades in
southern prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas also agreed to relink a major cross-border rail line
that was cut off shortly before the Korean War broke out in 1950.
When reconnected, the rail line will connect the two Korean
capitals and continue to Shinuiju, a major city on the North's
border with China.

Survey: Many Kids Home Alone
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite attempts to lower child-care costs and expand
choices, many children are left alone after school ends and before their parents
come home from work. One in five children ages 6 to 12 are regularly left
without adult supervision after school, according to a survey of working
parents. They also found that more affluent, nonminority workers reported
leaving children home alone even if they worked 9-to-5 jobs. That surprised some
analysts and parents who believed the main barrier to supervision was cost. The
report, based on a telephone survey of more than 44,000 households in 1997, does
not explain why parents make the choices they do.

'West Wing' Among Top Emmy Winners
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a landslide any politician would envy, NBC's
idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The West Wing,'' won a
record-tying eight Emmy awards Sunday night. James Gandolfini, the hulking mob
boss on HBO's ''The Sopranos,'' ended the dry spell for his show, which was
nominated for 18 awards, by winning the best actor trophy. The haul for ''The
West Wing'' tied the previous record of eight Emmys for a series in its first
season held by ''ER'' and ''Hill Street Blues.''

White House Faults GOP Drug Plan

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House says a plan pushed by Senate Republicans
falls seriously short of the goal of helping lower-income senior citizens obtain
needed but expensive prescription drugs. The Senate legislation, sponsored by
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., would offer up to $31 billion for temporary,
immediate prescription drug assistance under Medicare. It is similar to
proposals made by GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush and would operate
under control of the states.

Survey: Gas Prices Rise 6.5 Cents
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The price of gasoline in the United States rose
more than 6.5 cents a gallon in the past two weeks as a result of soaring crude
oil prices and tight supplies at U.S. refineries, an industry analyst said
Sunday. The weighted average for all grades of self-serve and full-serve
gasoline was roughly $1.62 a gallon, an increase of nearly 30 cents from the
same period a year ago, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. service
stations. An agreement Sunday by OPEC to boost crude output by 800,000 barrels a
day was expected to do little to ease rising pump prices.

of unacceptable behavior'' at Indiana. He will be replaced by an interim coach
for the upcoming season.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Portraits Go On Tour  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Washington got tired of all the people
who wanted to paint his portrait and threatened to quit posing. A
supporter of Abraham Lincoln sent an artist with instructions to
improve the candidate's looks, for campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   After 41 chief executives in a little more than 200 years, there
are as many stories as there are portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The National Portrait Gallery is sending a collection of
presidential images -- all 41 presidents from Washington to Bill
Clinton -- on a three-year, coast-to-coast tour. The first stop will
be the George Bush Presidential Library at College Station, Texas,
beginning Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington art museum is closed for renovation for the next
three years and the portraits are being carefully crated for
shipment.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is the only chief executive represented in the
show by a photograph and Fred Voss, the gallery's historian, said
he hopes it eventually will obtain a painted portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago, Oliver Cromwell, a British head of state, is said
to have insisted on being painted ''warts and all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the rule followed by most of the artists who painted
America's chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Richard Nixon's famous five o'clock shadow doesn't
appear in his small portrait by Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lyndon Johnson called his image by Peter Hurd the
ugliest thing he ever saw, Voss said the president didn't explain
why he thought so. Hurd's Johnson will be going on the tour. To
some it looks flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is shown in a portrait done many years after his
death by Rembrandt Peale, who had painted him from life but wanted
a heroic image for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Washington's portrayers tended to idealize the nation's
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Voss said the head of Washington by French sculptor Jean Houdon
may come closest to what he actually looked like. The gallery has a
cast of Houdon's work, but it is not among the 61 paintings, prints
and sculptures on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Houdon worked from a ''life mask,'' usually obtained by molding
plaster around the subject's face while he breathed through straws
pushed up his nostrils. Casts could be made from the plaster after
it was removed and hardened.
</P>
<P>
   That flattering but unpleasant experience may have colored
Washington's attitude toward artists.
</P>
<P>
   But he also grew irritated by the sheer number of people who
wanted to paint him, and said in a letter to a friend, ''I have
resolved to sit no more for any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   By Andrew Jackson's time 30 years later, portraits were being
used in campaign literature. ''Jackson had an artist friend -- Ralph
E.W. Earle -- living in the White House with him,'' Voss said.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican stalwart sent artist John Henry Brown to do a
portrait after Lincoln won the GOP nomination in 1860. Brown's
instructions were to make the candidate appear as good-looking as
possible, even if nature had left him little to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures in the exhibit show Lincoln with the usual dignified
chin hair -- not the gaunt frontier face that prompted 11-year-old
Grace Bedell to write him just before Election Day: ''I have got 4
brother's and part of them will vote for you any way and if you let
your whiskers grow I will try to get the rest of them to vote for
you ... All the ladies like whiskers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln replied, saying people might think it an affectation.
But when his train passed through her town, Lincoln sought out
Grace, gave her a kiss and said he would take her advice.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Leaves Five Dead in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A powerful typhoon that roared across coastal
southern China over the weekend left five dead and severely damaged
houses and crops, an official and state media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All of the deaths from Typhoon Wukong occurred on Hainan, the
island province just south of the mainland, an official of the
provincial government said, speaking on condition of anonymity. One
other person was reported missing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers said the typhoon was particularly destructive.
Packing high winds, it moved slowly to the southwest, lingering
over the island considerably longer than most typhoons, the Beijing
Morning Post and others reported.
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused over 1,000 houses to collapse and ruined 49,420
acres of rubber trees, bananas, rice and pepper crops, the
Yangcheng Evening News reported in its Sunday edition.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Looks For Military Stability  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's military always has something
to say, be it about defense, the independence of judges or religion
in schools. And two decades after the country's third and last
coup, everyone's still listening.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Tuesday, Turkey's military leaders arrested the
prime minister and opposition leaders, took over the only
television station and announced they were in charge.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, they restored elected government. But ever
since, the question remains how much power was actually given back
to civilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the generals no longer intervene in the day-to-day
running of Turkey, all crucial decisions seem to need their
approval, and critics say the generals may be the greatest obstacle
to Turkey becoming fully democratic and achieving its dream of
European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically and culturally, Turkey straddles Europe and Asia
and sees the borderless, tariff-free, single-currency European
Union as its gateway to prosperity. The military views itself as
the guarantor of the secular modern state founded by Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, himself a soldier, in the 1920s on the ruins of the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prominence of the army in politics is an impediment for
Turkey to become a full member of the European Union,'' political
analyst Fehmi Koru said. ''It is against democratic principles. The
(European Union's) criteria tell us that the army must be under the
control of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   In coup times, Istanbul would be patrolled by armed soldiers
enforcing curfews. Today, it's a vibrant, chaotic city of 12
million people -- but the police struggling to keep order are
civilian, not military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Turks are forever speculating on what the military is
doing behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The debate returned to the forefront last week after the chief
of the armed forces, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, publicly urged
Turkey's political leaders to purge the civil service of officials
who sympathize with Islamic militancy.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to do so, but President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer says Parliament must approve.
</P>
<P>
   The military chief said he didn't care how it was done, as long
as the purge took place. The army's job, he reminded Turks, was
''to protect the republic's immutable characteristics: the
democratic, secular and social state of law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the military identified the extreme left and right
as the main threats to the state. Nowadays it is more worried about
Islamic militants. The general staff pressed Parliament into
passing a law that effectively shut down religious secondary
schools. Kivrikoglu recently said that radical Islamic elements had
infiltrated the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The military also directs state policy toward Turkey's 12
million Kurds. Overriding liberals in the civilian government, the
generals oppose giving the Kurds language rights.
</P>
<P>
   They reject any compromise, even though Kurdish rebels fighting
for autonomy in Turkey's southeast announced an end to armed
struggle earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The military took over the country three times between 1960 to
1980 -- the last time to quell leftist-rightist street battles that
were killing about a dozen people a day.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the coups tended to be forgiven in the West
because Turkey was a vital NATO member, and the generals could be
relied on to restore civilian government once their objectives were
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Turkish military is not a corporate body that defends its
own interests like a South American army. They have always pulled
out, and very quickly,'' said Sencer Ayata, a sociology professor
at Ankara's Middle Eastern Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   But ''they reserve the right to intervene as they have
demonstrated several times in the past decades when they feel that
the country has been mismanaged to the point of endangering its
future,'' said Bulent Aliriza of the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The top generals use the National Security Council --
theoretically only an advisory board -- to shape state policies.
Through that council, they engineered the downfall of Turkey's
first Islamic-led government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With governments rarely lasting more than a year, and nearly all
parties tainted by corruption, polls show the military remains the
most trusted institution in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Abroad, some circles use the term 'militaristic democracy' to
describe Turkey, and there are people in the country who do not
like this, but it is good to have 'militaristic democracy,''' wrote
a columnist for the Cumhuriyet daily, Ilhan Selcuk, on Wednesday,
adding that without the military Turkey risks becoming an Islamic
state like Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no sort of political will in this country, organized
or powerful enough to overcome the deep ideological and cultural
conflicts of Turkey,'' said Ayata, the sociology professor,
referring to radical Islam and Kurdish separatism. ''In the absence
of that will, it remains to the military to deal with them, in
their way.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union named Turkey as a candidate for membership in
December, but is pressing it to improve its human rights record and
end its 16-year war with Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But if Turkey wants to enter the European Union, the military
may have no choice but to step back, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Two Moderate Quakes Shake Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two moderate tremors rattled east-central
Taiwan hours after a strong earthquake jolted the region over the
weekend, triggering landslides that caused minor damage,
seismologists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.4-magnitude quake hit 11 miles northwest of Hsilin late
Sunday night, the Central Weather Bureau said. Early Monday
morning, a 4.0-magnitude temblor shook the same area.
</P>
<P>
   The tremors followed a 6.2-magnitude earthquake that hit Hualien
county Sunday afternoon. Officials reported power outages and
landslides but no deaths or serious injuries in the area, about 110
miles south of the capital, Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Tremors often rattle Taiwan because the island sits on two
tectonic plates -- huge, moving slabs of Earth's crust. The two
slabs, called the Euro-Asian and Philippine plates, rubbed together
Sunday, causing the quake, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.2-magnitude temblor was among the strongest to hit the
island since a 7.6-magnitude quake killed about 2,400 people and
destroyed thousands of homes in central Taiwan last September.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Begin Rewriting Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At a town hall meeting with New York Jewish
leaders, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak exuded confidence. If
peace talks with the Palestinians fail, he said, he'll simply move
on and attend to Israel's domestic problems instead.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has appeared equally unruffled,
saying that if he cannot deliver everything he promised -- a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with east
Jerusalem as a capital -- an eventual successor would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders have begun rewriting their agendas and shifting
terms of the debate over Mideast peace. The changes come as a peace
treaty is slipping out of their grasp following President Clinton's
failure last week to resolve the toughest problem: the dispute over
Jerusalem holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   In part, such a display of cool may be a negotiating tactic,
with both men trying to show that they have other options and won't
make peace at any price.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak, and to a lesser extent Arafat, have also begun
preparing public opinion for the possible collapse of negotiations
</P>
<P>
   Both had staked their political prestige on a peace deal. Barak
was elected by a landslide in May 1999 on a bold pledge to end the
conflict with the Arabs in his first four-year term, while Arafat
promised his people at every turn that he would deliver Palestinian
statehood -- one of the fruits of peace -- by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's shift of emphasis became apparent in appearances before
American Jewish leaders on Sunday, the last day of a weeklong New
York visit during which the Israeli prime minister met twice with
Clinton to try to break the deadlock in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it turns out that peace is a dream whose time has not yet
come, then I am prepared to transfer my full focus and energy to
building bridges over the deep social divide between our people,''
Barak told a town hall meeting of Jewish leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's fallback plan to a peace treaty is to launch a ''civic
revolution'' in Israel, including writing a constitution, allowing
civil marriage and making math, civics and English mandatory in all
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would invite hard-line factions, including the
main opposition party Likud, into his government to win support for
a secular agenda. That move would dim peace prospects even further
since Likud opposes concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also has been trying to lower expectations raised by his
repeated promises that a Palestinian state would be declared by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After his difficult meeting with Clinton last week on the
sidelines of the U.N. Millennium Summit, the 71-year-old Arafat
said he would not compromise on the Jerusalem shrines, even if that
meant there would not be a peace treaty. Should he be unable to
wrest Muslim shrines in Jerusalem from Israeli control, Arafat
said, ''another one (leader) will come to liberate them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the top PLO decision-making body, the Central
Council, voted to delay the declaration of a Palestinian state.
Arafat at one point had said a declaration could be made as early
as Wednesday, the original deadline for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's decision was deliberately vague, stipulating only that
the council would reconvene Nov. 15 to review the matter.
Palestinian officials said they didn't want to fall again into the
trap of naming a date, then having to pull back from it.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is wary of a unilateral proclamation of statehood. A
state in the disjointed patches of land he now controls would not
be viable, and Israel has threatened to impose harsh sanctions in
response to unilateral acts.
</P>
<P>
   For now, neither Barak nor Arafat is saying openly that peace
efforts have collapsed, in part to avoid being blamed for failure.
Second-tier negotiators were to resume talks later in the week,
working against an unofficial five-week deadline, but Israeli and
Palestinian officials are skeptical they can succeed where
Clinton's personal intervention has failed.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint of negotiations is a 36-acre walled compound in
Jerusalem's Old City. Known to Jews as the Temple Mount, it is the
site of their biblical Temples. To Muslims it is Haram as-Sharif,
or Noble Sanctuary, with two major mosques marking the spot where
the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders have shown some flexibility on the issue in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Barak suggested Sunday that he was willing to consider less than
full Israeli sovereignty over the site, provided it was not handed
to sole Palestinian control. Arafat, who until recently insisted on
Palestinian rule over the mosque compound, told Clinton last week
he would accept Islamic sovereignty there, under the auspices of
several Arab countries, including Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has not been enough to create common ground, and the
Mideast knot remains so tight that even Clinton, who after seven
years of negotiations is familiar with every minute detail, may
finally be giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Middle East thing, it's maddening,'' he said after his
latest failed mediation effort.

<HEADLINE> Gore Torn on Fla. Airport Plan  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few environmental issues have been as
important to Al Gore as protecting Florida's Everglades. But an
airport controversy at the southern rim of the imperiled ''river of
grass'' ecosystem is causing the vice president problems among
disappointed Florida environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered solidly in GOP nominee George W. Bush's camp,
the Florida presidential race has tightened, forcing both
candidates to spend more time there. Bush was campaigning in the
state Monday and Tuesday. Democrat Gore's running mate, Joseph
Lieberman, was there over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Gore needs the strong support of environmentalists
in the politically crucial state, the dispute over Homestead Air
Force Base less than 10 miles from the Everglades is dampening
their enthusiasm toward the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has refused to either support or oppose conversion of the
base to a commercial, reliever airport, as some powerful South
Florida Democrats and business interests have urged. The Air Force
is expected to make a decision after completing an environmental
impact review, possibly this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to see Gore come out and say he's adamantly opposed
to a commercial airport at this location,'' said Michael Chenoweth,
president of Friends of the Everglades and a national director of
the Izaak Walton League.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a leading advocate of a $7.8 billion, long-term
Everglades rescue effort and has made environmental protection a
signature issue. But he has walked a fine line on the airport
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway said Gore believes the Air
Force's environmental study on the base's future should be used
should be completed before he takes a position. ''He's committed to
promoting economic redevelopment while protecting the Everglades
and Biscayne Bay national parks,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't satisfied Florida environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been ducking the issue so far,'' says Chenoweth,
reflecting views given by a half-dozen of the state's environmental
leaders in interviews. The ambivalence has kept some
environmentalists from aggressively working for Gore, while pushing
others into the camp of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know Bush is terrible on environmental issues, so we don't
want to see Gore lose. But our enthusiasm certainly is dampened by
his refusal to speak out on the airport,'' added Don Chinquina,
executive director of the local Tropical Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the air base, wedged
between Everglades and Biscayne national parks, has been earmarked
since 1993 for conversion to civilian use. Environmentalists want
the property to become a mixed-use commercial and tourist center,
but tentative plans by Miami-Dade County have been to turn it into
a reliever cargo and passenger airport.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted concern from national environmental groups --
including the Sierra Club, Audubon Society and National Wildlife
Federation -- as well as local activists. Federal agencies charged
with protecting parks and imperiled wildlife also opposed a new
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency in March voiced ''serious
environmental objections,'' and the Interior Department concluded
an airport ''could have a series of negative consequences'' on the
nearby parks, waterways and fragile coral reefs because of noise
and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Airport development ''will surely degrade both national parks,''
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt declared during a visit to South
Florida earlier this year. He urged officials to consider
alternative uses. EPA Administrator Carol Browner said a commercial
airport belongs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental activists insist Gore's reluctance to weigh in
on the controversy is because of the powerful political interests,
including key Democratic Party activists and fund-raisers, who have
led the drive for construction.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal boosters has been Alex Penelas, the
Miami-Dade County mayor and longtime Democratic activist. He argues
the airport is needed to take pressure off Miami International
Airport 30 miles away and to help revitalize a part of Dade County
devastated by the 1992 hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas has been a key supporter and fund-raiser for Gore,
although in recent months he has somewhat distanced himself because
of the Elian Gonzalez brouhaha. Developers who would build the
airport also have close Democratic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the airport bandwagon until recently has been Sen. Bob
Graham, who was on the short list of potential Gore running mates
and is one of the vice president's most important political allies
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While once calling the airport ''a powerful economic engine''
needed to revive the Homestead area, Graham said in a statement a
month ago that he did not want to come out on either side until the
Air Force completed its review.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Denounce Media Violence  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The movie, video game and music industries
aggressively market to underage youths violent films and products
that carry adult ratings, federal regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   A report being released Monday by the Federal Trade Commission
says that even movies rated R -- which require an adult to accompany
children under 17 to the theater -- and video games that carry an M
rating for people age 17 and over are routinely targeted toward
younger people, said sources familiar with the report's contents.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are derived in part from documents submitted by
the industry itself, including marketing plans that demonstrate the
efforts of companies to advertise to young audiences materials
designated for adults, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and video game industries have voluntary age-based
rating code systems. The recording industry has a more general
label that warns of explicit content in music.
</P>
<P>
   FTC spokesman Eric London declined to comment in advance on
specifics of the report, the product of a yearlong investigation
ordered by President Clinton. He said, however, the study would be
noteworthy for ''the light that it sheds on how this kind of
entertainment material is marketed by the industry itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The study included a survey of marketing practices and found
most of the R-rated films and M-rated video games examined included
promotional efforts targeting underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not suggest legislation, but seeks more
effective self-regulation by the entertainment industry and
enforcement of rating codes by retailers and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore and running mate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, a leading congressional critic of sexual and
violent excess in entertainment, were expected to address the FTC
report in television interviews in Chicago on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush, said the Texas governor ''believes the
entertainment industry has to take personal responsibility for the
products it provides to our children. And parents also have a role
to play. We're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee plans to hold a hearing Wednesday
on the findings, with Lieberman scheduled to attend. He and
committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., backed a measure last year
that requested the study.
</P>
<P>
   Following Senate passage, Clinton ordered the report himself,
using money from the White House budget. He acted after a spate of
deadly school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders questioned what conclusions the government
could draw from scrutinizing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are causing moral decay in this country, we ought to
have an explosion of crime,'' Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America, said Sunday. ''The exact opposite
is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that any evaluation of the marketing practices of
moviemakers can only be subjective and praised Hollywood's
voluntary rating system.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment
of our national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at
the box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   Video game makers stress that more than 70 percent of their
customers are over 18. According to the Interactive Digital
Software Association, the industry trade group, adults buy nine of
every 10 video and computer games sold in the United States. Only 7
percent of video games sold and rated since 1995 fall into the
mature category.
</P>
<P>
   But public interest groups said the new study could expose
efforts by the industries to circumvent their own labeling system.
For example, creating children's toys based on an R-rated movie
enables the industry ''to go right ahead in a very surreptitious
ways to market to kids,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the
Center for Media Education.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers have pledged to increase enforcement of the game
code. Kmart announced last week that it would stop selling M-rated
games to anyone under 17, using a barcode scanner that will prompt
cashiers to ask youths for identification. Wal-Mart said it would
adopt a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains, including Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and
Co., have stopped selling the M-rated games altogether.

<HEADLINE> What They're Saying About Knight  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''In the end, Bob Knight's attitude was just no longer
tolerable.'' -- Ray Richardson, Indiana trustee.
</P>
<P>
   ----:
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, the trustees are biting the bullet on this and
putting the good of the institution ahead of a basketball coach.
And to me that seems totally appropriate.'' -- Murray Sperber,
Indiana English professor, a critic of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ... am personally saddened by this outcome and the chain of
events that led to it. Nonetheless, I am confident that IU's action
today is in the best interest of the university, and I fully
support its decision.'' -- Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   ''His legacy will be more about his temper than it was his
success as a teacher and that's unfortunate. I've always had great
respect for Bobby. He's a great teacher, but his methods I disagree
with. He's more of a dictator-type.'' -- Former UCLA coach John
Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''It's awfully hard to live under the guidelines that the
university gave him. I'm not really sure that I could live by those
guidelines.'' -- Indiana basketball player Tom Geyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't have much of a choice. It's tough to see. You want
to see all great men go out on top. Coach Knight wasn't given a
fair chance in this.'' -- Indiana player Jared Jeffries, last year's
Mr. Indiana Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I idolize Bob Knight. He loves us and we love him.'' -- Dan
Fife, Indiana basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this latest situation, I smell a rat. Isn't it ironic that
the kid's dad is a lawyer who has been ripping Bob for five
years.'' -- Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Indiana University as an institution caved in to
pressure from the outside world, specifically the media, instead of
doing what's best for the IU community.'' -- Andrea Osman, a
Bloomington resident holding a university flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in the state of Indiana, I've lived here all my
life, and I don't ever want to be anywhere else. But today I'm
ashamed to call myself a Hoosier.'' -- Indiana senior James Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's terrible for Purdue fans. Now the rivalry is
dead.'' -- Kelley Oberlander of Lafayette, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a former student-athlete at Indiana and former player for
Coach Knight, it saddens me to see one of the greatest eras of
college basketball end this way. ... I have always seen Indiana
University and coach Knight as one in the same.'' -- Iowa coach
Steve Alford, a former Indiana player.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Appear on Oprah  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- When Oprah asks, ''Why should I vote for you?''
Al Gore shows up with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential nominee, looking to solidify recent
gains among women voters, leapt at an invitation to appear Monday
on TV diva Oprah Winfrey's popular talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oprah is one of the most admired women in television and her
show is a great forum for Al Gore to talk about his fight for
working families,'' campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey's daily broadcast from Chicago has, through her book
club, turned little-known authors into best sellers. She said she
hoped her interviews around the theme ''Why should I vote for
you?'' would give similarly broad exposure to Gore and Republican
rival George W. Bush, who is scheduled to appear on Winfrey's show
Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was aiming to allow her 22 million viewers weekly,
most of them women, ''to break the political wall and see who each
(candidate) is as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's guest turn on ''Oprah'' opens a week in which he and
running mate Joseph Lieberman plan to focus on education and
raising money for the Democratic Party, which has been financing
the lion's share of Gore's TV ad war with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   From Chicago, Gore was traveling to a Belleville, Ill.,
elementary school for a town meeting on education.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, also in Chicago, was headed to Texas later Monday for
a $1.5 million lineup of four fund raisers, but not before he and
Gore angled to capitalize on a Federal Trade Commission report on
entertainment violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a leading critic in Congress of the entertainment
industry's glorification of violence, hastened to Chicago on Sunday
night to be at Gore's side Monday morning for the taping of TV
interviews on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong investigation sparked by the rash of school
shootings, the FTC found in a report being issued Monday that
movie, video game and music industries aggressively market violent
films and products that carry an adult rating to underage youths
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore and Lieberman reunite to tour Ohio in a pair of
school buses. Later in the week, gala concerts are scheduled to
bring the Democratic National Committee some $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's emphasis on education was meant to help him put a lock on
what is his strongest advantage among women in months. In the most
recent polls, he leads by between 14 and 20 points among women,
whose support for him has waxed and waned through the campaign and
typically determined whether surveys showed him as competitive or
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby credited the gains to Gore's focus in the
past three weeks on education and health care, which helped him
pick up support among politically independent women.
</P>
<P>
   ''He now leads among independents, and that's because of the
lead that he holds among independent women,'' Zogby said Sunday on
CBS' ''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican activist William Bennett, asked on CNN how concerned
Bush should be about Gore's growing gender gap, replied:
''Concerned, but obviously not defeatist.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush has ''bold ideas about education, early education,
about school choice, helping children who need help the most. Al
Gore has a very tough time breaking from the hold of the teachers
unions.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Heads Fr Florida  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush is using appearances in
Florida, a state that Republican strategists once believed was
firmly in his column, to promote his health care and prescription
drug proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Al Gore's recent surge in the polls has made the GOP
presidential nominee's grasp on Florida, with its prize of 25
electoral votes, less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb is governor of Florida, but that may not be
enough to offset a spirited challenge by Gore and running mate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Florida is definitely a battleground state,'' said
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will spend two days campaigning in Florida, traveling to
Clearwater, West Palm Beach and Orlando. Then he heads for several
days of campaigning on the West Coast, with a stop in St. Louis on
Tuesday on the way.
</P>
<P>
   First on the Texas governor's schedule Monday was a senior
center in Clearwater, where he was promoting his proposal to
provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would allow the elderly to either stay with
Medicare, and get a prescription drug benefit, or opt for a private
plan that would provide many of the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign strategists had hoped Bush would not have to spend much
time in Florida. But with the tightening of the polls nationally,
the state is once again in play.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the weekend on his 1,500-acre ranch in central Texas,
near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week he will go on a policy offensive focusing on health
care, conservation and education,'' spokesman Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday dropped his opposition to participating in more
than one presidential debate with Gore under the auspices of a
bipartisan commission. He had called for two others on NBC and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from both camps were expected to meet this week to
work our terms.

<HEADLINE> Tony Blair Mulls Child Rearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Tony Blair thinks the roughest part about being
prime minister is ensuring his four children have a normal
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest thing about this job is making sure your children
grow up normally,'' Blair said in an interview published Monday in
Reader's Digest magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''And they are, with the odd little mishap, as people know,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his wife Cherie have four children -- teen-age sons
Euan and Nicholas, 12-year-old Kathryn and baby Leo, born in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs have attempted to place strict limits on their
children's media exposure. But it has been a trying summer for the
family.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 16-year-old Euan was arrested for being ''drunk and
incapable.'' In August he was in the news again, accused of
behaving badly during a family holiday in Italy.

Astronaut, Cosmonaut Start Spacewalk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut
floated out of space shuttle Atlantis early Monday for a long walk up the
international space station. Edward Lu and Yuri Malenchenko paired up for the
grueling climb, to lay cable and install a boom for a navigation unit on the
exterior of the 140-foot station. The spacewalkers planned to venture 110 feet
from Atlantis' cargo bay, where the space station had been anchored for the past
day. That's more than twice as far as the top of the Hubble Space Telescope,
where other astronauts have worked. The spacewalkers were to be tethered to the
structure the whole time, with mini jetpacks on their suits for added safety.

plead guilty to one charge and will cooperate with federal investigators,
Justice Department sources said Sunday. Lee is expected to be released Monday
after a plea hearing before U.S. District Judge James Parker and be sentenced to
time already served, ending a 3-year-old case that has been marked by
allegations of espionage and racial profiling.

OPEC Agrees To Boost Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC has agreed to boost its official oil output by 3
percent, but analysts say the move by the oil producers' cartel will not add
enough new crude to world markets to roll fuel prices back decisively from
10-year-highs. OPEC members agreed Sunday to add 800,000 barrels to their daily
production in the face of mounting international pressure to pump more crude and
cool sizzling prices. But analysts warn the bulk of the increase will serve only
to legitimize the 700,000 barrels that OPEC members are already estimated to be
producing each day above their current quota.

Survey: Many Kids Home Alone
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite attempts to lower child-care costs and expand
choices, many children are left alone after school ends and before their parents
come home from work. One in five children ages 6 to 12 are regularly left
without adult supervision after school, according to a survey of working
parents. They also found that more affluent, nonminority workers reported
leaving children home alone even if they worked 9-to-5 jobs. That surprised some
analysts and parents who believed the main barrier to supervision was cost. The
report, based on a telephone survey of more than 44,000 households in 1997, does
not explain why parents make the choices they do.

<HEADLINE> Mauritians Hope For More Prosperity  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) -- Just a month after Parliament was
dissolved without explanation, Mauritians voted in general
elections Monday, hoping to prolong the prosperity and peace that
have made the Indian Ocean nation one of Africa's few success
stories.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks of colorful, violence-free campaigning by 43
parties, polling stations set up in schools throughout the island
nation of 1.1 million opened Monday morning and were to close 12
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ''has been very peaceful, very civilized. We want
to be an example to the rest of Africa,'' Labor Party candidate
Issak Reza said as he watched a steady flow of voters enter a large
colonial school to vote in his constituency in Port Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the large number of parties fielding candidates, the
contest is seen as a fight between the incumbent Labor Party-led
coalition headed by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam and an
opposition alliance between the Mouvement Militant Mauricien and
the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien. Leaders of both groups
predicted victory at good-humored rallies attended by tens of
thousands Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this crowd, there is no doubt we will win,'' Ramgoolam
declared before jubilant supporters in the town of Quatre-Bornes.
</P>
<P>
   Official results were expected late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramgoolam called elections on Aug. 11 only hours after
dissolving the 62-seat Parliament whose five-year term was up at
the end of the year. He said he didn't want Mauritians to have to
endure a lengthy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were choosing Monday among 535 candidates. Observers
expected a high turnout, and within an hour of polling booths
opening officials said there had been a steady stream of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Always in Mauritius we get a turn out of between 80-90 percent
and I see no reason why it will be different this time,'' said
Beebeejaun Rashid, a Labor candidate who is defending his seat.
</P>
<P>
   The key issues for the 779,431 registered voters are the
continued strength of the economy, job creation and whether the
opposition coalition will hold together if it wins. Both the
government and the opposition coalition have promised to create
70,000 jobs -- the former over five years, the latter within seven.
</P>
<P>
   Mauritians have become accustomed to one of the highest
standards of living in Africa thanks to revenue from sugar and
textile exports and income from upscale tourism. The nation's per
capita annual income stands at about $3,600 and unemployment is
around 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Continued social and economic development is crucial for
continued peace and stability among the Hindu, Muslim, Creole,
African, Chinese and Franco-Maurtian communities that make up
Mauritius' so-called ''rainbow society.''
</P>
<P>
   Because neither alliance wants to upset the status quo, their
platforms scarcely differ. The contest mostly revolves around the
personalities of the main leaders, all of whom have a long history
in Mauritian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ramgoolam is the son of the nation's founding father, the late
Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the leader of one
half of the opposition coalition, was prime minister from 1982 to
1995. Paul Berenger, Jugnauth's counterpart in the other half of
the coalition, was his coalition partner in two previous
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Should the opposition alliance win, the coalition's two halves
have agreed that Jugnauth would be prime minister for the first
three years, after which Parliament would appoint him president.
Berenger, a Franco-Mauritian, would then become the nation's first
non-Hindu leader. Hindus make up 51 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Bush Heads For Florida  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush is using appearances in
Florida, a state that Republican strategists once believed was
firmly in his column, to promote his health care and prescription
drug proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Al Gore's recent surge in the polls has made the GOP
presidential nominee's grasp on Florida, with its prize of 25
electoral votes, less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb is governor of Florida, but that may not be
enough to offset a spirited challenge by Gore and running mate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Florida is definitely a battleground state,'' said
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will spend two days campaigning in Florida, traveling to
Clearwater, West Palm Beach and Orlando. Then he heads for several
days of campaigning on the West Coast, with a stop in St. Louis on
Tuesday on the way.
</P>
<P>
   First on the Texas governor's schedule Monday was a senior
center in Clearwater, where he was promoting his proposal to
provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would allow the elderly to either stay with
Medicare, and get a prescription drug benefit, or opt for a private
plan that would provide many of the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign strategists had hoped Bush would not have to spend much
time in Florida. But with the tightening of the polls nationally,
the state is once again in play.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the weekend on his 1,500-acre ranch in central Texas,
near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week he will go on a policy offensive focusing on health
care, conservation and education,'' spokesman Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday dropped his opposition to participating in more
than one presidential debate with Gore under the auspices of a
bipartisan commission. He had called for two others on NBC and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from both camps were expected to meet this week to
work our terms.

<HEADLINE> Lantern Makers Ready For Holiday  </HEADLINE>
By VERNA YU
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- With a smile, Leung Yau-kam lovingly smoothed
rice glue onto a piece of white silk covered with purple flower
paintings, then pressed it with great care onto a wire frame.
</P>
<P>
   The 86-year-old's pride was evident while he explained all the
work that goes into a festival lantern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, yes, I painted the peonies onto the lantern screen
myself,'' Leung said. ''I think you could say I'm the most
experienced in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. He's been doing it for 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lanterns will be everywhere Tuesday night, when Hong Kong
Chinese celebrate their mid-autumn festival -- an opportunity for
children to stay up late and roam around in parks.
</P>
<P>
   But fewer of them will be using the old-style lanterns, which
are lighted by candles. Many customers are buying blowup plastic
models that use battery-powered light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters today are drawn to flashy models. Some even go
against Chinese tradition by sporting foreign influences, such as
the Japanese cartoon character Hello Kitty or high-flying
techno-warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like these more,'' said 11-year-old Wan Ka-fai, pointing at
lanterns shaped like space invaders with laser guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are more eye-catching,'' agreed Tang Sau-fong, who was
in a shop with her 4-year-old grandson. ''The old ones can catch
fire -- they're far too dangerous for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Shop owner Kwan Wing-ho said he still sells traditional
lanterns, but about 80 percent of his lanterns are now the
inflatable kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago, the plastic ones were literally unheard of,''
he said. ''But year after year, there are more and more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when people buy paper lanterns, many are from mainland
China, where labor costs are much cheaper. Only the larger ones are
made by the few remaining Hong Kong craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Shop owner To Chin Sung pointed at some small rabbit lanterns on
sale for 45 Hong Kong dollars each, or about $5.80. If they were
made by ''the old masters,'' the price would be the equivalent of
$32, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As demand for paper lanterns shrinks, so does the number of
lantern-makers in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Young people aren't interested in learning the art, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have the patience, or the perseverance to learn the
craft,'' he said, shaking his head. ''It's a real shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Leung estimated the number of craftsmen in Hong Kong who have
gone through full apprenticeships has dropped from 20 to around
five over the past two decades. Some have retired. Some have died.
</P>
<P>
   Full apprenticeships taught how to make more than lanterns for
children. Those in the trade also learned to make large-scale
ornate lanterns and papier-mache dragons and mythological beasts
for ceremonial celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The craftsmen also produce funeral offerings that Chinese burn
after a loved one dies -- including model cranes, bridges, houses,
servants -- all intended to guide the dead to eternal rest and to
keep them comfortable in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard work, and many apprentices give up before finishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hardly anyone new has entered the apprenticeship,'' said
68-year-old Leung Tong, another craftsman who was making a giant
goldfish lantern. ''I don't want to burden the young; this trade
has no future. They're better off going into computing.''

<HEADLINE> Glassblowers Continue an Old Trade  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) -- In a small room at the back of
pharmaceutical giant Merck &AMP; Co.'s gleaming corporate campus, the
2,000-year-old art of glassblowing thrives.
</P>
<P>
   The people working here aren't making globes or trinkets for
tourists. Glassblowers Wayne Dockery and Harold Heimback work with
scientists to create devices useful in developing the latest
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   They're part of a growing number of artisans -- sought by the
expanding pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector -- who supply
custom equipment to chemists, biologists and other laboratory
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's an increasing number of people that would like
to be glassblowers,'' said Dennis Briening, a glassblower employed
by Salem Community College in Carneys Point, N.J., which offers the
nation's only scientific glassblowing degree. ''And I think there's
an increasing number of opportunities in glass.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Merck shop, nearly every flat surface is covered with
fireproof material, much of it blackened from years of exposure to
open flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hot enough to melt your buttons,'' said Dockery, adding
that he's ruined several shirts that way. Or cause injury --
Heimback, after 28 years in the trade, has visible scars and burns
on his hands and forearms.
</P>
<P>
   Like many glassblowing shops, the center of the room is
dominated by a giant lathe that can hold pieces of glass several
feet in diameter. On a recent day last month, the device spun
slowly under steadily decreasing heat to allow it to cool without
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Dockery, whose father ran the shop for three decades,
and Heimback create and repair thousands of glass pieces for Merck
scientists around the world. Many of the pieces are unique.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the pair created an automated tick feeder and a
flea counter for agricultural researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The feeder allows scientists to nourish the insects without
keeping a host animal in the lab. The counter, shaped like an
hourglass, has a narrow ''waist'' which allows only a single flea
to move through the passage at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason glassblowers are increasingly in demand is
the growth in pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The tricky
part is finding workers with the coordination and patience the job
requires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an art, and not everyone realizes it's an art,'' said
Bill Robbins, production manager at Kontes glassblowers in
Vineland, N.J. ''Not everyone gets to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of scientific glassblowing are custom glassblowers --
the people who can take scientists' vague ideas for experiments and
turn them into complex laboratory equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, they're just blue-sky ideas,'' said the
community college's Daryl Smith, a former Kontes glassblower.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 2,500 scientific glassblowers in the
country. And while the more repetitious aspects of the trade have
been automated, most glassblowers aren't afraid they will lose
their jobs to machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Philosophically, anything can be automated,'' Smith said,
adding, ''You have companies that downsize. I've never seen them
lay off a glassblower.''
</P>
<P>
   Salem Community College is located in the heart of southern New
Jersey, where glassblowing got its start in America. In the late
18th century, the pure sand in Salem and Cumberland counties drew
glassblowers to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   The college admits about 20 students each year to its two-year
program. After graduating, students begin at the bottom rung of
glassblowing as lathe operators -- production line work that
requires making one item over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''To attain top status, it takes eight to 10 years,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   A glassblower can remain a lathe operator or move on to custom
work -- either for a company that sells catalog and custom-designed
glass, or for university and corporate laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries vary widely. But, as Briening said, ''You can go to
whatever level you aspire to.''

	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - A 20-year-old woman, originally charged with
second-degree manslaughter, has instead been found guilty of
negligent homicide.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sydney Opening Day Looms  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With opening ceremonies for the Sydney
Games just four days off, a raft of Aussie celebrities lined up to
carry the Olympic torch as Sydney's lord mayor promised the biggest
bash in local history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city is ready, in case you haven't noticed,'' Frank Sartor
cracked at a news conference Monday afternoon (Sunday night EDT).
''It's ready, it's sparkling. ... The city will be in full swing.
It will be a great party.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the party by lugging the Olympic torch during its final
legs toward the Olympic Stadium were an assortment of
internationally known local heroes: tennis stars John Newcombe and
Pat Rafter, actress Rachel Ward, singer Olivia Newton-John and past
Olympic greats Dawn Fraser and Murray Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the torch carrier who will light the flame at
the opening ceremonies remains a secret, but organizers had no
worries about matching the 1996 moment when Muhammad Ali did the
honors in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure is making something special,'' said torch manager
Di Henry. ''In Australia, we have plenty of special people.''
</P>
<P>
   -- WEATHER WATCH: When the flame is finally lit Friday night, the
weather should pose no problems.
</P>
<P>
   The local forecast is calling for ''cool to mild conditions'' --
unusually cool for a Summer Olympics, with high temperatures only
in the 60s and a low of 51 degrees. The wind will be light to
moderate, making summer down under more like a pleasant fall day in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   -- OLYMPIC FLAG: Before becoming one of the original Keystone
Kops, Hal Haig ''Harry'' Prieste had a brief criminal career.
Today, 80 years after he stole the original Olympic flag during the
1920 games in Antwerp, Belgium, the 103-year-old returned the
valued icon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, 'I ain't going to be around much longer -- it's no
good in a suitcase,''' Prieste said Monday after presenting the
folded linen flag to International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was no good to me,'' the wheelchair-bound Prieste added.
''I won't be able to hang it up in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Prieste was an Olympic diving medalist when he swiped the white
flag with its five rings from a 15-foot flagpole. The flag was
slightly discolored and tattered where it was ripped from the
flagpole, but was otherwise in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   -- IOC SUIT: The organizers of Salt Lake City's scandal-marred
2002 Winter Games could face a libel suit from angry members of the
International Olympic Committee. IOC officials, incensed by a
secret dossier that purportedly held tips on how to bribe them,
raised the question of legal action at the opening session of the
IOC general assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Although IOC officials later played down the threat, IOC ethics
commission chairman Keba Mbaye's reaction was quite blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we should put an end to such a practice,'' he said of
the dossier. ''We need to condemn it and see what sort of legal
procedures we could initiate.''
</P>
<P>
   -- DAY OFF: Demonstrators outside a Melbourne hotel forced the
heavily favored U.S. men's basketball team to cancel its practice
Monday. The protesters weren't angry at Vince Carter or Alonzo
Mourning; the hotel was the site of the World Economic Forum, a
meeting of top business leaders from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to take any chances,'' said USA Basketball
spokesman Craig Miller, citing the recognizability of the NBA
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The more anonymous U.S. women's team opted to walk through the
crowds, board their bus and hold a two-hour practice. Their
departure from the Crown Casino and Hotel was delayed for more than
an hour.

<HEADLINE> 'Cats' Bids Goodbye To Broadway  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Cats,'' Broadway's longest running show, has
become as much a ''Memory'' as the song that was its most
persistent refrain.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly 18-year run, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical
closed with a roar Sunday at the Winter Garden Theater before an
invited audience of friends and fans.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered, screamed and even cried during an emotional,
confetti-strewn final performance -- number 7,485 -- that was
interrupted by several standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight is the last night of 'Cats' first life on Broadway,''
Lloyd Webber said after the exuberant cast and orchestra players
took their bows. ''So I wouldn't get too excited. I don't quite
know what the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, who wrote the show's music, was applauded as soon
as he entered the theater and before the house lights dimmed. The
most applause? For ''The Jellicle Ball,'' a big dance number near
the end of the first act, which received the night's longest
standing ovation, literally stopping the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's possibly difficult for you to realize here,'' Lloyd
Webber told theatergoers after the final curtain. '''Cats' was
already a big hit in advance before we came to New York, but in
London, it was a huge, huge risk. People don't believe this but we
opened with quite a lot of our capital missing. The only thing I
will say is musical theater has got to continue to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people called on stage by Lloyd Webber were director
Trevor Nunn, choreographer Gillian Lynne and producer Cameron
Mackintosh. As they waved goodbye, a shower of yellow, white and
silver confetti filled the theater, covering the cast and
still-applauding theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' was based on ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,'' a
collection of poems by T.S. Eliot. The St. Louis-born poet was
praised by Nunn as ''the greatest English and American poet of the
20th century and who was my unwitting collaborator in writing the
words for 'Memory' -- probably unwillingly, if he had known.''
</P>
<P>
   The poems by Eliot, who died in 1965, also provided the lyrics
for the other numbers in ''Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Memory'' is sung in the show by Grizabella, the musical's
faded glamour cat. Betty Buckley, who was the original, watched
Linda Balgord sing her signature number Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time since 1982, the Winter Garden, one of the
few Broadway theaters actually on Broadway, will be dark. Yet there
will be one more ''Cats'' event in the house. Next Saturday, props,
costumes and other mementos from the musical will be put on sale in
a giant theatrical garage sale. It will be a benefit for Broadway
Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the stage, Nunn begged off from going to the
show's post-performance party, saying he was flying back to London,
where he is working on a new production at the Royal National
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the words of T.S. Eliot, we have to remind ourselves of
these words, 'Every end is a new beginning,''' Nunn said.
''Translated into Broadway terms that is 'Another openin', another
show.'''

<HEADLINE> Foul Smell Makes Japanese Ill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A foul smell leaked from a parcel containing
Chinese chemicals at a Tokyo post office Monday, sending 45
sickened workers to the hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The parcel arrived in Tokyo by air from China two days ago and
was destined for Itochu Techno-Chemical Inc., a Japanese chemical
company in Tokyo, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Toshinari Hidekuma, a spokesman for Itochu, said the parcel
contained 3-chloropropionyl chloride, a chemical used in
synthesizing medical products, and apparently was not well
packaged. It was sent from a Chinese firm in Nanjing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If exposed to moisture in the atmosphere, the chemical emits a
stinging odor, Hidekuma said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitalized workers suffered eye pain, headaches and nausea
when the stinging odor emerged suddenly as workers were sorting out
delivery mail, said Seiya Tada, a spokesman for the Tokyo Fire
Department. Their injuries were not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off the Nihombashi Post Office and police cars,
fire trucks and ambulances were stationed outside the building in
central Tokyo. The spot is not far from the area where members of
the Aum Shinri Kyo cult released nerve gas on the subway in 1995,
killing 12 people and sickening thousands.

<HEADLINE> A bit of Americana survive on nostalgia, swap meets  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AZUSA, Calif. (AP) - At the last drive-in theater on the
Southern California leg of historic Route 66, families with
children hunker down under blankets as couples sip iced tea before
the evening's double feature.
</P>
<P>
   While some come for the nostalgia of Americana and bargain $5
tickets, others say they made the trip because, simply put, nothing
compares to a movie at the drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't come for years and recently we just started coming
again,'' said Mike Hobbs, 34, who brought his wife and 3-year-old
son to the Azusa Foothill Drive-in. ''I just said today, 'Hey,
let's go to the show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once feared on the brink of extinction, drive-ins have managed
to survive through low attendance by hosting weekend swap meets,
serviced by concession stands that keep popping and selling
popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of devoted fans who keep buying tickets and
business-savvy owners who found other sources of profit, the two
have kept drive-in theaters thriving.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the number of drive-ins in America has held steady at
about 500 for the past decade, said Don Sanders, author of ''The
American Drive-in Theater.'' While it's nowhere near the peak of
5,000 in 1958, there's no sign that the drive-in will fade to
black.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never going to be more than there are today, but I
don't think there'll be less,'' Sanders said of California's 35 or
so remaining drive-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Many have died out in major cities because of rising real estate
prices and a housing crunch, but drive-ins are still scattered off
rural and suburban highways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson, Wis., the old Highway 18 Outdoor Theater collected
weeds for five years until a new owner reopened it in May. And the
family-owned Starlite Drive-in in Neligh, Neb., has been a popular
destination since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Invented in 1933 by Richard Hollingshead in Camden, N.J., the
drive-in was a marketing scheme intended to lure customers to the
gas station at night, said Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, giant screens, murals, neon lights and in-car speakers
followed the post-World War II boom. Families became the drive-in's
main staple in the 1950s until teens gave it a new reputation as
''the passion pit'' in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, including competition from television
and later VCRs, the drive-in began to droop from the late 1960s on.
Some owners even blamed customer decline on the adoption of
daylight-saving time in 1967, arguing that families didn't want to
stay out late.
</P>
<P>
   Land value and ever-expanding cities forced many drive-ins to
sell in the 1980s, making many believe that the very American
institution would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took my first picture of a drive-in in 1987 and I thought
there wouldn't be any left in 2000,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   But while drive-ins seem to have weathered the worst, there's
still pressure to sell. The Foothill Drive-in, about 20 miles east
of Los Angeles, continues to fight rumors that neighboring Azusa
Pacific University will buy the land for classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Leo Aceves firmly said the owner, Los Angeles-based
Pacific Theaters, has no plans to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The younger generation is used to megaplexes, CD sound and
stadium seating, but you still get the regulars who are looking for
drive-ins,'' Aceves said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers such as Mike and Judy Williams admit to being
regulars. The couple, both 49, shared dinner with their friends on
lawn chairs in front of their new sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Drive-ins have always been a big part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back when they still charged by the car, we used to hide
people in the trunk,'' said Mike Williams, of Covina.
</P>
<P>
   He even remembers taking his wife on dates at a drive-in near
their home until it was torn down in the 1980s. Nowadays, they
don't mind driving a few extra miles to Azusa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing like it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Now just a 'Memory,' 'Cats' bids goodbye to Broadway  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - ''Cats,'' Broadway's longest-running show, has
become as much a ''Memory'' as the song that was its most
persistent refrain.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly 18-year run, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical
closed with a roar Sunday at the Winter Garden Theater before an
invited audience of friends and fans.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered, screamed and even cried during an emotional,
confetti-strewn final performance - No. 7,485 - that was
interrupted by several standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight is the last night of 'Cats'' first life on Broadway,''
Lloyd Webber said after the exuberant cast and orchestra players
took their bows. ''So I wouldn't get too excited. I don't quite
know what the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, who wrote the show's music, was applauded as soon

most applause? For ''The Jellicle Ball,'' a big dance number near
the end of the first act, which received the night's longest
standing ovation, literally stopping the show.

<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - A 35-year-old woman is dead following a
head-on crash that injured two others, according to sheriff's
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Garrow, 35, was driving west in an eastbound lane,
Madison County deputies said, when she struck a car occupied by Amy
L. Carinci, 22, and John W. Christensen, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Garrow, of Chittenango in Madison County, was pronounced dead at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carinci and Christensen were airlifted to University Hospital by
the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department and Mercy Flight Medi-Vac
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   A nursing supervisor said both were in fair condition Sunday
evening. They were being treated for facial injuries and possible
leg fractures, deputies said.

<HEADLINE> Fashion, Nerves Arrive at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA PEYTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Television's big night began on a red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the ceremony began for the 52nd Annual Primetime
Emmy Awards, another show unfolded outside the Shrine Auditorium:
celebrities showing off everything from fashion to family to, in
many cases, nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Chianese of ''The Sopranos,'' nominated for best
supporting actor in a dramatic series, said, ''I found myself
sitting at home all day, trying to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Peter Boyle, of ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' held out his
hands to show he wasn't nervous. ''I'm pretty calm. I think we have
a good chance for best show.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Franz of ''NYPD Blue'' said his numerous Emmy appearances
have helped him take it in stride. He was more interested in
showing off his new Peter Barnes suit with a tag inside that read:
''Tailored for Dennis Franz.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schiff of ''The West Wing'' and his wife Sheila Kelly
were celebrating more than his win for best supporting actor in a
drama series: Two weeks ago, they had a baby girl, Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very exciting time right now and also stressful,''
Schiff said. ''We breastfed her in the car on the way over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I breastfed her,'' Kelly said. ''He watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff told reporters waiting for the winner to be announced was
like looking down the barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything slows down and your mind goes blank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CBS' mega-hit ''Survivor'' wasn't nominated for any Emmy awards,
but a handful of cast members showed up anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Boesch, often seen shirtless on the show, wore a black
tailored suit. ''This is as dressed as you're going to see me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch, the last survivor and newest millionaire, was
also on hand, as was runner-up Kelly Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hawk, the loudmouthed trucker, said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria, who won the supporting actor award for the ABC
miniseries ''Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie,'' said
it was great to win, but ''working with Jack Lemmon was better.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those times where the real person exceeds the
legend,'' he said, clutching his Emmy during backstage interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Azaria revealed the secret of Lemmon's success: ''Before every
take, Jack says the words, 'Magic time.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sean Hayes, who won best supporting actor in a comedy series,
said NBC's ''Will &AMP; Grace'' was not trying to make a statement
about homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our motto is funny first, and anything that happens to
follow that is great. We just want to make people laugh,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Dutton wanted to celebrate his best
director award for the HBO miniseries ''The Corner'' at the 52nd
Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But instead he found himself backstage defending the six-part
miniseries chronicling a family in the grip of drug addiction and
street corner sales.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the show promoted stereotypes, Dutton said his
movie was a true story and blamed the media for inaccurately
portraying the storyline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is ... there are probably more white heroin addicts
than black. But I'm not going to make this a social thing,'' he
said. ''This is a story I think needed to be told. If we're going
to do an African-American story, let's make it real, true and
gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries was based on the David Simon and Edward Burns
book, ''The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner City
Neighborhood,'' a critically acclaimed view of how drug addicts
live.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton was chosen as the director for his introspectiveness and
his Baltimore roots.

   It was a bittersweet night for Halle Berry after winning the
best actress award for her role in HBO's ''Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who also served as executive producer, spent more than
six years trying to persuade Hollywood studios to take on the
project. When she couldn't get a deal, she turned to cable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I'm happy, I'm also a little sad because this is sort
of the end of my Dorothy Dandridge journey,'' she said shortly
after accepting the Emmy. ''Life is going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry also has walked off with a Golden Globe award and an NAACP
Image award for her portrayal of Dandridge.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward said she was shocked when her name was called out as
best actress in drama series for ABC's ''Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The show was overlooked in terms of nominations. So I thought
I didn't have a chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was critically acclaimed but struggling for
ratings, didn't rate a best show nomination
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to carry the banner for the whole show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin was tied up in knots over the Emmy wins for NBC's
''The West Wing,'' but the show's writer and creator couldn't get
his tie tied.
</P>
<P>
   ''It fell apart,'' he said. ''Now, I'm going for that Sammy
Davis look.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shandling Sparkled At Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''I said to my mother, 'I'm hosting the
Emmys,''' cracked Garry Shandling. ''She said, 'You do what you
have to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness he did.
</P>
<P>
   Neurotic, self-embarrassed and fearlessly ironic, Shandling
turned Sunday's Emmycast into a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   Aired live on ABC from Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium, ''The
52nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards'' was what it always is: an
overlong display of gussied-up stars and mostly hollow tributes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, no problem. Even when absent from the handsome
grids-and-cubes stage setting, Shandling drolly ruled. With his wry
stewardship, he kept everything honest.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what slows this show down?'' he mused. ''Seriously:
the awards. They should just tape 'em under the winners' seats.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he yanked things into perspective again by
introducing a few TV clips ''overlooked by the Academy'': monster
truck races, ''Jerry Springer,'' Weather Channel forecasts and a
woman hawking watches on Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   He did a quick, apparently off-the-cuff interview with the
onstage ''trophy girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I started as a trophy girl,'' he told her. ''And now I'm
host.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a backhanded compliment to the cable network that aired
his bygone comedy series ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' Shandling
observed that an acceptance speech could go on for days if HBO,
rather than ABC, were airing the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling's style of keeping it real (or at least an irreverent
facsimile of real) proved infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Former ''Seinfeld'' player Michael Richards delivered a lengthy,
impassioned thank-you speech for having been chosen by the Academy
as a presenter, seeming to forget all about presenting the award.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael J. Fox made sport of his Parkinson's tremors in a
mock-impromptu backstage encounter with Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your tie is all screwed up,'' Fox told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could you fix it?'' Shandling asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe me,'' warned Fox, producing his shaky hands, ''you
don't want ...''
</P>
<P>
   Later, no one could have failed to be touched by Fox's brief but
heartfelt acceptance for his Best Comedy Actor award.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actor Jack Lemmon, who won for his performance in the TV
film ''Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with Morrie,'' also won
himself a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them elegantly gowned and great with child, tandem
presenters Jane Leeves (''Frasier'') and Kelli Williams (''The
Practice'') made a lovely sight.
</P>
<P>
   And presenter Cher, as always a welcome addition, scored with
her dyed-blond tresses and accompanying dumb-blonde joke.
</P>
<P>
   But the night belonged to Shandling, who even put his imprint on
the night's biggest winner, White House drama ''The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I read for the part of vice president,'' he disclosed. ''They
said, 'Too Jewish.'''
</P>
<P>
   The season past was an odd one whose biggest craze, reality TV,
flew under the Academy's radar. But not Shandling's.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, the Emmycast (which Shandling said ABC considered
renaming ''Who Wants to Win an Emmy?'') began uproariously with a
taped sketch spoofing CBS' summer smash ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a setting that looked exactly like remote Pulau Tiga,
''Survivor'' host Jeff Probst convened a tribal council to decide
who would host the Emmy show (and receive the Pontiac Aztec).
</P>
<P>
   Among Shandling's fellow castaways were Arsenio Hall, who
complained that Shandling was ''walking around buck naked on the
island,'' and Craig Kilborn of ''The Late, Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted, it was Shandling who was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I just take the car?'' he begged Probst.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, Garry, you have to host.''
</P>
<P>
   If viewers are lucky, he'll have to host again next year.

<HEADLINE> Heaton Likes Practical Emmy Fasion  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Patricia Heaton tried on 20 different dresses
before settling on a body-hugging, low-cut number with yellow
stitched flowers and silver beading for Sunday's Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the kind of outfit the long-suffering housewife she plays
on CBS' ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' would wear. But practicality
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whichever dress I could get the scaffolding underneath without
it showing, that's the one I picked,'' said Heaton, who won lead
actress in a comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Mullally of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' winner for supporting comedy
actress, wore a jeweled butterfly ring that covered most of her
right hand. Wearing a crinkled navy dress with a plunging
V-neckline, Mullally joked she needed a towel to mop up the sweat
on a sizzling afternoon outside the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Red proved a popular color with actresses unafraid of blending
into the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston of ''Friends,'' who lost to Mullally, donned a
long strapless red satin gown beside new husband Brad Pitt. Aniston
wore her long hair straight and pulled back -- a change from last
year's piles of curls.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees Debra Messing of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' Stockard Channing
and Molly Shannon also shined in red satin dresses during the
preshow fashion parade.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and silver showed up in clothing and makeup, including the
shimmery silver eyeshadow worn by Laura Innes of ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, star of ''The Practice,'' worked her way through
the gridlock of celebrities and publicists in a long gray flannel
dress and matching wrap by Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to be cutting edge,'' Manheim said. ''I put this on at
2:45 and I was here at 3:30. Time management.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Cattrall, a nominee for ''Sex and the City,'' set off her
gray matte jersey long skirt with a gray beaded top with cap
sleeves by Randolph Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I wanted was to feel really comfortable and relaxed,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker, Cattrall's co-star, floated in a short
dress with a full skirt accented by pale pink feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Leeves of ''Frasier,'' who is expecting a baby in January,
wore a simple deep-purple long dress held up by a single spaghetti
strap that formed a V.
</P>
<P>
   Black was a color staple for most of the male actors. Steven Van
Zandt of ''The Sopranos'' accented his black tuxedo with a
trademark bandanna pulled low on his forehead. He seemed taken
aback by the red-carpet chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a nice low level of celebrity,'' he said. ''People say
hello and they keep walking.''

<HEADLINE> Gay-Themed Shows Fare Well At Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The big Emmy winner was the heartwarming
political drama ''The West Wing,'' but numerous wins by gay-themed
programs had Hollywood's elite buzzing backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Many said those victories Sunday were a sign that network
television is now freer than ever to let homosexual characters out
of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC odd-couple sitcom ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' about a gay man
whose best friend is a straight woman, won four Emmys, including
two for supporting roles. Vanessa Redgrave won a supporting actress
award for playing an aging lesbian in the HBO movie ''If These
Walls Could Talk 2.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning for best comedy series, the co-executive producer
and creator of ''Will &AMP; Grace'' joked to the audience that he was
overcome by the female form of the Emmy statuette.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God, she's so beautiful. As a gay man, I can't believe
I'm saying this, but I think I finally met a girl I want to sleep
with,'' said Max Mutchnick.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hayes, who plays Will's flamboyantly gay friend ''Jack'' on
the show, insisted ''Will &AMP; Grace'' is not a commentary on the
status of gays in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our motto is 'funny first,' and anything that happens
to follow that is great. We just want to make people laugh,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the doors are starting to open to these characters,''
said David Kohan, the other co-executive producer of ''Will &AMP;
Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC sitcom ''Ellen,'' starring Ellen Degeneres, seemed to
lose viewers in 1998 when the character revealed she was a lesbian.
However, Kohan dismissed that concern, saying the audience wasn't
ready then.
</P>
<P>
   ''She changed the character in the middle (of the series),'' he
said. Audiences may have been more accepting, he added, ''if she
started 'out' and stayed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seomin, the entertainment media director of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said the networks are now
proving they can showcase people who are out of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the gays and lesbians are perceived is significantly
shaped by television,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Denounce Media Violence  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The movie, video game and music industries
aggressively market to underage youths violent films and products
that carry adult ratings, federal regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   A report being released Monday by the Federal Trade Commission
says that even movies rated R -- which require an adult to accompany
children under 17 to the theater -- and video games that carry an M
rating for people age 17 and over are routinely targeted toward
younger people, said sources familiar with the report's contents.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are derived in part from documents submitted by
the industry itself, including marketing plans that demonstrate the
efforts of companies to advertise to young audiences materials
designated for adults, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and video game industries have voluntary age-based
rating code systems. The recording industry has a more general
label that warns of explicit content in music.
</P>
<P>
   FTC spokesman Eric London declined to comment in advance on
specifics of the report, the product of a yearlong investigation
ordered by President Clinton. He said, however, the study would be
noteworthy for ''the light that it sheds on how this kind of
entertainment material is marketed by the industry itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The study included a survey of marketing practices and found
most of the R-rated films and M-rated video games examined included
promotional efforts targeting underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not suggest legislation, but seeks more
effective self-regulation by the entertainment industry and
enforcement of rating codes by retailers and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore and his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, said they would propose legislation or new
regulatory authority to sanction the entertainment industry if it
doesn't stop marketing violence to children within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the industry promises parents that it will not market
violent material to children and then proceeds to do so, then the
industry's practices could constitute false and deceptive
advertising,'' Gore told The New York Times in an interview
published Monday. It's a new stand for the vice president, although
his wife Tipper is known for opposition to explicit music lyrics.
Lieberman has been a leading congressional critic of violent
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, spokesman for Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush, said the Texas governor ''believes the
entertainment industry has to take personal responsibility for the
products it provides to our children. And parents also have a role
to play. We're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee plans to hold a hearing Wednesday
on the findings, with Lieberman scheduled to attend. He and
committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., backed a measure last year
that requested the study.
</P>
<P>
   Following Senate passage, Clinton ordered the report himself,
using money from the White House budget. He acted after a spate of
deadly school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders questioned what conclusions the government
could draw from scrutinizing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are causing moral decay in this country, we ought to
have an explosion of crime,'' Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America, said Sunday. ''The exact opposite
is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that any evaluation of the marketing practices of
moviemakers can only be subjective and praised Hollywood's
voluntary rating system.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment
of our national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at
the box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   Video game makers stress that more than 70 percent of their
customers are over 18. According to the Interactive Digital
Software Association, the industry trade group, adults buy nine of
every 10 video and computer games sold in the United States. Only 7
percent of video games sold and rated since 1995 fall into the
mature category.
</P>
<P>
   But public interest groups said the new study could expose
efforts by the industries to circumvent their own labeling system.
For example, creating children's toys based on an R-rated movie
enables the industry ''to go right ahead in a very surreptitious
ways to market to kids,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the
Center for Media Education.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers have pledged to increase enforcement of the game
code. Kmart announced last week that it would stop selling M-rated
games to anyone under 17, using a barcode scanner that will prompt
cashiers to ask youths for identification. Wal-Mart said it would
adopt a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains, including Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and
Co., have stopped selling the M-rated games altogether.

<HEADLINE> Fed's Rate Boosts Said Near End  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of top economic forecasters believes
the Federal Reserve's 15-month string of interest rates boosts to
ward off inflation is near an end.
</P>
<P>
   Economists ''seemed increasingly optimistic that the Fed has
successfully countered any inflation threat to the economy and they
have adopted an optimistic outlook for interest rates,'' the
National Association for Business Economics said Monday in its
quarterly economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ''Panelists are increasingly convinced that the run-up in
interest rates is at its end,'' the group said in its survey, which
is based on forecasts made by 30 of the association's 3,000 members
in the last two weeks of August.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has boosted interest rate six times since June 1999 to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters, citing solid advances in business investment
and both exports and imports, revised upward their forecasts for
the economy's growth this year as measured by the gross domestic
product, the total output of goods and services within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They said they now expect GDP to increase 5.2 percent in 2000,
up from their previous estimate of 4.9 percent. If the 5.2 percent
GDP increase is realized, it would be the strongest economic growth
since a 7.3 percent advance in 1984. In 1999, the economy grew by
4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters estimated that GDP will grow by 3.3 percent in
2001, up from 3 percent in the previous survey in May.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in oil prices led economists to boost their inflation
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   They now estimate that inflation as measured by the Consumer
Price Index on a year-over-year basis will increase to 3.3 percent
this year, compared with its earlier estimate of 3.0 percent. In
1999, the CPI rose 2.2 percent on a year-over-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the forecasters expect inflation to moderate to 2.7
percent, unchanged from the previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also said they were bullish about the prospects of
continued strong gains in productivity -- the amount of output for
each hour of work.
</P>
<P>
   Sizable gains means companies can pay employees more and still
hold the line on prices. Computers, satellites and other
technological advances are credited with helping boost workers'
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong productivity gains, still-low inflation despite rising
energy costs ... all provide the basis for solid growth with no end
to the expansion in sight,'' said Richard Berner, NABE's vice
president and managing director and chief economist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.

<HEADLINE> Russians Deny Probe of Sub Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian official on Monday denied reports
that the nation's security service was investigating last month's
sinking of a nuclear submarine and had presented its findings to
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the head of a
government commission investigating the Aug. 12 disaster, also
reiterated Russia's denials that the Kursk was sunk by a missile
fired by a Russian ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, the Russian navy and Klebanov's
commission had already rejected a German newspaper report Friday
that the Kursk was hit by a new anti-submarine missile fired by a
nuclear-powered cruiser, the Peter the Great. The ship's commander
also denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also denied reports the Federal Security Service, the
FSB, had given Putin secret documents relating to the disaster, and
that the secret service had begun its own inquiry, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman refused to comment on the report Monday,
referring callers to a secret service statement last week that
denied the Kursk was sunk by a Russian torpedo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with
another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified
foreign submarine. All 118 officers and sailors aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ushakov, an aide to Russia's chief military prosecutor,
said Monday it was clear another vessel had caused the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have ''enough data that the collision with the
Kursk submarine was the blame of those officials who navigated an
unidentified marine craft,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation ''in no way blames the Kursk crew,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the Kursk's sinking was most likely
caused by the misfiring of one of its torpedoes.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Power-Share Deal Signed  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- One of four holdout Tutsi
political parties signed a power-sharing agreement with Burundi's
Hutu majority on Monday, two days before the deadline for joining
the peace plan aimed at ending Burundi's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Godefroid Hakizimana, president of Burundi's Social Democratic
Party, signed the document as mediators working with former South
African President Nelson Mandela, who brokered the accord, looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   The party had refused to sign the agreement Aug. 28 in Arusha,
Tanzania, in the presence of international leaders including
President Clinton, because of last-minute changes to the deal made
to accommodate Burundi's President Pierre Buyoya, Hakizimana said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have read the agreement and found that there is a global
compromise which answers concerns, particularly those raised by our
party,'' Hakizimana said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 19 groups taking part in the talks to end Burundi's
seven-year civil war, the government, the military and seven Hutu
parties signed the agreement. Six of the 10 Tutsi political parties
signed, but with severe reservations about much of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace agreement, however, the violence in the tiny
central African country has not ended.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Maj. Eduard Nibigira said Hutu rebels fired a
rocket at a military barracks outside the capital on Monday,
killing one soldier and injuring three. The army fired at the
rebels who attacked Kanyosha and Kabezi, about nine miles south of
Bujumbura, killing 10 people, Nibigira said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement contains no provision for a cease-fire, and Hutu
rebels have yet to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The three remaining Tutsi parties that have refused to endorse
the document are to meet with Mandela on Wednesday in South Africa
for clarification on some issues, said Mark Bomani, the head of
Mandela's team.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's Hutu rebels, who have been fighting the
Tutsi-dominated government since the October 1993 assassination of
the nation's first democratically elected president -- a Hutu -- have
met with Mandela but refused to participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the fighting. Hutus make up the majority of Burundi's population,
but Tutsis control the government, the military and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The process of implementing the agreement begins Sept. 25 with a
meeting of all signatories to the document in Arusha, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within 60 days of signing the document, the parties are
invited to nominate three representatives each to the National
Assembly,'' Bomani said. ''They are also expected to make
nominations to the government of national unity and nominate an
implementation committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya's government is scheduled to meet with rebel leaders on
Sept. 20 in Nairobi, Kenya, to begin negotiating a cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela will meet Tuesday with the leaders of the rebel Forces
for Defense of Democracy, or FDD, and the National Liberation
Front, or FNL, to lay the groundwork for the talks, Bomani said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Monday after losses last

<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call for Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian negotiators called
Monday for new Israeli concessions in recognition of this week's
decision to postpone the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat urged Israel to recognize
Palestinian sovereignty over a sensitive mosque compound in
Jerusalem's walled Old City, and Planning Minister Nabil Shaath
said Israel should withdraw to the 1967 borders and accept the
right of the Palestinian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately rejected the demand. Acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami said the postponement is ''commendable,'' but ''this
is not something we should pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Oslo interim agreement, Palestinian independence was
to be negotiated with the Israelis as part of the permanent
agreement, in which all the other tough issues, such as borders,
the refugees and the future of Jerusalem, would also be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian public opinion became increasingly impatient as the
negotiations dragged on, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
promised that if no agreement was reached he would make a
unilateral declaration of independence by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Sunday, the Palestinian Central Council, the PLO's
policy-making body, said the declaration would not be made until at
least Nov. 15 and perhaps not even then.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters before leaving for the United Nations
General Assembly session, Ben-Ami said the postponement gave the
peace talks ''a new lease on life,'' but insisted that the talks
must continue on the basis of ideas raised at the U.S.-sponsored
Camp David talks in July.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians suggested the price they were asking for the delay
was a reversal of some of the far-reaching concessions they had
agreed to at the U.S.-sponsored Camp David talks in July. Israel
also proposed far-reaching concessions at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   At those talks at a presidential retreat in Maryland,
Palestinians for the first time agreed to concede land within
territory Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war -- the first Arab
negotiators to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said such concessions were no
longer on the table -- the Palestinians had conceded enough in 1993
when they recognized Israel's existence.
</P>
<P>
   ''To come to the Palestinians again and try to snatch a piece
here, 5 percent there. ... It's not going to work,'' he told
Israeli army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said ''we hope that the Israeli government will be
committed to the basis of the peace process,'' meaning U.N.
resolutions calling for withdrawal from occupied territory and the
right of the refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has offered to admit a limited
number of refugees to Israel but said he would not recognize
Israeli moral or legal responsibility for the plight of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   It was over the future of Jerusalem that the talks broke down
and neither side showed any sign of budging Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Israel will
never give up sovereignty over the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in
Jerusalem, because it is also the site of the first and second
Jewish temples. ''We will not under any circumstances forgo our
sovereignty over the Jewish holy places,'' he told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has offered the Palestinians ''full functional
autonomy,'' at the site, but the Palestinians insist on nothing
less than sovereignty. ''The Haram as-Sharif (Holy Sanctuary) is
one of the most sacred sites of Islam,'' Erekat told Israeli army
radio. ''I don't want to deny anyone's belief but they should not
impose their beliefs on us.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Barak suggested Sunday that he was willing to
consider less than full Israeli sovereignty over the site, provided
it was not handed to sole Palestinian control.

<HEADLINE> Freed Hostages Arrive In Libya  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- A plane carrying four former hostages
freed by Muslim rebels in the Philippines arrived in Tripoli on
Monday, amid fears that fat Libyan payoffs would only encourage
more hostage taking.
</P>
<P>
   Libya reportedly paid $1 million each to secure freedom for the
German, Frenchman and two Finns who flew out of the Philippines on
Monday after being held for months by the Abu Sayyef, the smaller
of two rebel groups fighting for an independent Muslim state in the
southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   First to appear at the aircraft's door was Libyan negotiator
Rajab Azzarouq, who triumphantly waved to the dozens of
well-wishers and journalists waiting on the tarmac. The hostages
followed, carrying bouquets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were quick to praise Libya for securing their
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have done a really great job,'' said former
hostage Risto Vahanen of Finland. ''It may be possible that they've
saved our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   After showing the arrival of the aircraft, Libyan state
television began broadcasting patriotic songs over footage of
hostages and reporters inside the VIP lounge.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the four hostages were released Saturday, three men,
all Malaysians, were abducted from near where Abu Sayyaf rebels
kidnapped 21 people, including the four Europeans, on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   One Filipino resort worker remains in captivity from the group
captured in April. Two French television journalists, seized when
they visited the rebels' camp, are still being held by the Abu
Sayyaf. The guerrillas are also holding 12 Filipino Christian
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Another faction is holding American Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan officials have denied ransom was paid, saying they
instead secured the rebels' confidence by funding development
projects in the impoverished, heavily Muslim southern Philippines.
But negotiators in the Philippines said Libya paid $1 million
ransom for each of the four released Saturday and another $1
million each for six released late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paying ransom ultimately comes back to bite you,'' said
Philippine presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   The released hostages have reported sudden signs of wealth in
the rebel camp -- new clothes, gold jewelry. Negotiations for the
remaining hostages have been suspended because of fighting among
the Abu Sayyaf factions, reportedly over the division of the ransom
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no payment with the aim of encouraging the
kidnappers to carry on more operations,'' Ali El Tureiki, Libya's
state minister of African affairs, told reporters in Tripoli this
week. ''The agreement was to do some projects to help the Muslims
in the south Philippines, and the areas Libya considers itself
morally responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Libya has long-standing ties with Muslim rebels in the
mostly Catholic Philippines. In addition to negotiating in previous
kidnappings, it has helped build schools and mosques in the south
and has been accused of training members of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, the larger Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ransom concerns, Libya was reaping diplomatic
rewards for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, long accused of sponsoring terrorism and meddling in the
affairs of other countries, is working to end years of
international isolation. International sanctions were suspended
last year when Libya handed over for trial in the West two of its
government officials accused in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja headed to the north
African nation to participate in a welcome ceremony for the
hostages scheduled Tuesday. France and Germany were sending
lower-ranking officials from their foreign ministries, though
diplomats in Tripoli said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
in New York on Monday for U.N. meetings, would try to reach Tripoli
in time for Tuesday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ceremony held for the six former hostages released
last month was an anti-American affair, held at the ruins of the
house where Gadhafi's adopted daughter was killed in a 1986 U.S.
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The freed hostages were Vahanen and Seppo Franti of Finland;
German Marc Wallert, whose parents were earlier released; and
Stephane Loisy of France.

<HEADLINE> Feds Accuse Entertainment Industry  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The movie, video game and music industries
aggressively market to underage youths violent products that carry
adult ratings, federal regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the Federal Trade Commission says
that even movies rated R -- which require an adult to accompany
children under 17 to the theater -- and video games that carry an M
rating for 17 and over are routinely targeted toward younger
people.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore seized the issue for his
campaign, calling for a voluntary ''cease-fire'' in marketing
inappropriate material to children and threatening federal action
if the industry fails to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponent George W. Bush agreed the industry needs to
do a better job policing itself. But he questioned Gore's
credibility on the issue, asserting that the vice president had
failed until now to take a strong stand on violence in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC pointed to materials submitted by the industry, showing
intentional plans to promote their products to underage audiences.
One document disclosed that a company's primary audience to sell
M-rated video games was boys 12-17. Despite the age rating, ''the
younger the audience, the more likely they are to be influenced by
TV advertising,'' it said. A marketing plan for an R movie stated
its purpose was to ''make sure everyone between the ages of 12-18
was exposed to the film.'' Company names were edited out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's their documents. They knew what they were doing,'' said
FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who commissioned the investigation,
challenged the entertainment industry to be responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people will give, I think, the entertainment
industry a period now to fix this but something has to be done,''
Clinton said, during a campaign-style appearance in Scarsdale,
N.Y., with his wife, Hillary, who is running for the Senate. ''They
say these rating systems mean something. They can't turn around and
advertise to people that shouldn't see this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is not pressing for more legislation, walking a
careful line not to trigger First Amendment concerns. But the FTC
wants the industry to expand voluntary codes prohibiting such
practices and to sanction companies that run afoul of these
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, said they
would propose legislation or new regulatory authority to sanction
the entertainment industry if it doesn't stop marketing violence to
children within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the industry makes a promise not to market inappropriate
material to children but then does so, it could be guilty of false
advertising,'' they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that parents and the industry need to do more
''to reduce the violence that our children see on the screen.'' But
he accused Gore of suddenly seeking to capitalize on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the man's short on credibility on the issue,'' Bush
said, citing the millions Gore has received from the entertainment
industry in political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky has asked his staff to study whether laws governing
deceptive and unfair trade practices would apply and if enforcement
action could be brought against companies, if the behavior
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and video game industries have voluntary age-based
rating code systems. The recording industry has a more general
label that warns of explicit content in music.
</P>
<P>
   Of 44 R movies studied by the FTC, 35 were targeted to children
under 17. Of 118 games carrying an M rating, 83 targeted children
under 17 and all of the 55 music recordings with explicit-content
labels were targeted to children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee plans a hearing on the report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders questioned what conclusions the government
could draw from scrutinizing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are causing moral decay in this country, we ought to
have an explosion of crime,'' Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America, said Sunday. ''The exact opposite
is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that any evaluation of the marketing practices of
moviemakers can only be subjective and praised Hollywood's
voluntary rating system.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment
of our national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at
the box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   Video game makers stress that more than 70 percent of their
customers are over 18. According to the Interactive Digital
Software Association, the industry trade group, adults buy nine of
every 10 video and computer games sold in the United States. Only 7
percent of video games sold and rated since 1995 fall into the
mature category.
</P>
<P>
   But public interest groups said the new study could expose
efforts by the industries to circumvent their own labeling system.
For example, creating children's toys based on an R-rated movie
enables the industry ''to go right ahead in a very surreptitious
ways to market to kids,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the
Center for Media Education.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Removed From Soldier's Leg  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Surgeons wearing bulletproof vests
gingerly removed a live grenade from the leg of a Russian soldier
wounded in Chechnya, doctors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The grenade broke Pvt. Andrian Chebodayev's left thigh bone and
stuck in his leg without exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors considered amputation -- which would have reduced the
possibility of an explosion -- but then decided to try to remove the
grenade, surgeons said on Russia's RTR television station.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling was, well, this is our job, there's no other
way,'' said surgeon Igor Pesikin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fuse could have gone off, and the fuse was situated so
that the slightest bump or movement of the bone could have led to
an explosion,'' said military doctor Andrei Tikhnayakov.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was performed in a fortified pit at a field hospital
in Khankala, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital Grozny,
according to RTR and the ITAR-Tass news agency. The reports didn't
say when it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had no protection other than bulletproof vests, said
Pesikin.
</P>
<P>
   After the hour-long surgery, Chebodayev was flown to a hospital
in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the nearby Russian republic of North
Ossetia, RTR reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an official of the pro-Russian government in Chechnya
was ambushed and shot to death by rebels, a government spokesman
said Monday, in the latest of a string of assassinations of
Chechens who work for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Bukora Akhmadov, head of administration in the village of
Oktyabrskoye, was shot 12 times Saturday by attackers who stopped
his car, spokesman Alexander Machevsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military claims that rebel resistance has been all
but crushed after a year of fighting, but the rebels show no sign
of giving up their struggle for independence and mount almost daily
attacks on the federal forces.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Monday, despite a surge in

<HEADLINE> State steps up outreach to owners of unclaimed property  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lisa Livingston was trying to cash a
check at her bank last week when she was told her account had been
flagged.
</P>
<P>
   The problem turned out to be a blessing: The New Canaan mother
of two learned she had money coming to her from an insurance policy
canceled more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The money had been held by the state Treasurer's office, part of
a $270 million fund of unclaimed property. Under a 1939 state law,
the treasurer must safeguard the property - which includes
forgotten bank accounts, stocks and bonds and the contents of safe
deposit boxes - until the owners are found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea I was supposed to get this,'' said Livingston,
who declined to say how much she received. She said her insurer had
canceled the policy when her now 13-year-old son was diagnosed as
an infant with a rare neurological illness. ''I never dreamed I
would hear from them again.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state has expanded its database of names and put
a portion of it online to make it easier for people to find and
claim their assets. Treasurer Denise Nappier kicked off the new
outreach campaign Monday, which includes the Web site and a special
insert which will go out in papers across the state on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is risk-free,'' Nappier said, holding up a copy of the
80-page insert which includes the newest 29,000 names in a registry
of 1.5 million. The Web site lists 500,000 names.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of us like to play the lottery and that's fine, but on
Sept. 13, you should read this too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the state returned more than $9 million to 4,500
people - the largest amount ever, Nappier said. The single biggest
claim was $84,000 to a Waterbury man, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge for claiming property, which can be done
using the Web site, a toll-free number or a mail-in coupon in the
newspaper insert.
</P>
<P>
   Property is usually declared unclaimed about three to five years
after the holder loses contact with the owner, and the state must
keep it indefinitely. The list of people owed property is updated
every six months.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the state about $2 million to run the unclaimed
property division, but Nappier said the funds generate more than
enough interest to cover the budget. She said it is important to
find the property's owners to limit the liability of the agency
holding the funds and give people what is rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said she would use the funds for her son, who
requires around-the-clock nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is such a nice thing to do for people,'' she said. ''I'm
going to go buy him something big.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to make a claim, go online at
www.nameitandclaimit.org or call (800) 833-7318 weekdays from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. For Spanish speakers, the toll-free number is (800)
618-3404.

<HEADLINE> 'West Wing,''Morrie' Win at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Once again, crime didn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the election of a new U.S. president, the Emmy
Awards elbowed aside the mob-focused ''The Sopranos'' to shower
honors on the White House drama ''The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's freshman series won a record-setting nine Emmys on Sunday,
including best drama. Only James Gandolfini's best acting trophy
prevented a shutout for ''The Sopranos'' after 18 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish we had done a little better,'' Gandolfini said after
the show. It was the second straight year ''The Sopranos'' met
mostly with Emmy disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the surreal drama may be a little too dark and
violent for many Emmy voters. Some of Hollywood's old guard also
may be reluctant to vote for a cable show instead of one on the
broadcast networks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, 'West Wing' is a very good show, from what I
understand,'' he said. ''I've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC was thrilled with ratings for the Emmys. The show drew an
average audience of 21.6 million people, a 23 percent increase over
1999 and the biggest audience since at least 1986. ABC attributed
the jump at least partly to its ability to promote the show on the
popular ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''West Wing'' is an uplifting look at political life not weighed
down with cynicism. Its characters try to do the right thing, even
if they don't always succeed. Real Washington leaders are
constantly thanking producers for their portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ''By and large in movies and television shows, the country's
leaders are portrayed as either dolts or Machiavellian,'' series
creator Aaron Sorkin said. ''Here, they are neither. They're very
bright, committed and energetic people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin won an Emmy for his writing; Thomas Schlamme for
directing. Richard Schiff, who plays the grim aide Toby Ziegler,
and Allison Janney, who plays the White House's tough press
secretary, won supporting actor awards. The show won four other
technical awards.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether ''The West Wing'' educates viewers about politics,
Sorkin replied: ''We're not asking anyone to eat their
vegetables.'' But he said he was pleased that some people have
credited his show with exciting people about the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sheen, President Josiah Bartlet in ''The West Wing,'' was
dead-on walking into the Emmys with his prediction that Gandolfini
would beat him for best actor, but his show would win best series.
</P>
<P>
   ''James was selected MVP, but we won the game,'' Sheen said.
''That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy voters showed their sentimental sides Sunday. Michael J.
Fox won best actor in a comedy for his final performance in ''Spin
City'' before retiring because of Parkinson's disease. Jack Lemmon
won best actor in a miniseries or movie for ''Oprah Winfrey
Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Both veteran actors drew standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will &AMP; Grace'' was selected best comedy, boosting the show as
it moves to Thursday nights. Its supporting actors, Sean Hayes and
Megan Mullally, each won their first Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, David Letterman's ''Late Show'' won
the award for best variety series. It came during a year Letterman
had to take a break for an emergency quintuple bypass operation in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dave, if you're watching at home, it looks like the fake heart
surgery paid off,'' said the show's executive producer, Rob
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners: Patricia Heaton, comedian Ray Romano's
long-suffering wife in ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' as best actress
in a comedy; Sela Ward of ''Once and Again'' as best actress in a
drama; Lorne Michaels, the originator of ''Saturday Night Live,''
for the show's 25th anniversary special. Multiple winners included
''Tuesdays With Morrie'' and HBO's series about a tough Baltimore
neighborhood, ''The Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in
voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out
videotapes for voters to watch at home. As a result, more than
2,500 people voted this year as opposed to 650 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to think this change in the voting is working
extremely well,'' said Heaton, clutching her award.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the awards -- particularly Heaton's quiet victory
over Jenna Elfman of ''Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and Sarah Jessica Parker of
''Sex and the City'' -- indicate that most voters took their jobs
seriously, said Thomas O'Neill, author of ''The Emmys'' and a
frequent critic of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we saw the proof we needed that voters really watched
the tapes,'' O'Neill said. ''The biggest winner tonight was the
Emmy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC won bragging rights with 23 Emmys. HBO had 20 awards, ABC
had 15, Fox had 11 and CBS had 7.

<HEADLINE> Foe: Lieberman Is Neglecting Senate  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman's Senate challenger is
accusing him of being an absentee politician, forsaking his
Connecticut constituents for a shot at the vice presidency -- even
as he seeks re-election.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the attacks to do much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has missed all six of the roll call votes the Senate
has taken since the summer break during which he was tapped as Al
Gore's Democratic running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be in Washington Wednesday for a hearing on a
Federal Trade Commission report accusing entertainment industries
of marketing violence to minors. Otherwise, he isn't expected to
spend much time in town during the waning days of this
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   And other than a scheduled Oct. 19 debate against his Senate
challenger, it's unlikely Lieberman will campaign heavily in
Connecticut against Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 campaign commercial, Lieberman likened his Senate
opponent then -- Republican incumbent Lowell Weicker -- to a
slumbering, snoring bear who missed votes in Congress so he could
cash in on lucrative speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Now Giordano says, ''Notwithstanding Joe Lieberman's good voting
record, if he does miss a lot of votes now, it displays his lack of
commitment to the state of Connecticut,'' Giordano said. ''He's not
working on the state's behalf, and he's not serious about
campaigning here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't shut the lights off and locked the door,'' said
Kelly Moore, Lieberman's press secretary. ''Running for both
offices is clearly a difficult balancing act, but the people of
Connecticut are not being neglected. The senator will be here when
he is needed, and he's serious about his Senate run.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle says he's not concerned about
Lieberman's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe has indicated his willingness to come back on critical
occasions when we need his vote,'' Daschle said. ''He will drop
what he's doing regardless of where he is and be there when we need
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale University political science professor John Lapinski said
Republicans will have a tough time making criticism of Lieberman's
absenteeism stick.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's an important vote that the Republicans could nail
him on, you can bet that he'll come back to Washington and vote,''
Lapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   And a lack of face time with Connecticut voters shouldn't have
much of an impact on his popularity, pollsters say. In a Quinnipiac
College poll taken in July, Lieberman eclipsed Giordano, 71 percent
to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's really nothing that Giordano can do to affect people's
perception of Joe Lieberman,'' said Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac's
polling director.
</P>
<P>
   Along with more name recognition, Lieberman also has more money
-- more than $3 million to Giordano's $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman won't be knocking on many Connecticut doors,
family members have been going to fairs, parades and other
community gatherings to pitch his run for Senate. TV commercials
are coming up, said Ken Dagliere, Lieberman's Senate campaign
political director.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman wins both elections, he will have to resign his
Senate seat. That would give Republican Gov. John G. Rowland the
chance to appoint a successor
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are urging Lieberman to drop his Senate race so
the party has time to run a strong candidate and maintain a seat.
But Daschle said Lieberman is doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's invested 12 years to his Senate career,'' Daschle said.
''People would accuse him of being overconfident if he gave up his
Senate candidacy to run strictly as a vice president.''

<HEADLINE> Kohl Attends Session of His Party  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Disgraced former Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned
to his party's fold Monday, attending a meeting of party lawmakers
for the first time since setting off a slush fund scandal last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who retained his seat in parliament after losing the
chancellorship in 1998, had skipped the regular strategy sessions
of the Christian Democratic parliamentary group for 10 months after
he fell from grace by admitting that he accepted illegal campaign
donations.
</P>
<P>
   His return was part of a wider rehabilitation by the
conservative party he led for a quarter-century, including 16 years
as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders have invited Kohl to speak at an event marking 10
years of German unity this month, and at least one Christian
Democratic lawmaker urged the party Monday to let Kohl resume the
symbolically weighty post of honorary chairman that he was
pressured to give up after the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's refusal to reveal the source of some $1 million in
off-the-books donations he received as chancellor in the 1990s is
at the heart of the scandal. But his party's attempts to make Kohl
talk by ostracizing him have failed.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's session in the Reichstag parliament building, Kohl
sat in the third row between back-benchers from his native state of
Rhineland-Palatinate. Two lawmakers began clapping, but quickly
stopped when no one joined in. Several came up to shake his hand,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Even Angela Merkel, who took over as party chief in April after
frostily breaking with Kohl over the scandal, told reporters she
could once again ''talk with Kohl whenever I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   But she ruled out giving him back the honorary chairman's post
unless he clears up his role in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, the chancellor who united Germany in 1990 after the Berlin
Wall fell, has never wavered in portraying the scandal as a blip in
his career. In two appearances before a parliamentary committee
examining whether his government sold favors, he has responded with
aggressive defiance and refused to name the donors.
</P>
<P>
   But the scandal has weakened the Christian Democrats and has
grown to include probes of larger sums of unexplained donations,
charges of money laundering and resignations of top party
officials.

<P>
	   PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) - Pharmacia Corp., further expanding its
corporate and pharmaceutical headquarters in the state, has leased
more office space in Somerset County.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical company said Monday it has agreed to lease a

other half of the two-building complex.
</P>
<P>
   When fully occupied by the middle of next year, the two
buildings will accommodate about 800 employees. Pharmacia has 1,400
workers at its headquarters offices in Peapack and Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia Corp. became the world's 11th-largest drug company,
with about 60,000 employees and $17 billion in annual sales, when
it was created in April through the merger of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn,
based here, and St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.

   If the state exercises all the options in the eight-year
contract, the deal will be worth $169.2 million to Unisys. Since
1991, Unisys has been maintaining the system, which allows the
state Medicaid system to exchange information with the 53,000
health care providers who treat New Jersey's 700,000 Medicaid
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys, based in the Philadelphia suburb of Blue Bell, said
Monday it plans to enhance the system by adding a call-tracking
system, technical help desk services, access to advanced technology
and a system for managing fraud and abuse cases. Unisys also will
develop a Web site allowing providers to submit enrollment
applications or receive claim forms electronically.

</P>
<P>
   The company's technology already has been incorporated in the
sighting systems on some Army battle tanks, Bradley infantry
fighting vehicles and high-mobility wheeled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   DRS said successfully completing the project could lead to a
production contract for more than 400 systems.
</P>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - DWC Web Corp. has launched a new Internet

<HEADLINE> Jetliner aborts takeoff at JFK after windshield pops loose  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A TWA jetliner aborted its takeoff at Kennedy
International Airport on Monday after the pilot detected wind
rushing through an open cockpit window, blowing six of its 10 tires
as it skidded to a halt on the runway, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 233 passengers and crew were evacuated from the Boeing 767
and returned to the terminal. There were no reports of injury. The
passengers were to be put aboard another plane for St. Louis, the
original destination of TWA Flight 3.
</P>
<P>
   An initial report of a ''popped windshield'' proved wrong, a
Port Authority spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said
the pilot decided to abort the flight after he noticed the sound of
rushing air as the jetliner raced toward takeoff on JFK's Runway
13-R at 10:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three tires blew and three others went flat as the pilot braked
the big twin-engined aircraft some 8,000 feet down the 14,500-foot
runway. Although that was well short of the critical takeoff point,
''they had to do some pretty hard braking to stop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salac said investigators found that a window on the co-pilot's
side of the cockpit had been left unlatched, possibly during
maintenance performed on the plane earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said the
decision to abort was made after the co-pilot's windshield popped
out. Coleman later corrected the information.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers walked off the plane via a mobile stairway and
emergency evacuation chutes were not used, he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA, headquartered in St. Louis, did not immediately return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, D.C. was
advised of the incident but was not investigating, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second aborted takeoff by a commercial jetliner in
the past week in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, a Brussels-bound Continental Airlines DC-10
aborted its departure from Newark International Airport after an
engine spewed parts onto the runway. No one was injured in that
incident.

<HEADLINE> Young Knee Ails Can Triple Arthritis  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- You may think you rebounded fine from that
knee injury playing hoops or soccer at age 16, but it could haunt
you by your 40s or 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are proving what some sufferers have long suspected:
A single knee injury as a teen-ager or young adult can triple the
risk of arthritis in that knee by middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers are seeking ways to prevent injured knees from
deteriorating, and joint specialists say doctors must start telling
young patients, especially athletes, how to protect their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's advising giving up sports -- most Americans don't
exercise enough -- but some simple precautions may make a big
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you how many people I've seen who say, 'I played
college basketball and injured my knee but I still play on
weekends, I just run through the pain,''' well-known arthritis
expert Dr. Roland Moskowitz said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pain is nature's way of telling you there's something wrong
here,'' said Moskowitz of Cleveland's Case Western Reserve
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 21 million Americans suffer osteoarthritis, the form of
the joint disease typically caused by the wear-and-tear of aging.
The smooth, slippery cartilage that cushions joints over time
becomes rough and cracked, causing pain and stiffness that can
become severe as the cartilage continues to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   It can hit any joint, but knees are particularly vulnerable.
Some studies have found knee injuries in middle to old age, when
joints are deteriorating, accelerate arthritis. So Johns Hopkins
University rheumatologist Dr. Allan Gelber wondered if earlier
injuries, when your body still heals easily, played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Gelber used a study of 1,337 Hopkins medical school graduates
who underwent rigorous health exams before graduating some 40 years
ago and then were monitored each year since.
</P>
<P>
   People who injured a knee before age 22 had a threefold
increased risk of getting arthritis in that knee, and it typically
struck by the mid-50s, he found. The cumulative risk rose to
fivefold when Gelber also counted injuries suffered later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries included ligament or cartilage tears and bone
fractures. Football, basketball and skiing were common causes, but
car accidents and falls were culprits, too.
</P>
<P>
   If the injury heals, why would it matter? Because even mild
damage throws off a joint's biomechanics, Moskowitz explained.
''You may not see change day to day, but year to year you'll see
the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, said Gelber, ''We must find ways ... to prevent
knee injuries.'' Athletes could be given easy-to-use knee guards to
prevent injuries, and they could play on better terrain, avoiding
artificial turf that is much harder on knees than grass is, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are hunting for protective treatments for injured
joints. For example, preliminary studies suggest tissue engineering
-- using patients' own cells to grow new cartilage in a laboratory
and then transplanting that tissue into their knees -- works better
on a new, small injury than it does once arthritis strikes,
Moskowitz and Gelber say. But it's a cumbersome, expensive
treatment, so scientists are trying to create a single-injection
method.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are questioning if the arthritis treatment
hyaluronate also might help stave off the disease, and drug
companies are developing chemicals that might one day block
cartilage-destroying enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   Until such research is reality, specialists advise some
commonsense precautions for battered knees:
</P>
<P>
   --See a doctor right away if a knee injury causes severe pain or
if swelling lasts more than 24 hours, says Dr. John Klippel of the
Arthritis Foundation. Also seek help if pain lasts more than a few
days. You may need a brace, restricted activity or surgery --
although Gelber cautions that some cartilage operations themselves
have been linked to arthritis, so ask about options.
</P>
<P>
   --Lose weight. Being overweight is an arthritis risk, so adding
pounds adds trouble to an injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   --Try joint-friendly exercise, like swimming. A fast walk on a
treadmill is easier on knees than jogging. Whatever the exercise,
do stretches first to limber joint-supportive muscles. Proper
strength-training is important -- people with stronger quadriceps
muscles are less likely to get arthritis, Moskowitz says.
</P>
<P>
   --If giving up a favorite sport isn't an option, wear a
supportive brace even after the knee heals -- and don't play in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   --For a mild injury, a shoe lift helps stabilize the knee,
Moskowitz says; a rheumatologist or orthopedist can fit them.

<HEADLINE> Polls show Gore with big lead in New York state  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls out Monday showed Vice
President Al Gore far ahead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the
race for New York's 33 electoral votes, possible good news for
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion found
Gore leading Bush, 56 percent to 31 percent, among likely voters
questioned about the presidential race. The Green Party's Ralph
Nader was at 3 percent with Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan at
1 percent in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   A poll from Zogby International for the New York Post and Fox 5
News had Gore leading Bush, 52 percent to 35 percent, with Nader at
6 percent and Buchanan at less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means you won't see a lot of George Bush campaigning in New
York,'' Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a blowout,'' pollster John Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Marist poll had Gore leading Bush, 49 percent to
38 percent, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's big lead in New York is considered a plus for Clinton in
her Senate race against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Lazio would have to turn around at least one in five
Gore voters to have a chance at winning, Miringoff said, ''There
has to be chaos in the voting booth after people vote for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Marist pollster cautioned that such vote
switching wasn't beyond the realm of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's poll numbers in New York and Clinton's electoral chances
took a bounce upward after the vice president selected Sen. Joseph
Lieberman from neighboring Connecticut as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lead over Bush in the latest Marist poll crossed
geographic boundaries. In traditionally more conservative upstate
New York, Gore led Bush, 48 percent to 36 percent. Even among
Republicans, Gore was pulling almost one in five voters in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Marist's telephone poll of 480 likely voters was conducted Sept.
6, 7 and 10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points. The Zogby telephone poll of 703 likely voters was conducted
Sept. 7-9 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates China Weapons  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Fred Thompson sought Monday to tie
China's weapons proliferation policies to the granting of permanent
trade relations. Others warned that linking the two issues could
kill the trade bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   The nonproliferation amendment offered by Thompson, R-Tenn., and
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is seen as the last major hurdle to
smooth passage of the permanent normal trade bill, the most
important trade legislation Congress is taking up this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable to me that while we discuss trade issues
and a new relationship with China, that we will not address what
China is doing to endanger our country,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation hope to defeat the Thompson
proposal and other efforts to change the bill, setting up a final
vote as early as the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve permanent normal trade status to benefit
from the lower tariffs China has agreed to as part of its impending
entry in the World Trade Organization. American business groups,
who stand to gain billions from a more open Chinese market, have
lobbied hard for passage of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the bill by a 40-vote margin last May, and
supporters are concerned that Senate changes could doom the bill
this year because the House might not return to the legislation
before Congress adjourns next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any amendment added to this bill would likely kill this
legislation and kill the benefits of China's WTO commitments for
our farmers and our workers,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
chairman of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he supported the trade bill but contended it was
wrong to give blanket acceptance to the House version when there is
growing evidence that Chinese proliferation policy ''poses a mortal
threat to the welfare of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted a recent CIA report citing China, Russia and North
Korea as the key suppliers of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons technology, and reports the Chinese were helping Pakistan,
Libya and Iran with their weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson-Torricelli amendment would set up an annual review
of the weapons sales of China, Russia and North Korea and require
the president to impose non-trade-related sanctions on individuals
and companies that violate nonproliferation agreements. The
president could also impose additional sanctions on key supplier
nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to
create a procedure to inform American investors when foreign
entities on the president's proliferation list invest in U.S.
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president would be able to waive the sanctions requirements
for national security reasons, but Congress could vote to override
that waiver. The administration opposes the amendment as
unnecessary because it already has sanctions authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would cast a pall over American trade interests yet would
have no impact on our Japanese and European competitors,'' said
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a chief sponsor of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''All senators agree that we must address China's proliferation
policies but PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) is not the
right vehicle,'' said Baucus, adding that he was confident the
amendment could be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   A time hasn't been set for a vote on the amendment. On Tuesday,
the Senate will vote on an amendment by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
that would require China to disclose information on its compliance
with WTO obligations that it end subsidies to state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate handily defeated several other amendments
that would have required China to ensure religious freedom and
would have retained the current practice of annual reviews of
U.S.-China trade.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Iran Leaders' Kin Summoned To Court  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- The younger brother of Iran's supreme leader
has been summoned to court on charges related to the reformist
newspaper he launched in June, his aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The summons order for Hadi Khamenei was the third issued by the
Special Clergy Court since the Hayat-e-Nou newspaper debuted, the
aide, Abbas Safaifar, told The Associated Press. He did not say
when the order was issued or provide details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Khamenei has been summoned on press-related charges but he
has not yet made a decision whether to attend,'' said Safaifar.
</P>
<P>
   He said Khamenei had not personally appeared in court after the
two previous summons.
</P>
<P>
   Hadi Khamenei is opposed to his brother, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
who is a conservative. He was summoned by the Special Clergy Court
because he is a cleric.
</P>
<P>
   Many reformists say the court is unconstitutional and argue that
press offenses should be heard at the press court, regardless
whether the newspaper's director is a cleric.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei's newspaper was the only reformist newspaper to escape
a media crackdown by the hard-line judiciary that has shut down 24
pro-reform papers in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Summoning Khamenei means hard-liners see no limit for
undermining reforms. They are making maximum misuse of their powers
at the judiciary to target elements of reforms,'' said Davoud
Hermidas Bavand, a Tehran University professor and political
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hard-line daily Kayhan said parliament Vice
Speaker Behzad Nabavi, the reformists' spokesman, has been fined
$125 on charges of spreading lies, libel and propagating against a
rival candidate during the February legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
   Kayhan also said Alamdar Adibi, head of the Islamic Iran
Participation Front in southwestern Andimeshk, had been sentenced
to four months in prison, 20 lashes and a fine of $150 after he was
found guilty of libel, spreading lies and propagating against a
hard-line candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Nabavi and Adibi were sentenced by a Tehran
court. It did not say when, but added that Nabavi was only fined
because of his ''special condition'' as vice speaker.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent or official confirmation of the Kayhan
report.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners, who control the judiciary, broadcast media and the
military, oppose President Mohammad Khatami's reform program as
incompatible with the country's Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
   They have closed down 24 reformist publications and arrested
more than two dozen writers and political activists since April.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 70; Nasdaq Drops 68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The markets drifted lower Monday, despite a
surge in some energy and financial services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 69.92 at 11,150.73
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 68.31 to 3,910.10, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dropped 6.76 to 1,487.74
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so many crosscurrents here ... interest rates ... oil.
And there's some nervousness about third-quarter (earnings)
preannouncements,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ''The best I can characterize the market is just
that the volatility continues. It's a nervous market with more
trading going on than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices were mostly lower Monday after OPEC said it would add
800,000 barrels to its daily production target of 25.4 million
barrels. But energy stocks moved higher after analysts expressed
concern that the boost would not be enough to bring fuel prices
down. Schlumberger traded up $2.81 at $85.31, Halliburton was up
$2.25 at $54.31, and Baker Hughes rose $1.81 to $36.69.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened Monday, investment bank Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. announced it had agreed to buy the Wall Street market
maker firm Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg L.P. for $6.5 billion in stock and
cash to expand its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major deal in the financial services industry
in less than a week. On Wednesday, Citigroup said it was buying
lending powerhouse Associates First Capital Corp. for about $30
billion in stock in an effort to increase its global business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs' shares were up $5.94 at $130.19 in afternoon
trading. Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg is privately held.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Phillips Petroleum also rose $3 to $64.94 on
speculation that it was in merger talks with Chevron, whose shares
also were up $2.94 at $89.63.
</P>
<P>
   The markets are coming off of a weak first week of September.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite dropped 255.92 for the week;
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 18.13; the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was 26.27 points lower on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues Monday narrowly outnumbered decliners on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 714.25 million
shares, compared with 756.14 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.74 at 533.96.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Capture N.Western Town  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels on Monday said they
captured a northwestern town from President Laurent Kabila's army
after a 36-hour battle that killed scores of combatants
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Kamitatu, a leader of the Ugandan-backed Congolese
Liberation Movement, said the rebels took Dongo on Saturday and
forced the retreat of the government army toward Imese, about 435
miles northeast of the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting and accusations of troop buildup between the rebels and
the government in the northwestern Equateur province come despite
renewed international efforts to pressure Kabila into allowing some
of the planned 5,537 U.N. observers and troops to deploy in the
government-controlled western half of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinshasa, two government officials confirmed there was heavy
fighting in Equateur and blamed Rwanda and Uganda for launching
attacks against government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Col. David Kokolo Longo, a senior official in the Defense
Ministry, said Rwandan and Ugandan forces southeast of Dongo were
moving toward the government-held towns of Bola and Befale, about
170 miles east of the Congo River port of Mbandaka.
</P>
<P>
   Kamitatu, speaking on the satellite telephone from Gbadolite,
the rebel headquarters based on the estate built by the late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko on the Ubangui River facing the Central
African Republic, said at least 43 government soldiers and four
rebels died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Dongo, also on the Ubangui, has already changed hands twice
during the two-year civil war, the last time on July 25 when
government troops took it back from rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, his allies and the rebels signed a peace accord last
year. But the Congolese leader appears increasingly reluctant to
implement it by stalling the U.N. deployment in support of the
cease-fire and by refusing to accept an African-appointed mediator
for the postwar talks on a transitional government for Congo,
Africa's third-largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda back three rebel groups with arms and troops
and accuse Kabila of failing to rid Congo of about 10,000 Rwandan
Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after taking part in the 1994
genocide. The militiamen have since joined the Congolese army.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has proposed revising the peace agreement through direct
talks with Rwanda and Uganda on their unconditional withdrawal from
Congo. Both countries say they will leave Congo only when the
cease-fire is in place and Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia pull out their soldiers and equipment.

<HEADLINE> Movie patron stabbed, mall worker faces charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - An off-duty movie theater employee was
accused of stabbing a patron after an argument about cigarettes
outside the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore H. Turner, 21, of Hudson Falls was charged with
first-degree assault and sent to Warren County jail after the
incident late Saturday night, police said. He was due in court on
Wednesday for a preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing victim, Joseph M. Wilder, 25, of Cohoes, was taken
to Glens Falls Hospital, where he was listed in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was waiting for a ride in the parking lot of the Hoyts
Cinema in Aviation Mall after his shift Saturday night when Wilder
and three friends came out of the theater and asked him for a
cigarette, according to the Warren County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Turner refused and later complained to theater management that
Wilder and his friends were causing a commotion. There was an
argument between the two strangers after Wilder asked for a
cigarette a second time.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Turner pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed
Wilder several times, police said. Police said Turner then ran into
the cinema, covered in blood, and told workers there he had just
stabbed someone.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was being held on bail of $100,000 cash or $200,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Agencies Fail Computer Review  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fourth of the government's major agencies,
including the departments of Justice, Labor, Interior, Agriculture
and Health and Human Services, flunked a computer security review.
</P>
<P>
   The F's given to seven of the 24 major agencies, based on
agency-reported data and General Accounting Office and the
Inspector General audits, led to a government-wide grade of D-,
said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Ca., chairman of the House Government
Reform Committee's technology subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The departments that flunked all keep important computer data,
said Horn, who called the scores the first government-wide
assessment of computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Labor, charged with maintaining vital
employment statistics, an F. The Department of the Interior, which
manages the nation's public lands, an F,'' said Horn, as his
staffers passed out fake report cards to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Health and Human Services that holds
personal information on every citizen who receives Medicare,
another F. Agriculture and Justice, the Small Business
Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, the
personnel office for the entire federal government, all F's.''
</P>
<P>
   All 24 agencies has significant problems in allowing
unauthorized access to sensitive information, said Joel Willemssen,
director of the GAO's accounting and information management
division. Auditors proved that point by trying to hack into
government computers from remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our auditors have been successful, in almost every test, in
readily gaining unauthorized access that would allow intruders to
read, modify or delete data for whatever purpose they have in
mind,'' the GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies aren't good at monitoring access inside their own
work forces, either, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At one unnamed agency, all 1,100 computer users were granted
access to sensitive system directories and settings, while at
another agency, 20,000 users had been provided access to one system
without written authorization, the GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal agencies have serious and widespread computer security
weaknesses,'' Willemssen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's patchwork funding for computer security is
partly to blame, said John Gilligan, the Energy Department's chief
information officer and co-chair of the Chief Information Officer
Council Committee on Security, Privacy and Critical Infrastructure
Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an area where the executive and legislature are
failing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the problems could be solved by simply doing things
like changing passwords regularly or turning computers off after
workers leave, Horn said. ''That doesn't cost a thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And grading all the federal agencies with the same standards may
not be the best way to get results, said John Spotila,
administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
in the president's Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we must resist the simplicity of a one-size-fits-all
security program for the vast variety of agency systems, we must
also avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to measuring successes and
shortfalls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, advocated the creation of a national
Chief Information Officer position in the federal government to
monitor and coordinate computer security issues, an issue the
subcommittee will tackle on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Party-swapping congressman among those facing primary challenges  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Party-swapping Rep. Michael Forbes is the
Republicans' No. 1 target for defeat come November. But first he
has to get past Regina Seltzer, a 71-year-old former librarian from
his newly adopted Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is one of a batch of lawmakers in primary battles
Tuesday. While Hillary Rodham Clinton faces a token challenge from
an orthopedic surgeon, and her rival Rep. Rick Lazio has a clear
path to the general election, several incumbents in Congress and
the state Legislature are up against serious challengers with money
and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some fascinating races in New York this year,'' said
Columbia University political science professor Esther Fuchs.
''Some very entrenched incumbents are being forced to stand up and
defend their records.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the state legislative veterans facing harder-than-usual
intra-party challenges are Assemblymen Clarence Norman and Roger
Green, both of Brooklyn, Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, of Queens,
and Assemblyman Arthur Eve of Buffalo. All are Democrats. Eve is
the longest serving member of the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Eliot Engel of the Bronx is in a bitter
battle with state Sen. Larry Seabrook. In Brooklyn, Rep. Edolphus
Towns faces lawyer Barry Ford, Rep. Major Owens is up against City
Councilwoman Una Clarke, and freshman Rep. Anthony Weiner is in a
rematch with City Councilman Noach Dear.
</P>
<P>
   There is battle for Lazio's open seat in Suffolk County. Lazio
and the Republican Party are backing Islip Town Clerk Joan Johnson,
who if elected would be the first black woman Republican in the
House. There is a three-way battle for the Democratic nod.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern tip of Long Island, Forbes will face his first
test at the polls since swapping parties last year to become a
Democrat complaining about the extremism of GOP leaders in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is clearly the front-runner in Tuesday's matchup against
Seltzer. The three-term incumbent has raised about $1.4 million,
while Seltzer has just $40,000. But Seltzer got a boost when
Newsday endorsed her late last week.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by Seltzer on Tuesday would be embarrassing for
Forbes, highlighting Democratic discomfort with him as he heads
into what is expected to be a nasty November matchup against
Republican Felix Grucci.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings paid for by the state Republican Party have already
been landing in Democratic mailboxes gleefully touting more
conservative aspects of Forbes' record. ''Mike Forbes earned a
perfect score of 100 percent from Pat Robertson's Christian
Coalition for his first year in Congress,'' screamed one.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, who last held a Brookhaven town council seat more than
two decades ago, entered the race somewhat reluctantly after other
area Democrats backed out under pressure from party leaders in
Washington. Forbes was wooed as part of Democrats' strategy to
reclaim the House. Seltzer says Forbes - with his opposition to
abortion and votes to impeach President Clinton - is no Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided if no one else was going to run against him I
would,'' Seltzer said. ''What happened with Mike Forbes has made me
ashamed for the first time in my life of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes says he spent the August congressional recess fitting in
as many community and civic group meetings as the long summer days
would allow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response I've received on the street has been great, very
encouraging,'' Forbes said. ''I'm telling people I'm the same
person, committed to the same issues - a patients' bill of rights,
the environment, education - and that I'm going to continue to be a
strong independent voice for Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   While much has been made of Forbes' conservative positions
recently he has had the reputation of something of a maverick.
While a Republican, he supported campaign finance reform and was
one of the first to call for House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
resignation when ethics charges surfaced against him.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Seltzer says she shouldn't be counted out. She
went to law school at age 50 and now mostly works free of charge
for groups like the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. And she put
her law degree to good use recently suing the state Democratic
Party to stop them from running ads on Forbes' behalf before the
primary had been held determining who the party's candidate is. She
won.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters point out that while Seltzer gathered petition
signatures herself, the Forbes camp had to pay campaign workers $20
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And at least some voters in Forbes' district - which stretches
from the Republican stronghold of Brookhaven east to the more
liberal Hamptons - appear unsettled by his about face.
</P>
<P>
   At Peter's Luncheonette, in Patchogue, talk over eggs and coffee
dwells on the Mets and Yankees playoff chances, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   But asked about Forbes, retired contractor Carmine Chiuchiolo
makes a sour face.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a person switches like that it shows me something: he's
only out for himself. I don't know that you can trust someone like
that,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Canada Conference To Help War Kids  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Last year, at age 17, Rosamond was
abducted by rebels in her native Sierra Leone, then raped, beaten
and forced to labor in a rebel camp where she witnessed murders and
mutilations.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she is sleeping in a fine hotel in this peaceful city
on the Canadian prairie, hobnobbing with youths from other war-torn
nations. They go bowling. They take riverboat tours. And they
recount chilling tales of the worst of human nature, as seen
through the eyes of children.
</P>
<P>
   The conference on helping youth traumatized by war -- sponsored
by the Canadian government and drawing 800 youth and adults from
more than 130 countries -- has the usual experts in tweeds,
bureaucrats in suits and stacks of background papers filled with
grim statistics: 2 million children killed worldwide by war in the
past decade; 5 million injured; 300,000 forced to serve as child
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But with their often gruesome first-person accounts and their
earnest beliefs that future atrocities can be prevented, the young
people inject a raw blend of horror and hope to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you build peace when the next generation has
slaughtered the previous generation, and many in the next
generation are missing a limb because a colleague has chopped it
off?'' asked Steven Morris, spokesman for the Canadian
International Development Agency, a co-sponsor of the conference.
''These are problems that may never be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to the teen-agers who have come here from
troubled spots around the globe: Sri Lanka, Uganda, Colombia,
Angola, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ibrahim, 18, says her family fled to Canada from Sudan
after enduring government persecution. Her father, a businessman,
would disappear for days at a time, taken for questioning. He would
return with scarred fingers, refusing to talk about those marks of
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Acayo, 18, says she was abducted at age 13 by rebels with
the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. For three years, she was
forced to fight for the rebels' cause, laying land mines and
serving as one of 11 ''wives'' to a rebel commander. She says she
was forced to kill her cousin, explaining: ''If you don't kill,
they will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosamond asks that her last name not be used to reduce her
chances of being killed when she returns to Sierra Leone, where
civil war has driven half the nation's 5 million people from their
homes and forced nearly 3,000 children into duty as soldiers,
laborers or sex slaves -- mostly for the Revolutionary United Front
rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and handsome, Rosamond wears her hair in cornrow braids
that sweep back neatly from her face. She has a wide, gushing smile
that erupts frequently, especially as she describes a week of
firsts: her first airplane ride, her first foray out of steamy West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this place!'' she exults about Winnipeg, sitting in a
hotel restaurant. ''I love the people. I love everything. Very
different from home. The buildings, the weather. We don't have so
much cold. We have all our warm clothes on here.''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks cheerfully of her work in Sierra Leone, helping a
humanitarian group provide education and counseling to children
suffering from the war.
</P>
<P>
   When she begins her own story, however, the gleaming smile
vanishes. She shifts in her seat, her back stiffening.
</P>
<P>
   ''My day came Jan. 8, 1999,'' she says. ''The rebels came in,
looting, beating. It was an ordeal to see my neighbors pulled out
and executed. I was living with my uncle. We left our home for
security. We were hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ''After two days, I returned home in search of food and
clothing, because we were out of all those things. At my house,
they hit me. There were five of them. They blindfolded me, tied me,
dragged me into a vehicle and took me to the bush. I was there for
about three weeks. During that time, I was forced to witness ...''
</P>
<P>
   She stops, catches her breath, then plunges in again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was forced to witness pregnant women being cut open,
mutilation of male genitals with machetes. I was forced to witness
many things that were terrible. I was ...''
</P>
<P>
   She stops, and sobs bubble out. Her head sinks to the table,
tears dripping onto the table top. Diners at nearby tables look
over quizzically. Rosamond's chaperone, Grace Harman, puts her hand
on the girl's shoulder and speaks quietly for a while, remarking
that some of the worst horrors are committed by rebels who are
children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For five minutes, Rosamond weeps. Perhaps it is time to stop the
interview, Harman suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. I want to continue,'' Rosamond whimpers, lifting her head.
''I want other governments to see what is really happening in my
country. What happened to me has happened to many others. Many,
many.
</P>
<P>
   ''After three weeks, I managed to plan my escape. There were six
of us. One day, we went out until we were far away. We were quiet,
because if they saw us, they would kill us. When I came out, I saw
my house was burned down. Four months later, I realized I was
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   She begins to sob again, and Harman hands her a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Rosamond wants to talk more -- about her abortion, about her
nightmares and her inability to concentrate in school. But it is
7:15 p.m. -- time for dinner with the other youth delegates. Her
schedule this week in Winnipeg is chock full: forums in the
daytime; disco-bowling, a paddleboat ride and a barbecue with the
mayor in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Rosamond will return to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS to fix overline  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A TWA jetliner aborted its takeoff at Kennedy
International Airport on Monday after the pilot detected wind
rushing through an open cockpit window, blowing six of its 10 tires
as it skidded to a halt on the runway, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 233 passengers and crew were evacuated from the Boeing 767
and returned to the terminal. There were no reports of injury. The
passengers were to be put aboard another plane for St. Louis, the
original destination of TWA Flight 3.
</P>
<P>
   An initial report of a ''popped windshield'' proved wrong, a
Port Authority spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said
the pilot decided to abort the flight after he noticed the sound of
rushing air as the jetliner raced toward takeoff on JFK's Runway
13-R at 10:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three tires blew and three others went flat as the pilot braked
the big twin-engined aircraft some 8,000 feet down the 14,500-foot
runway. Although that was well short of the critical takeoff point,
''they had to do some pretty hard braking to stop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salac said investigators found that a window on the co-pilot's
side of the cockpit had been left unlatched, possibly during
maintenance performed on the plane earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said the
decision to abort was made after the co-pilot's windshield popped
out. Coleman later corrected the information.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers walked off the plane via a mobile stairway and
emergency evacuation chutes were not used, he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA, headquartered in St. Louis, did not immediately return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, D.C. was
advised of the incident but was not investigating, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second aborted takeoff by a commercial jetliner in
the past week in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, a Brussels-bound Continental Airlines DC-10
aborted its departure from Newark International Airport after an
engine spewed parts onto the runway. No one was injured in that
incident.

<HEADLINE> Eliot bibliographer Donald Gallup dies at 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The Yale Center for British Art will
remember benefactor Donald Gallup at next week's opening of an
exhibit of artwork he donated to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup, who had been the curator of the Yale Collection of
American Literature, died Wednesday at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup was a bibliographer of the poets Ezra Pound and T.S.
Eliot, and confirmed the discovery of a lost Eliot manuscript for
''The Waste Land'' in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gallup donated much of his Eliot collection to the
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a collector of artwork by another poet, Edward Lear.
Gallup donated almost 400 works by Lear, including drawings, prints
and paintings, to the Yale Center for British art in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is preparing to open an exhibit of Gallup's
collection Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a quite sizable collection. His giving this to us makes
us a fairly important repository of the work of Lear,'' said Scott
Wilcox, the curator of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup was born in Sterling in 1913 and graduated from Yale in
1934. As a student at Yale, he worked at the library and began
collecting Eliot's early writings.
</P>
<P>
   While stationed in England during World War II, Gallup bought
first editions of English poetry and literature. He also began
collecting drawings by Lear, who is better known as the author of
nonsense verse such as ''The Owl and the Pussycat.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Buffalo Teachers, 3rd Ld-Writethru,0680  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Classes resumed Monday for 47,000 Buffalo
students after striking teachers agreed to work through a day of
contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether teachers would continue to report in the absence of a
settlement remained in question, though, even as a judge ordered
union leaders to refrain from work stoppages like the one that
canceled two days of school last week.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers picketed outside schools before heading in to class
Monday to pick up the school year where it left off after only one
day last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're here for is the children and we want them in the
classroom. We want ourselves in the classroom,'' teacher Jeff
Wright said. ''Let's hope that that was it and we don't have to do
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court judge, meanwhile, strengthened a court
order obtained by the Board of Education last week prohibiting the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows that teachers aren't supposed to be on strike,
it's against the law, we all know that,'' Buffalo Teachers
President Philip Rumore said. ''It's not a surprise that the judge
would say it's illegal to go on strike because, indeed, it is
illegal to go on strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rumore would not rule out a return to a citywide
walkout. He said union executives would meet Monday night and
before school Tuesday to discuss the next move.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers agreed to work Monday at the state mediator's request,
he said. The district's 3,700 teachers have been working under the
terms of an expired contract since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Contract negotiations resumed Monday afternoon, with a mediator
from the state Public Employee Relations Board shuttling between
the two sides, district spokesman Andrew Maddigan said. Union and
district negotiators met face-to-face over the weekend for the
first time since the illegal strike began.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rumore nor Board of Education president Paul Buchanan
would characterize the tenor of the marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working very hard, all of us, to make progress,''
Superintendent Marion Canedo said late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The district is pursuing contempt charges against Rumore for
calling the strike in violation of last week's temporary
restraining order, which was converted Monday to a more permanent
preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, union attorneys attempted to have the order thrown
out on a technicality. Hearings were set for Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the teachers will be back at work with a brand new
contract, that we'll all be working together talking about the kids
rather than a court dispute,'' Rumore said after the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore and other union leaders could face additional contempt
charges if the walkout is resumed, city attorney Michael Risman
said. The charges carry the potential for 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After attending classes the first day of school Wednesday,
teachers shocked the district, students and parents by announcing
the work stoppage one hour before school Thursday, stranding
children on yellow schoolbuses and street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, with no deal in sight, Canedo told students to
stay home Friday. Teachers then reported Friday as a ''sign of good
will,'' and spent the day cleaning classrooms and developing lesson
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have said they would not bend on their demand for pay
raises of 3.5 percent in four out of five years. The district has
offered across-the-board yearly raises of 2 percent in three out of
four years.
</P>
<P>
   The union also opposes the district's offer to lower the cost of
health insurance provided to teachers who are hired or retire in
the future, and a provision to contract with outside agencies to
provide social services to students and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of agree with what the teachers are doing and what they
are asking for,'' high school student Steve Andres said. ''I think
they should give them their contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits public employees
from striking, teachers could face fines of two days' pay for every
day off the job.

<HEADLINE> Nader supporters remain optimistic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - When Aaron Tabackman wanted to grab
national attention for Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader, he chose his spot carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Tabackman shouted ''Nader for president!'' during a welcome home
rally for the Democratic vice presidential candidate, U.S. Sen.
Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Tabackman and other Nader supporters remain optimistic, despite
recent polls that show him with just 3 percent to 6 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he will do much, much better than the two major
parties would have you believe,'' said Michael DeRosa, a leader in
the Green Party in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are telling us they're very glad (Nader) is doing this
because they feel like they have no one to vote for,'' said DeRosa,
who is running for the 1st District state Senate seat in Hartford
under the Green Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Tabackman, Nader's campaign chairman in Connecticut, was among a
group of supporters meeting in Stamford on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has held his head up high, and he's totally optimistic,''
Tamarack said.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released last week showed Nader
with about 3 percent of the vote nationally. But Nader, a Winsted
native, is expected to do better among Connecticut voters. The most
recent poll done by Quinnipiac University - conducted in July,
before either major party had their convention - showed Nader with
11 percent support in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, where about 40 percent of voters are registered
as independent, the Green Party hopes to gain momentum with its
messages of protecting the environment, getting big money out of
politics, universal health care and protection of social security.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers think Nader's candidacy could siphon
votes from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Nader candidacy could hurt (Gore) somewhat, but he
would have to get into much bigger numbers than he's drawing,''
Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac poll, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lieberman acknowledged Nader's potential effect in remarks
to reporters during a campaign stop in Connecticut earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''On issues that really matter to Nader supporters -
environmental protection, consumer protection, health care,
progressive tax structure - the choice between the two major
parties (is) so dramatic that it would be a shame if Nader pulls
some votes that make it harder for Al Gore and me to win,''
Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-nun accused of sex abuse of student fails to appear in Manhattan court </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former nun and teacher who is being sued for
$150 million by a former student who accused her of sexual abuse
failed to appear in a Manhattan court Monday for the start of jury
selection for her trial.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Louise Gruner Gans ordered a clerk
to find out whether Linda Baisi and her lawyer intended to take
part in the trial, which will go on with or without her.
</P>
<P>
   Baisi's lawyer, Brian O'Dwyer, said he and his client will not
participate. ''She has no assets. She has no insurance,'' he said.
''Given that, she has no money to hire lawyers to defend herself
against the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer would not say where Baisi was. He said she is working,
but not in education and not in anything related to the Catholic
church. The lawyer refused to speculate on what might happen in
court in Baisi's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trial is proceeding. The lawsuit accuses Baisi of
carrying on a five-year sexual affair with Brian O'Rourke, now 25,
beginning when he was 12 and a student at St. Frances de Chantal
School in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court in 1996,
O'Rourke says Baisi first sexually molested him when he went to her
home in November 1987.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke's parents found out about the alleged affair in 1995
after he told drug counselors and they reported Baisi to state
officials. O'Rourke's lawyer, Michael Dowd, says his client's
parents initially hired him to stop the drug counselors from
reporting Baisi.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke said that because of the five-year affair other
students ridiculed him and he felt so much emotional distress that
he turned to alcohol and drugs for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Baisi, the school's parish and the New York Catholic
Archdiocese are named as defendants in O'Rourke's lawsuit. The
position of the archdiocese is that the allegations against Baisi
have nothing to do with the church or her job and she is on her
own. They have refused to pay for her defense.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Zwilling, spokesman for the archdiocese, said he had no
comment and any statements would come from the church's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has ordered the lawyers to keep quiet about the case.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Charity: Worker Killed 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Swiss charity said Monday that one
of its local workers in Kosovo killed three people in a row over
construction supplies being used to rebuild a village.
</P>
<P>
   Caritas Switzerland said it has temporarily suspended its
operations in Loznica, a village near the provincial capital
Pristina, after the representative, who wasn't identified, shot a
father and two sons Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were killed immediately while one of the sons died
on the way to hospital in Pristina, the charity said. The
representative, whose job was to assign building supplies to
villagers, was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss branch of the Roman Catholic aid agency Caritas is
involved in rebuilding programs in another 15 Kosovo villages.
Activities outside Loznica will continue, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which formally remains part of Serbia, the larger
Yugoslav republic, has been run by NATO and the United Nations
since NATO bombing last year forced Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to pull out his troops and cede day-to-day control of the
province.

<HEADLINE> IRA, 401(k) Bill Gains Momentum  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two years of Republicans passing tax
cuts and President Clinton vetoing them, the one tax measure with
broad appeal to middle-class voters that could still become law
this year would raise contribution limits for IRA and 401(k)
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the House passed its version of the
legislation with 401 votes in favor. Last week, the Senate Finance
Committee unanimously approved a somewhat different package.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting a bit of steam, and well it should,'' said Sen.
Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton vetoed a 10-year, $792 billion GOP tax cut --
it included similar retirement provisions but was vetoed for other
reasons -- and has vetoed bills this year that would have eliminated
inheritance taxes and reduced the tax marriage penalty on
two-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has expressed concern that the
retirement package wouldn't do enough to help lower-income people
save, but those reservations may not withstand an election-year
Congress eager to pass the measure by veto-proof majorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no reason for any further resistance by the
Clinton administration to ultimately signing these provisions into
law,'' said James Klein, president of the Association of Private
Pension and Welfare Plans.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Monday the administration is
working toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very hopeful we can reach agreement with Congress on a
package of pension reforms this year which is consistent with our
commitment to fiscal discipline,'' said Patrick Dorton, spokesman
for economic adviser Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Americans are abysmal savers. In 1999, savings
as a percentage of personal disposable income fell into negative
range for the first time since 1933. Some analysts estimate that
half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in savings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Social Security faces possible insolvency
after the baby boom generation retires. Only about half of today's
workers have employer-provided pension plans, including just 20
percent of those who work for small businesses of 25 employees or
less.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, Americans are not saving enough for their
retirements,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. ''They are prevented from doing so by
several factors, including a tax code that discourages savings.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the annual $2,000 contribution limit for
traditional individual retirement accounts hasn't changed since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved by the House and pending in the Senate
would raise the annual IRA contribution limit to $5,000. For
401(k)s, in which an estimated 36 million people now participate,
the annual contribution cap would rise from $10,500 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills also contain special IRA ''catch-up'' cap of $7,500
in annual contributions for people over 50, particularly women
whose retirement savings lags behind because they left the work
force temporarily to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions include creation of a Roth 401(k), similar to a
Roth IRA, in which contributions are made with after-tax dollars
and the withdrawals are tax-free. There is a tax credit to
encourage businesses to offer pensions, accelerated pension vesting
for employees and rules making it easier for workers to carry
assets from job to job.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the bill mainly helps people who already can save.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-profit research
organization, estimated that three-quarters of the House bill's
benefits would flow to people with incomes above $67,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been concerned that any approach to increasing savings
focus on the 75 million Americans who don't have access to pensions
or 401(k)s or tax-favored savings,'' said Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   To address that concern, single people earning up to $25,000 and
married couples earning up to $50,000 would benefit from a Senate
bill proposal by Baucus creating tax credits of 5 percent to 50
percent for up to $2,000 in contributions to a qualified retirement
plan.
</P>
<P>
   One controversial element in the Senate bill would set up new
disclosure rules for workers when employers convert to so-called
''cash balance'' pension plans that can erode benefits expected by
older employees. Opponents say this could legitimize a questionable
practice and jeopardize pending court cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would allow companies to get away with age discrimination
in their pension plans,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns aside, the bill will be brought to the Senate
floor later this month under budget ''reconciliation'' rules that
limit debate and amendments.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes as expected, the House and Senate would work out
differences before a final product is sent to Clinton. The bill
could still become a vehicle for unrelated tax legislation as the
congressional session winds down, but supporters were optimistic
the pension provisions would not fall victim to other divisive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that we have a bipartisan consensus if we want
to have something enacted this year,'' said Sen. James Jeffords,
R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 1102.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rep. Herbert Bateman Dies  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rep. Herbert Bateman, a nine-term
congressman who in the 1970s was one of the first Virginia
Democrats to break with his party and become a Republican, died
Monday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman had battled lung and prostate cancer over the past
decade, and in April 1998 had a cancerous growth removed from his
right lung. His uncertain health prompted him to announce early
this year that this session of Congress would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   He died in his sleep early Monday in Loudoun County, where he
had planned to play golf, said Bateman's spokesman, Dan Scandling.
The precise cause of death was not immediately known, Scandling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the most important figures in the transition
from the old Virginia Democratic Party to the modern Republican
Party,'' said Ed Matricardi, executive director of the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Added House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.: ''He is a good
man, a good husband and father, and a good representative to his
constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bateman was elected to the state Senate in 1968 as a member of
the conservative Democratic faction that dominated every facet of
Virginia government for most of the 20th century. Like many
Virginia Democrats at the time, he felt estranged from the liberal
direction the party was heading nationally, so in 1976, he changed
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the GOP controls the General Assembly, the governor's
office and other top executive offices. Bateman was among five
Republican congressmen from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman was first elected to Congress in 1982, taking the seat
held by Republican Paul S. Trible. Trible had won a U.S. Senate
seat that year.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years in the House, he made good on his campaign
pledges to bring defense contracts to his southeastern Virginia
district. His hometown, Newport News, is among the world's major
centers for the construction of warships.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman was a deficit hawk and fought for a balanced budget. He
supported the presidential line item veto, which Congress passed
but the Supreme Court later struck down as unconstitutional. He was
a steady opponent of abortion except in cases of rape or incest,
and supported capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman remained popular in his district and seldom faced
serious opposition for re-election. He had no Democratic opponent
at all in his final two re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Elizabeth City, N.C., moved to Virginia at an
early age. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in
1949 and later earned a law degree from Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, while still in the state Senate, he ran unsuccessfully
for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 93; Dow Falls 25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investor concerns about technology stocks pushed
markets lower Monday for a second straight session, despite a surge
in some energy and financial services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   After fluctuating throughout the day, the Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 25.16 at 11,195.49, according to preliminary
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 92.86 to 3,885.55, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dropped 9.22 to 1,485.28.
</P>
<P>
   The declines came on the heels of a disappointing first week of
September. On Friday, blue chips and technology issues fell sharply
as investors concerned about third-quarter earnings took profits or
sought to minimize their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so many crosscurrents here ... interest rates ... oil.
And there's some nervousness about third-quarter (earnings)
preannouncements,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ''The best I can characterize the market is just
that the volatility continues. It's a nervous market with more
trading going on than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices surged Monday despite OPEC's announcement that it
will would add 800,000 barrels to its daily production target of
25.4 million barrels. Energy stocks also moved higher after
analysts expressed concern that the boost would not be enough to
bring fuel prices down. Schlumberger traded up $2.79 at $85.29,
Halliburton was up $2.17 at $54.23, and Baker Hughes rose $1.88 to
$38.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were less enthused about technology stocks. Shares of
IBM traded lower, down $4.56 at $124.94, after a Goldman Sachs
analyst lowered her revenue and earnings forecasts. Other high-tech
losers included Oracle which fell $3.44 to $83.13; Sun
Microsystems, down $5.61 at $115.14 and Cisco Systems, off $2.61 at
$61.27.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a certain sense of malaise that is going to continue
until we get a better sense of what third-quarter earnings are,''
said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened Monday, investment bank Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. announced it had agreed to buy the Wall Street market
maker firm Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg L.P. for $6.5 billion in stock and
cash to expand its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major deal in the financial services industry
in less than a week. On Wednesday, Citigroup said it was buying
lending powerhouse Associates First Capital Corp. for about $30
billion in stock in an effort to increase its global business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs' shares were up $8 at $132.25. Spear Leeds &AMP;
Kellogg is privately held.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing rumors that Deutsche Bank is eyeing J.P. Morgan helped
push Morgan's shares up $5 to $169.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Phillips Petroleum also rose $1.50 to $63.44 on
speculation that it was in merger talks with Chevron, whose shares
rose $2.63 at $89.31.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 895.71 million shares,
compared with 958.66 million in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.44 at 533.26.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 2.25 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.73 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.28 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.42 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. thanks New York for hosting Millennium Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - With the Millennium Summit of world
leaders over, the United Nations is thanking New Yorkers for
putting up with traffic delays and street closings in as big a way
as it knows.
</P>
<P>
   From a giant ''Thank You N.Y.'' note spelled by office lights on
both sides of the U.N. headquarters building Sunday night and again
Monday night, to letters by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
mayor and the police commissioner, it was the United Nations' way
of recognizing the city's efforts in dealing with the 147 world
leaders who attended last week's Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Messages of thanks also were aired on a number of local radio
and television stations and were to be displayed on the marquee at
Madison Square Garden, the scoreboard at Shea Stadium, outside the
U.S. Tennis Center at Forest Hills and on the Astrovision Screen in
Times Square, according to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a home and a community that nourishes and supports us''
is one factor that helps the United Nations do its job, Annan wrote
to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, thanking city authorities for their
''extraordinary efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With its tradition of tolerance and resilience, and with
diversity mirroring that of the larger human family, New York City
continues to be a source of great strength for this organization,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sept. 6-8 summit, thousands of policemen, U.S.
government security agents and bodyguards of the visiting leaders
caused havoc for pedestrians and vehicles on Manhattan's East side.
</P>
<P>
   Entire blocks around U.N. headquarters and hotels where
dignitaries stayed were sealed off to allow the long motorcades to
move unhindered.
</P>
<P>
   Roads and sidewalks were ''frozen'' - a term police officers and
security personnel used in order to keep people away - and New
Yorkers were forced to make detours to get to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt trucks filled with sand blocked some streets to prevent any
would-be terrorist attack. Helicopters repeatedly flew over the
U.N. area. Speed boats and ski jets with security agents aboard
raced back and forth on the East River in front of the headquarters
building.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement at the end of the summit, Annan said he hopes
that New Yorkers ''are proud of this reaffirmation that our city is
truly the capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, getting down to the business of managing the city,
wants compensation for the money spent to make it safe and smooth
going.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a letter on Thursday to U.S. President Bill Clinton -
one of the city's prominent guests last week - asking that the
federal government reimburse the city dlrs 25 million for its
expenses, ranging from overtime for the police and fire departments
to sanitation costs.
</P>
<P>
   For Annan's staff, the summit ended with a small celebration in
the secretary-general's 38th floor office Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told his staff to enjoy the weekend ''because Monday
morning we will begin implementation'' of the eight-page
declaration adopted at the summit which sets out an ambitious
agenda to reduce poverty, improve education, and promote a more
peaceful world, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, many of the roads in the city were clear - but it's
not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic disruptions were expected to continue for another two
weeks - albeit on a smaller scale - as the General Assembly's main
debate continues through Sept. 22, with speeches by foreign
ministers and some world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine are scheduled to speak at Tuesday morning's
opening session.

<HEADLINE> TV Artifacts To Be Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE, Wis. (AP) -- The eyepiece worn by Col. Klink on ''Hogan's
Heroes'' and the suspenders used to hold up Chester's pants on
''Gunsmoke'' are among the pop culture artifacts going on the
auction block next week.
</P>
<P>
   The items are left over from a long-defunct traveling museum run
by the late Helen and William Rowell.
</P>
<P>
   The couple crisscrossed the country during the 1960s, showing
off the items at fairs and festivals. They persuaded Hollywood
stars to donate items of interest by promising to use them in
support of charities.
</P>
<P>
   After Helen Rowell died two years ago, heirs inherited 10 trunks
of celebrity artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked about opening a display of our own,''
daughter-in-law Rebecca Rowell said. ''But we all have other
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The House in the Woods Auction Gallery in Eagle will conduct the
auction.

<HEADLINE> Americans Have More Credit Cards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proportion of American families having at
least one credit card jumped by more than 40 percent between 1970
and 1998, research by the Federal Reserve shows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 73 percent -- or nearly three-fourths -- of American
families had one or more credit cards, up from 51 percent in 1970,
according to the surveys of consumer finances, a series sponsored
by the Fed, sometimes jointly with other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The information was contained in an article Monday published in
September's edition of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards issued by banks, gasoline companies, retail stores,
travel and entertainment companies and other issuers such as car
rental and airline companies were all counted under the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Bank-type credit cards with a revolving feature such as those
issued under the MasterCard and Visa brands showed the most notable
increase during the period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 68 percent of families reported having a bank type of
card, compared with 16 percent in 1970, the research showed.

<HEADLINE> New law sets tighter ''Jet Ski'' emission standards  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A bill requiring new ''Jet Ski'' engines
sold or manufactured in New York to meet emission standards above
the federal limits set in 1996 was signed into law by Gov. George
Pataki Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new law mandates that the state Department of Environmental
Conservation adopt standards created by California in 1998. It
calls for engines of personal watercrafts - commonly known by the
trademarked name ''Jet Skis'' - to be three times cleaner than what
the federal government is requiring.
</P>
<P>
   The more stringent standards will apply only to new engines and
are expected to reduce emissions by 70 percent in 2002 and 96.5
percent in 2009, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the technology is very energy-inefficient. It
really has a tremendous impact on air quality,'' said Peter
Iwanowicz, director of environmental health at the American Lung
Association of New York. ''This law will reduce the level of smog
in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwanowicz said up to a third of the gasoline-oil mixture used to
power the two-stroke personal watercraft engines is left unburned
and pollutes the air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Environmental Protection Agency has required
that personal watercraft meet federal emission standards beginning
2006.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gonsalves, a spokesman for Yamaha Motor Corp., maker of the
''WaveRunners'' craft, said the technology exists to make
environmentally cleaner engines, but ''the challenge is redesigning
it for personal watercraft.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry cannot meet these accelerated deadlines because
it's technically difficult to design these engines,'' Gonsalves
said. ''Consumers can expect less choice and definitely expect
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iwanowicz countered that manufacturers are just using ''cost
as a scare tactic'' and that consumers will save on fuel and
health-related costs in the long run with more energy-efficient
models.
</P>
<P>
   Iwanowicz cited a report used by the California government to
set its emission regulations had concluded that the technology for
making more energy-efficient engines exists.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation will oversee
enforcement of the tougher ''Jet Ski'' emission regulations and is
expected to adopt the regulations by October 2001. The new law goes
into effect two years after DEC adopts the standards. From that
time on, new personal watercraft in New York will not be allowed to
registered unless they meet emission standards.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Pataki signed into law another ''Jet Ski''
related law that allowed local governments to limit or ban personal
watercraft on local waterways.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that there are 50,000 personal watercraft in New
York and that twice as many people operate those crafts.

<HEADLINE> Heaton Likes Practical Emmy Fashion  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Patricia Heaton tried on 20 different dresses
before settling on a body-hugging, low-cut number with yellow
stitched flowers and silver beading for Sunday's Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the kind of outfit the long-suffering housewife she plays
on CBS' ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' would wear. But practicality
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whichever dress I could get the scaffolding underneath without
it showing, that's the one I picked,'' said Heaton, who won lead
actress in a comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Mullally of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' winner for supporting comedy
actress, wore a jeweled butterfly ring that covered most of her
right hand. Wearing a crinkled navy dress with a plunging
V-neckline, Mullally joked she needed a towel to mop up the sweat
on a sizzling afternoon outside the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Red proved a popular color with actresses unafraid of blending
into the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston of ''Friends,'' who lost to Mullally, donned a
long strapless red satin gown beside new husband Brad Pitt. Aniston
wore her long hair straight and pulled back -- a change from last
year's piles of curls.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees Debra Messing of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' Stockard Channing
and Molly Shannon also shined in red satin dresses during the
preshow fashion parade.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and silver showed up in clothing and makeup, including the
shimmery silver eyeshadow worn by Laura Innes of ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, star of ''The Practice,'' worked her way through
the gridlock of celebrities and publicists in a long gray flannel
dress and matching wrap by Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to be cutting edge,'' Manheim said. ''I put this on at
2:45 and I was here at 3:30. Time management.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Cattrall, a nominee for ''Sex and the City,'' set off her
gray matte jersey long skirt with a gray beaded top with cap
sleeves by Randolph Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I wanted was to feel really comfortable and relaxed,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker, Cattrall's co-star, floated in a short
dress with a full skirt accented by pale pink feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Leeves of ''Frasier,'' who is expecting a baby in January,
wore a simple deep-purple long dress held up by a single spaghetti
strap that formed a V.
</P>
<P>
   Black was a color staple for most of the male actors. Steven Van
Zandt of ''The Sopranos'' accented his black tuxedo with a
trademark bandanna pulled low on his forehead. He seemed taken
aback by the red-carpet chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a nice low level of celebrity,'' he said. ''People say
hello and they keep walking.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dip your hand in your pocket or purse and look
at your change. If your nickel's replica of the Jefferson Memorial
or quarter's profile of George Washington doesn't inspire awe or
patriotism, you have company in Sen. Phil Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our coins and our currency are crummy,'' said Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A coin collector as a boy, Gramm is now chairman of the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has oversight
of currency design.
</P>
<P>
   He is bringing together coin professionals and hobbyists
Wednesday to discuss whether the look of U.S. currency -- coins and
bills -- should be changed. Although he has no plans for
legislation, he hopes the forum might lead in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that American coins and I don't believe
American currency reached the level of beauty that you would expect
that the coins and currency of the greatest nation in history of
the world would achieve,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said he'd like American coins to capture the majesty of
Greek coins, which include one with Hercules wearing a lion's head
on front and Zeus atop a throne on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Ute Wartenberg, executive director of the American Numismatic
Society, a New York museum that focuses on academic study of coins,
has a more positive view of U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought they looked a bit nice, if conservative,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coin designs are old. The current nickel was designed in
1938. The standard quarter with a spread-winged eagle on its
''tails'' side was designed in 1932 and the Lincoln profile on the
penny has been around since 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doty, the Smithsonian Institution's curator of
numismatics, agrees with Gramm that it's time to change U.S.
change.
</P>
<P>
   The coins ''have been with us an awfully long time,'' Doty said.
''If there's no one around saying, 'Can we have a more inspiring
5-cent piece,' nothing's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows for change in coin designs every 25 years.
Recent examples are the new quarters featuring each of the 50
states and the Sacagawea ''golden'' dollar, which replaced the
18-year-old Susan B. Anthony dollar. Both coins are highly popular
with collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''People at this point are paying a great deal of attention to
their coins and coin design because of the 50-state quarter program
and the likability of the golden dollar,'' said Jay Johnson, U.S.
Mint director. ''I think it will be an interesting debate and long
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who voted for the 1997 act that created the Sacagawea
coin, considers its design an improvement over the penny, nickel,
dime, quarter and half dollar. The gold-colored coin features the
Shoshone Indian who guided explorers Lewis and Clark, and her
infant son Jean Baptiste. An eagle circled by 17 stars soars on the
back of the copper alloy coin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. coins considered most beautiful by Gramm and many
numismatists were ones inspired by President Theodore Roosevelt,
who persuaded sculptor Agustus St. Gaudens to design them. His work
includes a $10 gold coin with a profile of Lady Liberty wearing an
Indian bonnet on the front and a standing eagle in profile on the
back. He also created a $20 gold coin whose front had Lady Liberty
striding forward with rays of sunshine in the background and an
eagle in flight on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law dictates some aspects of a coin's design, such as
including ''In God We Trust.'' Designs must be made with a single
strike of the press with fairly shallow relief, otherwise they
become too costly, Doty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those things aside,'' Doty said, ''we could do better work and
the Sacagawea dollar may be a pointer toward the future.''

<HEADLINE> Trio Lead Survey For New Coins  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Coin collectors around the country would
like to have the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Ronald Reagan and
Harry Truman in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader and two former presidents were the top
vote-getters in a national survey asking collectors whom they would
like to see depicted on coins.
</P>
<P>
   The collectors' suggestions ranged from Jesus Christ to the
Three Stooges and included 33 presidents as well as astronauts,
actresses, artists, baseball players, pioneers and a king -- Elvis
Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping if we can get enough exposure, we might start a
groundswell for some revisions to our pocket change,'' said David
Sundman, president of Littleton Coin Co. of Littleton, N.H., which
conducted the survey that was completed open-ended, with no
nominees suggested by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though Abe Lincoln was a great guy, the (penny) design is
coming up on a century in a few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted the survey on its Web site and sent
questionnaires to customers with coin orders. King was the top
choice of the 1,940 collectors who responded.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has changed the lives of many people and deserves the
recognition,'' one collector wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After King, Reagan and Truman were astronaut and former Sen.
John Glenn, President Theodore Roosevelt, evangelist Billy Graham,
astronaut Neil Armstrong, physicist Albert Einstein, actor John
Wayne and Presley. President Clinton came in 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Also included were sports figures Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe, Michael
Jordan and Mark McGwire; military figures Douglas MacArthur, Robert
E. Lee, George Patton and Audie Murphy; and entertainers Bob Hope,
Frank Sinatra, Charlton Heston and The Three Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who responded wants to see coins limited to famous
people. ''I'd like to see something absolutely different, for
example, a hot dog or a nice picture of a turkey,'' one collector
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates drew seven
nominations, landing him 78th on the list, but not always with
glowing recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has most all of our cash anyway,'' one collector wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar survey five years ago, the top three choices were
the same, but in different order: Reagan, Truman and King.
</P>
<P>
   Sundman said the results would be sent to the Senate Banking
Committee, which has oversight of coin designs.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Chief DeParle Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nancy-Ann DeParle, who has overseen the
government's Medicare and Medicaid programs for three years, has
resigned to take a job at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle, a native Tennessean, will become a fellow at the
Kennedy School of Government's health policy program.
</P>
<P>
   During her term, DeParle worked to extend the life of the
Medicare trust fund, reduce fraud and abuse of the system and
expand insurance coverage to include more than 2 million children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no right time to leave the gratifying and important
work we have shared,'' DeParle said in a message to her colleagues,
''so leaving is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her position as administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, DeParle worked in the Office of
Management and Budget, where she oversaw budget and policy matters
for federal health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy-Ann DeParle has done an extraordinary job at the helm of
the HCFA. She's a first-class professional,'' Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle was President Clinton's second Medicare head, succeeding
Bruce Vladeck, who took a professorship at Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle's replacement has not been named. Michael Hash, the
deputy administrator, probably will run the agency at least through
January, when a new administration will take office.

<HEADLINE> Landlord-tenant dispute may have led to woman's death, police say  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Police were investigating whether an ongoing
dispute between a tenant and her landlord led to the woman's
shooting death Monday in an Upper East Side apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The tenant, a 69-year-old schoolteacher, allegedly went to the
landlord's third-floor apartment armed with a claw hammer, said
Assistant Chief William Taylor, head of Manhattan Detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord, Louis Hubrecht, 65, told police he shot the woman
when she tried to attack him shortly before 9:30 a.m., Taylor said.
The woman, identified as Barbara B. Kenna, was taken to New York
Hospital where she was pronounced dead a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Hubrecht and one of his sisters - who was at the apartment when
the shooting occurred - were brought in handcuffs to the 19th
Precinct for questioning, but have not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know the nature of the dispute. Hubrecht
initially described the conflict as a ''landlord-tenant dispute,''
police said. Both Hubrecht and Kenna lived in the apartment
building for many years, police added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shooting occurred at 700 Madison Avenue, a
well-heeled location between 63rd and 64th streets, residents were
not alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This seems like a pretty isolated case, like something had
been brewing between them for a while,'' said Alyssa Bernard, 54.
''I still consider this neighborhood the safest in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenna's death is only the second murder to occur this year in
the 19th Precinct. In 1999, there was only one murder in the
precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Hubrecht owns the five-story, rent-controlled apartment and
commercial building, sandwiched between several small shops that
include a hat store, a dress shop and a hosiery store. Three floors
of apartments are located above two floors of shops.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Kenna went to Hubrecht's apartment, where the
two argued. At some point, Hubrecht called one of his sisters, who
lives in Manhattan, to come over because he was arguing with Kenna,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the sister arrived, Kenna allegedly tried to attack
Hubrecht and he fired several shots, Taylor said. Kenna was struck
three to four times, police said. An autopsy was scheduled for
Tuesday. Hubrecht was licensed to own the handgun, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna had been employed as a full-time elementary school teacher
at Public School 2 in midtown Manhattan since 1970, said Marjorie
Feinberg, a Board of Education spokeswoman. She worked as a
substitute school teacher from 1955 to 1970.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Asthma Drug Genes  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a step toward an age of ''personalized
medicines,'' researchers have found gene variations that affect the
way individual asthma sufferers respond to a drug widely used to
control acute attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Out of thousands of variations in a single gene, the researchers
said they have identified 12 that determine how well asthma
patients respond to albuterol, a drug commonly used to prevent or
to control acute attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the genes that affect the way a person responds to a
drug will help physicians to individually tailor prescriptions for
each patient, said Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, a researcher at the
University of Cincinnati School of Medicine and the senior author
of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a step toward personalized medicine,'' said Liggett.
''The era of one drug fitting all is probably coming an end soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Liggett said medicines now are generally tested on large numbers
of people ''and we look at the average response of those on the
drug versus those on placebo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see responses that are very, very good and some that
are bad,'' said Liggett. ''The FDA says to look at the average
response.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, some drugs that may be quite useful for a
small subset of patients may never become available because they
show little or no benefit, or even harm, for the average patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we become more sophisticated, we may become highly specific
in prescribing drugs for certain genetic makeups,'' said Liggett.
''We may have a host of wonderful drugs that could be liberated by
genetic testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said Liggett, doctors treating difficult disorders,
such as asthma, often must use trial and error in order to find a
drug that fits precisely a patient's needs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Proceedings study, Liggett and his co-authors composed a
profile of the gene associated with the beta-2 adrenergic receptor,
which is the target of albuterol. They found a genetic variability
that could lead to 8,192 combinations and identified 12
combinations that directly affect the response to the medicine.
This was based on drug response tests of 121 patients from
different ethnic and racial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the genetic patterns, said Liggett, it is now possible
to identify asthma sufferers who have a high probability to respond
well to albuterol and those who have a low probability of being
helped by the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a significant observation,'' said Dr. William W.
Busse, an asthma expert and professor of medicine at the University
of Wisconsin. ''If we could find a gene variable that would enable
a doctor to make predictions about how people would respond to a
medicine, it would be very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Liggett said similar genetic studies are now underway for all of
the classes of drugs used to treat asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, genetic tests of an asthma patient will
identify those drugs most likely to be useful and those apt to less
useful. From this, a personalized list of probable benefits could
be drawn up for each individual patient and used by the doctor to
write prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would reduce the trial and error period that all
physicians go through when they have patients with complex
conditions,'' said Liggett.
</P>
<P>
   Albuterol is the asthma drug most commonly used to control acute
attacks. It works by blocking the beta-2-adrenergic receptor. This
causes muscles to relax and allows bronchial tubes to dilate,
aiding the flow of air to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is a disease process where the bronchial airway
contracts, causing wheezing and difficulty in breathing. Often it
is caused by an allergy reaction to air pollutants, smoke or other
substances. It can also be prompted in some people by exercise or
even by emotion.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 million Americans suffer from asthma and about 5,000
die from the disease annually.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 82; Dow Falls 25  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investor concerns about technology stocks pushed
markets lower Monday for a second straight session, despite a surge
in some energy and financial services stocks.
</P>
<P>
   After fluctuating throughout the day, the Dow Jones industrial
average closed down 25.16 at 11,195.49.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 82.06 to 3,896.35, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dropped 5.24 to 1,489.26.
</P>
<P>
   The declines came on the heels of a disappointing first week of
September. On Friday, blue chips and technology issues fell sharply
as investors concerned about third-quarter earnings took profits or
sought to minimize their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so many crosscurrents here ... interest rates ... oil.
And there's some nervousness about third-quarter (earnings)
preannouncements,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ''The best I can characterize the market is just
that the volatility continues. It's a nervous market with more
trading going on than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices surged Monday despite OPEC's announcement that it
will would add 800,000 barrels to its daily production target of
25.4 million barrels. Energy stocks also moved higher after
analysts expressed concern that the boost would not be enough to
bring fuel prices down. Schlumberger traded up $2.75 at $85.25,
Halliburton was up $2.17 at $54.23, and Baker Hughes rose $1.88 to
$38.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were less enthused about technology stocks. Shares of
IBM traded lower, down $4.88 at $124.63, after a Goldman Sachs
analyst lowered her revenue and earnings forecasts. Other high-tech
losers included Oracle which fell $3.13 to $83.44; Sun
Microsystems, down $5.50 at $115.25; and Cisco Systems, off $2.69
at $61.19.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a certain sense of malaise that is going to continue
until we get a better sense of what third-quarter earnings are,''
said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen
Securities. ''Valuations for many companies are still quite rich
and there's no room for earnings disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened Monday, investment bank Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. announced it had agreed to buy the Wall Street market
maker firm Spear Leeds &AMP; Kellogg L.P. for $6.5 billion in stock and
cash to expand its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major deal in the financial services industry
in less than a week. On Wednesday, Citigroup said it was buying
lending powerhouse Associates First Capital Corp. for about $30
billion in stock in an effort to increase its global business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs' shares were up $8.06 at $132.31. Spear Leeds &AMP;
Kellogg is privately held.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing rumors that Deutsche Bank is eyeing J.P. Morgan helped
push Morgan's shares up $5.31 to $169.31.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Phillips Petroleum also rose $1.44 to $63.38 on
speculation that it was in merger talks with Chevron, whose shares
rose $2.63 at $89.31.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.10 billion shares,
less than Friday's 1.19 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.08 at 533.62.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 2.25 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.73 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.28 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.42 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A judge criticized the Department of
Children and Families for acting improperly and ignoring a couple's
desire to have a minister and his wife care for their son, the
Connecticut Law Tribune reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Kelly Silk, who died in a June 1999 murder-suicide,
said in their wills that they wanted Chad and Sara Prigge to raise
their children. Police say Kelly Silk fatally stabbed her husband,
Charles, on June 10, 1999, and set a fire in which she and two of
their four children died.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Middletown juvenile court judge, there was no
legal reason to stop the Prigges from gaining custody of Joshua
Silk, who was 2 months old when he was rescued from the burning
house.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Jessica, survived 61 stab wounds and burns and has
moved to Minnesota to live with her biological father.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling on custody of Joshua, Middletown Superior Court Judge
Carl Schuman said a DCF worker destroyed evidence on the morning of
a deposition; said the agency rebuffed overtures from the Prigges;
and said the agency placed the child with different parents without
regard to the dead couple's wishes, according to court records
obtained by the Law Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman concluded that the Prigges deserved to get the boy and
would have been fine parents. But he ruled that Aldo and Lisa
Vallera should adopt Joshua, largely because DCF sent the infant to
them first and the child has bonded with them.
</P>
<P>
   In a 25-page opinion issued Aug. 21, Schuman detailed how DCF
had ignored the law of wills and custody and failed to give the
Prigges either a first or second chance to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, a DCF worker made a single phone call to Chad Prigge
in which DCF says he expressed reservations about taking the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a phone conversation is not a valid means of waiving
important testamentary rights,'' the judge said. ''At the very
least'' DCF should have obtained a formal, written waiver of those
rights, Schuman said.
</P>
<P>
   DCF workers placed Joshua with the Valleras, but within a week
the Prigges began their quest for the boy. Prigge attempted to meet
with court officials at the temporary custody hearing but was asked
to leave, Schuman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an assistant attorney general for DCF was
telling the court the Prigges ''were approached by the department
and they've indicated they do not want to take custody of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prigges contest that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said DCF ignored a 1991 state appellate court ruling
that favors placement of children with guardians identified in
wills.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman also criticized the destruction of original handwritten
interview notes and typing of a new version for a deposition,
calling it a ''highly improper'' action that calls for ''decisive
corrective measures.''
</P>
<P>
   DCF officials declined to comment on the report Monday because
the matter involved a juvenile. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
also declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Nun To Deliver House Prayer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sister Catherine Moran of New Jersey will
become the first Roman Catholic nun to serve as guest chaplain of
the House on Tuesday, when she delivers the opening prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit comes six months after House Speaker Dennis Hastert
resolved a bitter dispute by appointing a Roman Catholic as House
chaplain for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Catherine works at the New Community Corporation in
Newark, N.J., and has been a member of the Dominican Sisters for 55
years. She has worked as a teacher, principal and superintendent of
schools in the Archdiocese of Newark and was formerly the principal
of elementary and high schools in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the House Chaplain said Sister Catherine will be
the first non-ordained woman to offer an opening prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hastert appointed the Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin as the
first Roman Catholic to hold the position of House chaplain,
ministering to lawmakers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The choice followed four months of controversy that began when
some Democrats accused GOP leaders of anti-Catholic bigotry for
appearing to pass over a widely supported priest in favor of a
Protestant for the chaplain post.
</P>
<P>
   Guest chaplains, nominated by members of Congress, offer opening
prayers two to three times each week when Congress is in session.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., nominated Moran and will introduce
her on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Paciello codefendants plead guilty in mob case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Three men accused along with a Miami Beach
nightclub owner in a mob murder case surprised prosecutors Monday
by pleading guilty to racketeering charges carrying possible life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas by the codefendants of Chris Paciello came just two
weeks before they were to go on trial together in Brooklyn for
allegedly robbing banks, dealing drugs and settling scores for the
Bonanno organized crime family. Paciello and the other remaining
defendant, reputed Bonanno boss Anthony Spero, now will be tried
separately, with Paciello's trial delayed until mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had alleged that all five men were behind an early
1990s crime spree that left a half-dozen bodies in its wake,
including that of Staten Island housewife Judith Shemtov.
</P>
<P>
   Shemtov's daughters wept in Brooklyn federal court Monday as
defendant Thomas Reynolds confessed he was part of a violent holdup
crew that raided her home in 1993 on a tip that her businessman
husband had $200,000 stashed in a safe. Reynolds, 28, claimed his
gun accidentally went off, killing the victim before the getaway
car - allegedly driven by Paciello - sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also told U.S. District Judge Edward Korman that he was
among the armed bandits who smashed the windows of a Staten Island
bank and stole $300,000 in 1992. Accomplice witnesses have alleged
Paciello was both mastermind and lookout for the heist.
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant identified as a Bonanno soldier, Joseph
Benanti, 66, admitted in his plea that he ordered a hit on a drug
addict who burglarized the home of Spero's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said it was OK, your honor,'' Benanti said. ''I didn't pull
the trigger myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabrizio DeFrancisci, 30, also pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, defense attorneys said their clients were
gambling that they would be spared life sentences if they admitted
their guilt. Korman did not set a sentencing date.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wanted to do life,'' said attorney Vincent Romano.
''This was their best chance at a (lesser) sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have accused Paciello, 28, of using mob money to
open a string of celebrity hangouts in South Beach like Liquid, Bar
Room and Joia. They also say he used strong-arm tactics to
intimidate his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Paciello, whose real name is Christian Ludwigsen, has denied any
wrongdoing. His attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said the fact that his
client will be tried alone ''substantially increases'' his chances
for acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Federal court upholds Megan's Law provisions  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals has
approved guidelines crafted by the state Attorney General's Office
to limit the spread of information in sex offender notifications
under Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling is the latest to uphold New Jersey's version of
the law, which directs police and prosecutors to tell the public
the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the law also forbids people who get the notifications -
which usually include an offender's name, age and address - from
further spreading the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Megan's Law's fundamental purpose, however, is public
disclosure,'' wrote Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, a member of the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever privacy interest, if any, may exist in the area of
one's residence ... is substantially outweighed by the state's
compelling interest in disclosing Megan's Law information,'' Barry
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Barry cited revisions that require people to sign a notice
saying they will not disclose the information provided. Those that
don't sign are given a modified notice that does not include the
offender's address.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys from the state Public Defender's Office claimed in a
lawsuit that earlier court-ordered restrictions on confidentiality
rules were being ignored. Lawyers for the sex offenders also argued
that New Jersey's 21 counties had different rules to protect the
privacy of the offenders
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals court backed a lower court judge
who said Attorney General John J. Farmer took adequate steps to
correct that flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is significant because, for now, it ends the litigation.
And it is the fullest recognition from the courts of the compelling
interests of the state,'' Farmer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court recognized that disclosure is at the heart of
Megan's Law and that the public interest is so compelling, that it
should not be frustrated by the privacy interests of convicted sex
offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel also said New Jersey's counties do not need
to adopt uniform contempt-of-court penalties for those who violate
certain provisions of Megan's Law, public defender spokesman Jeff
Beach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The full panel felt the attorney general's guidelines are
adequate protections,'' Beach said.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly-appointed lawyers were consulting with their
clients on possible appeals, Beach said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas ordered Farmer to
impose tighter, more consistent rules statewide. In April, Irenas
ruled that Farmer's updated regulations were adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for sex offenders promptly appealed, and federal
Appellate Judge Dolores Sloviter issued an order to freeze
sex-offender notifications while the appellate court reviewed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Barry lifted that order after oral arguments before the court on
July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law was passed after 7-year-old Megan Kanka of Hamilton
Township, Mercer County, was raped and murdered in July 1994 by
Jesse Timmendequas, a neighbor with a record of sex crimes.
Timmendequas is scheduled to have his death penalty sentence
reviewed by the state Supreme Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands after nearly six years of court review, Megan's
Law groups convicted sex offenders into one of three categories
based on the risk the offender is believed to pose to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   For those deemed most likely to commit another crime, the law
allows prosecutors to provide the offender's name, address and
photo to residents living in a carefully defined area. All
offenders are required to register with police once released from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling again reinforces the fact that limits need to be
placed on the notification process, lawyer Jack Furlong said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Megan's Law has done is wind its way through the courts
and it survived a shakedown cruise after significant
modifications,'' said Furlong, who has challenged the law since it
was proposed.

<HEADLINE> Historians: Clinton's Reputation OK  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton can take heart: Impeachment
may have sullied his legacy, but it will do little damage to his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion Monday of a panel of scholars, who said
even the greatest presidents were maligned in office and became far
more attractive once they were examined through history's long
lens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a pretty cruel country,'' said historian Allen
Weinstein, founder of the nonprofit Center for Democracy. ''We
judge harshly, but we're pretty good about forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that sense, Clinton does have some comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Panelists, convened as part of a forum on the American
presidency, noted that save for the impeachment, Clinton's
experiences in the White House are in line with that of most modern
presidents. His reputation, like those of his predecessors, will
remain in flux for a long time, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the most difficult job in the world,'' said Boston
University history professor Robert Dallek, author of a biography
of Lyndon B. Johnson. ''None of these men are saints. They're not
eager to 'fess up to it. Who is?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, presidential reputations often are shaped by
something over which they have no control: the actions of their
successors. As an example, Dallek cited what might happen if George
W. Bush should be elected this fall and the country fell into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''My gosh, Bill Clinton's reputation is going to go to the
moon!'' Dallek said.
</P>
<P>
   About the best parallel for Clinton is Richard Nixon, the
panelists said. While Nixon's legacy is that he is the only
president to resign, his actual reputation is undergoing ''a
process of redemption,'' said Tom Wicker, a New York Times
columnist during Nixon's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the years go on, (Nixon's actions) tend to take on greater
weight,'' Wicker said. ''Richard Nixon, prior to Watergate, was not
really the inconsequential president. He was not totally an
unpopular man.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nixon, Clinton is unlikely to face prosecution after he
leaves office, but that alone will not suffice, Wicker said. ''He
will do enough to damage his own reputation without that,'' Wicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallek noted a 1988 poll in which Johnson, who drew much
vilification for his handling of the Vietnam War, was consistently
ranked last among presidents for on-the-job performance. By
February of this year, however, a C-SPAN poll showed Johnson at
10th overall, and second only to Abraham Lincoln on matters of
civil rights, courtesy of his Great Society programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that strong legacy, Johnson's reputation swings back and
forth, due to a tendency to examine his presidency for guidance on
foreign policy errors and domestic achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ''His reputation in the future will be volatile,'' Dallek said.
''He will become kind of a touchstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Harry Truman, who earned himself a heap of scorn
with his blunt style. ''He left the White House demoralized,
depressed and discredited,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As an ex-president, Truman's blunt assessments became rather
appealing. His statement that Nixon was a ''shifty-eyed liar'' --
and the fact that Truman died during the Watergate scandal --
touched off ''a minor Truman craze'' that is now helping Truman
evolve into something of a presidential standard-bearer, Weinstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, professor of history at the University of New
Orleans, said former presidents now feel a need to burnish their
records after they leave the White House, because of the way Jimmy
Carter re-shaped the role of the ex-president. That, in turn,
creates added pressure for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton is focusing on, 'How can I be like Carter?'''
Brinkley said. ''Every ex-president has the Carter standard to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter came to set that standard only after the 1981
assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, when
self-reflection led him to devote himself to peace causes and
building homes for the poor. That is a stark contrast to Carter the
no-frills president who was a ''horrible political leader,''
Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He makes us feel there is something clean about politicians
after all,'' Brinkley said. ''I think we'll miss that clean smell
of Jimmy Carter.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers call for more dam aid  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In the aftermath of two destructive storms
in consecutive years, a legislative leader said Monday that New
Jersey should spend more money repairing dams.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins called on lawmakers to recommend
new funds to improve dam safety, without specifying an amount. He
made his comments at a special hearing convened to assess damage
caused by a mid-August storm that dumped torrential rains on Sussex
and Morris counties.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he does not believe the $9 million earmarked by
Gov. Christie Whitman this year is adequate to ensure the state's
1,600 dams remain safe. Sixty-seven of the structures are
considered ''high hazard'' and in need of repair, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers originally proposed $50 million over three years
for dam inspection and repair, but the governor cut the amount,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not for bigger government, but on the other hand, let's
be real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's look at the financial support. To me, this is something
that government should definitely be involved in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees
dam regulations, must also beef up its staff to keep dam
inspections up to date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Robert Littell, R-Sussex, told members of the
Assembly Appropriations Committee that the need for state dam aid
may be as high as $135 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman cut the $50 million measure first pushed by lawmakers
because she deemed it a knee-jerk response to a problem that needed
more study, her spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She directed that the DEP develop strategies to recommend
methods of funding, rather than do it on a case-by-case basis,''
said spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   DEP Assistant Commissioner Cari Wild said her staff is in the
midst of a push to make sure high-hazard dams are inspected in a
timely manner and repaired when necessary. Some dams are classified
high hazard not because they are in disrepair, but because of large
populations that live downstream, she said.
</P>
<P>
   High-hazard dams must be inspected every other year. Inspections
involve a review of the structure's integrity, an analysis of the
spillway's capacity, and a comparison with the dam's original
plans. State dam records go back to 1912, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wild said her staff could do additional work with more funding,
but said it is too early to say how much more money is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, meanwhile, heard contrasting reports from mayors of
towns struck by the mid-August storm, and mayors of towns hit by
the equally fierce Hurricane Floyd one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Mayor Robert E. Piccoli, complained that state and
federal authorities have not gotten back to his Bergen County
borough since June. The agency has paid the municipality only
$172,000 on more than $5 million in damage from Hurricane Floyd, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We send $1 billion to Columbia to fight drugs with no strings
attached. What we really need is for the federal government to help
people in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hayden, director of the state Office of Emergency
Management, said that Oakland may not be entitled to everything it
wants because some of the damage occurred to private property.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martinasco, coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, said he would look into Piccoli's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Eric Wilsusen of the Jefferson Township Police Department,
on the other hand, said ''FEMA was a real pleasure to work with''
in the aftermath of the August 2000 rainstorm.

<HEADLINE> No arrest yet in Atlantic City highway shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMMONTON, N.J. (AP) - A gunman responsible for a pre-dawn
shooting spree in Atlantic City last week apparently remained at
large Monday, and authorities remained tightlipped about their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz would
not comment on whether police have a suspect, nor would she
identify the lone survivor of the attack, which occurred at 4 a.m.
Friday when a man with an assault rifle opened fire on a 1989 Honda
Accord stopped for a red light on U.S. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Wilson, 21, Richard White, 26, and Michael Demps, 20, all
of Pleasantville, were killed. Wilson - the driver - was shot as he
ran away from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not appropriate, at this time, to release the victim's
name,'' said the spokeswoman, Janet Niedosik. She would not say
why.
</P>
<P>
   She also declined comment on the motive for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Demps was shot five times, according to autopsy results released
Monday. The fatal wound was to the head. White, too, was shot five
times, and Wilson once in the back of the head and once in the
shoulder, according to autopsies by Dr. Eliot Gross of the Cape May
County Medical Examiner's Office.

<HEADLINE> Clinton visits Danbury to raise money for Maloney  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) - Warming to his self-described new role as
''cheerleader-in-chief,'' President Clinton Monday stumped for
embattled U.S. Rep. Jim Maloney, D-5th District, raising more than
$200,000 for Maloney's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's four-hour visit, the first by a sitting president to
Danbury in nearly a century, included a luncheon speech at a local
banquet hall and a rally for about 3,000 people at Western
Connecticut State University.
</P>
<P>
   At each appearance, Clinton said it was important for voters to
return Maloney to office.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is profoundly important,'' Clinton said, noting
that control of Congress - and the fate of Democratic priorities
such as a patients' bill of rights and prescription benefits for
seniors on Medicare - hinges on a few key races, including the 5th
District.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maloney voted in favor of an inquiry to impeach Clinton
two years ago, the two men were all smiles as they shook hands and
hugged before Clinton addressed a luncheon fundraiser at the Amber
Room Colonnade. Maloney ultimately voted against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Maloney ''a good man,'' Clinton told an enthusiastic
crowd of more than 750 Democratic activists that it was important
that they do more than contribute money to Maloney's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Care enough to talk for him'' to friends and neighbors as the
Nov. 7 election approaches, Clinton urged. ''Make sure people hear
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   And while they are out touting the Connecticut congressman,
Maloney supporters might get in a word or two on behalf of his
wife, who is running for U.S. Senate in New York, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family has a new candidate and my party has a new leader.
I've become the cheerleader in chief, and I love it,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential endorsement was a hit with Maloney's
supporters, who called the president's visit the boost Maloney
needed to fend an energetic challenge from Republican Mark Nielsen.
Maloney's campaign said the visit generated between $200,000 and
$250,000.

   Nielsen narrowly lost to Maloney in 1998, and the two men are
expected to spend more than $1 million apiece for the rematch. Both
national parties have targeted the district as a key race in the
battle for control of Congress, and each campaign is already on the
air with TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, aware that Clinton's visit would generate significant
media coverage, showed up at the Western Connecticut rally to blast
Clinton and Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an example of two politicians whose careers have been
marred by campaign finance scandals, together raising money. I
think that is a sad picture,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen got some high-profile support of his own last week, as
GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney appeared in the
district to tout a Republican plan for prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Schwartz of Newtown called Clinton's speech
''electrifying.'' Rae Sammis of New Milford said Clinton had
''really gotten people excited about the race. This is a tight race
and anything that can help Jim Maloney is needed.''

<HEADLINE> Virginia Gov. says DNA tests confirm killer's guilt  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Recent DNA tests from a woman who was raped
and killed seven years ago show that a Virginia death row inmate
committed the crime, Gov. Jim Gilmore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Derek R. Barnabei, 33, a Somers Point, N.J. native, is scheduled
to die Thursday night for the slaying of Sarah J. Wisnosky, a
17-year-old college freshman whose nude body was found in a river
Sept. 22, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore ordered DNA tests on the victim's fingernail clippings,
which vanished late last month for a few days along with other
material from a secure evidence storage area.
</P>
<P>
   Blood on the clippings was found to have come from Barnabei,
Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite clear that Barnabei was the match. It is a very
clear determination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Tucker, an attorney for Barnabei, said he will insist that
other DNA evidence in the case also be tested to prove that someone
else was the killer. He denounced what he called government secrecy
in the handling of the evidence and said it only heightens
suspicions of tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has been acting like a thief in the night and
it merely raises more questions than it answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The determination leaves only the federal courts as Barnabei's
last hope. A hearing is tentatively scheduled Tuesday in a federal
lawsuit that asks the court to delay the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who alone under state law can grant clemency, said in a
written statement that he would not intervene further in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Texas man sentenced to life in prison was pardoned
after new DNA evidence suggested he didn't rape a girl whose naked
and bludgeoned body was found in September 1986.

<HEADLINE> 6 Injured in Mexico City Cop Fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City policemen demanding the
resignation of their commander for alleged corruption stormed the
force's headquarters Monday in a protest that injured six officers.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed members of the city's blue-uniformed
auxiliary police force, who guard businesses and stores, hitting
fellow auxiliary officers with batons and poles. Several officers
suffered bloody head wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The six injured officers were rescued by riot police and treated
at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries. The protests
blocked traffic along some of the city's main streets.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have lodged a series of complaints against their
commander, police director Jose Luis Silva, in recent months,
including alleged corruption and fraud in a pension fund, as well
as inadequate equipment and benefits.

<HEADLINE> Schumer healing after tumble tears ligaments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer's misstep during a recent
Colorado vacation may keep him on crutches for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer tore several ligaments in his ankle when he stumbled
three feet off the platform of the cabin in Aspen where he and his
family were staying in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard my ankle go pop,'' Schumer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Democrat is undergoing physical therapy and is
wearing a soft cast during the day. He was in a wheelchair for a
brief time.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I actually walked on it today and it's feeling much
better,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came at the end of a cross-country trip with his
family that included hiking in the South Dakota Badlands and a trip
to Mount Rushmore. Schumer and his family arrived in Aspen late at
night and he fell while searching for the cabin's key in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   It's Schumer's second tumble in recent weeks. At the Democratic
Convention in Los Angeles, Schumer rode his bike into a car. He was
left with bruises on his shin and a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been a good month,'' he acknowledged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he was fiddling with the gears of a rented mountain
bike when he slammed into a car driven by a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The accident didn't stop Schumer, an avid biker, from taking a
20-mile ride later that day.

<HEADLINE> 'Dr. Laura' Makes Her TV Debut  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- No one stormed the studio.
</P>
<P>
   The host didn't breathe fire.
</P>
<P>
   Defying months of protests by gay-rights groups, Dr. Laura
Schlessinger, radio's ethics noodge, launched her daytime TV talk
show Monday. Peace prevailed on the air.
</P>
<P>
   A target of gay activists since her public dismissal of
homosexuality as ''deviant'' and dangerous to society, Schlessinger
has also railed on the radio against abortion, divorce, feminism
and interfaith marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But for her TV premiere, the syndicated ''Dr. Laura'' chose a
troubling but not so controversial topic: ''Teens and Drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What is to blame?'' Schlessinger posed at the top of the show.
''Whatever it is, I'm sick of it, I'm very worried, and I want it
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, she led into a no-nonsense, consensus-seeking
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although the format and arena setting of the Los Angeles-based
series resemble those of a dozen talk-show counterparts, one
difference stood out: Schlessinger's guests were polite and
well-dressed, with those who had made mistakes apparently on the
mend.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Schlessinger puts a premium on solutions and
contrition.
</P>
<P>
   Her first guest, a mother named Kristin, described the drastic
stand she took by sending her teen away for a year of drug therapy.
How did daughter Lauren feel on getting roused in the middle of the
night by two attendants with handcuffs? Mad? Scared?
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy,'' Lauren said.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest represented a company that markets drug tests for
parents to use on their children. Schlessinger tested Mike, a
17-year-old former abuser, as his mother looked on. Mike came up
negative. The audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharli, a fresh-faced 17-year-old, confessed to enjoying
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   What personal need might that reveal? Schlessinger asked the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''A feeling that I don't have control of myself,'' Sharli
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a very important point,'' Schlessinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the hour, she explored a Texas high school's policy of
mandatory drug testing. When her Web site poll revealed that 44
percent of respondents were against such a program, she wasn't
pleased. ''I think you guys gotta think a little more about the
moral obligation involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   The show sparked a protest outside Paramount Studios from
activists who waved signs and chanted slogans like
''Two-four-six-eight, Schlessinger is full of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   But, overall, the debut avoided talk-show pyrotechnics and the
shrill tone of her call-in radio show. A kinder, gentler (if no
less resolute) Dr. Laura made her TV debut smartly -- without making
waves.

<HEADLINE> Blood at scene leads to a suspect, Suffolk County DA says  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - DNA lifted from blood stains at a crime
scene have led authorities to crack a year-long investigation into
a burglary of a Long Island floral shop, the Suffolk County
district attorney said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first cold hit DNA match in the state in a
property case,'' said District Attorney James Catterson. ''The
expanded DNA data bases in New York are providing an invaluable
tool for prosecutors and investigators to identify and bring to
justice perpetrators of crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagano, 37, of Huntington, was arraigned Monday in Suffolk
County Court on an indictment charging him with the Aug. 19, 1999,
burglary of the ''Flowers of the Heart'' floral store. Traces of
blood - the only evidence found at the scene - were allegedly left
on a piece of glass window apparently smashed by Pagano to gain
entry to the store, Catterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Pagano pleaded innocent to the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Pagano is currently in jail for the burglary of a Huntington
Station delicatessen almost a week after the first robbery. After
his arrest in that burglary, blood samples were taken from him,
said Catterson. The blood samples were put into the data base of
the New York Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), operated by the New
York State Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last month, we decided to send the traces of blood found at
the florist to CODIS to see if by chance there was a computer match
and, bingo,'' said Catterson.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few years ago this crime would never have been solved,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Pagano faces 3&AMP;frac12; to 7 years in prison if convicted of the charge.

<HEADLINE> Senator Plans To Stop Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator renewed his campaign
Monday to stop Senate votes on White House judicial nominations,
saying President Clinton had violated an agreement on recess
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., accused the president of undermining
a spirit of cooperation when he made 17 temporary appointments
while the Senate was not in session during August.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives the president power to make temporary
appointments during a congressional recess. The appointment stands
during that session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Inhofe, a fierce critic of Clinton, has contended that the
president has abused this right to appoint nominees whose
confirmations were in doubt because of questions raised in the
GOP-led Senate about their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am announcing tonight I will put a hold on all judicial
nominations for the rest of his term,'' Inhofe said. Clinton's term
expires Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate tradition, a single senator can put a ''hold'' on a
nomination, which makes it more difficult to get the nomination to
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe acknowledged that his latest action might be an ''empty
threat'' because of a lack of support from Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He also put holds on all nominations after Clinton made
appointments during the New Year's recess but was opposed by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott argued that the White
House had tried to act in good faith in making the appointments,
and the Senate should not hold up the nominations. Without Lott's
support, Inhofe last February lost a 79-19 vote on stop
confirmation of several judges.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats then were hitting the Republicans hard for causing
delays in confirmation votes for minority nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe pointed to a 1985 agreement between President Reagan and
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., then the majority leader, under which
the president pledged to give notice of any coming recess
appointments. Clinton agreed in June 1999 that this agreement was a
''fair and constructive framework.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma Republican said Clinton violated the agreement in
August with ''17 recess appointments in just an arrogant defiance
of the Senate's prerogative of advice and consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those appointed was Bill Lann Lee as assistant attorney
general for civil rights, who faced strong opposition from some
Senate Republicans.

<HEADLINE> France Sterilization Complaint Filed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A handicapped rights group on Monday filed a
complaint over the alleged forced sterilization of 14 mentally
handicapped young women at a state-run care facility in France.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in French media on Monday said that 14 women, in their
20s, had allegedly been sterilized without their consent since 1995
at a state facility in the town of Sens, in the Yonne region of
central France.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for the Defense of Handicapped People of Yonne
filed a complaint with a local court for the alleged ''violence
that led to the mutilation and permanent disabilities'' of the
patients, said the group's lawyer, Pierre Gonzalez de Gaspard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge promised to act fast in this serious matter,'' said
the lawyer, contacted by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the government released findings that some 225
physically or mentally handicapped men and women under state care
had been given forced sterilizations between 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that forced sterilization was ''infrequent, but
not negligible,'' and stressed that although the practice violated
French law, it was ''virtually tolerated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Rambling with Gambling,'' the longest-running
radio show in America, has rambled for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   WOR decided not to renew the contract of John Gambling, whose
grandfather originated the show 75 years ago. Although the contract
does not expire until December, Gambling decided that Monday would
be his last program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just could not see myself day after day dying a slow
pathetic death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling continued the tradition of news, interviews and
lighthearted talk started by his grandfather and continued by his
father. Gambling joined his father as co-host 15 years ago and took
over as the main host 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling said his ratings were good and improving, but station
management was seeking a younger audience more attractive to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   News Director Joe Bartlett will serve as interim host until a
permanent replacement was named. Bartlett often filled in for
Gambling, and on Saturdays would joke with his listeners that
Gambling wanted a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bartlett conceded Monday that he was shocked by the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would see this,'' he said.

	   BEACON, N.Y. (AP) - Police were still without suspects Monday in
the weekend shooting of a 20-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Anthony Grant was found about 5:10 a.m. Saturday in a
parking lot of a housing complex, bleeding from gunshot wounds to
his chest, groin, lower abdomen and arm. Nearby was a semiautomatic
pistol that police estimate was shot more than 17 times. Police
believe Grant was shot at about a dozen times by two people.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who is not a resident of the complex, apparently tried to
flee his attackers by running through the complex, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in critical condition at Westchester County Medical

</P>
<P>
   Police do not have a motive for the shooting. They said it

<HEADLINE> Ellen Barkin testifies in Perelman-Duff custody trial  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Actress Ellen Barkin, who this summer became the
fourth bride of cosmetics king Ronald Perelman, admitted Monday
that she feels some hostility for her husband's socialite ex-wife,
Patricia Duff.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for Perelman in his fight with Duff, 46, over custody
of 5-year-old Caleigh, their only child together, Barkin admitted
that Duff has done nothing to her but said Duff's attacks on the
makeup mogul anger her.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx-born Barkin, who married Perelman, 57, on June 28 at a
synagogue in Manhattan, said her husband is a loving, attentive,
and religious father whose six children and two stepchildren adore
him.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman's lawyer, Adria Hillman, said she called Barkin as a
witness to counter Duff's charges that her client, the billionaire
chairman of Revlon, is an irresponsible and uncaring parent.
</P>
<P>
   Barkin, 46, said Perelman, whom she began dating in April 1999,
acts as a father to the boy and girl she had with her first
husband, actor Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a constant presence in their lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkin's testimony suggested that Duff, while claiming she
wanted to ''tear down the walls'' between Perelman's children and
ex-spouses, seemed to try to alienate Caleigh from her
stepsiblings.
</P>
<P>
   The actress quoted Caleigh as saying that Duff had told her that
Barkin's two children by Byrne, Jack 11, and Romy, 7, ''don't want
to see me, don't want to be with me, and don't want to play with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkin also said Caleigh seems ''anxious'' and apprehensive when
Duff telephones to speak with her at Perelman's house. Barkin said
she has seen the child shaking and trembling while saying to Duff,
''No, mommy. Nobody's touching the phone. Nobody. I can hear you
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkin said she had never heard Caleigh say that she missed
Duff.

<P>
   Duff's lawyer, Toby Kleinman, tried to blunt Barkin's
unflattering testimony about her client by mentioning Barkin's
topless appearances in movies, questioning her religious faith -
Barkin was born to Jewish parents - and saying she was hostile to
Duff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you have any hostility to Ms. Duff?'' Kleinman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of what she's done to my husband and to Caleigh,''
Barkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinman also asked whether Barkin's prenuptial agreement with
Perelman bars her from saying anything negative about him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe it's there,'' the actress replied, and when
Kleinman pressed her, she said, ''I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkin, whose movie credits include ''Sea of Love'' and ''The
Big Easy,'' was the final witness in the trial. Bransten said she
will hear motions Thursday. A date for closing arguments was not
set.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence Found On AIDS Origin  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Independent laboratory tests have found no
evidence to support the theory that an experimental polio vaccine
used on about 1 million Africans in the 1950s inadvertently
triggered the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented Monday at a conference at the Royal
Society in London, found no evidence that the vaccine, administered
between 1957 and 1961, contained any tissue from chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, most
probably originates from the type of SIV, or simian
immunodeficiency virus, found in chimpanzees in western central
Africa. But they don't know how or when the chimp virus got into
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory is that a hunter became infected after
being scratched by a chimp when trying to capture it or after
cutting himself while butchering the animal. However, some experts
suspect that polio vaccine made with contaminated chimpanzee cells
may have been the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest tests, samples of four different supplies of the
vaccine, including some used in the African immunization program,
were tested for traces of genetic material from animals.
</P>
<P>
   Two independent laboratories -- the Max-Planck Institute in
Leipzig, Germany and Paris's Pasteur Institute, the lab where HIV
was first isolated -- were given vaccine samples to test.
</P>
<P>
   The tests revealed the samples were made using monkey tissue and
found no chimp DNA, said Claudio Basilico, chairman of the
microbiology department at New York University School of Medicine,
told the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Basilico chaired a committee of scientists set up by
Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, the research institute which
produced the vaccine, to investigate claims that chimp tissue might
have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does this definitively rule out the vaccine theory? No, but it
makes it more unlikely,'' Basilico said. He said record-keeping was
sketchy at the time and that there may have been other samples not
tested that were used in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were also designed to find traces of SIV and found
none. But that may not be important, Basilico said, because the
virus could have died out after 40 years in a freezer.
</P>
<P>
   The findings did not dampen the views of writer Edward Hooper,
chief proponent of the polio vaccine theory.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper contended in a 1999 book, ''The River,'' that the Wistar
Institute scientists might have used chimp kidneys contaminated
with the virus to make some batches of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means nothing at all for the polio vaccine theory because
different batches were prepared,'' Hooper said, adding that other,
untested or missing batches might have yielded different results.
</P>
<P>
   Two scientists who conducted the African vaccine trials denied
any chimpanzee tissue was used to make the vaccine and branded
Hooper's theory a ''fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We never used chimp kidneys,'' said Dr. Hilary Koprowski, who
developed the vaccine. ''I was there in 1957, and the author
(Hooper) was not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was working in the Wistar laboratory from 1957 to 1961 and I
never saw or heard of chimpanzee cells'' being used, added Dr.
Stanley Plotkin, now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper quoted others involved in the research, such as lab
technicians, hygienists and vets, who appeared to support his
theory. One, a lab technician identified only as Juma, said kidneys
were removed from chimps at the vaccine research station in Africa
and sent to labs in Belgium and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Others contended that chimp kidneys were sent to the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia and that some of the vaccine was made in
a laboratory in Stanleyville, in what was then the Belgian Congo,
now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Events For Wife  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Calling himself the ''cheerleader in
chief,'' President Clinton attended half a dozen events Monday,
mostly in service of his wife's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an interesting time in my life. My family has a new
candidate and my party has a new leader. I've become the
cheerleader in chief, and I love it,'' Clinton said while in
Connecticut to raise money for Rep. James H. Maloney, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton will go beyond cheerleader to voter, casting
his first vote as a New Yorker for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton faces the little-known Dr. Mark McMahon
in the New York Democratic primary, and the family plans to vote
together at a school near their suburban Westchester County home.
They bought the house last year when Mrs. Clinton began her Senate
campaign in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   But until now Clinton had remained an Arkansas voter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had six events to attend Monday -- four political or
fund-raising speeches bracketed by two events concerning New York's
Jewish community. Although nominally nonpolitical presidential
appearances, even those two Clinton speeches offered a veneer of
policy over campaign-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first stop was a Jewish community center in
Westchester County. Clinton was ending his day in New York City,
where Mrs. Clinton was collecting an award for work among Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is lagging in her pursuit of New York's influential
Jewish vote, a traditionally Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1 among New York State's
Jews, yet polls show Mrs. Clinton is still having trouble reaching
the 60 percent level of support among Jewish voters that analysts
say is the minimum she needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, the race between Mrs. Clinton and Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., is roughly even. Though hardly monolithic, the
Jewish vote is considered capable of swinging a Senate election
even though only 12 percent of the state's electorate is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently tireless Clinton was busier Monday than many
candidates who are actually on the ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   He hopscotched from suburban New York to Connecticut and back to
New York City to raise money for Mrs. Clinton and two other
Democrats. He also found time to stop his motorcade and shake hands
in Danbury, and to pose for photographs with firefighters in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundraising reception on the East Side of Manhattan,
estimated to raise $500,000 for his wife's campaign, Clinton said
her political career may have been hurt, not helped, by his long
years in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that upsets me from time to time is some of
our critics, and I say that because regrettably she's inherited
most of my enemies... they say she wouldn't be up here running for
the Senate if she wasn't the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if she hadn't been married to me, and spent thirty
years trying to help other people and doing things for other
people, she might have been doing this twenty years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he praised Mrs. Clinton for her long work
with children during one stop, and delivered a history lesson on
the political and economic cycles of the 20th century at the next.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, Clinton spoke without notes in a
conversational style studded with facts and figures he pulled from
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at a fund-raising luncheon for Maloney nodded and
applauded appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning professorially on his podium, Clinton made a joke at his
own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not your standard political speech,'' he said. ''But I
have been doing this a long time now, and I've got the hang of
it.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio unveils education plan  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican hoping to
keep Hillary Rodham Clinton out of the U.S. Senate, unveiled an
education plan Monday that he said would allow children in failing
schools to be sent to other public or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressman from Long Island also called for a
new emphasis on testing teachers and proposed a ''Best and
Brightest'' college loan forgiveness program. That program would be
for students who finish in the top 10 percent of their
undergraduate schools and agree to teach for three years in needy
schools or in subject area where there is special demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I see it, there is no single factor that has greater
influence on our future than our success in equipping our children
with the education they need to fulfill their destiny,'' Lazio told
a crowd of nearly 200 supporters, mostly college students. ''The
state of our schools today is the state of our society tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So if a school isn't doing the job, ''we should stop subsidizing
failure'' and give parents the freedom to pursue other educational
options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also called for creation of a ''Hometown
Choice'' program that would send $10 billion in federal money for
use by school districts as parents and local educators see fit -
for everything from new textbooks to new computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key in all this is returning authority to local schools.
School districts need not just more funding - but more freedom,''
said Lazio, adding that his opponent's education proposals bring
''more strings and more bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio plan would cost $97.8 billion over 10 years. Lazio
left immediately after his 35-minute speech without answering
questions about how his proposals would be funded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Lazio proposals appeared to be old ideas with new
names.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lazio called for creation of ''opportunity
scholarships'' that would be a tweaked form of school vouchers, a
concept Clinton has been highly critical of. She has said vouchers
would take money away from needy public schools. Lazio said his
plan would avoid that by requiring that extra money be used for the
scholarships and that existing funds continue to flow to public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton - who months ago unveiled proposals to put more teachers
into classrooms, to rebuild schools and to encourage smaller
classes - issued a statement saying Lazio's education plan ''is
marked tardy'' and that he had voted ''against New York's schools''
during his eight years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Education isn't an afterthought to Hillary,'' Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just last week, as classes resumed across New York, the
first lady unveiled new proposals she said could produce 10,000 new
principals over the next five years, break up large schools into
smaller units and provide regular reports to parents about violence
in individual schools.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio did manage to get his education proposals out before the
candidates' first debate, scheduled for Wednesday night in Buffalo.
The congressman has been under pressure from some top Republicans
to step up his campaigning and offer concrete proposals on major
issues. He unveiled a major tax-cut proposal late last month, his
first major policy proposal of the campaign. The education plan is
his second.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio only entered the Senate race in mid-May after New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew on the Republican side to deal
with his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Lazio education plan:
</P>
<P>
   -School districts would be given financial incentives to have
teachers tested for competency every five years and money would be
made available for teachers who want tutoring before they take such
competency tests. It would be a ''two strikes and you're out''
opportunity for teachers to pass those exams under Lazio's plan.
There also would be money made available for merit pay raises for
teachers whose students do well on standardized exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an information-based economy, we're all realizing that
learning is a lifelong endeavor, so we've got to bring the same
expectation to the people we ask to teach our kids,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a big believer that if we want to see quality in the
classroom ... we've got to give them (teachers) more than credit.
We've got to give them financial incentives that show them we value
what they do,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   -There would be a $4 billion infusion to help keep schools up to
snuff on technology, science and math.
</P>
<P>
   -Approximately $60 billion would be devoted to improving special
education, a move that could help reduce local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   -Teachers would be given additional authority to remove unruly
students from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   -School construction would be aided by an extra $5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Machu Picchu Sacred Stone Damaged  </HEADLINE>
By CARLA SALAZAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A massive crane being used to help film a beer
commercial toppled over damaging a stone sundial in Peru's famed
Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Intihuatana, or ''hitching post for the sun,'' is a granite
block carved into the peak of the mountain where Machu Picchu lies,
high in the jungle-covered Andes, about 310 miles southeast of the
capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   A jutting edge of the sundial the length of a ballpoint pen was
chipped off Friday when a 1000-pound crane being used to film the
commercial fell over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Machu Picchu is the heart of our archaeological heritage and
the Intihuatana is the heart of Machu Picchu. They've struck at our
most sacred inheritance,'' said Federico Kaufmann Doig, a
prestigious Peruvian archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Intihuatana was used by Inca astronomers to predict
solstices and was of great importance in Inca mythology and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered to be the most important shrine in Machu
Picchu, which is visited by hundreds of thousands of foreign
tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was being shot by the U.S. publicity firm J.
Walter Thompson for beer company Cervesur, a subsidiary of Peru's
largest beer company Backus &AMP; Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we do not feel responsible for this regrettable
event, we are committed to help clear up what happened,'' said
Cervesur regional manager Carlos de la Flor in a telephone
interview with the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company was ready to help the INC repair the damage,
a precedure that experts said would require advanced restoration
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuzco office of Peru's National Institute of Culture blamed
the film production company hired by J. Walter Thompson for damage
to the 500-year-old ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Manrique, Cuzco's INC director, said that the permit
specified only light equipment could be used.
</P>
<P>
   Manrique said the production crew had sneaked the crane into the
sanctuary at dawn after the INC had prohibited its use.
</P>
<P>
   He said criminal charges for destruction of national patrimony
had been filed against the production company. The charges carry a
sentence of two to four years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox To Push For Free Trade  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect Vicente Fox
pledged Monday to push for a free-trade zone from Mexico to Panama,
as part of a bid to stem illegal immigration from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off a four-day tour of Central America, Fox repeated
arguments he has made in talks with U.S. leaders -- that economic
opportunity and free trade are key to stemming the tide of
immigrants north.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic reasons are increasingly causing illegal immigration
from here into Mexico, as they are from Mexico into the United
States,'' Fox told a news conference Monday, after arriving here
late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to begin creating economic and social plans that can
have a regional effect, plans that will improve conditions in
border regions by erasing obstacles to free trade,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Fox's proposal for a common market with the United
States -- a proposal which got a chilly reception when he visited
Washington in August -- there are some stumbling blocks to free
trade with Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and Guatemalan business owners expressed concern that
organized crime on both sides of the border and illegal immigration
may make it difficult to achieve the kind of free market both Fox
and Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo have championed.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, immigrants from Central America cross into Mexico by
the hundreds of thousands to make their way to the United States or
work at low-paid agricultural jobs in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries agreed to appoint ''border czars'' to oversee
efforts to slow illegal Guatemalan immigration into Mexico. Fox
also pledged to investigate past rights violations against Central
American immigrants ''and ensure that they will be treated with the
dignity that they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who arrived in neighboring Honduras late Monday, said free
trade would pave the way toward social stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not adopt the concept of being the big brother of
Central America like in the past,'' Fox said. ''We are brothers,
period, on the same economic and social levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office as Mexico's president Dec. 1, is scheduled
to visit Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua on the
trip. Mexico is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement
with the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Renew UN Pledge  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a move to strengthen the role of the
United Nations in the 21st century, Russia and the United States
renewed a pledge to work closely together to streamline its
operations and promote rapid deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement issued Monday reaffirmed the U.S.-Russian
commitment to cooperate on U.N. reform which was discussed last
week by President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin on
the sidelines of the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia remains strongly opposed to U.S. deployment of a
national missile defense shield, Moscow and Washington have united
to seek ways of improving the Security Council's ability to prevent
international crises -- and resolve them when they occur.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page statement by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov expands on a
brief statement March 23 in which the two countries agreed to
intensify cooperation on practical ways to make the United Nations
''more efficient and more responsible to the challenges of the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's statement, Moscow and Washington backed the overhaul
of U.N. peacekeeping operations recommended last month by a U.N.
panel and said they will cooperate to improve the U.N.'s ability to
plan and deploy peacekeeping missions more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has never had support for establishing a
standing army. But since 1992, it has been trying to get member
states to make advance commitments of troops so it can respond
quickly to threats to peace. It has over 30 formal commitments --
most importantly NATO members Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain, plus Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia said they want to improve efforts
to ''operationalize'' the system of standby troop agreements, and
to establish a similar system for civilian police and other
civilian experts. Both countries said they were prepared ''to make
their contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of U.N. financing, the United States has won
Russia's support for its campaign to revise the scale of
assessments for both the regular and peacekeeping budgets. The
United States is now billed 25 percent of the regular budget and 31
percent of the peacekeeping budget.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries favor measures ''to broaden the U.N.'s base of
contributions and lessen the organization's excessive dependence
upon a single contributor, with a view to establishing a stable,
up-to-date and equitable financial foundation for the U.N. in the
next century,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States said the new scale should reflect
''the special role and responsibility of the permanent members in
peacekeeping financing.'' The five permanent council members are
the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Makes Stange Hotel Exit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. basketball teams made a
bizarre, pre-dawn exit Tuesday (Monday night EDT) from their
besieged hotel complex, but only after getting final clearance from
a young protester with a mohawk.
</P>
<P>
   With massive protests taking place outside their hotel, which
also was the site of the World Economic Forum, the men's and
women's teams were virtual prisoners inside. A decision was made
late Monday night to get out of Melbourne and head to Sydney, and
the teams got onto buses by 6:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 protesters sat in the street and blocked the main exit
near the front entrance of the Crown Casino and Hotel. The
protesters decided by voice vote that they would not move aside to
let the team leave.
</P>
<P>
   The buses then turned around and headed toward a different exit,
where another group of demonstrators had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Not believing that the buses held Olympic athletes, the
protesters initially refused to move. After the police asked them
to come inside the concrete barricades and have a look for
themselves, a 21-year-old with a punk rock haircut volunteered to
do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked in the first bus and it didn't look like a basketball
team, but then I looked inside the second bus,'' said the mohawk
man, Yanni Cotis of Adelaide. ''We had a quick discussion about
whether to let them go through and decided to let them leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and team personnel were half-amused and half-shocked
that their safe passage was in the hands of someone looking like a
distant cousin of Billy Idol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something I learned long ago was to expect the unexpected,''
U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said, ''and this was one of those
cases. It was good we got out and got our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' family members had left a few hours earlier, before
most of the protesters arrived at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had planned to stay in Melbourne until later this
week, but the protests that virtually shut down the hotel forced a
hasty change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   The men's team had to cancel practice Monday because of the
protests, while the women's team made it out of the hotel on foot
before being forced to return by boat.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball officials had been warned months ago that they
could become circumstantial victims of the protests, but decided to
stick with their accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're moving on to Sydney with some strange stories to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was stunned by the whole situation,'' Antonio McDyess said.
''How could they let a guy in a mohawk be their leader?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Allan Houston: ''What kind of a place are we in when USA
Basketball, the police and 100 security guards have to get approval
from a guy in a mohawk. What does that tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   The men held a two-hour practice after making their escape, then
sat around the gymnasium for another hour with nothing to do and no
place to go as their flight to Sydney was not due to leave for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, the crowds outside the former U.S. team hotel
had swelled to in size to several thousand. The players, meanwhile,
were recounting the story of their pre-dawn escape. They even came
up with a nickname for the mohawk man, dubbing him ''Zippy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice of that guy to let us through,'' Jason Kidd said.
''It shows you how much power the (protesters) have.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Lead Patriots After 1st Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde's 4-yard pass to
tight end Fred Baxter gave the New York Jets a 7-3 lead over New
England after one quarter Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the Jets three-and-out on their first possession,
New England got good field position with a 31-yard punt return by
Troy Brown to the New York 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots stalled after a 19-yard pass from Drew Bledsoe to
Eric Bjornson and an 11-yard run by Kevin Faulk got them to the 13.
Adam Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal gave them a 3-0 lead with 9:51
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets came back with a 74-yard drive in 12 plays for the
go-ahead touchdown. Testaverde twice converted third-and-long
plays, connecting with Dedric Ward for 25 yards and Vincent Brisby
for 18.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-2 from the 10, Testaverde handed to fullback Richie
Anderson for 6 yards, and on second down from the 4, Testaverde
faked a handoff into the middle and passed to Baxter for the TD,
his third scoring reception in as many games against the Patriots.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Fairfield University professor seeking
to remove Joseph Lieberman from the ballot for U.S. Senate in
Connecticut is bringing his case to the State Ethics Commission and
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   John Orman, of Trumbull, claims Lieberman is running an
''unethical'' and ''frivolous'' race for re-election because he is
also running for vice president. Should he win both races,
Lieberman would have to resign his Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the state Elections Enforcement Commission and
Secretary of the State both rejected Orman's complaint, ruling that
it is legal in Connecticut to run for both offices at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Orman said he would ask the Federal Election
Commission to look into whether Lieberman is indirectly mixing his
vice-presidential campaign funds with his senatorial campaign funds
in violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Orman said he will also ask the State Ethics Commission to rule
whether it is ethical for a candidate to run for an office if the
candidate will not promise to serve in that office.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Lieberman is doing is just not kosher,'' Orman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spokeswoman Kelly Moore said the senator's staff has
been ''extremely careful to put up the appropriate walls'' between
the Senate and vice presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman believes leaving the U.S. Senate race would not be in
the interests of the democratic process, because a handfull of
party leaders would decide who replaces him as a candidate, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Connecticut could have a U.S. senator for six
years who they had no say in putting on the ballot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Should Lieberman be forced to resign his Senate seat, Republican
Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint his replacement. A special
election would be held in 2002 to fill the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator feels that is an infinitely preferable scenario
for the people of Connecticut,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who has a large lead over Republican Philip Giordano
in recent polls, could drop out of the Senate race as late as Oct.
27 and still be replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.

<HEADLINE> Knight To Give Live ESPN Interview  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight
will discuss his firing in a live interview Tuesday night on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, fired Sunday for a ''pattern of unacceptable behavior,''
will sit for a one-hour interview with Jeremy Schaap.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was interviewed by ESPN's Roy Firestone and college
basketball analyst Digger Phelps in May after the school handed
down its zero-tolerance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Knight deserves the opportunity to state his side and
people deserve to have questions answered about his behavior in the
past 17 weeks. He said Sunday night outside Assembly Hall that he
wants to tell the truth, and I hope that's what he intends to do,''
Schaap said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not theater, it's journalism. This is not an
interrogation, it's an interview. The goal is to elicit as much
information as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview is at 7 p.m. EDT, and will be rebroadcast at
midnight on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 8, Mets 2  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Rigdon pitched 6 2-3 solid innings and
Richie Sexson homered as the Milwaukee Brewers handed the New York
Mets their eighth loss in 10 games, 8-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon (3-3), a right-hander acquired along with Sexson from
Cleveland in the Bob Wickman deal, allowed two runs and five hits
as Milwaukee won for the fifth time in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets dropped three games behind idle Atlanta in the NL East.
New York entered the day 4&AMP;frac12; games ahead of Arizona in the wild card
race. The Diamondbacks played Los Angeles later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes homered for the Brewers, who won for the first
time in six games at Shea Stadium since May 18, 1999 and improved
to 5-18 overall against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson extended his career-high hitting streak to 12 games by
leading off the second inning against Rick Reed (9-5) with his 12th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, who made a throwing error on his first fielding
chance at third base in the top of the second, atoned in the bottom
half with a one-out solo homer, his second of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon and Lou Collier hit consecutive one-out singles in the
third and scored on Mark Loretta's double to right-center, making
it 3-1. It was only Rigdon's second hit of the season in 10 at-bats
and first run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani's 14th homer, a two-out solo shot to left in the
bottom half, cut it to 3-2. The Mets then loaded the bases on Derek
Bell's single and two walks, but Franco grounded out to shortstop
to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins led off the sixth with a double off the top of the
wall in right-center, and one out later Jeromy Burnitz was
intentionally walked. The move backfired when Hayes singled to load
the bases, and Ron Belliard singled to left to score Jenkins. Raul
Casanova's sacrifice fly made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   After Bobby M. Jones hit Loretta with the bases loaded in the
eighth, Rich Rodriguez relieved and walked Jenkins on four pitches
to force home another run and make it 7-2. He finally struck out
Sexson to end the inning and drew the loudest cheer of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes added a solo homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed five runs and eight hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Attendance was only 21,797 with the Yankees drawing more
than 40,000 and the Jets playing Monday Night Football at the
Meadowlands in New Jersey. ... Brewers OF Marquis Grissom remained
one steal shy of 400 for his career. ... Regular Mets starting 3B
Robin Ventura wasn't in the lineup for the second straight game

<HEADLINE> Woes Persist at 2002 Olympic Venue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- A test of the refrigeration unit at the 2002
Olympics site for hockey ended the way the previous one did: Rink
officials say there's a leak, the rink's builder says there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The first test, an 11-day trial a month ago, was to have been
the final test on the chiller at The Peaks. It was supposed to end
squabbling among arena manager Max Rabner, builders and suppliers,
but its validity was challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The system -- which chills the two ice sheets at the Peaks -- was
tested again on Friday and Peaks officials said a leak was
detected. The contractor, Hogan &AMP; Associates, said the chilling
system worked correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Rabner said the chiller has been troubled since it was installed
because there is an internal leak in the system that prevents him
from keeping the two ice sheets at separate temperatures. Events
such as speed skating and figure skating require different ice
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan officials said there is only an exchange of fluid in the
system, not a leak. This exchange does not impair the Peaks ability
to chill ice, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Henrie, a consultant for the Provo/Utah County Ice Sheet
Authority, said Friday's test concerned him because he thinks the
leak could get worse and eventually destroy the chiller.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the chiller could cost $170,000, a bill Hogan could
have to pay. Rabner has withheld a final payment of $84,091 until
the chiller functions as he wants it to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've withheld payment because we don't have an operating
system,'' Rabner said. ''Without this refrigeration system, this
facility is nothing but a huge warehouse.''

<HEADLINE> Ontiveros Signs with Red Sox  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Steve Ontiveros, a former AL ERA champion and
All-Star, signed with the Boston Red Sox on Monday after a
five-year absence from the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros joined the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, but did not
pitch in Boston's 4-0 victory over New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros made his last appearance in the majors on Sept. 29,
1995, with Oakland. The next year, he underwent his second ligament
transplant surgery on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I didn't think this day would ever happen,'' he said. ''I
was really scratching my head, wondering why I wasn't here
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 39-year-old Ontiveros pitched in the Baltimore,
Milwaukee and Colorado organizations -- doing well, too -- but never
made it out of the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros retired after last season, then signed with Scottsdale
of the Western Baseball League this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Welch, who I played with, was the manager there and I knew
he would tell me honestly if I could still do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Welch, Ontiveros later signed with Triple-A
Colorado Springs. After being released, he contacted teams in the
big leagues and landed a job with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros figures he'll pitch in different roles for the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Middle relief and long relief and maybe make an emergency
start because we have some doubleheaders coming up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox trail Cleveland by three games in the AL wild card
race. They start a three-game series at Jacobs Field on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros is 33-30 lifetime with a 3.62 ERA in nine seasons with
Oakland, Philadelphia and Seattle. He led the AL with a 2.65 ERA in
1994 and made the All-Star team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm healthy now and throwing the ball as well as I ever
have,'' he said. ''It's not like I've thrown 3,000 innings. I still
have a lot left in my arm.''

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Rep. Herbert Bateman, a nine-term
congressman who in the 1970s was one of the first Virginia
Democrats to switch parties, died Monday after a long battle with
lung and prostate cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman was elected to the state Senate in 1968 as a member of
the conservative Democratic faction that dominated Virginia
government for most of the 20th century. However, he disagreed with
the liberal direction the party was heading nationally, and in
1976, he became a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to Congress in 1982. In his 18 years in the
House, Bateman brought defense contracts to his southeast Virginia
district. His hometown, Newport News, is among the world's major
centers for the construction of warships.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman was known as a deficit hawk, and he fought for a
balanced budget. He remained popular in his district and seldom
faced serious opposition for re-election. He had no Democratic
opponent in his final two re-election bids.
Mike Hughes:
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Hughes, a former sports reporter who
became editor-in-chief of United Press International, died Monday
at age 66.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had been suffering from stomach cancer and had been
diagnosed with a brain tumor eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes joined United Press -- which became United Press
International -- in England in 1956 as a teletype operator. He later
worked as a sports reporter and editor and became executive sports
editor in New York in 1973. He covered seven Olympic Games for UPI.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes moved to the news side of the wire service in 1977 and
helped found United Press Canada. In 1983, he was named vice
president and general manager of UPI's international division. The
following year, he was promoted to executive vice president and
editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, UPI was in the midst of structural and financial
problems following its sale by the Scripps family. Hughes' battles
with the new owners led to his resignation from UPI in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is survived by his wife, a daughter, a brother and a
sister.
Bill McCuen:
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Bill McCuen, a former Arkansas
secretary of state who was imprisoned for corruption in office,
died Saturday. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   McCuen was diagnosed with cancer while serving a 17-year prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected secretary of state in 1984. In 1994, the
state police began investigating his involvement in a scheme with
political consultant Darrell Glascock to purchase $53,650 worth of
flags from a sham company.
</P>
<P>
   McCuen was indicted on public corruption charges in 1995. The
following year, he pleaded either guilty or no contest to charges
involving bribery, taking kickbacks and tax evasion.
William W. Quinn:
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- William W. ''Buffalo Bill'' Quinn, a retired
Army lieutenant general who served in two wars and played a role in
the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, died Monday of
congestive heart failure. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Quinn served as an intelligence officer in
Europe, where he was responsible for gathering and coordinating
information for the invasion of southern France on Aug. 15, 1944.
The landing by U.S. and French troops was met with minimal
resistance and was considered one of the most successful amphibious
operations of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Quinn was named chief of operations of the Central
Intelligence Group, a forerunner of the CIA. Quinn later served as
a colonel on the staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn retired from the military in 1966. He worked as a vice
president of the Aerospace Group at Martin Marietta Corp. until
1972, when he formed Quinn Associates, a consulting firm.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Lee's Release Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The expected release of Wen Ho Lee was
delayed Monday as prosecutors and Lee's defense team haggled over a
plea deal that would release the jailed Los Alamos nuclear
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker gave no reason for putting off
a scheduled court hearing until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must regretfully say that we cannot proceed with the hearing
this afternoon,'' the judge said. ''There are some issues that may
require some amendment to the plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's daughter, Alberta, left the packed courtroom in tears and
her mother, Sylvia, appeared dazed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys declined to comment on the delay, as did
Justice Department officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal described Sunday by government sources, Lee was
expected to drop allegations that he was targeted because he is
Chinese, claims included in a lawsuit against the FBI and the U.S.
Departments of Energy and Justice. His attorney in the case, Brian
Sun, said Monday that the lawsuit is ''still viable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the sources, Lee had agreed to plead guilty to only
one of 59 counts accusing him of violating national security. His
sentence was to be the nine months he has already served in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his freedom, Lee was expected to explain what he
knows about seven computer tapes he was accused of downloading. Lee
-- whose defense contended he was targeted only because he is ethnic
Chinese -- has insisted the tapes were destroyed at the lab. His
willingness to explain in more detail what happened was described
as the turning point in 2-month-old plea discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue here is -- are we getting the tapes back and we find
out what happened to those tapes. I think that is the key,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in Oak Ridge, Tenn., before the postponement was announced. ''The
plea bargain enables us to get that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year case began as an offshoot of a Chinese espionage
case and led to accusations that the 60-year-old Lee had downloaded
the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear weaponry and might be poised
to hand them over to a foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   The government has since backed down from nearly all those
charges. Government sources said Lee agreed over the weekend to
plead guilty to one count of unlawful gathering of national defense
information, aid federal investigators over the next six months and
drop the claims that prosecutors went after him because he is
Chinese-American. Lee is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves a national apology,'' said John Vance, a safety
engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. ''The president of the
United States should call him in and apologize on national
television for the damage that's done.''
</P>
<P>
   The lab considers Lee, who worked for the lab for more than 21
years, as retired. A spokesman said Lee is getting a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was fired from his Los Alamos job in March 1999 and nine
months later was formally accused of downloading restricted nuclear
data to unsecured computers and tapes. Lee has been jailed since
Dec. 10 and faced life in prison if convicted of all 59 counts.
</P>
<P>
   The case began disintegrating last month at Lee's latest bail
hearing. FBI agent Robert Messemer, whose testimony was key in
denying Lee bail originally, said he repeatedly erred in that
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, including a former Los Alamos lab director, also
weighed in on the side of the defense, dismissing the importance of
the information Lee was accused of mishandling. One scientist said
''99 percent'' of the information was available anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Parker agreed to release Lee on $1 million bail,
saying information presented by the government ''no longer has the
requisite clarity and persuasive character necessary'' to keep Lee
in jail until trial. He ordered both sides to negotiate final
conditions for Lee's release.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Parker ordered the government to produce
documents to help determine whether Lee was targeted because of his
race -- and he outlined his reasons for favoring bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the government described in December 1999 as the 'crown
jewels' of the United States nuclear weapons program no longer is
so clearly deserving of that label,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said he believes Lee was
jailed without bail only to elicit a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case stinks,'' Dershowitz said, ''and the resolution
doesn't make it smell any better. It only makes the contestants
happy, but it shouldn't make the public happy ...It is
un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time, Lee's neighbors had to scrap plans for a
welcome-home party. Homes were decked out in American flags, red,
white and blue ribbons and signs of support and welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's devastating,'' said Jean Marshall, Lee's next-door
neighbor. ''Can you write the sound of tears?''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''Our enthusiasm for his homecoming has not dimmed. I
believe that America is watching, and I think justice in the end
will prevail.''

   LaRue, making a bid for the starting catcher's job next year,

fourth for a 6-3 lead. He is considered a good defensive catcher
and handler of pitchers but began the night with a .171 average and
five RBIs in 70 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. left with a strained left hamstring after
colliding with Joe Girardi at home plate in the seventh, trying to
score from first on a double by Dmitri Young.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch (7-6) allowed five runs and eight hits in five
innings with five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves pitched the ninth for his 28th save in 33 chances,
allowing an RBI single to pinch-hitter Jeff Reed, then striking out
Jose Nieves to end the game with runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay (2-8) gave up six runs and six hits in four
innings as the Cubs (59-84) lost for the 10th time in 11 games,
dropping a season-worst 25 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro hit an RBI double in the second ahead of Castro's
fourth homer, which made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa homered in the fourth and needs just one more to become
only the third player with more than two 50-homer seasons, joining
Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi hit a sacrifice fly and Garibay singled in a run, his
first RBI in 14 at-bats this season. Harnisch escaped additional
damage when Chad Meyers grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   After LaRue's double down the left-field line, Julio Zuleta hit
a two-run double in the fifth as Chicago closed to 6-5, then was
thrown out stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ochoa homered in the seventh off Steve Rain.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ricky Gutierrez twice lost hold of his bat in the third
inning, allowing it into the seats near the Cubs' dugout. No one
was seriously injured. ... Scott Sullivan's wild pitch in the fifth
increased the Reds' club-record and major league-leading total to
89. ... Jack McKeon got his 280th win as a Reds manager, moving
into ninth on the club list. ... The biggest ovation of the night
went to the big-screen replay of Pete Rose's hit No. 4,192. Monday
was the 15th anniversary of Rose's single that moved him past Ty
Cobb into first place on baseball's career hits list.

<HEADLINE> Florida's Palmer Starts as QB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jesse Palmer, who was pulled last
weekend in the middle of a drive in the second quarter, will start
at quarterback for No. 6 Florida against No. 11 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Spurrier pulled Palmer in the second quarter of
Florida's 55-0 rout of Middle Tennessee State last Saturday,
replacing him with redshirt freshman Rex Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman completed 9 of 14 passes for 95 yards, three touchdowns
and one interception after taking over. Palmer was 15-of-23 for 193
yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. However, he also
struggled with timing on deep routes for the second straight week.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Spurrier said he was not sure who would start
against the Volunteers. On Monday, he said Palmer would start and
Grossman would probably see some action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesse Palmer's our starter, just like the first two games,''
Spurrier said. ''Rex is waiting in the wings. Rex probably will
play, but we will start with Jesse just like the other games and
see how it goes. Rex definitely will get a lot of snaps during
practice and hopefully we'll have two ready to play.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 8, Pirates 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered for the first time in
more than two months and Edgar Renteria hit a tiebreaking single in
the eighth inning Monday night, leading the St. Louis Cardinals
over the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 31st of the
season and first since July 1. He had been limited to one plate
appearance in each of the four games since he came off the disabled
list last week.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, sidelined from July 6-Sept. 8 with patella tendinitis
in his right knee, has been listed as a second baseman and has left
each time after batting in the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out, popped up and was hit by a pitch during three
weekend games at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (16-8) won for the fifth time in six
decisions, allowing four runs, seven hits and four walks in seven
innings. He retired the side in order just twice.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, which overcame four RBIs from John Vander Wal, is 8-3
in September and had won 19 of its last 26.
</P>
<P>
   With their 82nd loss, the Pirates were mathematically eliminated
from postseason contention and were assured of their eighth
consecutive losing year, the longest stretch of losing seasons
since 1949-57.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 4-all, Fernando Tatis singled off Ravelo
Manzanillo (2-2) leading off the eighth, took third on Ray
Lankford's single and scored when Renteria extended his hitting
streak to 11 games with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny bunted into a double play before pinch-hitter
Thomas Howard blooped a ball to left that fell between Brian Giles
and Abraham Nunez for an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wallace walked Ray Lankford with the bases loaded in the
ninth and Edgar Renteria hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew opened the game with a double and McGwire drove Jose
Silva's 0-1 pitch over the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis stretched the lead to 4-0 in the second when Matheny
hit an RBI double and scored on Stephenson's single.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal hit an RBI single in the third and tied it in the
fifth on a Vander Wal's 20th homer, a three-run drive.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Adrian Brown saved two runs when he leaped and
reached over the center-field fence to rob Placido Polanco of a
home run in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes:  The Cardinals are 22 games over .500 for the fourth time
this season. ... St. Louis avoided losing consecutive games,
something that hasn't happened since Aug. 8-9 against Florida. The
Cardinals haven't lost consecutive road games since they were swept
in a three-game series at New York from July 28-30. ... Pirates
rookie first baseman Alex Hernandez broke a 0-for-13 slide with a
single in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> Gore Faults Hollywood on Violence  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's vow to lean on Hollywood until it
stops peddling violent material to kids puts him loudly in league
with poll-tested unease over entertainment fare, and seemingly at
odds with an industry that lubricates his party and campaign with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about censorship,'' the Democratic presidential
candidate said Monday on TV's ''Oprah,'' a venue suited to the
women voters he's courting. ''It's about citizenship, including
corporate citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he's giving the industry six months to stop marketing
violent movies, recordings and video games to underage youth. If
that doesn't happen, and he becomes president, he said, he would
seek sanctions against offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore has privately assured Hollywood insiders
in the past that they have nothing to worry about, and termed his
crusade for family entertainment values an act perhaps worthy of an
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore launched his pursuit on the strength of a Federal Trade
Commission report detailing efforts, mostly through advertising, to
interest young people in movies, music and games rated for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pointed to a published report saying that when the
FTC inquiry began, Gore stressed to potential donors from the
entertainment industry that it was not his idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the man's short on credibility on the issue,'' said
GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush. The Texas governor said
the solution to improper entertainment influences on children rests
with parents and political persuasion, not new federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's approach to Hollywood has been alternately critical and
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   In a nuanced speech on the entertainment industry in March, he
urged industry self-restraint against the ''violence being showered
on the heads of young people.'' Yet he declared ''it is not fair to
make the industry a scapegoat when we have a flood of guns in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a meeting at a Belleville, Ill., school Monday, the
attack on guns was set aside in favor of a broadside on
entertainment. ''Kids now see 20,000 murders on television by the
time they graduate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like Al Gore is trying to distance himself from any
political fallout the Hollywood money might be giving to his
campaign,'' said Larry Makinson, director of the Center for
Responsive Politics. The nonpartisan center tracks political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The TV, movie and music industries are together the fourth
largest source of cash for the Democratic Party, raising $5.9
million so far this campaign cycle for the party and $928,000 for
Gore. Those industries are 11th on the list of Republican sources,
donating $3.7 million to the party and $726,000 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
joined other industry leaders in rejecting the FTC findings. He
attributed the attention to the issue to the political season.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate
upset some in the industry because the senator's attacks on
Hollywood have been long-standing, unvarnished and open to the idea
of government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the centrist Democratic Leadership Council pointed
Monday to an article in its current issue by Lieberman, the group's
chairman since the mid-1990s, in which he warns that many
broadcasters may be breaching their ''legal obligation'' to serve
the public interest with their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an explosion of crude, rude, and lewd material
in prime time,'' Lieberman wrote. He said sexually explicit
material on TV is even worse than the violence on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The same DLC issue reports on a survey commissioned from
Democratic pollster Mark Penn indicating that most Americans are
concerned about the violent and sexual subject matter young people
are being exposed to. Women were especially worried.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not wait for the FTC report's official release to go on
the offensive, an eagerness the Bush camp said was unconvincing
given his previous hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides cited a Los Angeles Times story from August 1999 that
quoted donors as saying Gore privately told them the inquiry was
President Clinton's idea, not his own, and that he had no part in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane confirmed the vice president at the
meeting said that he had not requested the FTC report.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, he has a long record on these issues,'' Lehane said.
''And one of the fundamental differences in this campaign is we
believe that government should give parents the tools and support
they need to help protect and raise their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, led a successful effort in the 1980s to
have the recording industry label albums containing offensive
lyrics. Variety reported that during his failed presidential run in
1988, Gore privately told music executives that a Senate hearing on
the issue was not his idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not ask for the hearing,'' he said, according to a
transcript of the meeting published by Variety. ''I was not in
favor of the hearing.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Dead in Japan Amid Heavy Rains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Torrential rains hit central Japan on Tuesday,
leaving three people dead and driving hundreds of thousands from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included a 53-year-old firefighter who fell into a
flooded roadside ditch and a 49-year-old man who was buried by
mudslides, said Tadanobu Horiguchi, an official with the industrial
city of Nagoya, 165 miles west of Tokyo. Two other people were
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Horiguchi said Nagoya authorities ordered about 365,000 people
to evacuate after two rivers jumped their banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This flooding is unprecedented in our city,'' said Horiguchi.
''I've never seen such huge rainfalls in such a short period of
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall totaling 23 inches was recorded in Tokai, near Nagoya,
over the past 24-hour period, the local observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed residents wading waist-deep in muddy
water and children navigating flooded streets in rubber
life-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 were flooded above the floor level, said National
Fire Agency official Masahiro Sekine.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet train services were interrupted, and about 50,000
passengers were forced to sleep overnight in trains that grinded to
a halt, national broadcaster NHK reported.
</P>
<P>
   Major highways in central Japan were closed to traffic, said
NHK, which interrupted regular programming to report on the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in central Japan were difficult to contact because of
the volume of calls to police and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more violent weather was creeping toward Japan, as
typhoon Saomai approached the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa
packing winds of 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Saomai, located 60 miles east of the Okinawa capital of Naha,
was already lashing the island with powerful winds.

<HEADLINE> Mom Alleged To Have Buried Newborn  </HEADLINE>
By AMY GEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, S.C. (AP) -- A 21-year-old woman has been charged with
assaulting her newborn son by burying him in a trash dump a few
hours before he was found in a shallow grave covered with fire
ants.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Jones was held in lieu of $40,000 bond Monday, charged
with assault and battery with intent to kill. Her son, who was
found Friday, was in good condition at a Columbia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing, Jones would not answer questions about why she
left the baby. Her mother said Jones buried the boy because she
thought he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a good person,'' Bertha Jones said of her daughter.
''She knew that baby wasn't alive. I know in my heart she would
have never did what she did'' if she had known the baby were alive.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Carolyn Jones gave birth Friday, then took the baby
to the dump near this rural community of 2,500 people and buried
him headfirst in a 14-inch grave. She then went to Allendale County
Hospital, where doctors alerted police she had signs of giving
birth but no baby.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told authorities that she thought the baby was dead and
had buried him. Police Chief John Sullivan said she later led
authorities to the dump.
</P>
<P>
   ''She pointed right to where it was -- we started digging,'' said
paramedic Joe Topper.
</P>
<P>
   Although the boy was covered with ants and a white substance
police think was lime, authorities could tell the baby was still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby was crying,'' Topper said. ''It sounded like his
lungs were doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his body temperature was 85 degrees and his skin was
peeling.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who also has a 2-year-old son, worked as a security guard
for the past seven months. She told the judge she previously worked
in a day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Jones said neither she nor her daughter knew about the
pregnancy until the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sign, and she said she didn't know,'' Bertha
Jones said.

<HEADLINE> UK Troops Faced Tough Mission  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- While helicopters provided
covering fire, Cpl. Simon Dawes led the first British paratroopers
on a mission to free seven hostages held by a maverick Sierra Leone
army gang.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes, 29, was seeing combat for the first time. ''This is the
first firefight I have been in where rounds were coming my way. It
was a scary experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Liam Cradden, 30, second in command of all ground forces,
waded 1,500 feet under enemy fire Sunday through a creek with his
troops on the way to freeing the six British soldiers and a Sierra
Leonean soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were an awful lot of young guys in the unit,'' Cradden
said. ''They all performed with excellent professionalism and every
member of the company did his duty as he was asked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cradden said the 150 British paratroopers, mostly all in their
20s, had been planning the operation for 10 days and that it took
six hours to rout the rebels after extracting the hostages. The
hostages had been held since Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   One British paratrooper was killed and between 12 and 14 others
were wounded in the mission, British military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six members of the West Side Boys faction were killed,
and at least 18 others, including the faction leader, were
captured.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes, a father of three, told reporters: ''It was scary. But
once we got into the fighting the training took over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The company is a very young company and none of us had
experienced a two-way range, as we call it, with rounds coming our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cradden, the second-in-command, recalled how the regiment moved
in on Rokel Creek in the Occra Hills, 45 miles east of Sierra
Leone's capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our part in the operation was to ensure the West Side Boys'
heavy guns on the south side (of the creek) could not interfere
with operations on the north side and endanger the safety of the
hostages,'' Cradden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The assault lasted for about two hours until the area was
secured.''
</P>
<P>
   The six British soldiers freed in the raid and five others
released Aug. 30 by their captors were being debriefed Monday
aboard the British warship Sir Percivale in Freetown's harbor, Lt.
Cmdr. Tony Cramp told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been explained how the soldiers were captured by
the West Side Boys, a well-armed but ill-disciplined group that
has, at times, fought alongside both the government of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and the main rebel group, the Revolutionary
United Front.
</P>
<P>
   Cramp insisted the hostage-taking would not deter the British
soldiers from their mission of training better Sierra Leonean
soldiers to fight the rebels. The rebel group is responsible for
the deaths and intentional mutilation of tens of thousands of
civilians since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue was carried out after the captors had threatened
repeatedly to kill the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said
the raid showed that ''this kind of thuggery, of rejection of law
and order in Sierra Leone will not be tolerated by the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenstock spoke outside the Security Council, where ambassadors
were working on a resolution to strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping
force in the West African nation to as many as 20,500. A vote could
come later this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that the
United Nations, the Sierra Leone government, and West African
nations must ''harmonize'' their work if peace is to be restored to
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came amid reports of serious divisions in the U.N.
peacekeeping leadership in Sierra Leone that have jeopardized
efforts to help the government wrest back control of the country
from rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Guardian newspaper on Saturday reported that the
Indian U.N. force commander, Maj.-Gen. Vijay Jetley, had written a
memo accusing Nigerian officers in the U.N. mission and the West
African peacekeeping force that preceded it of colluding with
rebels to sabotage last year's peace agreement and get rich off
Sierra Leone's diamonds.

<HEADLINE> Woes Persist at 2002 Olympics Venue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- A test of the refrigeration unit at the 2002
Olympics site for hockey ended the way the previous one did: Rink
officials say there's a leak, the rink's builder says there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The first test, an 11-day trial a month ago, was to have been
the final test on the chiller at The Peaks. It was supposed to end
squabbling among arena manager Max Rabner, builders and suppliers,
but its validity was challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The system -- which chills the two ice sheets at the Peaks -- was
tested again on Friday and Peaks officials said a leak was
detected. The contractor, Hogan &AMP; Associates, said the chilling
system worked correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Rabner said the chiller has been troubled since it was installed
because there is an internal leak in the system that prevents him
from keeping the two ice sheets at separate temperatures. Events
such as speed skating and figure skating require different ice
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan officials said there is only an exchange of fluid in the
system, not a leak. This exchange does not impair the Peaks ability
to chill ice, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Henrie, a consultant for the Provo/Utah County Ice Sheet
Authority, said Friday's test concerned him because he thinks the
leak could get worse and eventually destroy the chiller.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the chiller could cost $170,000, a bill Hogan could
have to pay. Rabner has withheld a final payment of $84,091 until
the chiller functions as he wants it to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've withheld payment because we don't have an operating
system,'' Rabner said. ''Without this refrigeration system, this
facility is nothing but a huge warehouse.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Welcomes Palestinian Delay  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sees some
breathing room for U.S. diplomacy in a decision by the
Palestinians' leaders to postpone for two months the declaration of
a state.
</P>
<P>
   With an unyielding deadlock in negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians, however, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser
Arafat are showing signs they are ready to turn a page -- Barak to
focus on domestic needs, Arafat possibly to defer his drive for
Jerusalem to his as yet undesignated successor.
</P>
<P>
   And Albright, welcoming Sunday's decision by the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Central Council, acknowledged Monday that
American mediation efforts are in a tough patch. ''There is a
difficult road ahead,'' she said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, addressing a dinner here Monday night
honoring people who helped seek restitution for Holocaust
survivors, declared: ''We cannot give up on the Middle East until
the whole thing is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he remains optimistic, but ''the truth is that
we've come to a painful choice between continued confrontation and
a chance to move beyond violence to a just and lasting peace. Like
all life's chances, this one is fleeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, meeting in Gaza City, backed off from a pledge to
declare statehood by Wednesday, the deadline set last year by Barak
and Arafat for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The 129-member group then adjourned for two months, deferring in
the drive for statehood to Arafat. Now 71, the only leader the
Palestinians have known in the Israel era said that if he cannot
wrest Muslim shrines in Jerusalem from Israeli control, ''another
one (leader) will come to liberate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, under fire from opponents of the vast territorial and
other concessions he has held out to Arafat, indicated Sunday he is
running out of steam, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it turns out that peace is a dream whose time has not yet
come, then I am prepared to transfer my full focus and energy to
building bridges over the deep social divide between our people,''
he told Jewish leaders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is to take Israel on a secular course despite its
grounding in the religious precepts of the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he would invite the main opposition party, Likud,
and other critics into his government to try to gain support for a
secular domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   That would diminish peace prospects even further since Likud
opposes concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Sept. 13 deadline -- Wednesday -- that Barak
and Arafat set for an agreement has become a dead letter and no
longer is held up by frustrated American mediators as critical.
</P>
<P>
   Having once warned that failure to conclude an agreement by then
could lead to disappointment and violence, and having warned
repeatedly that ''the window is closing'' for peace, U.S. officials
now refer to Sept. 13 as simply an artificial date whose passing
need is not critical.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the decision by the Palestinian Council showed
''their commitment to the peace process and to continued
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   She reiterated it is up to Israel and the Palestinians to make
the ''hard decisions'' required for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what American mediators could do, Albright said without
elaboration that ''there are various combinations of meetings and
things we are going to be looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak confirmed last week that the Palestinians could have a
state if Arafat would compromise on Jerusalem. At the Camp David
summit in July, Barak also assured Arafat of taking control of
almost all the West Bank and Gaza for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat remains steadfast in insisting that Israel also transfer
control of east Jerusalem to the Palestinians for a capital. In
July, he rejected Barak's offer to give the Palestinians control of
some neighborhoods in the city and some close-in suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Arafat rejected a proposal by President Clinton
that would give the Palestinians sovereignty over the two holiest
Muslim mosques in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said his aim is to liberate the city for the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with officials from a half-dozen Arab countries in
the Persian Gulf region Monday. The officials endorsed U.S.
peacemaking efforts and said any lasting agreement must meet the
needs of both sides, according to a senior U.S. official.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns for Hillary  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Calling himself the ''cheerleader in
chief,'' President Clinton attended half a dozen events Monday,
mostly in service of his wife's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an interesting time in my life. My family has a new
candidate and my party has a new leader. I've become the
cheerleader in chief, and I love it,'' Clinton said while in
Connecticut to raise money for Rep. James H. Maloney, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton will go beyond cheerleader to voter, casting
his first vote as a New Yorker for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton faces the little-known Dr. Mark McMahon
in the New York Democratic primary, and the family plans to vote
together at a school near their suburban Westchester County home.
They bought the house last year when Mrs. Clinton began her Senate
campaign in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   But until now Clinton had remained an Arkansas voter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had six events to attend Monday -- four political or
fund-raising speeches bracketed by two events concerning New York's
Jewish community. Although nominally nonpolitical presidential
appearances, even those two Clinton speeches offered a veneer of
policy over campaign-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first stop was a Jewish community center in
Westchester County. Clinton ended his day in New York City, where
Mrs. Clinton collected an award for work among Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is lagging in her pursuit of New York's influential
Jewish vote, a traditionally Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1 among New York State's
Jews, yet polls show Mrs. Clinton is still having trouble reaching
the 60 percent level of support among Jewish voters that analysts
say is the minimum she needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, the race between Mrs. Clinton and Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., is roughly even. Though hardly monolithic, the
Jewish vote is considered capable of swinging a Senate election
even though only 12 percent of the state's electorate is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently tireless Clinton was busier Monday than many
candidates who are actually on the ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   He hopscotched from suburban New York to Connecticut and back to
New York City to raise money for Mrs. Clinton and two other
Democrats. He also found time to stop his motorcade and shake hands
in Danbury, and to pose for photographs with firefighters in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising reception on the East Side of Manhattan,
estimated to raise $500,000 for his wife's campaign, Clinton said
her political career may have been hurt, not helped, by his long
years in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that upsets me from time to time is some of
our critics, and I say that because regrettably she's inherited
most of my enemies... they say she wouldn't be up here running for
the Senate if she wasn't the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if she hadn't been married to me, and spent thirty
years trying to help other people and doing things for other
people, she might have been doing this twenty years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he praised Mrs. Clinton for her long work
with children during one stop, and delivered a history lesson on
the political and economic cycles of the 20th century at the next.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, Clinton spoke without notes in a
conversational style studded with facts and figures he pulled from
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at a fund-raising luncheon for Maloney nodded and
applauded appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning professorially on his podium, Clinton made a joke at his
own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not your standard political speech,'' he said. ''But I
have been doing this a long time now, and I've got the hang of
it.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Getting More Food to Civilians  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq has considerably increased the amount
of food getting to ordinary people from the U.N. aid program but
has refused to cooperate with an investigation of the humanitarian
situation in the country, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the U.N. oil-for-food program, Annan also pointed
to the $1.5 billion worth of contracts that remain held up in the
U.N. committee that monitors sanctions against Iraq -- largely at
the request of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The program lets Iraq sell its oil to buy food, medicine and
other goods for its people who have been under strict U.N.
sanctions since 1990. Fearing some of the purchases could be used
to make new weapons, Washington often blocks contracts or puts them
on hold while U.S. officials review them to ensure they cannot be
used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has repeatedly urged the United States and Britain, to a
lesser extent, to release the contracts so badly needed equipment
can reach Iraq, particularly oil spare parts needed to improve the
oil production industry.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the ''commendable efforts'' to release some of the
contracts, the secretary-general again expressed concern at the
volume and value of the goods still tied up.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has also repeatedly urged the Iraqis to give priority to
food and health items in its distribution plan of proceeds from the
oil sales to help combat the malnutrition suffered by Iraqis,
particularly children. In the past, Baghdad has chosen to spend its
money on other items as well as food, including oil spare parts and
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But in his report, Annan welcomed Iraq's decision to ''increase
considerably'' the food and health sector allocations in the most
recent distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been barred from selling its oil on the open market
since U.N. sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Sanctions can be lifted after U.N. weapons inspectors
report Baghdad is free of its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Policemen Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City policemen demanding the
resignation of their commander stormed the force's headquarters
Monday, battling fellow officers with batons in a protest that left
six officers injured.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed members of the city's blue-uniformed
auxiliary police force, who guard businesses and stores, hitting
fellow auxiliary officers with batons and poles. Several officers
suffered bloody head wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The injured officers were rescued by riot police and treated at
a hospital for non life-threatening injuries. The protests blocked
traffic along some of the city's main streets.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have lodged a series of complaints against their
commanders in recent months, including alleged corruption and fraud
in a pension fund, as well as inadequate equipment and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The protesting officers called for the resignation of their
commander, Jose Luis Silva.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Mexico City Mayor Rosario Robles named Ramon
Sosamontes as the auxiliary police's new commander, although Silva
will continue to work for the organization, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, aides to president-elect Vicente Fox announced
plans to overhaul Mexico's notoriously corrupt and inefficient
police forces and create a law enforcement system more like that in
the United States, including an agency modeled after the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to make cleaning up the corrupt forces and
restoring public faith a top priority of his government.

<HEADLINE> Rockland party chairman accused of public corruption  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Paul Adler, chairman of the Rockland
County Democratic Party and a fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham
Clinton, was charged Monday with public corruption after allegedly
enriching himself by nearly $375,000 through fraud, extortion and
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Among other charges, Adler is accused of threatening fellow
politicians with the loss of their jobs and saying, in a secretly
taped conversation, that he had not taken the position of
Democratic Party chairman to ''lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't help your friends, then why get into some of
these positions?'' he allegedly asked.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White answered his
question: ''People get elected and appointed to public positions
... to serve the interests of the public and party members fairly
and honestly rather than violating their trust and committing
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, a real estate broker, has been county chairman since
1996. He is a political mover and shaker in Rockland, one of the
suburban counties considered key to the U.S. Senate race in
November, and was the host for a fund-raiser for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Levine, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, would say
only, ''Hillary knows this is a difficult time for Paul and his
family and she wishes them well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Marr, spokesman for Republican candidate Rep. Rick
Lazio, said, ''This further illustrates why New Yorkers don't trust
Hillary Clinton. When a key campaign aide is charged with serious
federal crimes, it gives a great many New Yorkers a cause for
concern.'' The Lazio campaign demanded that Clinton return a $1,500
donation from Adler and renounce him as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   White, a Democrat, announced that corruption charges also were
brought against Sean Purdy, attorney for the Town of Haverstraw,
who was quickly suspended. The charges came after a 15-month
investigation that started when a member of the Clarkstown Planning
Board reported he'd been offered a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in White
Plains charged Adler with eight counts stemming from three real
estate transactions, including one involving the huge new Palisades
Mall in West Nyack.
</P>
<P>
   Adler, who spoke publicly in favor of the mall as its
construction was being debated, allegedly received $135,500 over a
three-year period to push through the proposal. A call to the West
Nyack office of the Pyramid Cos., developer of the mall, was not
returned. Pyramid was not accused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Duty seemed not to matter to these defendants,'' White said,
adding, ''not duty to the public, their own clients, nor in Adler's
case, to the Democratic Party and his own business partners.
Instead, they saw public service as a path to private enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, White said, Adler told Democrats on the Planning
Board that they would lose their positions if they opposed his real
estate deals. Once, she said, the Democratic chairman offered to
let a Republican run without opposition in exchange for help in
getting rid of a Democrat on the Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland District Attorney Michael Bongiorno, a Republican, said
the public pays for such real-estate corruption: ''It pays in
overdevelopment, it pays in terms of taxes that are increased and
it pays because people lose their faith in the government and
government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, 42, of New City, and Purdy, 43, a Democrat from
Garnerville, were brought to court Monday morning and released
without bail. They did not return calls to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Adler could face up to 60 years in prison and a $2
million fine while Purdy could face up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine, White said.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections Held in Macedonia  </HEADLINE>
By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Macedonia's ruling coalition and the
opposition both claimed victory Monday in local elections, which
outside observers described as being marred by irregularities,
intimidation and security incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's claim was based on unofficial results,
indicating that opponents of center-right ruling coalition of Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski won 23 out of 123 municipalities. The
same preliminary results indicated that the three-party ruling
coalition won 12 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition rejected the claim, offering instead their
own preliminary figures which had the three-member coalition
winning in 38 municipalities in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Official results of Sunday's election were expected later this
week. A runoff will be held in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The local elections were critical because Georgievski had
pledged he would be prepared to call early parliamentary elections
if the ruling coalition lost by more than 10 percent. With the vote
in dispute, however, it was not immediately clear whether he would
make good on that promise.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe mission in Macedonia said Monday the
municipal elections ''fell short of a number of international
standards for democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In particular, the elections did not fully meet the country's
OSCE commitment to conduct elections free from violence and
intimidation, and to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot,'' a
report obtained by The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police said Monday that violence was reported in six
locations during the voting and that they had detained 20 people,
with one man arrested for attempted manslaughter. Six people were
injured, the police stated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the incidents during Sunday's balloting took place in
western Macedonia, populated largely by ethnic Albanians who make
up about one quarter of the country's 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia was the only former Yugoslav republic to gain
independence in the early 1990s without war. Last year the nation
gave shelter to hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees
during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This exacerbated ethnic tensions locally, since many ethnic
Albanian refugees stayed behind. Macedonia's Slavic majority
perceives it is under threat.

Under the deal described Sunday by government sources, Lee was expected to drop

<HEADLINE> President Clinton with wife on eve of primary  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - President Clinton joined his wife on the eve of
her first primary election Monday as her Senate opponent, Rep. Rick
Lazio, continued to take heat over a photo of him shaking hands
with Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Ed Koch, a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's
Democratic Senate campaign, said there was ''nothing wrong with
shaking hands with people whom you either don't like or you
disagree with. ... But there is something wrong with hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House released the 1998 photo over the weekend after
Lazio criticized President Clinton for shaking hands with Cuban
President Fidel Castro last week at a United Nations meeting. Lazio
has also previously criticized Hillary Clinton for kissing Arafat's
wife when she traveled to the Middle East last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who was with Lazio when he met Arafat
as part of an official U.S. delegation, said everyone on the trip
shook hands with Arafat, including himself. Lantos is the only
Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress, and it was he who brought
the photo to the attention of the New York Post, where it first
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is not Lazio shaking hands with Arafat,'' Lantos
said. ''The issue is Lazio attacking Mrs. Clinton earlier with
respect to Mrs. Arafat, and his attacking the president on Fidel
Castro. It's such sheer and childish hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was Hillary Clinton's original
Republican challenger in the Senate race, said Monday that ''as to
whether Rick Lazio should have shook hands with him or not, yeah,
probably not, but it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Sunday there was a ''big difference'' between what he
did and what the Clintons did. He said the delegation he was part
of was there to recognize the repeal of a Palestinian charter
provision that called for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, said Monday that he doesn't
think Lazio ''has anything to apologize for. ... He's been a very
strong supporter of the state of Israel. He has a record. He's been
in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, faced a controversy of her own at
fund-raiser for the World Jewish Congress honoring the Clintons and
others, including former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, for work on
restitution for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady received an award for arranging a meeting between
her husband and World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman.
Some critics have questioned whether the award is appropriate,
given that Bronfman is an adviser to her campaign and Jews make up
a crucial voting bloc in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award, the first lady described her role as ''a
very minor part'' of the effort, while the president thanked two
Republican honorees, D'Amato and Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who
chaired the Senate and House banking committees that helped force a
settlement with Swiss banks.

   Outside the dinner at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, about 50
protesters from the Jewish Human Rights Forum staged a protest.
''It's crass exploitation of the Holocaust for partisan political
purposes,'' said Beth Gilinsky, who heads the group. ''All she did
was she told her husband he should meet with Edgar Bronfman.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it's nothing compared to the
years of effort put in by other people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner, Bronfman's son, Edgar Jr., thanked the Clintons
for ''these past eight years'' and added: ''I look forward to
helping to continuing this legacy with President Gore and Senator
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign has pointed out that he, too, played a role in
restitution efforts, by introducing a bill that extended the life
of a presidential commission investigating what happened to assets
of Holocaust victims that came into American hands. Lazio was not
invited to the dinner.

   On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton faces her first electoral challenge,
against relatively unknown orthopedic surgeon Mark McMahon. One
recent poll put his support at less than 15 percent, but McMahon
has been boasting that he expects to win an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons planned to vote Tuesday in Chappaqua, where they
have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is historically significant, the first time any U.S.
first lady's name has appeared on a ballot. Lazio, the GOP
candidate, does not face a primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the president appeared with his wife at a
Westchester County Jewish community center where they challenged
the entertainment industry to stop marketing inappropriate material
to children.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio gave a speech in upstate Elmira on Monday night outlining
his education policies.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Florence forms southeast of Carolinas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Tropical Storm Florence formed Monday southeast of
North Carolina and quickly blossomed with 70 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   The system was not expected to pose any threat to the
continental United States through Thursday, the outer limit of the
forecast by the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will produce some heavy surf and rip currents along the
southeast U.S. Coast and Bermuda,'' said hurricane specialist Stacy
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Although little change in strength was expected, a slight
increase in the intensity could bring Florence to hurricane
strength. A hurricane forms when winds reach 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could weaken just as easily as it could intensify,''
Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane hunter aircraft checked the system after a swirling
cloud formation developed Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, the sixth named storm of the 2000 Atlantic
hurricane season, was centered near 30.2 north latitude and 72.8
west longitude, or about 400 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras
and 485 miles west-southwest of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was nearly stationary but drifting toward the west.
Its forward motion was expected to be slow and erratic over the
next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane experts have predicted an active season, but the
storms so far have been relatively tame.
