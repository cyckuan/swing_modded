SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kim Jong-pil, head of South Korea's
second largest opposition party, the United Liberal Democrats
(ULD), was today elected as the party's presidential candidate in
December's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,575 or 82.3 percent of the 3,190 ballots cast at
the party's convention went to Kim Jong-pil while the other

In his acceptance speech, Kim said that he would do everything
in his power to get elected and revise the basic law in favor of a
parliamentary cabinet system.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a prime minister in the early 1970s, was one of the
so-called "Three Kims", along with the President Kim Young-sam and
Kim Dae-jung, leader of the largest opposition National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) party.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung was elected as his party's presidential candidate
on May 19.

Seven contenders from within President Kim's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP), including two former prime ministers, Lee Hoi-chang
and Lee Soo-sung, are currently campaigning to get the NKP's
presidential nomination in late July.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM's UAE Visit Achieves Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali`s three-day official visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) achieved positive results and advanced the
bilateral relations in various fields, said a senior Jordanian
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe made
the remarks to the press after Majali briefed the Cabinet today
on his UAE visit concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the prime minister delivered a message from
King Hussein to UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al
Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan believes that Arabs now are passing through a
critical stage and facing the prospects of a new regional
order," said Majali during his meeting with the UAE president.
</P>
<P>
"If we are united, we can be partners in shaping up this
regional order but if we are not, a regional order will be
imposed on us and it might not be in our interest," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jordan signed a 12-million-dollars loan agreement
with the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). The money will be used to
help the kingdom cover its balance of payments deficit which
resulted from higher prices of imports like basic agricultural
commodities, especially cereals.
</P>
<P>
The loan corresponds to 50 percent of Jordan's total share in
the fund.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Governor Ziyad
Fariz signed two agreements with the Arab Financing Program (AFP),
under which Jordan will be offered credit facilities worth
12.5 million U.S. dollars over a 18-month period to finance the
import of food commodities from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE president paid a visit to Jordan in April this year and
held talks with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is one of the Arab countries that severed ties with
Jordan during the Gulf War in 1991, but in recent years, the
bilateral ties have improved since Jordan distanced itself from
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Integrated Effort Leads to Effective Meningitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An integrated effort by
international organizations like UNICEF and WHO has been
successful in helping African countries to respond effectively to
the 1996-97 meningitis epidemics, cutting figures of both cases
and deaths in the previous season, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The meningitis season runs roughly from November to April.
Following exceptionally severe epidemics of meningitis in 1995-96
in Africa, when 150,000 cases with over 16,000 deaths were
reported, epidemics in the 1996-97 season were also significant,
but cases and deaths were reduced, with 59,461 cases reported as
of June 1, of which 6,055 were fatal.
</P>
<P>
The International Coordinating Group (ICG), set up in January
1997 in charge of meningitis control, began a two-day meeting here
in Geneva on Monday. The ICG is composed of representatives of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the International
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the Association pour L'Aide a la
Medecine Preventive (AMP), the World Health Organization (WHO), as
well as technical partners from WHO Collaborating Centers and
manufacturers of meningitis vaccine and autodestruct syringes.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the ICG, no country which urgently needed vaccine
was denied it; we were able to meet all urgent needs," said Dr
Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO Director-General.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of vaccine was anticipated in 1997 as a result of
unusually heavy demand in 1996, WHO said. The ICG is trying to
coordinate the best use of the limited amount (14 million doses)
of vaccine available for the control of epidemic meningitis in
Africa and to advise WHO on the best means of allocating the
vaccine. It was essential to ensure that the meningitis vaccine
was used where it was needed most and that wastage was avoided.
</P>
<P>
A fund of four million U.S. dollars for epidemic preparedness
has been set up. In 1997-98, the fund will both ensure that
countries have immediate access to vaccine when needed and provide
a mechanism for reimbursement so that countries become
self-sufficient in meningitis vaccine procurement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 16 African countries committed themselves in
November 1996 to a concerted effort to improve meningitis control.
They have developed national plans of action including training of
district health personnel and laboratory technicians, as well as
an estimation of needs of vaccine and other drugs based on
criteria of population at risk, epidemiological patterns of the
disease and the vaccine stock available at country level.

<HEADLINE> NATO Enlargement Creates New Division in Europe, says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The German opposition Greens Party
today warned that the planned eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would create new military and
political divisions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament and the swift opening of the European Union is
what is needed... not the expansion of NATO linked to a
militarisation of EU foreign policy," said the Greens in a
declaration quoted by the German DPA news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion would waste a chance to overcome the legacy of
Cold War bloc confrontation and could lead to a new division in
Europe, said the Greens, Germany's third biggest political party
after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the
main opposition Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
It also called for the strengthening of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), instead of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are due to meet in Madrid on July 8-9 when they
are expected to decide on which eastern European countries would
be invited to join the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are widely expected to
be the candidates to join in the first wave.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) --Ethiopia's parliament, the House
of People's Representatives, today endorsed the United
Nations convention on combating desertification which provides a
framework for sustainable development in dry-lands.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the house unanimously
endorsed the convention at a regular session with a strong
belief that the convention enhances measures taken by the government to
contain land degradation and drought in addition to fostering
access to financial resources and technologies from international
organizations and the developed world.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is strictly defined as land degradation in
arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. Ethiopia with 60-70
percent of its land within this category, was active during the
negotiations of the convention and was one of the first to sign
it, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia signed the convention in October 1994 at the Paris
conference.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy in EU to Reach 87: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union Babies born now
could have a life expectancy as high as 87 for girls and 83 for
boys, it is one scenario painted by population projections on
Tuesday by EU's statistical office Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
This would be a mighty leap from generations born in the
beginning of this century, who lived on average 20 years less,
Eurostat points out.
</P>
<P>
The scenario presupposes continual improvement of medical care
and healthy life-styles.
</P>
<P>
But the Eurostat report also warns that, if positive influence
slow down and are counteracted by negative factors such as smoking
and stress, progress to longer lives might stagnate. Life
expectancies would then be 82 for girls and 76 for boys, it says.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at present 21 percent of the EU
population is above 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
Longer lives and considerable changes in reproductive
behavior, which is resulting in far fewer babies, could boost
this to as much as 40 percent by 2050, and one third of this
elderly population might be 80, the report estimates.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Chief Assesses Dangers of Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Chief of Staff
Amnon Lipkin Shahak warned today that Syria is continuing to
improve its capability of launching a surprise attack against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shahak told the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee that Israeli army is ready to
quell new Palestinian rioting which could escalate in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The army chief was giving his assessment of the current
tension between Israel and Syria and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) due to the stalemate in both peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
Shahak said Syrian army has been improving its offensive
capabilities since last September. He noted Syria has redeployed
troops near the strategic Golan Heights between the two
countries, and sharpened its capability of launching a surprise
attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that both Syrian army and civilian
officials recently began talking more about war instead of
peace. But he added that Israeli army intelligence did not
detect any intention by Syria to launch a surprise attack in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The general also noted that Syria recently opened three
border crossings with Iraq, one of arch enemies of Israel, in a
bid to improve relations with Baghdad. He believed that the
Syrian move reflected its anger toward Israel over the prolonged
stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of south Lebanon where Israel has been bogged
down in a tough guerrilla war with Hezbollah forces, Shahak said
the recent public debate raised by mothers of soldiers serving
in south Lebanon caused damage to the troops.
</P>
<P>
He said while the mothers had the right to call for
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon, he thought such a move
would be more dangerous than remaining in the region. He said,
instead of a public debate, a political decision needed to be
made on the issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian violence, Shahak warned that
Israeli troops had been given clear orders on how to quell new
Palestinian rioting. He said the army was doing everything
possible to keep the situation under control in face of the
recent riotings. He foresaw casualties on both sides if a future
violent confrontation erupted.
</P>
<P>
Shahak claimed that the PNA was interested in continuing the
violence at a low level in order to reap political gains, but it
did not want an open confrontation at the stage and acted to
prevent authorized terror attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Shahak added, the Israeli-Palestinian
situation remained tense and the Palestinians, frustrated over
the peace stalemate, were waiting for new developments to start a
new round of violence.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, Israel's Civil Administration on
the territories has prepared several options for the outbreak of
widespread Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
The options included arresting Palestinian officials,
confiscation of their VIP cards, application of economic
sanctions including reimposing closure on the territories, and
even establishment of a new Palestinian leadership, the radio
reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Although Mozambique has potential
capacity to feed six times its 16 million population, it is still
faced with abject poverty, a United Nations official said in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe today.
</P>
<P>
Sigurd Marstein, a Mozambique-based U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) officer, said that of the 80 percent of people in Mozambique
living in rural areas, 60 percent are very poor.
</P>
<P>
He said food security is UNDP's major challenge in Mozambique
which now has relative peace and stability after 20 years of
civil war which destroyed the socio-economic potential of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to repatriate 1.7 million refugees from
neighboring countries since 1992, but we are now faced with the
task of feeding them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marstein said that there is plenty of arable land in Mozambique
which could be used to make agriculture more viable as a starting
point in eradicating starvation.

<HEADLINE> Intra-African Trade Low, Says Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Growth of intra-African trade is
hampered by lack of finance and information on available goods
and services, a Zimbabwean cabinet minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day exhibition running concurrently with the
meeting of shareholders of the Africa Export and Import Bank
(AFREXIM) in Harare, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa
said lack of information had resulted in locally available goods
being sourced from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"Frequently, the world market is perceived, given the effects
of colonialism, as the metropolitan center by many of our
exporters and importers," said Murerwa.
</P>
<P>
"Products normally available from neighboring countries are
sought far away even where there are no obvious differences as to
both quality and price," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition mounted by various government agencies and
private sector companies is meant to demonstrate the scope of
activities for which the AFREXIM bank provides financial support.
</P>
<P>
The AFREXIM bank was established in 1993 in Cairo of Egypt, with
the task of facilitating and promoting intra and extra African
trade.
</P>
<P>
The bank operates a number of programs to supplement and
leverage trade finances from inside and out of the continent.

<HEADLINE> Assassination Plot Exposed in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government has
accused the Sudanese government of plotting to assassinate its
President Isaias Afwerki.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued on Tuesday, the Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said that the Sudanese government "plotted to assassinate
President Isaias Afwerki, dispatching a member of its foreign
security forces to Eritrea on November 14, 1996" to infiltrate the
National Democratic Alliance of the Sudan, which operated in Eritrea,
"to accomplish the abominable act".
</P>
<P>
The ministry said, "The heinous crime was conceived at the
highest level with explicit operational orders given to the
terrorist from senior government officials".
</P>
<P>
It pointed out, the assassination mission in Eritrea was
planned to "be executed by Captain Al Khairat alone although other
subversive support groups were also dispatched from Khartoum at
the same time".
</P>
<P>
In addition to a detailed information on the plot to assassinate
President Isaias, Captain Al Khairat has further confirmed
"subversive and terrorist sponsoring activities", it added.
</P>
<P>
The assassin had confessed that the primary motive behind the
assassination plot was to bring about political confusion in
Eritrea, the press release said. The Eritrean Foreign Ministry
called upon the international community to " take immediate and
appropriate action against the Sudanese government to ensure the
cessation of these illicit acts".

<HEADLINE> Greco-Cypriot Defense Pact Remains Intact, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A common defense pact between
Greece and Cyprus remains intact and both governments are
determined to safeguard it, a government spokesman of Cyprus said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said that "the pact is the achievement of
the Greek and Cypriot governments and is safeguarded fervently."
</P>
<P>
"It plays a significant role in the fulfillment of our
policies and we will protect it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to press reports in
Greece that the Cypriot government's unilateral decision to waive
overflights by Greek military aircraft challenges the pact.
</P>
<P>
The pact, reached in November 1993 between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and the late Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou,
provides Cyprus with sea, air and land cover from the Greek
military in the event of fresh offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced the decision in April to
suspend overflights by Greek military aircraft in order to create
a good climate for the U.N-sponsored direct negotiations between
the two communities of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in the
island country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the decision "is not a moratorium on
flights, but a unilateral and conscious decision which we have
taken."
</P>
<P>
Christofides accused Turkish military aircraft of having
repeatedly violating the Cypriot airspace, saying the entries are
illegal and have violated international law.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the Turkish violations as part of the continuing
crime of the continuing invasion and occupation of part of Cyprus
and we consistently denounce them to the United Nations and other
international bodies," Christofides noted.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took control of its northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Primakov will visit Hong Kong from June 28 to july 2 to take part
in the celebration of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by director of the department of information
and press of Foreign Ministry Gennagi Tarasov on Tuesday at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said Primakov is to participate all the activities
arranged by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the
guests. He may also take the opportunity to meet with foreign
ministers of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the amendment recently passed by the Lower House
of the United States on tougher the sanctions against Cuba,
Tarasov noted that it is another attempt of the U.S. to bring
pressure on the third country and its coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said that the American scheme would not help normalization of
the relations between Cuba and the U.S. and the situation of this
area. One of the goal is to force Russia to shrink its cooperation
with Cuba in building nuclear power station, Tarasov added.

donor representatives in the country to ensure that the
assessment of relief needs was conducted in a transparent and
measurable way, she said.
</P>
<P>
While the situation in some regions is reported to have eased,
the WFP official said, those households most seriiously affected
by drought will need assistance to the end of July or in August,
depending on the harvest returns in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports from the government of Tanzania and FAO
indicated that many of the Central regions in the country may
continue to need support, she added.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official told that the four million US Dollars donated
to WFP for drought relief food by Canada, Ireland, Australia,
Germany and Belgium, will provide food rations to some 200,000
persons for a period of 120 days.

JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians today accused the
hardline Israeli government of trying to cancel all signed
agreements and reoccupying the Palestinian self-rule areas,
according to the Palestinian JMCC press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on leaked information about an Israeli military plan
to reoccupy Palestinian territories in Area A, the Palestinian
cabinet secretary, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, warned the Netanyahu
government that "such a plan will not pass easily" and "we are not
to be eaten in such a way."
</P>
<P>
Rahim declared that it is very difficult for the Israelis
to enter the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Palestinian National Authority commits
itself to all agreements the PLO signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rahim advised the Israeli government or some of its members
still harboring old mentality of occupation to "get rid of such
ideas since they will bring about catastrophe for both (Israeli
and Palestinian) peoples."
</P>
<P>
According to the leaked information published in the Israeli
press, the Israeli government is conducting military trainings in
order to reoccupy Palestinian territories. The plan is
code-named "Field of Thorn."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Supports Extension of Current OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would support a
decision on the extension of the current oil production ceiling of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Kuwaiti
Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazidi said today.
</P>
<P>
He was making the announcement through an interview with
official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) before leaving for Vienna to
take part in OPEC's Ministerial Council meeting scheduled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said "we have no choice but to agree on the extension of the
ceiling if agreed by all member states" because oil prices were
low at present.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait at present produces 2 million bpd of oil in line with a
quota set by OPEC while reserves are estimated at 96.5 billion
barrels or 10 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's oil production ceiling is standing at 25.03 million
barrels per day (bpd). But OPEC's 11 members have increased
production by more than 2 million bpd since November last year,
reaching 27.05 million bpd in April this year, according to
Kuwaiti oil sources.
</P>
<P>
Production has increased by nearly eight percent above the
ceiling while prices have declined by 20 percent in the first
quarter of this year, Libya's Oil Minister Abdullah Al-Badri said
in May.
</P>
<P>
An extra 400,000 bpd of output from OPEC might be forthcoming
in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Venezuela and
Indonesia might all add production capacity this year.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) have been continuing in a down trend since the
start of this year because of increase of international supply and
decrease of demand.
</P>
<P>
The prices of OAPEC's basket of seven crudes stood at 18.6
barrels per day in March, dropping by 4.9 dollars per barrels
compared to last December.
</P>
<P>
The Brent Blend crude, the world benchmark grade, was trading
at an averaged 19.39 U.S. dollars per barrel in the past four
months.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi said OPEC's ceiling will be decided according to
reports to be presented by OPEC Secretary General and head of the
committee assigned to follow up prices.
</P>
<P>
The most important agenda at the meeting would be the OPEC
member states' commitment to the production ceiling in order to
preserve international crude oil prices, Al-Mazidi said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected better prices in the third quarter of
1997 due to the cold weather in some parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Minister: British Government to Maintain Existing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The new British Labor
Government will maintain the same policy pursued by its
Conservative predecessor towards Kuwait and promote the existing
relations with it, a senior British official said today.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister of State for Commonwealth and Middle
East Affairs Derek Fatchett made the remark before departure at
the Kuwait International Airport after wrapping up a two-day
official visit to the oil-rich Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
"The change of government in Britain does not mean any change
in British policy towards Kuwait," Fatchett told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the new Labor Government headed by Tony Blair is
"keen to strengthen and improve our existing relationship and I
believe that my visit here today has been a first step to achieve
this objective."
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived here Monday after visiting Oman, held
separate talks with Kuwaiti amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah
and government officials on ways of promoting bilateral relations
on both political and economic fronts and discussed pending arms
deal with the host.
</P>
<P>
He said during his visit he discussed with Kuwaiti officials
"all aspects of our defense relationship," adding that Britain
"remains ready to help Kuwait build up its own defense
capability."
</P>
<P>
On the question of the pending British-made Sea Skua missile
deal, Fatchett said "A point we have stressed throughout is to
ensure the Kuwaiti ability to defend itself."
</P>
<P>
The British minister stressed that "Kuwait remains a very
important market for Britain and we will do all we can to help
support the work of British exporters."
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement
following the 1991 Gulf War to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country would "help maintain pressure on
Iraq to comply with all U.N. Security Council Resolutions."
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Fatchett affirmed that
Britain would assist in the peace process to achieve a "political
cooperation, the political freedom and the economic prosperity
that we need in the region."
</P>
<P>
Fatchett's tour is the first visit of its kind by a senior
British official to the Gulf since the Labor Party came to power
in the elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who is on a Gulf tour that has already taken him to
Oman, will also visit the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Unionists Poised to Accept New Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the main
pro-British unionist party in Northern Ireland, said today his
party was prepared to accept new Anglo-Irish proposals to break
the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, to be announced by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to parliament on Wednesday, is designed to include Sinn
Fein, the political wing of IRA, to join multi-party peace
negotiations on the Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein has so far been
barred from such talks because the IRA refused to call a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Blair in the Downing Street office, Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionists, the main Protestant party in the
province, told reporters the plan involved the concept of
"parallel decommissioning" by which the IRA would start to
surrender its weaponry as the talks proceeded.
</P>
<P>
By that offer, Blair is hoping to persuade the IRA to resume
the ceasefire they abandoned in February 1996, committing
themselves to political methods to work towards their goal of a
united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's possible that we have the basis of a way forward.
But of course this has got to be agreed with all the other
parties," Blair told reporters in New York while attending the
U.N. environment summit.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army has launched military campaign over
the past 28 years to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland's Protestant majority, however, favors to remain
in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said parallel decommissioning was not his party's
"first preference," but they could "go along...provided of course
that that is what actually happened."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told Irish radio that he had not
seen the proposals yet. But once he sees the government document,
"Sinn Fein will study very carefully the proposals that they are
putting forward."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Scores New Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence of the U.S.
advanced again in June, the New York-base research group
Conference Board reported today.
</P>
<P>
The index of consumer confidence rose to 129.6 in June, nearly
two points higher than in May, the group said. The present
situation index climbed more than 5 points to 157.8, up from 152.6
in May. The expectation index held at 110.7, barely off from 111.4
in May.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence increased this month in seven of America's
nine major regions, it reported. Some 36 percent of all consumers
say business conditions are "good", up from about 33 percent in
May. Nearly 36 percent say jobs are plentiful, up from about 35
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of consumers expecting business conditions to
improve held at about 19 percent, the same figure as in May.
</P>
<P>
"Latest survey results show consumer confidence continuing to
run at historically-high levels," says Lynn Franco, Associate
Director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Involvement in Attempt on Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Mustafa Osman Ismail has denied his government's
implication in the attempted murder of Eritrean President Issayas
Aferwerki.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has charged that Sudan was behind a plot to
assassinate the Eritrean president.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, the Sudanese minister
said that "Sudan has nothing to do with the matter, these are
mere allegations."
</P>
<P>
He said that by making the allegations, the Eritrean regime
wished to evade the involvement of Eritrean agents in the
sabotage attempts recently uncovered by Sudanese security forces.
</P>
<P>
Media reports have quoted an Eritrean government statement as
saying that a Sudanese officer called Nasreddin Babakr Abul
Khayrat had been arrested while plotting to kill Aferwerki.
</P>
<P>
But Ismail said that no one by that name worked for Sudan's
armed forces or security services.
</P>
<P>
He further asserted that the above-mentioned officer belongs
to the Sudanese opposition, adding that the Sudanese government
will produce further information as soon as it is available.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Hopes to Focus Job, Crime in Next G-7 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today he wanted the next G-7 summit to be held in Britain to
concentrate on jobs and crime, not merely "glorified photo calls."
</P>
<P>
Blair, just back from his first summit of the Group of Seven
nations plus Russia in Denver, told Parliament he "wants to return
to the original idea" for the summits.
</P>
<P>
"This was my first G-8 summit and I was struck by how much
better the discussions were when we had time to focus on the key
issues common to all our countries. Next year, I want to take that
further and concentrate on fewer issues in greater depth," he told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I want in particular to concentrate on two subjects: the issue
of jobs and employability and the challenge posed by organized
crime," he added.
</P>
<P>
His aides said Blair hoped that the leaders could have at least
half a day away from the prying eyes of the media.
</P>
<P>
"We all face the challenge of how to take advantage of
increasing globalization and provide new job opportunities. In
many countries unemployment, particularly among young people, is
far too high" so the job issue must be underlined at the next
summit, Blair stressed.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Several minor earthquakes,
registering 3.4 to 4.6 on the Richter scale, shook northwestern
United States Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Tries to Clean up Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian capital has launching a
campaign to improve its air quality which has deteriorated into
the world's worst.
</P>
<P>
Early this month the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency
embarked on the Cairo Air Improvement Project with the backup of
60 million U.S. dollars of technical assistance and funding from
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according
to Middle East Times.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution is the highest environmental health risk in the
city, causing 10,000 to 25,000 deaths every year, according to a
1994 USAID study quoted in the latest edition of the English weekly.
</P>
<P>
The two most dangerous culprits are lead and particulate
matter, or soot, in air. USAID estimates that Cairo's children
currently lose an average of 4.25 I.Q. points because of their
exposure to lead.
</P>
<P>
In one step, the Oil Ministry switched to unleaded gas in
Alexandria and Cairo a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to impose tougher limit on the use
of diesel fuel to help reduce floating soot, the cause of
respiratory ailments to thousands of Cairo residents.
</P>
<P>
The city's bus fleet, a major consumer of disel, will be
converted to users of compressed natural gas (CNG), a cheap and
clean alternative, according to the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the private sector is taking initial steps to
convert cars to natural gas as the country is rich in gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes developing a system for vehicle
emissions inspection. It will support inexpensive, private-sector
testing and tune-up stations that will allow the government to
enforce emissions standards.
</P>
<P>
USAID, during their investigation, also found several
unexpected sources of pollution like foundries, the habit of
burning garbage and motor bikes using oil-fuel mixers to improve
their performance.
</P>
<P>
USAID has promised to help both private and public sector
smelters clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
The agency has allocated 7-8 million U.S. dollars of the total
aid figure for new projects designed to address these problems.

<HEADLINE> Eurofighter to Go Ahead, German Finance Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today the Bonn government will hold on to the Eurofighter
project despite controversies over how to fund the costly
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
"The Eurofighter is indispensable due to reasons of defense
policy," Waigel was quoted by German media as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eurofighter is a joint project developed by Germany, Britain,
Italy and Spain. Except Germany, the other three nations have
already approved the purchase of the modern jets and are anxiously
waiting for Bonn to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Germany indicated earlier that it wanted to buy 180 Eurofighter
jets to modernize its air force. However There remain doubts over
how to foot the expected 23 billion German mark (13.6 billion U.S.
dollar) bill due to huge shortfall in the government budget.
</P>
<P>
Waigel has proposed to redirect Germany's state aid for the
Airbus airliner to help fund the Eurofighter. A final decision is
expected to be made on June 11 during the German parliament debate
on the 1998 budget.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration FMs Conference to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LATAKIA, SYRIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers'
Conference of Damascus Declaration Signatories will open here
Wednesday, which will tackle issues concerning the Mideast
peace process and other matters of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the conference quoted officials at the
secretariat of the conference as saying that there will be
several important and sensitive issues on the agenda for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda are the freeze of the Middle East peace
process, the Arab strategy in face of the Israeli policy of
intransigence, and dimensions of the military and security
alliance between Israel and Turkey and its negative consequences
on the regional and Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fourth Middle East and North Africa economic
conference, due to be held in Qatar in November, will also be a key
issue for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration Signatories, which was formed right
after the 1991 Gulf War, groups the Gulf Cooperation Council
members of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Bahrain and Qatar, as well as Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the foreign Ministers of the eight
countries will examine a joint Syrian-Egyptian working paper on
ways and means of establishing an Arab common market to confront
regional and international economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Egypt are promoting the Arab common market as an
alternative to a Middle East market through which Israel will be
placed within the Arab economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Arab countries fear that the introduction of
Israel into Arab economy will ultimately lead to Israeli economic
hegemony over the Arab market in view of Israel's economic and
technological superiority in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the conference will discuss the prospects of an Arab
resolution on the restoration of Iraq to the Arab ranks,
particularly after Syria and Egypt restored economic and trade
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Political observers hold that the Damascus Declaration
foreign ministers conference, embracing the politically,
economically and militarily significant Arab states, constitutes
the beginning of a unified Arab stance, paving the way for an
expanded Arab summit to work out an Arab strategy against the
challenges confronting the region.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Major Parties Support PM-Designate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Three major opposition parties of
Turkey today voiced their support for Turkish Prime
Minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz who is trying to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Yilmaz, the Democratic Left Party
(DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit told reporters that his party would
give full support for the new government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, also former prime minister, said that all secularist
leaders should back Yilmaz, describing the support for the new
government as "a national duty."
</P>
<P>
Husamettin Cindoruk, whose Democratic Turkey Party (DTP) has
seven seats in the parliament, also declared his support for a
government of Yilmaz, adding he made the decision for the survival
of Turkey's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal
affirmed that his party would not join the new government, but
all the 49 CHP deputies would be its supporters.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the support by the DSP, DTP and CHP
meant a great help for Yilmaz's success to win a vote of
confidence in the 550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, chairman of the Motherland Party (ANAP), the second
largest political party in Turkey, was appointed by President
Suleyman Demirel to form the next government following the
resignation of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on June
18.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Yilmaz also met with the True Path Party (DYP)
leader Tansu Ciller, but failed to persuade Ciller to change her
position.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Ciller, also deputy prime minister and
foreign minister of the present caretaker government, told
reporters that she refused to exchange views with Yilmaz over the
government issue.
</P>
<P>
"I did not discuss the government issue so as not to
legitimise Yilmaz's position," she said, adding the ANAP leader
should "return the mandate immediately to the president."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, caretaker Prime Minister Erbakan told his Welfare
Party (RP) members today that Yilmaz should hand over the
mandate to Ciller to set up a new government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has started since Monday rounds of thorny talks with
leaders of various parties in an effort to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
He said the new government would be one of what he termed as
cohesion and reconciliation, adding it aimed to solve the
problems of the country within the framework of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-designate, however, rejected talks with
the Erbakan-led RP and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) led by Muhsin
Yizicioglu.
</P>
<P>
BBP, which has eight seats in the parliament, vowed to support
a DYP-RP coalition government.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Yilmaz has enjoyed 265 votes in the
parliament, not enough to survive a possible vote of confidence
in the 550-seat legislature with a vacancy of two.
</P>
<P>
If the new government fails to win a vote of confidence in
the parliament, the mandate to form a government will naturally
go to Ciller, whose DYP ranks the third in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned last week under the pressure from both the
military and his junior coalition partner DYP who criticized the
government's failure in curbing the rapidly-expanding
fundamentalism in the secular republic.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Rejects Ban on Female Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court today overturned a
ban on performing female circumcision in hospitals, putting an end
to the government's campaign to exterminate a popular ritual in
this largely Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
This ruling will allow the operation to be carried out in all
state and private clinics. But amateurs are banned to do the
delicate job though it is common that midwives and barbers are
entrusted in poor urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Judge Abdul Aziz Hamade said the court overturned the ban
because it was imposed a year ago without parliamentary approval,
rather than making a statement on the nature of the female
circumcision.
</P>
<P>
A group of doctors in Cairo filed a case last September demanding
that the government overturn the ban.
</P>
<P>
Female circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation,
is common in Egypt despite a government ban on health care workers
performing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of Egyptian
women have undergone the procedure, most of them, girls of 8-12
years old.
</P>
<P>
Many believe it curbs a girl's sexual appetite or enhances
cleanliness. Others say it is required by Islam, although Muslim
scholars disagree over this. Some Egyptian Christians also follow
the practice.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Workers' Income Unchanged in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The median employment income of
Canada's labor force was essentially unchanged in 1995 as
compared to 1994, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The median, the point at which half the population are above
and half are below, was 20,600 Canadian dollars (14,800 US
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was "24 dollars less than the amount required to keep up
with the increase in the consumer price index," the federal agency
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the median employment was 25,900 dollars (18,600 US
dollars) for men and 16,000 (11,500 US dollars) for women. Both
men and women experienced an increase on a current dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
Yet, "the gains were not sufficient to withstand inflation,"
the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The number of Canadians who earned income from employment at
any time in 1995 increased by 223,470 to reach 14.4 million, the
largest change since 1989, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> China's Jiangsu Province Eyes on US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province is
trying to make a rousing performance on the U.S. market after it
has made marked progress in Southeast Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
A high ranking economic and trade delegation from the province
started a three-day trade fair today in the World Trade Center,
now the facilities for many of China's trade activities in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Chen Huanyou, the first senior adviser to the
People's Government of Jiangsu Province, the delegation includes
about 150 officials and business people from 13 cities and a
number national level development zones, trading companies and
about 80 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to Washington, made a timely
presentation at the opening ceremony. "Despite the ups and downs,
China-U.S. relations have made positive progress recently," he
said. In 1996, the United States became China's second largest
trading partner, while China was the fourth for the U.S. Up to
now, American investment in China has reached 14.3 billion U.S.
dollars, he said. "The progress is amazing," the Chinese
ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that the Jiangsu fair can serve as another
good opportunity to further the efforts for strengthening the
trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation has brought along more than 300 projects
for establishing cooperation or joint ventures in Jiangsu, with
each requiring at least a million U.S. dollars. All the projects
offered will cost a total of 6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taking the advantages of its ideal geographic location and
convenient transport and telecommunication facilities, Jiangsu has
attracted foreign investment for growingly bigger projects,
according to Chen, who is also secretary of the provincial Chinese
Communist Party committee. By the end of 1996, there had been more
than 2,000 projects with an investment of above 10 million U.S.
dollars each. And 20 of them exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars
each, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's trade with the U.S. is also developing rapidly, said
Chen. In 1996, its trade volume with the U.S. rocketed to 3.03
billion U.S. dollars from 657 million U.S. dollars in 1980. Its
products sold to the U.S. market also covered wide ranges.

LUANDA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will invest
10 million US Dollars to restore its traditional agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
The decision was disclosed by the Angolan Ministry of
Agriculture today in Huambo, a central Angolan city, reported the
local press.
</P>

As the country regains peace and stability, restoration of
agricultural production is required to solve the problem of
food shortages and to further provide raw materials for
the processing industry, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Export Missile Decoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government is to
sign a collaborative deal worth 85.5 million U.S. dollars to
supply Australian-developed missile decoys for the United States,
Canada and the Royal Australian Navy.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here today,
"It is a major export and it's a major defense industry success
for Australia."
</P>
<P>
The anti-ship missile decoys called Nulka are capable of luring
missiles, such as the French-designed Exocet, away from their
targets, he said. The deal is being signed with the Australian
arm of British engineering group British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Nulka, an aboriginal word meaning "be quick", arose from
research conducted by the Australian Defense Science and
Technology Organization (DSTO) in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The DSTO envisaged a hovering rocket launched from a warship
and simulating its electronic emissions to present a much more
attractive target to missiles.
</P>
<P>
Extensive testing by the Australian and U.S. navies showed it
worked effectively against a wide variety of possible threats.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the government announced a 44-million-dollar deal
to equip Australian warships with Nulkas.

<HEADLINE> HK to Remain International Financial Center: Bankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The executives of three
influential banks in Hong Kong agree that Hong Kong will continue
to retain its status as an international financial center after
its return to China.
</P>
<P>
Alexander S. K. Au, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang
Seng Bank; Ian R. Wilson, general manager of the Hong Kong, China
Northeast Area of the Standard Chartered Bank; and David Li
Kwok-po, vice chairman and chief executive of the East Asia Bank,
outlined financial prospects of Hong Kong at a forum held here
today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, Ian R. Wilson said that Hong Kong had 357
foreign-funded banks, ranking second in the world after London.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranks 5th in the world in terms of net daily turnover
of the foreign exchange market after Singapore, Japan, US and UK.
</P>
<P>
"At present in Hong Kong we have 182 fully licensed banks, 64
restricted-license banks, 121 deposit taking companies and 157
representative offices making a total of 524 financial
institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's financial markets are characterized by a high
degree of liquidity and operate under effective and transparent
regulations, which meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have a big stake in Hong Kong and use Hong Kong as
a regional hub. We feel very much at home in Hong Kong and we have
every confidence in the future of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Au said that this is especially true of Hong
Kong in its role as a major international financial center thanks
partly to its ideal location in southern China and at the trade
crossroads of Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has every intention of preserving Hong Kong
as an international financial center after the handover. the Basic
Law of Hong Kong provides specifically for the maintenance of Hong
Kong as an international financial center, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has stated that Hong Kong will continue to formulate its
own monetary and financial policies and pursue a low-tax policy.
The free flow of capital will be safeguarded and the Hong Kong
dollar-US dollar peg will remain.
</P>
<P>
The risk assessment of Hong Kong's post-1997 business
environment by overseas organizations is increasingly positive.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe Hong Kong will continue to offer unique value
with its unique qualities, especially as the gateway to China," he
said.
</P>
<P>
David Li said that 25 percent of Hong Kong's economy is related
to financial services which make up eight percent of Hong Kong's
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Development of the local economy and opportunities offered by
the inland areas of China have turned Hong Kong into an
international financial center, he noted.
</P>
<P>
All the factors contributing to the success of Hong Kong will
continue to exist after the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Government is established on July 1. Hong Kong will strengthen its
status as an international financial center with greater support
from the inland areas, he said.

</P>
<P>

Kong is and will continue to be a strong supporter of
international actions to fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We choose June 26 to launch the Homepage to
commemorate the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit

<HEADLINE> Balanced Budget, Key to HK's Economic Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the 45-year-old secretary said he
is resolved to continue implementing this fiscal policy as
stipulated in the Basic Law, so as to build up a sound base for
the long-term prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Kwong, the Hong Kong government has always attached
great importance to its effort to keep a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
As the growth in revenue has kept abreast of the economic
growth, Hong Kong usually works out its annual budget in
accordance with the five-year economic growth forecast and the
relevant anticipated revenue augment.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements for the expenditure are also based on the
principle that the expenditure growth shall not exceed the
economic growth rate in term of a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
In order to strive for a balanced budget, which often
constitutes no easy job, a tight control on the expenditure is
always essential, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of attaining this objective, he added, it is
helpful and beneficial to solicit people's views extensively from
all walks of life and to keep in good communication with the
related departments so as to win support from society at large.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the fiscal and taxation policies as stipulated in
the Basic Law are in conformity with the consistent financial
policies of Hong Kong, and these policies will remain the same
after Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy has kept growing yearly ever since 1962.
"As long as the continuity of the policies is ensured, the
long-term development of Hong Kong will be guaranteed," the
secretary for treasury assured.

<TEXT>
<P>
LATAKIA, Syria, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Foreign Ministers of the Damascus Declaration Signatories (DDS)
ended here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting lasted four hours after the opening
ceremony that was chaired by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara in his capacity as foreign minister of the host country.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Shara underscored the importance of
the conference as the Arab nation was facing three challenges,
foremost among which was the one confronting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of blocking the Middle East peace process,
being engaged in occupation activities and launching repeated
attacks against south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shara said that the Turkish-Israeli military alliance, which
has alarmed all Arab countries, represents the second challenge.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the commitment of Arab states to the
Arab solidarity needs to be honored.
</P>
<P>
Shara also confirmed that the Arab states had been seeking to
achieve a just and comprehensive peace on the basis of
international legitimate resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United States for having participated in the
Turkish-Israeli naval exercises and for ignoring the fact that it
was the co-sponsor of the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the DDS will hold second session this
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister revealed that a cordial and fraternal
atmosphere prevailed in the unofficial consultations among the
participating foreign ministers Tuesday evening.

The DDS, which was formed shortly after the 1991 Gulf War in a
bid to increase military cooperation, comprises the Gulf
Cooperation Council members of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, as well as Egypt and
Syria.

"I am convinced that, on the basis of the 1984 Sino-British

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin's visit to China scheduled on June 26-28 will promote
the development of military and technical cooperation between the
two countries, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a high-ranking
official of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The official, the report does not give his name, said that the
joint declaration signed by Russian and Chinese leaders last year
in Beijing favors trustful and mutually advantageous partnership
aimed at a strategic interaction not only in this century but also
in the 21st centary.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cooperation between Russia and China is not
directed against third countries and is called upon to promote
geostrategic stability in east Asia and ensure lasting peace in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The military relations between the two countries were
developing quite rapidly in 1992-1997, the Russian military
representative was cited.
</P>
<P>
As many as 26 aircraft of the Shukhoi trademark were delivered
to China by the end of 1992, and the volume in the area of
military-technical cooperation between Russia and China reached
1.8 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed China's requirement of Russian
military equipment for the period up to the year 2000, when Zhan
Wannian, the chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation
Army of China, was on a visit in Russia in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and Chinese presidents signed a joint agreement on
non-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles and refraining from
the first uses of nuclear weapons, when Chinese president Jiang
Zemin visited Moscow in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996 in Shanghai the heads of five states -- Russia,
China, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and Tajikistan, signed an agreement
on confidence-building in the military sphere in the border area
-- a first such agreement in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
A protocol on military and technical cooperation between Russia
and China was signed in Beijing in December 1996. It was agreed
that Russia would sell China a consignment of Russian destroyers
of the latest make, of Sovremenny class, and that armaments and
navigation systems of Chinese naval ships of this type will be
modernized.
</P>
<P>
A Five-Nation Agreement on Mutual Force Reduction in the Border
Area was signed in Moscow by leaders of Russia, China, Kazakhstan,
Kirghizia and Tajikistan on April 24, 1997, when Chinese president
Jiang Zemin was on an official visit in Russia. It was described
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin as a landmark agreement
creating a zone of stability on the border stretch of 7.5 thousand
kilometres, the Itar-Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Welcome Party for Journalists Covering HK Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Federation of
Journalists hosted a welcome reception here today for Chinese and
overseas journalists covering the return of Hong Kong to China on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figure from the Handover Ceremony
Coordination Office under the Hong Kong Government, there are now
more than 8,000 journalists from 778 media institutions across the
world in Hong Kong to cover the Hong Kong handover.
</P>
<P>
"July 1 is a historic moment. This is a great opportunity for
us," Chan Tin-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of
Journalists, told the several hundred journalists attending the
reception in an opening speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that the local media are glad to join journalists from
all over the world to "witness this important historic event."
</P>
<P>
Talking about freedom of the press in Hong Kong, Chan said that
the Chinese government, for the interests of Hong Kong, has
adopted the policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
People governing Hong Kong," a high degree of autonomy and the
maintenance of Hong Kong's current lifestyle for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
These policies, he said, have been enshrined in the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which explicitly
provides for freedom of speech and of the press. "In other words,
freedom of the press in the future has been guaranteed, and will
be protected by state policies and laws in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was reinforced by a statement of the federation
released at today's reception.
</P>
<P>
The statement says: "Detailed and specific clauses on the
guarantee of freedoms of speech, of the press and publishing have
been stipulated in the Basic Law, while commitments have also been
made for the SAR Government to continue to abide by the
'International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights' and the
'International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights'
in the future."
</P>
<P>
With such arrangements, the statement says, press freedom in
Hong Kong will be "fully and unequivocally" protected by relevant
national policies and Hong Kong law.
</P>
<P>
Chan said Hong Kong's well-developed media and information
industry will continue to develop with technological advances and
the better flow of information.
</P>
<P>
"We Hong Kong journalists have to put in much effort to uphold
and promote professionalism, and to learn the latest technology,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the handover coverage which has attracted thousands
of journalists to Hong Kong as "a very good opportunity to learn
from each other," Chan said that Hong Kong journalists are eager
to enhance exchanges with journalists from China's interior areas
and from the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> German Police Seek Banker Suspected to Embezzle 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The police in the German southern
city of Munich today disclosed that they have begun an
international search for a German banker suspected to have
embezzled over 50 million marks (28 million US dollars), according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Peter Dieter Sommer, 57, formerly managing
director of the capital management company GGK, was believed to
have fled to South America. No trace was found of him since he
went to Mexico on vacation in March.
</P>
<P>
Munich police, which have been investigating the GGK company
for two years on suspicions of fraudulent activities, launched the
search for Sommer after gaining evidence from a former business
partner of his, a Greek national named Benedik Symenonidis, who
was arrested a year ago after found having caused about 200
million mark losses to several companies through fraudulent bond
sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Sommer's personal assets, some of them
legally acquired, totaled at least 100 million marks, which
included a mansion in London and other real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
GGK was founded in the 1950s and for a time a thriving
financial investment business. It went bankrupt in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Promotes a Prosperous China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the
board of Japanese electronics giant NEC, said here today that the
"one country, two systems" principle, which reflects the wisdom of
the Chinese people, will bring a prosperous China into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua Tuesday, Sekimoto said it
is of historic significance that Hong Kong, which was forcibly
taken by Britain in the last century, will soon be returned to
China peacefully under the concept of "one country, two systems"
put forward by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's peaceful handover to China on July 1 deserves
celebration not only in China, but also in Asia and throughout the
world," the NEC chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Introducing two systems in one country is a great pioneering
undertaking which has drawn global attention and will have a
positive impact on the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, economic ties between the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HK SAR) and the inland areas will get
closer, Sekimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng during his visit to Beijing in April, Sekimoto
said he was deeply impressed by the determination of the Chinese
leadership to carry out the reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
"China has carried out economic reform on the premise of
maintaining social stability and has achieved a great deal in the
past 10 years and more," Sekimoto said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will play a great role as the economic center of
Asia and the world in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong's
economic environment will see no change after its return to China
and will maintain its prosperity and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Should the Chinese government consistently uphold the 'one
country, two systems' principle and make the best use of Hong Kong
as an international financial and trading center, then the
economies of both the HK SAR and the inland areas will develop
remarkably," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic about China's economic development after Hong Kong's
handover, Sekimoto said NEC, which started economic cooperation
with China 25 years ago, will further its cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Sekimoto, who was elected chairman of the China Committee
affiliated with Japan's largest economic organization Keidanren in
May, said his committee's main task is to promote Japanese
companies' cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business circles will actively cooperate with China in
the fields of state-run enterprises' reform, environmental
protection, energy exploitation and infrastructure construction,
he said.
</P>
<P>
They will also support China in its efforts to enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Sekimoto added.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition opened here
today to celebrate China's resumption of its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Through about 150 photos, the show depicts the history of Hong
Kong, the evolution of the Hong Kong question, efforts by the
Chinese government to recover Hong Kong and a bright future for
the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony at the Philippine National
Library, Guan Dengming, Chinese ambassador to the Philippines,
said the show was organized to "enable our Filipino friends to
have a better understanding about Hong Kong's history, present
situation and its beautiful future."
</P>
<P>
"After resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,"
Guan said, "the Chinese government will strictly abide by the
Basic Law of Hong Kong and genuinely practice the principles of
'one country, two systems', Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong
and a 'high degree of autonomy' so as to ensure long lasting
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The 10-day exhibition, entitled "A Brighter Future for Hong
Kong," was sponsored by the Chinese embassy in cooperation with

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Has Positive Effect On Cross-Strait Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At a symposium held by the Taiwan
Studies Society today, experts on the Taiwan question said that
the return of Hong Kong will have a positive influence on
relations across the Taiwan Strait and will improve possibilities
for the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, vice-president and secretary general of the
society, said that the "one country, two systems" principle not
only will provide an example for resolving the Taiwan issue, but
also have a strong effect on forces advocating "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
The international community will realize how strongly the
Chinese government feels about the sovereignty issue, he said, and
the return of Hong Kong is certain to become a force for the
peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiashu, a professor at People's University in Beijing,
and Wang Hui, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, analysed the effects of Hong Kong's return
on cross-strait relations, noting that because Hong Kong and
Taiwan maintain close economic ties, the return will certainly
increase development of cross-strait economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "national reunification program" of the Taiwan
authorities has collapsed of itself, and direct mail, commercial,
and transport links across the strait are expected to increase,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, secretary general of the Association for Shipping
Exchanges Across the Taiwan Strait, said the smooth resolution of
the shipping issue between Hong Kong and Taiwan has resulted in
better conditions for direct shipping across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that after 1997, cooperation between Hong
Kong and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will have good
prospects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Calls for Better Yellow River Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun, speaking at a meeting in Beijing today on a Yellow River
Control and Development Program, called for a better job in
harnessing the river.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told those present at the meeting that the Yellow River
is the cradle of Chinese civilization and has a strategically
important role in the modernization drive. In the past 50 years,
he said, there have been outstanding achievements in harnessing
and developing the river. This in turn has made a great
contribution to China's modernization drive, production, and
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out that control and development efforts have
fallen behind the demands of national economic growth and social
improvements. Severe droughts, wind, sand, and soil erosion along
the middle and upper reaches, in addition to silting, bursting
dykes, and a lack of water sources along the lower reaches have
all come together to pose great threats to local economic
development and people's lives, he added.
</P>
<P>
A special effort must be made, Jiang noted, to preserve water
and soil, restore vegetation, and improve the eco-system along the
middle and upper reaches, and to reinforce dykes and dams, dredge
waterways, and increase flood-relief measures along the lower
reaches.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the work to bring the river under control must
be done in accordance with natural and economic laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has prepared a
document on Cyprus issue to be presented at the Cypriot
bi-communal direct talks next month.
</P>
<P>
The document will be presented by the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's Special Representative for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, to
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash at the U.N.-sponsored direct talks.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by government spokesman, Manolis
Christofides, who announced some details about the program of the
talks, to take place between July 9 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Christofides told reporters after a cabinet meeting today that
the talks will be held at Troutbeck, Dutchess County, near Amenia
town, north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, U.N. Secretary-General Annan will host a dinner for
Clerides and Denktash, and the representatives of the three
guarantor powers namely Britain, Greece and Turkey, and the
special representatives for Cyprus of Canada, the U.S., Finland,
Germany, Russia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Also participating will be China and France and the
representatives of the presidency of the European Union and the
European Commission. Italy and Norway will also be invited to send
a representative to the dinner, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The talks will open with a special ceremony on July 9 with a
statement by the U.N. Chief Annan in the presence of all those who
attended the dinner on the eve of the talks.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, there will be a meeting between Clerides and

and Turkish Cypriot communities with a U.N. document, the
contents of which was not revealed yet.
</P>
<P>
The program for the remaining days, Christofides said, will be
decided on site.
</P>
<P>
Access to the site of the talks will be restricted but
President Clerides and Denktash will be able to consult their
advisors and confer with them outside the location where the
talks will take place, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming U.N.-sponsored Cypriot bi-communal talks are
aimed at hammering out a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus
problem, which has remained unresolved since 1974 when the island
was divided after the Turkish troops occupied its northern third
in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash had two informal meetings in Nicosia
under the U.N. auspices, in October 1994, which ended in a
deadlock. They have not met ever since.

<HEADLINE> New Regulations on Chinese Citizens Travelling Abroad (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseas travel is the natural outgrowth of China's reforms and
opening-up, and an indication of the improving standard of living
and cultural interest, and an index of the country's political
stability, economic prosperity, and social development, He noted.
</P>
<P>
China, however, is a developing country, with a low per capita
gross national product, and more than 50 million people living
below the poverty line, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent a drain on foreign currency, and to give
priority to national interests, the overseas travel business
should be developed in a controled way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, there has been a growing demand by Chinese
citizens to travel abroad even though number of travelers,
compared with the total population, is still quite small, the
total number is already large.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number of Chinese going abroad was more than five
million, making China one of the top sources of tourists in Asia,
and the number of tourists, including those going to Hong Kong and
Macao, was 1.64 million.
</P>
<P>
Although this number is not very large, it is growing quite
rapidly, he said, noting that the new regulations are significant
for establishing a basic system for travel abroad by Chinese
citizens, for providing proper management, and for protecting
national interests and the interests of tourists.

<HEADLINE> German Budget Deficit Hits New Record, Claims Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's budget deficit hit a new
record of 53.4 billion marks (31 billion U.S. dollars) by the end
of May, Bonn's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
claimed here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SPD parliamentary leader Rudolf Scharping confirmed
today that his party would file a lawsuit against the government's
1996 budgetary policy at the country's highest court, the Federal
Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
The SPD claims the government has violated the constitution by
running up a new debt higher than the total investment in the 1996
budget.
</P>
<P>
Germany had 78.3 billion marks (45.5 billion dollars) in new
debt in 1996, higher than the total investment of 61 billion marks
(35.5 billion dollars)
</P>
<P>
The new development dramatized Germany's financial plight which
has already put a heavy strain on Bonn's attempt to meet the
budgetary and fiscal requirements for joining the planned single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
SPD budget expert Karl Diller said government budget deficit in
the first five months of 1997 had already exceeded the total
new debt approved for the whole year -- 53.3 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The SPD estimates the government will face a total budget
shortfall of about 30 billion marks (17.4 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To plug the huge budget hole, Bonn is planning to sell state
assets including its holdings in telecoms giant, Deutsche
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
The German government has also announced that it will submit a
supplementary budget to parliament asking for a higher level of
new debt for 1997.

<P>
LISBON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
said here today that Hong Kong's smooth transition will have a
positive influence on Macao.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Sampaio said Hong Kong's
continuing stability and prosperity after the July 1 handover will
be an encouragement for Macao before its own return to China in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was optimistic about Hong Kong's future and
believed the efforts China and Britain made for Hong Kong's smooth
transition will pay off.
</P>

The Portuguese president added that Hong Kong's return to China
is an event of global significance and the whole world will be
watching with great interest.

<P>
He praised the "one country, two systems" concept initiated by
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, saying it is a pragmatic

He said China and Portugal have both committed themselves to a
smooth transition of Macao and to handling the transfer of power

<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting in
Beijing this afternoon with Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov, said he hopes that China and Russia can jointly
push forward the continuous development of bilateral
good-neighborly friendship.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming Nemtsov on his first visit to China, Li mentioned
the good talks he had with Vice-Premier Li Lanqing Tuesday and the
discussions of key cooperative projects of common concern and the
progress during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he is looking forward to meeting with Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and that he believes the meeting
will have exciting results.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China attaches great importance to its
good-neighborly friendship with Russia, and that he hopes their
border will be a friendly one.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the Sino-Russian strategic and cooperative
partnership is substantial and that the major task the two sides
now face is concentrating on expanding the sphere of cooperation
and to implement the agreements reached by the two sides as a
basis of exploring new cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have established a mechanism for regular
meetings by prime ministers, Li said, and the most important thing
now is to improve the sub-committees' work to let them prepare
fully.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said that China will soon resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, a historical event of international
significance and one worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the development of Russian-Chinese
relations, and said that bilateral cooperation is developing in
various ways, but noted that the current bilateral trade volume is
no more than seven billion US dollars, which is not a match for
the two countries' status and potential.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia has a positive attitude towards
cooperation with China in petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy
and hydropower, and hopes that cooperation can have good results.
</P>
<P>
Li said that there are very good prospects for Sino-Russian
cooperation, and that Nemtsov, as the new chairman of the
committee for regular meetings and the sub-committee on bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, will make his own contribution to
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Jardine Matheson Shows Confidence in HK Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua this week, Chairman of Jardine
Matheson (China) Ltd. Martin G. Barrow said: "We continue to have
confidence in Hong Kong as an international business center and we
will continue to invest here."
</P>
<P>
He said Jardine Group is the largest business employer in Hong
Kong, with a staff of some 60,000 working in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 99 percent of our staff are the Chinese among the Hong
Kong residents. I think our staff are very positive about the
future prospects of Hong Kong," he said, adding that the company
has asked the staff from overseas to learn Putonghua (or standard
Chinese) so that they will be ale to better adapt to Hong Kong as
a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
"When we give them a letter of appointment, it says that they
must learn the Chinese (language)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Jardine Matheson Group has a very long-standing
involvement in Hong Kong and the interior area and is still very
much committed to development of its business in Hong Kong and
China's interior area.
</P>
<P>
Jardine has been active since the start of China's opening-up
policy in the late 1970s. It first invested in one of the
country's first foreign-funded enterprise in China in 1980 --
Beijing Air Catering Co. at Beijing Airport, and also in one of
the first industrial joint ventures, namely, Schindler Elevator
works both in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased to participate in the very first
ventures," he said. "Since then we have entered into many business
fields in China, meanwhile we continue to increase our business in
Hong Kong itself."
</P>
<P>
So far, Jardine has a presence in some 30 cities across China
from the northeastern city of Dalian to Haikou in central China,
representing a very broad range of activities. With China's
opening up of the service sector, particularly over the last five
years, Jardine has expanded its business area largely in the
interior area.
</P>
<P>
"We made many new investments in Hong Kong and China's interior
in the last few years," he said. "We have continued to buy other
companies in Hong Kong, we continue to make new investment here in
infrastructure, such as the transportation field, the new airport,
container operations, high technology and the property market. We
also have hotels and merchant banking in Hong Kong."

<P>
He noted that it is important to keep Hong Kong competitive, it
is important to preserve the strong features of Hong Kong, to
preserve the rule of law, and to preserve Hong Kong as a
corrupt-free society.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, a level playing field is very important for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Hong Kong's economy must be kept in good
competitive shape in trade, investment, tourism and many other
different aspects. "I'm sure Hong Kong's role as a gateway to
China as well as a gateway for East Asia can continue."
</P>
<P>
It is very welcome to the business community that the principal
officials remain to serve the SAR, he said, pointing out that Tung
Chee Hwa has a very strong team around him, not only the principal
officials but also the Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, it's very much business as usual.
The business strategy, the whole emphasis about the handover for
Hong Kong is continuity, and I believe that continuity not to
change is the key," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Jardine's withdrawal from Hong Kong's stock
market in 1994, he cited it as a very technical issue relating to
corporate regulation, and that is not the important point.
</P>
<P>
"The important point is where our business is," he said. "Ten
years ago Jardine had 30,000 staff members in Hong Kong, today the
number has more than doubled, that demonstrates our involvement
and commitment in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have confidence in Hong Kong, we would not have so
many people and buildings here. Hong Kong is really the heart of
Jardine's activities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Tourism Industry Ushers in New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Every tourist to Hong Kong on
July 1 or after will receive a certificate from the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA), which certifies that he or she
"visited Hong Kong in 1997 and witnessed the historic moment of
Hong Kong's transfer of power."
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to China is a grand historical event
that will bring the world's attention to Hong Kong to an
unprecedented height," Kent Hayden Sadler,
deputy-executive-director of the HKTA, said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA is hoping to seize the opportunity, attract more
tourists to Hong Kong and help the local tourism industry scale a
new height, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, tourism is the most lucrative sector in Hong Kong
in terms of foreign exchange earnings. In 1996, the Hong Kong
tourism industry earned a record 104.8 billion HK dollars from a
record 11.47 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that because of the handover factor, these two
records are likely to be broken this year.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA recently announced that in the 100 days between July 1
and October 8 this year, it would stage a major tourism-promotion
event "100 Wonders of Hong Kong", which would give tourists from
all over the world a chance to visit Hong Kong immediately after
the handover and witness history together with local residents.
</P>
<P>
During that period, visitors to Hong Kong will be able to
participate in a number of special activities and programs, while
enjoying a series of preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
"This is only one of the measures Hong Kong will take to
develop its tourism industry beyond 1997," said Sadler.
</P>
<P>
Other measures of the HKTA will include organizing a series of
grand events between 1997 and 2001, setting up a representative
office in Beijing, and cooperating with the tourism sector in
China's interior areas in carrying out tourism promotions
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will also encourage investment in developing theme parks,
movie cities, and water sports centers in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the next five years, the number of
visitors to Hong Kong will increase at an annual rate of more than
five percent, and will reach 18 million by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"A new era will begin for the tourism industry of Hong Kong,"
he said.

<P>
The regulations state the extent of operations and standards of
tourism departments and public security and their
responsibilities, and the responsibilities, obligations, and
rights of the travelers going abroad. They also state the
responsiblities and obligations of international travel agencies
that are approved for overseas travel, and penalties for
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director-general of CNTA, said that the National
Tourism Administration will check the travel agencies for approval
in accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Travel
Agencies and by examining the performance of the travel
agencies. The number of these travel agencies will soon climb to
67 from the current 9.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are now only four approved destinations for
travel abroad: Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"But CNTA will propose more destinations with the ministries of
Foreign Affairs and Public Security, and apply for approval by the
State Council," he said, pointing out that management principles
for overseas travel are meant to develop it in an organized,
planned, and controled manner.

<HEADLINE> HK Welcomes U.S. Renewal of China MFN Trading Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Denise Yue, secretary for Trade
and Industry of the Hong Kong government, today welcomed the U.S.
House of Representatives' vote for the renewal of China's Most
Favored Nation (MFN) trading status this year.
</P>
<P>
Yue said, " We are very pleased with the result. The renewal
of China's MFN status always matters greatly to Hong Kong, but it
has never mattered more than this year when Hong Kong will embark
on a new chapter in its history in less than a week's time."
</P>
<P>
She said that the renewal of China's MFN status goes a long way
to ensure the continued economic vibrancy of Hong Kong during the
handover period.
</P>
<P>
She noted that economic strength is vitally important as Hong
Kong settles into the new relationship of being a Special
Administrative Region of China, enjoying a high degree of autonomy
in its government, legal system, civil service and trade and
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
With the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status, American
companies will continue to find Hong Kong a good place to do
business in Asia, she added.
</P>
<P>
On June 24, the House of Representatives of the United States
rejected an attempt to disapprove the President's decision to
extend China's MFN status for another year.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Foreign Trade in Huge Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A vast trade gap was
experienced in the last four years between Zanzibar and its
principal trading partners, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The trade gap widened by 207 percent in favour of the latter
between 1993 and 1996, an official of the Zanzibar statistical
Bureau told reporters in the town of Zanzibar recently. The
official said the trade gap brought the deficit to widen from
16,498.7 million Tanzania Shillings (about 27.49 million US
Dollars) to 49,734.58 million T.Shs. (about 82.89 million US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau's statistics, about 10,150.59 million
T.Shs. (about 16.9 million US Dollas) was earned in exports as
commpared to 152,725 million T.Shs. (about 254.5 million US
Dollars) used in imports by the Isles during the period, with
imports of industrial commodities taking the lion's share of
total import expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Imports of industrial commodities went up to 65,679.25 million
T.Shs. (about 109.5 million US Dollars). Equipment for
transportation, medicine, machinery and electricity, as well as
foods and drinks also used large amounts of money. Just a small
portion of import expenditure was allocated for imports of raw
materials, animals and vegetable oils, and in importing petroleum
oil.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has used more money in imports of consumer goods as
compared to inputs during the period, it was indicated. No
exports of industrial goods were made during the period despite
adopting export processing campaigns since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that traditional products have remained
the only source of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Cloves have remained the major export commoditity, but money
realised from exports declined from 1,257.01 million T.Shs.
(about 2.09 million US Dollars) in 1992 to 883.90 million T.Shs.
(about 1.47 million US Dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, cloves have been fetching about 50 percent of foreign
currency earnings, followed by sea weeds. Its export increased by
more than 50 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
Copra, clove oil, centipede, makonyo oil and few other
traditional crops have remained a major contributor in exports,
the statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> Feature: T-shirts Add Emotional Touch to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With Hong Kong's
handover only 120 hours away, Roger Y.K. Ngan, a Hong Kong Chinese
doing business in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria, found
himself having much to hope for, and of course, much to
commemorate.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, I must do something for my motherland," said Ngan,
who decided to contribute 100 pieces of specially-designed
T-shirts to the gala of July 1 when the handover takes place.
</P>
<P>
"As all the Chinese living in the city dance out the last hours
of over 150 years of colonial rule by the British over Hong Kong
at the midnight party on June 30," Ngan said, "each of us will
sport this commemorative sweater."
</P>
<P>
To him, as well as many Chinese, the white garment, with "97"
and the emblem of the HK Special Administrative Region stitched in
red and green silk thread, is more than merely another show of
business savvy.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this could be an appropriate expression of my gratitude
and happiness," he said, while making a final check of a sample
that just rolled off the sewing machine.
</P>
<P>
Ngan, a 48-year-old Hong Kong Chinese, is a self-made success
in the ultra-competitive ready-wear empire. His 30 years of
acumen earned him bountiful shares in many projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
His latest investment is a multi-million dollar HK-Egyptian
textile firm inside Alexandria's free trade zone. A producer of
modest casual wears, trousers and pyjamas, the eight-month-old
factory has already set an eye on the European and U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Ngan will distribute the smart T-shirts to the invitees to the
banquet to be held in the Chinese General Consulate in Alexandria
marking China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"When that historic moment arrives, there should be no regret,
no anxiety but only hope for a better future," the placid and mild
Hong Kong native got rather emotional when talking of the future
of his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
"I expect life and business as usual. Nothing much to change.
Of course, except changes for the better. I am very optimistic
what is good will be carried on into the new era."
</P>
<P>
"People should have nothing to worry about. All the indicators
show business is strong," he added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the handover would bring an immediate benefit to his
eight-month-old, 2,000-square-meter factory that still experiences
teething pains, according to the board director of the HK-based
Great Eastern Textiles Co..
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to China, cotton, textile materials and
machines needed by his workshop will be more convenient to be
shipped from China's inner areas at lower costs.

ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, June 25 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
"By then we can expect a big improvement," said Ngan, who
supervises the 310-strong, export-oriented joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Ngan has been shuttling between the Mideast, Hong
Kong and other southern Chinese regions that interest him. In his
opinion, the gap between Hong Kong and the rest of China,
especially the more affluent southern provinces, is simply
omissible now.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Great Eastern Textiles set up a garment
factory jointly with the Chinese Triumph Group in the eastern
province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
"The disparity between Hong Kong and its neighboring areas is
diminishing thanks to ever-expanding cooperation and rapid
development of those regions," said Ngan, reflecting on his
transactions with his business partners there.
</P>
<P>
In a more festive mood, his 11 Chinese office employees are
working against time to rehearse for their choral presentation at
the midnight jubilee on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the jubilation over the much-anticipated British
departure, private parties, official celebrations are being held
in Alexandria and Cairo, the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
The energetic Ngan plans a family party in his Hong Kong
residence on July 2. In order to be at home on time, he will have
to catch the earliest flight after leaving the midnight party in
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
But for Ma Shiyuan, a permanent resident of Cairo, celebrations
will be a pure family affair.
</P>
<P>
"My whole family on that night will be right in front of the
TV for the live coverage of the handover ceremony and the sworn-in
of the new administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am overjoyed that the days of indignity are bygones with the
departure of the British," said Ma, the ethnic Chinese
sexagenarian, who has established himself in Egypt since leaving
his hometown 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the excitement over the highly-publicized event is not
confined to the overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Mohab F. Akhnoukh, managing director of the Great Eastern
Textiles, has booked an expensive trip to Hong Kong on June
29-July 6 to be an eyewitness to the grand event.
</P>
<P>
Even if he risks a rip-off as the cost of the eight-day stay in
a comfortable hotel has rocketed to 23,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to see Hong Kong at the moment when history and
future shake hands," said Akhnoukh, a well-groomed Egyptian in his
early 30s, fresh from an eight-year higher education in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big occasion for my Chinese colleagues and so a very
important one for me. I've got a lot to learn from them," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It will be Akhnoukh's first trip to China since he took over
family business from his father who has interests in Great
Eastern's operations in China.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Trade Falls, Afrexim Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa's internal and external
trade recorded a decline last year due to weaker external demand
and high tariff and non-tariff barriers, a banker said on Tuesday
in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Africa export and import (AFREXIM) bank president Christopher
Edordu said the total African trade fell by about two percent to
235 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that intra-African trade declined by five percent to
20.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fall in exports has been attributed to low demand and
reduced commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
"Imports fell significantly as a result of protective measures
in the form of higher tariff and non-tariff barries which stood
at an average of over 27 percent," said Edordu.
</P>
<P>
He said the tariff level in Africa was higher than recorded in
industrial countries as well as in newly industrialising
countries of south-east Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the decline in African trade could have been worse had
it not been for significant increases in export volumes which
moderated the effect of lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw Africa's trade as a proportion of global
trade decline to 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Edordu said despite the weak export and trade
institutions which characterised the environment last year,
overall economic conditions were relatively favourable.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Interview With Russian Ambassador To China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Ambassador to China Igor
Rogachev, who was interviewed by Xinhua, said that the frequent
exchange of visits by Russian and Chinese leaders in recent years
have increased the mutual trust and understanding and that
relations are moving smoothly towards the goal of establishing a
strategic partnership oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will start his China visit
on June 26 and Russia and China will sign the 1997-2000 trade
agreement and nearly 10 other agreements and memoranda to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in energy and transportation
during that visit, Rogachev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China have signed about 150 collaboration
agreements, he noted, and the healthy development of
Russian-Chinese ties is one that has seldom been seen between big
powers in today's world. The border agreement signed by Russia,
China and three other Central-Asian countries last year was also
an example for resolving border issues around the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Chinese economic and trade ties are improving too,
Rogachev continued, saying that bilateral trade volume last year
was 25 percent more than the previous year. The two sides have
used more modern trade methods instead of the traditional barter
trade, he said, and Russia will continue to push for collaboration
between major companies.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that cultural exchanges between Russia and
China have also increased and that many artists and musicians have
visited each other since last year and Russia is planning to hold
a China art festival in Moscow this fall so that the Russian
people can get to understand China better.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Produce Low Earth Orbit Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The construction of an Australian
low earth orbit satellite is expected to start before the end of
this year, Australian Science and Technology Minister Peter
McGauran said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 400 kg ARIES-1 (Australian Resource Information and
Environment Satellite) is planned for launch in 2000 and will be
the world's first commercially sustainable resources information
satellite, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's most ambitious space project has moved a step
closer to reality with the completion of a 900,000 US dollar
feasibility study on the satellite, McGauran said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The study, jointly sponsored by the Australian government and a
high profile consortium of local and international industry
groups, confirmed the commercial and technical feasibility of the
satellite.
</P>
<P>
"It will dramatically improve on the existing capabilities for
geological mapping, environmental monitoring and land use
assessment for agriculture, forestry and defense applications
world-wide," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will monitor the globe on a regular basis to
assess the extent and condition of crops and forests and to map
land degradation, such as overgrazing and salinity.
</P>
<P>
"It will be capable of differentiating between various minerals
in rocks and soils, even through moderate vegetation cover. In
addition, it will be able to detect various vegetation species and
a range of environment indicators," the minister said.

other industries, and speeding up capital accumulation to improve
infrastructure, by developing short-term but high-efficient
projects, such as the light industry, Zou said.

<HEADLINE> Bus Only Lane in Beijing Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A special lane for buses on one of
Beijing's busiest streets, Chang'an Avenue, opened today as the
first in the Chinese capital, in a move to solve the city's
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
The special lane is the far right-hand lane and is marked with
a double broken-yellow line. Only buses and mini-buses approved by
the police can use the lane. Traffic authorities say the lane will
help increase buses' speed and encourage more people to ride them.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's roads can not keep up with the increasing number of
motor vehicles. In 1993, there were 27 areas in the city that were
frequently jammed, but now there are 99, and every day, there are
more than 50 traffic jams just on the main streets.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an Avenue running east-to-west across the heart of
Beijing is a major street for public transportation. There are
more than 1,000 buses and some 150 mini-buses traveling on it
daily, moving more than 340,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"Now it takes only 50 minutes to drive the whole route," said a
conductor of a No.1 bus on the avenue. Previously, however, the
bus needed more than an hour, or even two during traffic jams.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration FMs Meeting Opens in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAKAKIA, SYRIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of foreign
ministers of the Damascus Declaration states opened here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the foreign ministers will
discuss issues including the deadlocked Middle East peace process,
the Arab strategy towards Israel's intransigence in executing
U.N. Security Council resolutions, Israeli-Turkish military and
security alliance and its negative effects on both Arab security
and regional security.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will also study a working paper on
setting up an Arab economic community, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Damascus declaration was signed in March 1991
among Egypt, Syria and six GCC countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the aftermath
of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to the original document, Egypt and Syria were to
provide up to 100,000 troops to be based in the Gulf to safeguard
the oil-rich states from future threats. In exchange, the Gulf
states were to earmark up to 15 billion U.S. dollars for
development projects in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the military pact faltered quickly under opposition from
Iran and Turkey. And since then Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar have
signed security agreements with the United States and other
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara stressed the importance of holding the meeting under the
three challenges, the deadlock in the Middle East peace process
because of Israel's intransigent policy, the Turkish-Israeli
alliance and the fact that Arab states are in urgent need of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February 1996 generated fear in Middle East countries that Turkey
was aligning itself with the Jewish state against Syria and other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara criticized the U.S. for its participation in the
Turkish-Israeli naval maneuvers recently conducted in the
Mediterranean Sea, ignoring the fact that Israel adopts a policy
that rejects the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Foreign Minister underlined the necessity of
boosting Arab solidarity to achieve a fair and overall peace in
the region, voicing support of Arab states for the Palestinian
people to obtain their legitimate rights, including
self-determination and establishing an independent state.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Return of HK to China, Step in Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said today that "the return of Hong Kong (to China) is a
step in the right direction and a model for other nations to reach
agreements on thorny issues through negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister made the remarks here during an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems", put forward by the
late senior Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping, will certainly reunite
the Chinese nation despite different economic systems, Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan believes in "one China" and hopes that all the
Chinese territories will return to the motherland in the same
manner as Hong Kong and Macao," said the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China is a great event in the
history of development of the Chinese nation, said Sharif, adding
that "we are happy and congratulate the Chinese nation on the
impending return of Hong Kong  on June 30 (at midnight), 1997 to
be followed two years later by the return of Macao."
</P>
<P>
In answering a question about the prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong after its return to China, the Prime Minister said, "we
believe that Hong Kong will continue to prosper and remain stable
after its return to the motherland. Hong Kong will continue to
enjoy the position of international financial and trade center."
</P>
<P>
"The fast growth of the Chinese economy would contribute to
enhancing further the current status of Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the peaceful return of Hong Kong to its
motherland under the pattern of "one country, two systems" is a
good model for other nations to emulate."
</P>
<P>
To a question about Pakistan's current trade with Hong Kong and
ideas of furthering the economic and trade ties with the region,
the Prime Minister said, "Pakistan and Hong Kong have
traditionally enjoyed very sound trading relations. Hong Kong has
emerged as the second most important export market for Pakistan
after the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's exports to Hong Kong rose by more than 50 percent
during the last financial year," the Prime Minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister expressed his belief that "with the
burgeoning Chinese economy backing Hong Kong, Pakistan-Hong Kong
trade and economic relations will receive a further fillip in the
years ahead."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the latest round of foreign secretary-level talks
between Pakistan and India, Sharif said he is satisfied with the
result. "it is a positive sign," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister expressed his belief that with the
"political will and sincerity", all outstanding issues between
Pakistan and India will be solved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the Prime Minister spoke highly of the
achievements made by China in the construction of its national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that he has visited China several times both as
prime minister and leader of the opposition, and witnessed for
himself the fast economic progress made by China in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Introduce Bilingual Legal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This will help to steer Hong Kong in the direction towards a
more democratic society of rule of law, said Tony Yen Yuen-ho, a
law draftsman of the Legal Department.
</P>
<P>
He said, "English has served as the legal language in Hong Kong
for more than 100 years."
</P>
<P>
However, in Hong Kong, primarily a Chinese community where
most citizens do not have a good knowledge of English, a legal
system with English as the legal language lacks transparency and
is sometimes "unfair".
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong society opening wider, he noted, if the legal
linguistic status of the Chinese language is still subordinate to
English, it will be detrimental to judicial practices and the
maintenance of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
However, as English is the language for the establishment of
the existing legal system of Hong Kong, as well as an
international commercial language, it is imperative to refer to
the common law system of Hong Kong from legal cases and legal
documents of other regions where common law is practiced.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, necessary to continue to use English in
formulating and enforcing laws, the law expert noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong began to use both English and Chinese to formulate
laws in 1986. In 1989, the first bilingual law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the translation into Chinese of the
previously-formulated 530 laws was finished in April this year.
</P>
<P>
In fact, basic courts in Hong Kong began to use Chinese long
time ago. Now some intermediate courts have also begun to do so.
</P>
<P>
According to Yen, owing to technical problems, the bilingual
legal system should be practiced step by step.
</P>
<P>
He urged judges, lawyers and legal scholars to use Chinese as
much as possible in their work.

<HEADLINE> PKK Kills 3 Turkish Soldiers in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Turkish soldiers were killed
and four others wounded late Tuesday night in an armed attack by
rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that a
group of the PKK militants raided a petrol pumping station in
Raman region of Batman province in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers have been hospitalized, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Turkish security forces started large-scale
military operations in a bid to capture the PKK rebels who
escaped from the scene in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been staging armed attacks against the Turkish
soldiers in southeastern Turkey since the Turkish military
launched its cross-border operations in pursuit of the PKK rebels
in northern Iraq on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's massive military campaign followed a request for aid
by Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to sweep the PKK
members out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has said that at least 2,500 PKK
militants have been killed in the attack, which was accused by
many as an incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war, which has claimed
over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern Turkey since August
1984.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registration Re-Extended in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission of Kenya
has extended voter registration for another six days starting
from today till Monday with more than seven million Kenyans
having registered.
</P>
<P>
Z. Chesoni, the chairman of the commission, said in a
statement Tuesday evening that the decision came in the wave of
appeals for more time from all corners of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,241,582 voters had registered up to June 22,
excluding returns from seven constituencies which have not been
received, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission believes the Monday and Tuesday, June 23 and
24, figures will lift the total to over eight million registered
voters at June 24," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he had witnessed crowds of would-be voters waiting to
register at the registration centers and also considered the need
to give an opportunity to patients admitted to hospitals to
register as voters.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen outside the registration centers in
eight constituencies in Nairobi in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there was a mad rush for voter
registration countrywide once again to beat the Tuesday deadline.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the commission extends the deadline.
The first was from June 22 to 24. The registration started on May
19.
</P>
<P>
The commission originally expected there would be about 10
million registered voters around the eastern African country by
the end of the registration.
</P>
<P>
However, only seven million Kenyans registered as voters
before the last general election in 1992.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Development of "Mega-forestry" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader in China's highest
legislature today urged that closer attention be paid to the
development of the forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
The call from Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of National People's Congress (NPC), was made at a
meeting on the inspection of law enforcement for forests. Wang
said that forestry plays an important role in China's national
economy, social and environmental development, and he urged
development in the sector under the concept of " mega-forestry".
</P>
<P>
"Forestry is not only the production of timber and conservation
-- its influence can be felt in many areas including the economy,
society, ecology and natural resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three groups were sent by the NPC Standing Committee to
Jiangxi, Fujian and Yunnan provinces last April to check up on
forest law enforcements. They visited timber production areas,
nature reserves, afforestation areas, forest parks and gardens,
markets, enterprises and individual farmers.
</P>
<P>
Wang spoke highly of the achievements local governments have
made in implementing the Forestry Law. In Fujian and Jiangxi, all
waste hilly land has been planted with trees and grass. Forest
coverage rate in the two provinces has increased to 57 percent and
52 percent respectively, far in excess of the national average,
13.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan, a total 87 nature reserves for the protection of
trees and wildlife have been established. They form part of a
national network which protects 67.5 percent of the country's
plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, there are still problems involving the
illegal use of forests, particularly by cutting and selling its
timber.
</P>
<P>
Wang warned that the country's financial spending on forestry
was far from enough.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the legal system to provide more legislation
to protect the rights and interests of forest growers and
managers.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Be Much Cleaner in Future: Environmental Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Leung Po-Wing, secretary for
Planning, environment and lands, expressed his full confidence in
Hong Kong's future environment, which, he noted, will be much
cleaner and better still.
</P>
<P>
"We have made Hong Kong cleaner after years of strenuous
effort," he said at a news briefing held at the Hong Kong
Exhibition and Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
On air pollution control, he explained, the government has
divided Hong Kong into 10 atmospheric control zones, with each
having set its qualitative goal.
</P>
<P>
Satisfactory results have been attained by imposing limits on
the use of solid and liquid fuel to reduce the sulphur contents of
fuel in use in factories, spreading the use of lead-free gas and
catalytic devices and banning the use of fluoride which is harmful
to ozonosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the rate of sulphuric contents in the air has lowered
by 80 percent and that of lead by 70 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leung said, traffic noise has been alleviated thanks
to the improvement of designs for architectural structures and
installation of sound-insulation boards and shelter covers and use
of sound-reducing road materials. The government has erected sound
insulation boards with a total length of 6.4 km on some key roads.
And the railway department has invested 100 million US dollars on
projects for reducing traffic pollution.
In addition, some 8,000 classrooms with relatively serious noise
pollution have been equipped with sound-insulation and air
conditioning facilities.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the secretary recalled, Hong Kong
discharged two million tons of sewage and 100,000 tons of liquid
chemical wastes into the Victoria Harbor each year. Half of the
sewage wastes was untreated before being discharged into the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of heavily-polluted water has dropped
from 25 percent in 1989 to the present 10 percent whereas the rate
of fine-quality water has risen from 18 percent to 38 percent,
said Leung, who is to take the same job in the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) upon its
establishment on July 1.
</P>
<P>
On future development, he said, Hong Kong is formulating an
overall plan based on environmental evaluation and will add three
garbage-filling grounds.
</P>
<P>
To date, a sewage disposal works has gone into operation on the
stonecutter Island, and it is now able to treat 25 percent of the
sewage in the western part of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a deep-sea tunnel is being built at the Victoria
Harbor to collect the sewage wastes at sea, which will be moved to
the Stonecutter Island for disposal.
</P>
<P>
Upon the completion of the tunnel in 1999, 70 percent of the
liquid wastes will have treated before its discharge into the
Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
New technology has offered new channels for environment
protection. Hong Kong's main objective is to work for a sustained
development while maintaining high standards in its environmental
Protection, Leung said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Cites Role of Higher Education in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today underscored the crucial importance of higher education and
research in reducing poverty and improving human resources in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized this point during the closing ceremony
of the World Congress on Higher Education and Human Resources
Development in the Asia-Pacific held in Manila.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries face the dual challenges of improving
their human resources and reducing poverty levels. In this
context, higher education and research are seen as extremely
important factors in development policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos noted that the need for higher education and human
resources development had also been addressed by the leaders of
the 18 member economies during the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation meetings held in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
"At that historic gathering, the leaders renewed their
commitment to enriching the lives and to improving the standards
of living of all citizens in the Asia pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia Pacific region, governments have supported the
closer integration of education, research and development, and
information technology strategies with the requirements of a
globalizing economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the part of the Philippines, the President said that
turning the country into an education and knowledge center in the
region is a pivotal goal of his administration.
</P>
<P>
The government will set specific objectives to promote a
culture of creativity, productivity and excellence through higher
education and give priority to human resources development by
accelerating economic and social development in the country, Ramos
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Turns to Import for Fuel Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has concluded arrangements
to import refined oil from Cote d'Ivoire to ease the acute fuel
scarcity that has trapped the country in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
The development follows an order of the head of state, General
Sani Abacha Monday to end the fuel crisis in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Local media said it is ironic for Nigeria to import fuel from
Cote d'Ivoire, for the latter gets the bulk of its crude oil from
Nigeria and has only one privately-owned refinery, whereas
Nigeria has four state-owned ones.
</P>
<P>
Report also said that Nigeria has contacted Ghana for fuel
import, though it is doubtful that Ghana has got additional fuel
to export, as it also has only one refinery, with a daily
capacity of 100,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the world's No.6 largest crude oil producer, has been
suffering from periodic fuel scarcity in the last few years, due
to its illing refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
The latest fuel scarcity, starting from late January and with
a short period of limit about one months ago, has become a
nationwide crisis with paralyzing effect on people's life and the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
It also led to hot criticism of the oil minister, Dan Etete,
from the finance minister, Anthony Ani and other senior
government officials, last week.
</P>
<P>
In the heat of the crisis, the head of state interfered on
Monday at the Council of State meeting, ordering immediate import
to end the crisis and a rescue to the refineries for a lasting
solution.

<HEADLINE> Album Bearing 10,000 Autographs to Be Sent to HK From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, U.S., June 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese
children living with their parents in the United States have found
a way to convey their congratulations for Hong Kong's return to
China.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 children and their parents and grandparents
have signed their autographs on loose-leaf papers over the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
The children are students of some 80 Chinese schools across the
country, where classes of Chinese language are offered after
school or during weekends. In the past few weeks, lectures on Hong
Kong's history and geography were given, and oratorical contests
on Hong Kong were organized in these schools.
</P>
<P>
Now all the autographs have been gathered in Columbus, Ohio,
where the Chinese School Association in the United States (CSAUS)
is headquartered. They were finally bound into a big album which
also includes the photos of many signers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a huge Chinese national flag, 15 meters long and 7
meters wide, has been made in Los Angeles and ready for shipment.
</P>
<P>
In a few days a delegation led by CSAUS president Jim J. Wang
will take the flag and album to Hong Kong, where a ceremony of
handing over the gifts is scheduled on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that many American children studying in the Chinese
schools also signed their names together with their Chinese
classmates.
</P>
<P>
"The kids, both Chinese and American, have studied the Chinese
characters for a short time so cannot handle them very well," Wand
said. "But their autographs are very beautiful to me."

SHANGHAI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- In a true rekindling of community
spirit in the heart of the city, some notices posted in
residential areas of Shanghai are advertising voluntary services
being offered by ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
And the do-gooders are not few and far between, according to
surveys. Shanghai is believed to have around 720,000 residents who
are willing to give a helping hand to their fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, apparently, come from all sections of
society. There are government officials, workers, businessmen,
teachers and students, children and retirees. And they will do
virtually anything to help a neighbor: clean an apartment, repair
a bike, mind the kids, fix the TV, even advise on legal
matters. What's more, they do it for free.
</P>
<P>
A resident from the Jinyangyuan district said all families
there had taken care of the flowers and trees in neighborhood
gardens, and over 4,000 yuan in donations has been collected to
buy 3,000 more saplings with which to green the area.
</P>
<P>
"Community volunteers are breaking down walls of indifference
lying between urban residents by offering a helping hand," said a

<HEADLINE> Oman Beat Macau in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Oman defeated Macau 2-0 in a Asian
zone Group Four World Cup qualifying match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Oman collected 12 points from four wins against one defeat in
the four-team competition, with their goal differential standing
at 13, far fewer than front-runners Japan at 27.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who had four consecutive wins for 12 points, were
to play Nepal later in the day at the National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Macau suffered a major setback only 12 minutes into the match
when defender Iong Kin-chong was sent out for kicking Mohamed
Khamis Juma Al Araimi from behind.
</P>
<P>
Althought Oman controlled the match for most of the time, they
found their last passes rarely got through the Macau defense with
keeper Domingos Chan stopping most of the balls.
</P>
<P>
Both goals came in the 44th minute into each half.
</P>
<P>
Al Araimi's pass to Ahmed Khamis Humaid Al Mazrooei hit a Macau
defender's foot, returning a good scoring chance to Al Araimi, who
struck into the right corner.
</P>
<P>
Badar Ali Nasser Al Mahrouqi sent a pass from near the right
corner into the area, where Ahmed Ali Hassan fired home for Oman's
second goal.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Predicts Booming in Trade, Commerce With HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade and commerce
with Hong Kong will rise steadily after Hong Kong's return to
China on July 1, said the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, in a report outlining the situation of Hong Kong
after July 1, said the prediction is based on Hong Kong's
uninterrupted economic buoyance, China's promise on the "one
country, two systems" framework and the capital inflow from
adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has decided to maintain existing
trade and commerce policies toward Hong Kong after July 1, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said that China's high economic growth rate would clear the
way for South Korea's increased shipments via Hong Kong, while
direct shipments to Hong Kong will also be bolstered along with a
sharp rise in demand for various facilities and technologies
related to the expansion of infrastructure investments in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are limits to South Korea's bid to invest in Hong Kong's
manufacturing sector because of Hong Kong's narrow market and high
production costs, but South Korea's joint ventures with Hong
Kong's ethnic Chinese is considered a foundation for business
operations in China, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry promised to extend support to help maintain
cooperation with Hong Kong in international organizations,
including Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation after the power
transfer, so as to promote the trade and commerce relations
continuously.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea posted a trade surplus of 10 billion US
dollars with Hong Kong and registered a surplus of 4.334 billion
dollars in the first five months of this year, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Foils Largest Drug Smuggling Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has smashed the largest ever
drug smuggling attempt, confiscating heroin and opium with an
estimated value of 6 million Jordanian dinars (about 8.5 million
U.S. dollars), a police source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 47 kilograms of drugs, including 31 kilograms of
heroin and 16 kilograms of opium, were seized when five suspects
were trying to deliver them to neighboring counties last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Jordan Times today quoted Colonel Nazih
Shreideh, director of the Anti-Narcotics Department (AND) as
saying "This is the largest amount of drug seized in Jordan as
well as in the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
"We received tips from agents in neighboring countries and put
the suspects under surveillance (for 10 days), after they entered
Ramtha border and then arrested them at dawn Saturday while (they
were) attempting to deliver the drugs which came from Turkey," the
police official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the suspects had hid the drugs in the petroleum
tank of a Mercedes 300 car, "which made it hard for border
inspectors to detect it."
</P>
<P>
The official did not disclose the destination of the drugs and
the identity of the five smugglers, only saying that they were
Arab and foreign nationals aged between 30 and 37.
</P>
<P>
The police official said that Jordan is a "defense line"
against the illegal trade since it is geographically situated
between drug producing and drug receiving countries.
</P>
<P>
"We know that most drug dealers use Jordan as a transit point,
but we want them to know that we will not allow any of these
smugglers to use Jordan as a base for drug smuggling." Shreideh
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the department is in constant contact with the
authorities in neighboring countries in a joint effort to combat
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Police statistics indicate that a total of 68 kilograms of
heroin and 43 kilograms of opium were seized in the kingdom last
year.

<HEADLINE> Deregulation, Anti-dumping Top EU-Japan Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The annual European Union-Japan
summit meeting started today in the Dutch capital of the Hague
with Japan's program of deregulation and EU's anti-dumping
measures at top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, European Commission President Jacques Santer and Dutch
Prime Minister and current EU President Wim Kok, is the sixth
since the two sides met for their first summit of this kind in The
Hague in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to put more pressure on Japan to speed up
its three-year deregulation program.
</P>
<P>
European Commission officials said that the latest revision of
the deregulation program, announced by Japan in March, was
"disappointing."
</P>
<P>
Although Japan's revised package covers areas like financial
services, communications, housing, distribution, transport,
energy, labor and education, the commission complained that
overall progress had been limited.
</P>
<P>
The EU is also expected to call on Japan to further its reform,
possibly by launching another far-reaching multi-annual
deregulation program.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Japan will press the EU on its increasing use of
anti-dumping measures against cheap imports, a practice which
Tokyo sees as a veiled protectionism.
</P>
<P>
The summit is reported to cover issues including the EU
Amsterdam Summit held last week, the EU expansion to central and
eastern Europe and the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
It will also discuss the talks about the World Trade
Organization and the Asia-Europe meeting scheduled for next year.

HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- "Seven-Eleven", is a duration of
business hours a kind of shops especially extend to satisfy the
needs of customers. The term can now be used to describe a work
day of Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Tung has become a busy man who are sought after by press
circles ever since he received the letter of appointment from
Chinese Premier Li Peng in mid-December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted with a historic mission, Tung has been busy
conferring officials of the British Hong Kong government, meeting
with ordinary residents and listening to their views, and
addressing varied functions daily over the past 190 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he raced against the time in forming the future
HKSAR government. He has always been busy attending meetings,
making speeches, reading documents and interviewing with
journalists from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He has left his footprints everywhere in Hong Kong, either in
the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Center, or in communities
or hotels.
</P>
<P>
Tung, 60, had resigned from his posts as a member of the
British-Hong Kong Executive Council and chairman and chief
executive officer of the Orient Overseas (International) Ltd.,
before he decided to run for the office of the first chief
executive of the HKSAR. And with the fortitude, and the sense of
resourcefulness and self-confidence fostered in his business
career over decades, he took the responsibilities of the first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He was committed to the formation of the HKSAR Government, a
key link in ensuring the smooth transition in Hong Kong. The task
he has undertaken is unprecedented in history and very
complicated. A great many difficulties are involved, and there are
still too many things to attend to.
</P>
<P>
A staff at the Chief Executive Office said, "Tung was too busy
with his work. He is at office from seven o'clock in the morning
to eleven in evening daily, without a single day off every week."
</P>
<P>
Though Tung is a football fan, but now has no time for the
hobby, the staffer added.
</P>
<P>
In his own words, Tung said he is "busy all day long with no
holidays" and his hair and eyebrow are "greying a lot".
Nevertheless, he is working dedicatedly and with willingness to
the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local people held that the formation of the HKSAR Government
proceeded smoothly since Tung was appointed by the Central
Government as the first Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
To date, Tong has nominated 23 principal officials for the
first government of the HKSAR, formed the first Executive Council,
the Court of Final Appeal and High Court and appointed members of
the provisional Urban council and the Provisional municipal
Council and the district board, paving way for the smooth
operation of the HKSAR Government on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He formed his cabinet in accordance with his consistent work
style of "resourcefulness and proceeding steadily and in a
well-planned way". It took him over a month to have separate
meetings with more than 20 senior officials of the British Hong
Kong government, soliciting their opinions on the operation of the
future government, routine work procedures and division of work.
Many of them were impressed by his sincerity and firmness.
</P>
<P>
The objective of turning Hong Kong into a stable, equitable,
compassionate and democratic society with clarity of direction and
unity under the principle "One country, two systems" proposed by
Tung Chee Hwa has won wide recognition and endorsement from the
whole community.

<HEADLINE> Optimism Prevails in Symposium on HK's Future (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to China should have the effect of adding a
large new dimension to our market without taking any of its
existing international and regional role," Cheng told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the economic hinterland of China, he added,
Hong Kong should be better positioned than now to increase the
breadth and sophistication of its range of financial products and
services, thus enhancing its "critical mass" as an international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries,
expressed a similar view in a written speech titled "The Hong Kong
- China Nexus" presented to the symposium.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "one country, two systems" concept, Tang
pointed out, Hong Kong will benefit from all of the strengths that
have built Hong Kong to what it is today, and at the same time
"puts us in pole position" to capture opportunities that are
arising across the interior area as its economy steadily opens.
</P>
<P>
Upon its return to China, he noted, Hong Kong's role as the
metropolitan heart of an increasingly affluent south China region
will be greatly enhanced now that the barriers to official contact
are brought down, and Hong Kong will continue to be the main
source of foreign capital inflow for inland businesses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's future advantages, Raymond Ch'ien,
chairman of the Industry and Technology Development Council, said
Hong Kong should focus on development of the high-tech sector to
create new advantages for sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
Differing from Ch'ien's view, David Dodwell, co-author of the
recently published Hong Kong's Advantages, said the Hong Kong's
economy has changed from a manual economy to a knowledge-based
one, and a metropolitan economy with links to China's interior
areas and the region.
</P>
<P>
With services booming and manufacturing value-added increasing,
Dodwell argued that Hong Kong's future lies in retaining its
present economic pattern.
</P>
<P>
Observers here pointed out that the positive mood displayed
during the symposium embodies the optimism prevailing in Hong
Kong's business community.
</P>
<P>
Latest surveys conducted by the American and Canadian chambers
of commerce in Hong Kong among their member companies show that 95
percent of American companies see the business environment for the
next five years as either "very favorable" or "favorable", while
99 percent of the Canadian respondents will stay in Hong Kong
beyond the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Optimism Prevails in Symposium on HK's Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 -- Optimism about Hong Kong's future played
the main tune during a two-day symposium on Hong Kong's continued
prosperity after its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Political and business figures, from both Hong Kong and other
parts of the world, envisioned a politically stable and
economically prosperous Hong Kong while addressing the Symposium
on Countdown to 1997: Roadmap to Hong Kong's Continued Prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which closed here yesterday, was sponsored by
Far Eastern Economic Review, one of the most influential business
weeklies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the symposium, Lee Kuan Yew, Senior
Minister of Singapore, predicted that the Chinese leadership will
observe the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,
which are in China's national interest, and will go all out to
show that Hong Kong can thrive and prosper after its return to
China.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those pressing China on Hong Kong "may find they
have helped to frustrate themselves, because China will make
doubly sure it does not breach the Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "one country, two system" policy pursued
by the Chinese government, Hong Kong will maintain for 50 years
its existing economic and political structures after its return to
China, enjoying a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that public confidence in the economy is
currently at a record high, as reflected in the strength of the
stock and property markets, while the international community
shares this confidence.
</P>
<P>
He told the symposium that a recent survey found that over 90
percent of foreign-funded companies in Hong Kong will stay after
the handover, which cited favorable banking and financial
facilities, infrastructure, tax regime as the top three
attractions that will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Local business leaders, from the standpoint of their respective
fields, shared Lee's confidence in post-handover Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the symposium on the prospects for Hong Kong's stock
market, Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong,
noted that the local securities market will not only maintain its
key elements that have made it one of the most successful in the
world, but also benefit from new business opportunities created by
the historic handover.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Rushes Decrees to Save Finance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Tuesday pushed
through four executive decrees as urgent measures to help the
troubled finance and property sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government House, one of the decrees was
introduced to amend the bill on finance business to encourage the
mergers of finance firms and allow the core finance company to
hold stakes in other companies for the purpose of acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Another decree was designed to go round the bill on commercial
banks to allow the finance minister to approve foreigners to hold
limited stakes in a commercial bank to help finance firms to seek
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
It also will allow the finance minister to approve a board
member of commercial bank to be a member of other banks, but for
no more than three years.
</P>
<P>
The third decree aimed to facilitate finance companies to set
up ad-hoc institutes for securitization to help them overcome
their existing funding problems.
</P>
<P>
The fourth decree is on the secondary mortgage corporations.
</P>
<P>
However, local newspapers said that the measures introduced as
executive decrees to go around the legislative procedures are
likely to place the government at unnecessary risk in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet ministers felt that the measures should have been
introduced in the form of draft bills which would require the
approval of the parliament, instead of executive decrees.
</P>
<P>
Yet new Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya believed that the
measures should be in place urgently in view of the current
situation in the country's finance sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred overseas Chinese

handover ceremony to be held at midnight on June 30, local sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
An official with the China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Ltd.,

of local Chinese communities or renowned figures.
</P>
<P>
"The 300 people include business tycoons, social celebrities,

ceremony for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Hong
Kong SAR) and the swearing-in of the Hong Kong SAR government, a

</P>

world, they will bear witness to the historic event of Hong Kong's
return to China after it has been subjected to more than 150 years

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership Plan Launched in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Finance Building Society (FBS) of
Zambia has launched a scheme to help local people acquire houses
easily.
</P>
<P>
The scheme known as "Home Savings Plan"is a two-stage option.
In the first one, the would-be home owner starts accumulating his
contribution toward the cost of the house by saving a regular
monthly sum.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, one uses those savings together with a
housing loan from FBS to purchase a suitable house.
</P>
<P>
One will then have to pay month loan instalments but can get
tax relief on the loan interest.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will not only help people buy houses but also
assist them set money aside for other purposes like acquisition
of furniture, cars or child education.
</P>
<P>
The contribution should be regular for a minimum two years.
The savings will enjoy an attractive interest rate though the
rate may go up and down depending on changes in the country's
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Premature withdrawal will only be considered by way of
exemption.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Suffers Losses from Illegal Motor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 used vehicles
were entering South Africa illegally every month, costing the
motor industry millions of Rand in terms of lost sales, local
daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This is just a conservative estimate," Motor Industries
Federation (MIF) President Oscar Taub was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The illegally imported vehicles originate from various parts
of the world including Europe and the United States, but mainly
from Japan and Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taub said while the MIF could not provide figures on the cost
in monetary terms and possible job losses, the illegal imports
had a negative impact on South Africa's motor industry.
</P>
<P>
The MIF has made several representations to the governement
about the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar sentiments were echoed by the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, which appealed the
government to pay an "urgent attention" to the matter.
</P>
<P>
According to the automobile industry sources, new vehicle
sales in South Africa plunged 19 percent in May to 30,610 units,
which is believed to have something to do with illegal import of
motor vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Spend $1.6m on Grain Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The government plans to
spend 1,000 million Tanzania Shillings (about 1.6 million US
Dollars) to boost the Strategy Grain Reserves (SGR), local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives, Pius
Mbawala said that the SGR would start buying grain from farmers
in the first week next month and beef up stocks in order to have
enough food to meet demand in the event of famine.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the SGR seeks to pay better prices to
farmers as an incentive to produce more and stop them from
selling grain to smugglers and unscrupulous middlemen.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy minister, since the SGR was
established in the country, the government has injected 10,898
million T.Shs. (about 18.2 million U.S. Dollars) into its
coffers.
</P>
<P>
The highest amount came in the 1992/93 season when the
government pumped in 3,757 million T.Shs. (about 6.3 million
U.S. Dollars) and the lowest amount was dished out in the 1996/97
season when the SGR got 400 million T.Shs. (about 666,000
Dollars) only.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Calls for Setting UP New Peace Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- To mark 47th anniversary of the
outbreak of the Korean war, the official newspapers in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today repeated the
call for the establishment of a new peace mechanism to maintain
peace and stability in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A Rodong Sinmun article said, "If the U.S. is truly desirous
of peace on the Korean peninsula it should implement the
DPRK-U.S. framework agreement with sincerity, thereby putting an
end to its hostile relations with the DPRK and replacing the
obsolete armistice agreement with a new peace mechanism."
</P>
<P>
"For the present, the U.S. should accede to the DPRK's
initiative for signing an interim agreement to that effect," it
said.
</P>
<P>
This is "the only way to bring undoubtful and durable peace to
the Korean peninsula," said the article.
</P>
<P>
The Korean people will certainly fulfill the wish for the
reunification of the fatherland, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The paper Minju Joson said that if the U.S. and the South
Korean ruling quarters persist in military confrontation with the
north, the DPRK will not mind the final battle with them.
</P>
<P>
The articles condemned the military reinforcements and
exercises by the United States and South Korea around the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Korean war broke out on June 25, 1950.

<HEADLINE> "Tree of Wishes" Reflects Hope of School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- "I hope everybody loves Hong
Kong". The hope was expressed by a middle school student in
Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
First-grader Luk Kar Po of the Mong Kok School for Workers'
Children wrote the message on a piece of heart-shaped paper, then
put it on a "tree of wishes" on a wall of the school hall.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program to celebrate Hong Kong's return to
China, the 980 students in the school erected the four-m-tall
"tree of wishes" adorned with heart-shaped paper in red, yellow
and green, on which they wrote their hopes on and expectations for
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
One message reads that "I hope that everyone will become
prettier day by day, and Hong Kong's economy will grow steadily."
</P>
<P>
One student expressed the hope that Hong Kong will continue to
be stable and prosperous in the future, another hoped that HKSAR
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa will govern Hong Kong successfully,
and still another wished for peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
Lai Tak Keung, a teacher of the Chinese language, said the
school established last September a preparatory committee for
activities to celebrate Hong Kong's return to China. The
activities include a competition for design of handover souvenirs,
and a poem composition contest.
</P>
<P>
The school, founded in 1946, raises the Chinese national flag
on every National Day, which falls on October 1, and teaches its
students to love the motherland, the people, labor, science and
public properties.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Stage Recovery To Close Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
staged a late recovery to close higher, with broad base investor
confidence renewed after a positive turnaround on Wall Street
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 16.7 points firmer
at 2705.1, undoing yesterday's 17.9 point fall, while the Dow
Jones industrial average finished 153.80 points higher to 7,758.06
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The local market recovered from the morning low of 2688.4.
</P>
<P>
A Sydney-based broker said the rally on Wall Street and the
local market's subsequent fall yesterday after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's plunge was regarded as an over-reaction to
comments from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Lance Jones' broker Hamish Dee said while there was a degree of
book-squaring going on in preparation for the end of the financial
year, the market had also received an injection from overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed up 31.4 points at 4259.7,
while the all resources index lifted 4.7 points to 1505.8.
</P>
<P>
On the resources front, oil and gas group Woodside was a star
performer, piling on 73.7 cents to close at 11.207 Australian
dollars -- having reached an intraday high of 11.30 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market bellwether BHP shed 15 cents to 19.25 Australian dollars
while diverse resources giant Rio Tinto was up 33.6 cents at 22.89
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Weakened by lower overseas prices, the gold index slid 18.3
points to 1461.8.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, gold bullion was trading at 337.90 US dollars per
fine ounce, compared to yesterday's close of 339.75 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 393.19 million shares worth 999.80
million Australian dollars (749.85 million US dollars), with rises
of 658 outnumbering falls of 568.

<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An official of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) warned Tuesday that sustainability
of development efforts is at risk unless they are rooted within
people and their communities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a five-day workshop on participatory approaches and
partnerships in Bulawayo, the second largest city of Zimbabwe,
UNDP assistant representative Duduzile Chandiwana said the agency
had learnt that participatory relationships with communities had
to be changed.
</P>
<P>
She said there was need for a change of strategy if
development programmes, under which millions of dollars were
spent, were to succeed.
</P>
<P>
She said participation was one of the most effective
strategies for change and policy reform.
</P>
<P>
Experience had taught the agency that development initiatives
were sustained where communities were empowered to take the lead
and control their agenda.
</P>
<P>
She said the UNDP's major role now was poverty alleviation,
and that the agency was taking a more focused approach to human
resource development.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be a jack-of-all-trades, but now we have to change
the way we do business," she said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop which began Monday is being attended by 70
delegates from Angola, Eritrea, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> 204 Philippine Migrant Workers to be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 204 Philippine migrant
workers, who were recently arrested by the Malaysian authorities
for "illegally" staying there, will be repatriated to the
Philippines this week, government officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 204 Filipinos are among those who have been arrested
earlier by the Malaysian immigration authorities following its
crackdown on "illegal aliens," officials in the Foreign Affairs
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Embassy in Malaysia reported that there are
113,400 Philippine migrant workers working or staying in Malaysia
without proper permit.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has given these illegal migrant
workers until May 31, 1997 to register to its immigration bureau
for proper documentation. But some of the 113,400 illegal migrant
workers failed to comply with the requirements by the Malaysian
government before the deadline for registration.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Department officials said that the Philippines
and Malaysia recently agreed that those who failed to register for
documentation will be eventually repatriated.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, a leading coal producer in
north China, aims to wash 40 percent of the coal it produces
by the year 2000. At present, only 20 percent of the coal coming
out of the province's mines is washed.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to ensure that more large coal dressing
plants, coking projects and high value-added coal projects will be
constructed. Meanwhile, the production capacity of existing coal
dressing plants will be optimized, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi will construct modern coal dressing plants close to its
major coal mines, near large centers of collection and
distribution, and in coal producing counties if transport
is convenient. Dressing increases the value of coal, changing it
from crude coal into "refined" coal.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Shanxi has a coal reserve of 220
billion tons, and currently produces more than 300 million tons
a year. The figure constitutes a quarter of the country's output.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 million tons of coal produced by the province is
transported to other areas, making up 80 percent of the country's
total coal shipment volume.

LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has no arrears with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and it has the largest quota of
363.5 million special drawing rights (SDRs, with one SDR equaling
1.4 US dollars) with the IMF among the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by IMF resident representative Elwaleed Taha at
a recent economic seminar under the auspices of Bank of Zambia,
according to today's local press.
</P>
<P>
Taha said that the Zambian government's record since the
country embarked on the Structural Adjustment program in 1992 has
been excellent in terms of adhering to strong corrective economic
reform measures and, as a result of Zambia's strong commitment to
economic reforms, the country cleared its arrears in December
1995 and qualified for concessional lending from the IMF's
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF disbursed 14 million US dollars of ESAF funds to
Zambia in March this year and this left a balance of 40 million
SDRs which will be disbursed in two equal instalments in the
remaining two years.

<HEADLINE> Red Lanterns Hanging High along Beijing Main Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With the handover countdown well into
single figures, Beijing is brightening itself up with giant
red lanterns to celebrate Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese tradition, red lanterns carry jubilant and
auspicious meanings, and people usually hang them outside buildings
and in their homes on high days and holidays, most notably at
Spring Festival and on October 1st, China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
In Tian'anmen Square, some 60 red lanterns measuring 1.1 meters
in diameter and two meters in height have been positioned around
the square, while another 100 will be hung on the two sides of the
digital countdown clock outside the Museum of Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
A few hundred meters to the east of the square, six workers wrestled
in sweltered heat to position five 1.8-meter-diameter red lanterns
outside the main door of the Beijing Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Wang Youqing, an electrician at the hotel, said the
lanterns seemed much bigger and brighter than the ones hung
before.
</P>
<P>
Lanterns, big and small, are also catching the eye along the
city's main shopping streets: Wangfujing, Xidan and Dongdan.
</P>
<P>
For special symbolism, exactly 1,997 big red lanterns have been
hung along the four-kilometer stretch of road between Xuanwumen
and Xinjiekou.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Yuliang, a manager at the Beijing Artistic Red Lantern
Factory, is delighted at the unseasonal demand for red
lanterns. Business is so hot that factory workers have been
working overtime to turn out more lanterns. In the past month the
factory has produced more than 4,000 red lanterns for some 1,000
customers.

<HEADLINE> ROK Elevator Producer Eyes China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- LG Industrial Systems Co., the
largest elevator producer in the Republic of Korea (ROK), will
increase its investment volume in China to 140 million US dollars
by 2000 from the present 40 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
LG Industrial Systems regards China as extended home production
base because of its geological closeness to ROK as well as its
huge potential market, Bob Jang, executive vice-president of the
company's overseas operation told Xinhua just a week before the
China World Elevator Expo '97 to be held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said his company will expand its sales volume in China to
6.5 billion yuan (780 million US dollars) by the year 2000,
snatching six percent of the total market. Last year, his company
sold China elevators worth 800 million yuan, accounting for only
one percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Jang said that China, along with its sustained economic
development, will need more equipment related to the building of
office towers, hotels, apartments and power stations, and LG
Industrial Systems chooses to focus on developing the market of
elevators, power distributors, transformers and parking facilities
in the country.
</P>
<P>
LG Industrial Systems has established 27 sales centers in
China, accounting for 60 percent of the total worldwide. In July
this year, it will wind up the construction of an elevator joint
venture in Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province. Besides,
it plans to build five more factories in China before the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urged to Suspend Operations Against Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Regional officials in Mindanao have
appealed to President Fidel Ramos for immediate suspension of the
military operations against suspected kidnappers in the southern
part of the country, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Ustadz Murshi Ibrahim, chief of staff of the Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao, said the appeal was contained in a strongly
worded resolution addressed to the President through Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa.
</P>
<P>
The appeal said the recent operations by government troops
against the suspected kidnappers, Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels, had led to the evacuation of thousands of civilians
in Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces.
</P>
<P>
The military intensified its assaults after 200 MILF rebels
held hostage 43 employees of the Philippine Oil Co. on June 16.
Since last Friday, the two sides have been trading mortar fires,
killing at least 30 rebels and three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that government troops have closed in on the
MILF's second biggest camp in the region. As a result, both the
rebels and the military are sending fresh forces there, fueling
speculation that the clashes will escalate.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of military offensive may further aggravate
the situation in Mindanao and result in an open armed conflict
between government troops and MILF rebels, Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
He added that aside from the suspension of military operations,
the regional officials are also demanding for the immediate
withdrawal of government troops in areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, chairman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao, had earlier proposed the two sides calm down to forge a
general truce to prevent the collapse of their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF broke away from the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by Misuari in 1970s. Its leaders
had threatened to quit peace talks with the government if
government troops continue the operations.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Interview: Pakistani Diplomat on Hong Kong's Future By Shi Xiaofan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani envoy here said
Hong Kong is important for Pakistan economically and expressed
confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong will continue to prosper as an international trade
and financial center after it returns to China, its attractions
for foreign investors are bound to grow," said Mr. Puri, Pakistan
Consul-General in Hong Kong, in a recent interview in his China
Resources Building office.
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Puri, Hong Kong has emerged as Pakistan's
second largest trading partner, next only to the United States. In
1996, Pakistan exported 833 million US dollars worth of goods to
Hong Kong, up 55 percent over the previous year. In the same year,
Pakistan imported 79 million US dollars worth of goods from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Apart from direct bilateral trade, Hong Kong also serves as an
important base for Pakistan's entrepot trade, he said. "The bulk
of Pakistan's trade with the United States, for example, is done
via Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a prime venue for doing business thanks to its
status as an international trade and financial center and the
presence there of numerous multinationals, he said.
Interaction with international portfolio investors and fund
managers present in Hong Kong has generated a great deal of
support for the Pakistani stock market, Mr. Puri said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Puri is also a trade expert with working experiences in
Pakistan's Ministry of Commerce, the World Trade Organization and
as consul-general in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that my appointment in the economically-important Hong
Kong is partly due to my experiences in the trade and commercial
sector", the 46-year-old consul-general said.
</P>
<P>
"Since many of Hong Kong-based multinationals are involved in
textile trade, this market is an extremely important one for
Pakistan," he said.
Pakistan is a cotton-growing country where cotton-related
products account for 65 percent of the country's total exports, he
said.
"That is why Hong Kong has also played an important role in
Pakistan's textiles trade in the world, and long-term prospects in
this regard are good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since he came to Hong Kong two years ago, his consulate has
helped at least 15 multinationals with regional headquarters in
Hong Kong to open representative or liaison offices in Pakistan,
said Mr. Puri.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has begun making many of the world's brand-name
garments in addition to exporting cotton yarn and fabrics, and
Hong Kong has played a role in this, too. "Hong Kong experts are
now working in Pakistan to help garment-makers upgrade their
products," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I just cannot agree to some negative reports on the future of
Hong Kong, since they are not based on the real situation here. On
the contrary, I'm absolutely convinced that, if there are to be
any changes, Hong Kong will change for the better."
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging economic indicators from all sectors, the constant
return of Hong Kong people who earlier emigrated to foreign
countries and the growing presence of multinationals all point to
a bright future here," he said.
 Hong Kong's success is largely due to its proximity with China,
and when Hong Kong returns to China, economic and commercial links
will surely increase and strengthen, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the "one country, two systems" is a unique
concept, thanks to which Hong Kong is experiencing a smooth and
painless transition and will continue to be stable and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"The application of this concept reflects the farsightedness and
pragmatic wisdom of the Chinese leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Puri said his work in Hong Kong is one of the most rewarding
experiences in his career.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of great pride for me to witness the historic
moment when, after being under British colonial rule for such a
long time, Hong Kong will be reunited with its motherland," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Aspirin Helps Prevent Second Stroke: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An international study has found
out that aspirin could prevent a second stoke if it is taken by
the patient within 48 hours of the first one.
</P>
<P>
The study, which included Israeli researchers, was carried out
in 36 countries and has studied the cases of 19,435 patients, 114
of them Israelis, the English daily The Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that a dose of at least 300 milligrams of aspirin
taken within 48 hours of the first stroke could prevent the death
of 10 patients or a recurrent stroke for each 1,000 persons who
have undergone a stroke.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Natan Bornstein, head of the unit for cerebrovascular
diseases at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, was quoted as saying
that aspirin was highly effective in reducing mortality after a
stroke, compared to the blood-thinning drug heparin.
</P>
<P>
When heparin was given in moderate doses, aspirin proved more
effective; and when large doses of heparin were administered, the
patients often suffered cerebral hemorrhages as a result, the
study revealed.
</P>
<P>
Strokes, in which blood vessels in the brain are blocked by a
clot causing oxygen starvation and damage to brain tissue, are the
third most common cause of death in Israel after cardiovascular
diseases and cancer. They are also the main cause of disability
in middle-aged and elderly adults.
</P>
<P>
Borenstein said the research results added an important
contribution to the controversial question of aspirin versus
heparin after a stroke. At least 300 milligrams of aspirin should
be given in the emergency room and immediately after a
clot-induced stroke is diagnosed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Warns Against Move to Rig Bypoll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has threatened to launch a campaign to
topple the government if it tries to rig the Manikganj by-election
scheduled for June 30.
</P>
<P>
BNP leader Khaleda Zia told a public meeting in Manikganj
Tuesday that If the government tried to rig the election, tamper
results of the polling or indulge in any other manipulation, such
a movement would be launched to compel it to quit.
</P>
<P>
"I've come here to meet you with a demand, the demand for your
valuable vote. I always consider you as my close kin, so I have
the right to make this demand," said the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Manikganj-3 seat was vacated after the death of BNP
lawmaker Alhaj Nizamuddin Khan in March. The BNP had earlier
announced that it would not contest the by-election under the
present Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, however, changed its mind early this month and said it
will take part in the bypoll "for the sake of democracy and
following the assurance by the Election commission."
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia told the cheering crowd that the government was
destroying the country through its misrule and conspiracies. "This
is the character of the government. It can not be trusted."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the opposition leader said the government has
ruined the economy of the country within only one year and called
upon the people to resist the government's activities.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Promotes Farmers' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
has lifted 520,000 adult farmers out of illiteracy and trained
them in technical skills over the past two years so that they will
improve their wellbeing.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 50 million farmers, of whom only
760,000 are still illiterate. Over years of efforts, about a half
of its cities and counties have wiped out illiteracy among the
adults.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels in Hunan have set up night schools
for farmers. An example is Lixian County which has opened over 250
night schools in its poverty-stricken villages and has lifted
12,000 farmers out of illiteracy and helped them grasp some
technical skills to earn more money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of grassroots governments have paid
attention to the education of illiterate women who still account
for the bulk of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhixiang, vice-governor of the province, says that it is
an important task of the government to help farmers become
literate, and Hunan will continue to give priority to it.
</P>
<P>
The province is to help another 500,000 illiterate people
receive education this year, according to Tang.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Russia have agreed
to build an exclusive industrial park for South Korean firms in
Nakhodka, Siberia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between a South Korean government
delegation and Russians in Moscow last week, according to
government sources here.
</P>
<P>
A formal accord will be signed during the conference of South
Korea-Russia Joint Committee on July 7-8, along with a land-lease
contract for 3.3 million square-meters, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean businessmen in the industrial complex will receive
favorable treatments, including a 50-percent cut in value-added
tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to lower the current VAT rate of 20
percent to 10 percent for South Korean entrants in the park.
</P>
<P>
However, the firms would have to export 50 percent of their
production and the preferential customs and tax treatments would
only be applied to manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Warns Against Illegal Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An official with the People's Bank
of China, the central bank, has urged stricter control over the
domestic institutions providing guarantee for economic activities
overseas.
</P>
<P>
He said that all government departments, local governments, and
public institutions are forbidden to provide guarantee for
economic activities overseas, except for relending overseas loans
with the State Council's approval.
</P>
<P>
Illegal guarantee provided by domestic institutions in some
areas has severely endangered state property and damaged China's
international credit, and even made it easy to make fraud, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
All the guarantees for economic activities overseas have to be
done in strict accordance with the state guarantee law and related
regulations. Otherwise, such contracts will be invalidated, people
involved will be penalized or even brought to justice when they
are caught in extremely severe violations, the official warned.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Hong Kong-related Data (9): Central Government Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Article 13 of the Basic Law
stipulates, "The Central People's Government shall be responsible
for the foreign affairs relating to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs refer to such activities, conducted in the name
of the state by the head of state, the head of government, the
Foreign Ministry, diplomatic representative organizations and
diplomatic delegations, as visits, negotiations, making
representations, issuing diplomatic documents, concluding
treaties, attending international conferences and joining
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The handling of such state-to-state foreign affairs, in the
name of the state or government with other countries or
international organizations, reflects the sovereignty of a state.
</P>
<P>
These differ in nature from the economic, trade and cultural
contacts between non-state and non-government organizations, which
are unofficial or non-governmental external affairs.
</P>
<P>
As a regional administrative region of China, Hong Kong does
not have the power to handle foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the first section of Article 13 of the Basic Law
makes an explicit stipulation regarding the foreign affairs
relating to Hong Kong that the Central Government handles.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the HKSAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy,
the third section of Article 13 of the Basic Law states: "The
Central People's Government authorizes the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region to conduct relevant external affairs on its
own in accordance with this Law."

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Hong Kong-related Data (10): Stationing of Troops in Hong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The central authorities decided
to station troops in Hong Kong in 1997. This embodies state
sovereignty and is out of the need to maintain social order in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The troops dispatched by the Central People's Government to the
HKSAR will be responsible only for defense affairs, and will not
interfere in the local affairs of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The social order within the Region will be the responsibility
with the HKSAR Government. The HKSAR may, when necessary, ask the
Central People's Government for assistance from the troops in
maintaining public order and conducting disaster relief
operations.
</P>
<P>
The troops shall abide by national laws as well as laws of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
So far, the expenditure of the British troops in Hong Kong has
been borne by Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, however, the Central Government will be responsible
for Hong Kong's defense and the Hong Kong people will not have to
pay the military expenses.
</P>
<P>
The military expenditure will be borne by the Central People's
Government in accordance with the Basic Law, which is a special
treatment granted to the Hong Kong people by the central
authorities.

<HEADLINE> hkhk -Hong Kong-related Data (11): Regional Flag, Emblem of HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, unlike provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities in China's inland areas, is allowed to have its own
regional flag and emblem.
</P>
<P>
This is a concrete reflection of the principles of "one
country, two systems" and "a high degree of autonomy," and is also
designed to facilitate the external contacts of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Without the regional flag and emblem, it will be inconvenient
for the SAR to exercise its power, authorized by the Central
Government, to conduct external affairs.
</P>
<P>
The regional flag of the HKSAR is a red flag with a bauhinia in
the center highlighted by five stars-tipped stamens. The red flag
represents the motherland and the white bauhinia represents Hong
Kong, implying that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China and
prospers in the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The five stars in the bauhinia symbolize Hong Kong compatriots'
love of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
The flag and the flower are in different colors, red and white,
symbolizing "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The regional emblem of the HKSAR is round in shape, with its
outer ring carrying the words "Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China" in Chinese and "Hong
Kong" in English.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the emblem is a bauhinia highlighted by five
star-tipped stamens against a red background. The emblem has the
same symbolic meaning as the regional flag.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) will shift the venue for seven sports for next year's Asian
Games in Bangkok if construction work is not finished timely.
</P>
<P>
An OCA source said the governing body had identified existing
venues in southern Bangkok that could be used as the replacements.
</P>
<P>
According to the original plan, stadiums and press facilties in
the Bangkok Land complex in the northern part of the city must be
finished five months before the Games starts in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jizhong, chairman of the Asian Games technical committee,
was concerned at the lack of progress at the B-Land site when he
visited the place in May, the source said.
</P>
<P>
And OCA committees have had to warn the authorities several
times about the pace of preparations.
</P>
<P>
B-Land is not only one of three main areas for the Asian Games,
but also the site of the main press centres and accommodation.
Sports for the complex include boxing, gymnastics, tennis,
weightlifting, billiards and snooker, rugby and volleyball.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Realize Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor
Song Jian said here today that China has the ability to realize
sustainable development, though problems remain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting organized by the United Nations
Development Program, Song, the head of the Chinese delegation to
the 19th special session of the U.N. General Assembly, said that
China, as a big country with a population of 1.2 billion, faces
a lot of problems in development.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the control of population growth, ecological
farming and clean production as the three of vital importance.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's farmland averages 10 persons per
hectare. If the population doubles, Song said, there will be an
unbearable pressure on the agricultural resources.
</P>
<P>
To curb population growth, the family planning policy was
introduced in China in the 1970s and it has been proved to be a
very effective way, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for ecological farming, Song said it is necessary to protect
farmland and other agricultural resources, adopt eco-friendly
farming mode, expand animal husbandry and fish farming.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to reduce pollution, protect forest,
freshwater resources and biodiversity, the councillor said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
three aspects and is confident to realize sustainable development
despite difficulties, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that China remains a developing country
with 58 million people still living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
China needs international assistance and cooperation and China
hopes to strengthen its cooperation with the United Nations
Development Program, the United Nations Children's Fund and other
U.N. agencies, Song added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Exporters, Industry Favor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian exporters and industry
captains are likely to seek a temporary devaluation of the rupee
along with other measures to boost the country's exports when they
meet Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being convened as the initiative of the prime
minister in the wake of poor performance of the export sector last
year and early this fiscal year (April 1997-March 1998).
</P>
<P>
After a growth of over 20 percent in 1995-96, India's exports
grew by only 4.01 percent in 1996-97, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, the first month of the current financial year,
the exports were 10 percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The steady slowdown in export growth has caused widespread
concern in both the Indian government and business circles who are
trying to work out measures to check the decline.
</P>
<P>
President of Federation of Indian Exporters' Organizations
(FIEO) Ramu Deora said a readjustment by 10 percent in the value
of rupee against the U.S. dollar would ensure exports remained
competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said the decline in imports had reduced the demand for
foreign currency. This had raised the value of the rupee against
the dollar, making Indian exports less competitive.
</P>
<P>
A senior industry representative agreed that "a 10-12 percent
devaluation (of rupee) over the next 6-8 months would help."  A
more significant reduction, he added, would lead to retaliatory
action by competing countries.
</P>
<P>
But industry captains are not unanimous over whether
devaluation of the Indian currency is desirable.
</P>
<P>
Some argue that a fall in the value of rupee would push up the
cost of imports and that producers relying on imported inputs
would suffer.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that devaluation would be necessary at least as a
temporary measure before more effective ones to boost exports
could be taken.
</P>
<P>
While in favor of at least a temporary devaluation of the
rupee, Industry captains have urged the Indian government to
improve administration and formulate longer-term measures to boost
exports.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and
Industry sources said the government should go in for a 10-12
percent devaluation of the rupee over the next 6-8 months and
bring down the cost of export credit.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, it should emphasize improving
infrastructures for exports and making Indian products more
competitive globally by reducing taxes on industry.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Customs authorities were also urged to simplify
formalities to improve administration of exports.

<HEADLINE> Employers' Group Cautious About Italy's Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian employers' organization
Confindustria today said the country's economic prospects in
coming years may not be as bright as the government expects.
</P>
<P>
However, while commenting on a latest government financial
plan, Confindustria said the country may still be able to make way
into the European monetary union before its launch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-2000 economic and financial planning document,
submitted by the government in May, passed the Senate floor today
after winning a Chamber of Deputies approval on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Italy's budget deficit this year would be between 3.2-3.6
percent of gross domestic product, or above the 3 percent ceiling
set for the single currency union, Confindustria said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in 1998 would be 3 percent, still above the
government's target of 2.8 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation would be 2.1 percent this year, below the
government's estimate of 2.5 percent, but the unemployment would
be unlikely to go down below 12 percent until 1999.
</P>
<P>
A stagnated economy would be resulted from postponed reform to
improve the quality of public spending, administrative efficiency,
tax system and labor market, said the group.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainties in Italy's public accounts mean that the
country's qualification for joining the European monetary union
will remain a doubt up to May 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
But "it is reasonably probable that Italy will succeed, albeit
by a hair's breadth, in crossing the line" with some leading
countries into the union, it noted.

<HEADLINE> Drug Use Among American Youths on Increase, at Yonger Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse among American
youths keeps increasing, and starting at a younger age, even
though overall drug use in the country is declining, the U.S.
Government's top anti-drug official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our children are using drugs again and in increasing numbers,"
Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy told reporters. "And we're seeing new and disturbing
phenomenon with heroin exposure, marijuana and other emerging
drugs."
</P>
<P>
Citing findings from a semi-annual check of drug use trends in
the United States, McCaffrey said there are increased hospital
admissions for children abusing marijuana, often in combination
with alcohol, methamphetamines or crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
"The drug threat is changing and student populations are
picking up on it, and it's tending to drift into younger years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The average age at which kids report first using illegal drugs
is 16, but "significant numbers" of eighth-graders have reported
trying marijuana, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report on national trends in illegal drug abuse and drug
markets in the second half of 1996, conducted by McCaffrey's
Office, was based on interviews with epidemiologists, drug abuse
treatment providers and police in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The analysis showed that cocaine and crack cocaine abuse has
stabilized or declined, although there are still an estimated 1.4
million chronic addicts in the country.

<HEADLINE> Honduras to Reinforce Border Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran Foreign Ministry
today suggested that the country's public security force step up
border control efforts to keep out armed Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo Panting said dozens of Hondurans
had complained about attacks and robberies by re-armed Nicaraguan
guerrillas in some eastern border towns of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
While taking the complaints very seriously, Panting said, his
ministry had called for closer surveillance along the border and
intensified investigation into the incursions.
</P>
<P>
The only way to dissuade the criminal groups is by reinforcing
Honduran military outposts in the border areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan government of President Arnoldo Aleman is doing
its utmost to disarm these people, but there are several groups
that have eluded the control of Nicaraguan authorities," the
foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government is confident that the situation will
not deteriorate along the border since the Nicaraguan government
has every good will to avoid conflicts with its neighbors, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nazi Retrialed for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Nazi SS captain Erich Priebke
told a military court today that he was forced to take part in
Italy's worst World War Two massacre of 335 men and boys, 75 of
them Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, dressed in a white shirt and grey jacket, read a
prepared statement in Rome's high-security Rebibbia jail where he
is standing trial on charges of complicity in the mass killing.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old German said he would have been executed if he
had refused to carry out the order that "came directly from
Hitler".
</P>
<P>
The ex-Nazi officer described his role in carrying out that
terrible order as horrendous thing, a personal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Priebke returned immediately to the Roman Catholic monastery
south of Rome where he is under house arrest after speaking for
half an hour during his first appearance in the military court
since the retrial opened on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, who is accused together with former SS major Karl Hass
of complicity in the massacre, was extradited from Argentina in
November 1995.
</P>
<P>
A court found him guilty last August but ruled that he be set
free under a statute of limitation.
</P>
<P>
The retrial was called because the verdict sparked a storm of
protest in Italy and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Gold Dealer Sees Golden Opportunity in Return of HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong gold dealers are
expecting the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1 to bring the
local gold market a new development opportunity that can really be
called a "golden" one.
</P>
<P>
"China has a population of 1.2 billion. If each Chinese buys
one gram of gold, China will consume half of the annual production
of all Western gold mines," Chan Fat Chu, president of the Chinese
Gold and Silver Exchange Society, was quoted as saying by local
media.
</P>
<P>
With its current status as an international financial center,
Hong Kong will serve as a major window for China to purchase
foreign gold, he added.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1910, the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society
operates one of the largest gold bullion markets in the world.
Gold traded through the society is of 99 percent fineness and
weighted in taels (one tael equals about 1.2 troy ounces).
Turnover on the exchange totaled 15 million taels in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"History has bestowed our society with several major chances of
development, and I believe this year's return is another one,"
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the near future, the income of the people in
China's interior areas will increase substantially as a result of
the reform and opening up drive and the influx of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
If inflation is under effective control, he said, people will
take out their bank savings and buy gold jewelry as a kind of
investment.
</P>
<P>
"When the sale of gold surges, the People's Bank of China will
need to purchase gold from the international market, and the Hong
Kong gold market will be the best choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the gold jewelry industry in China's interior
areas will enjoy further development in the coming two to three
years, thus promoting the formation of a gold market in the
interior areas that could help set the gold price.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also necessary for the gold market in the
interior areas to be linked with the Hong Kong gold market to
reduce the risk of a possible collapse caused by any major price
fluctuation in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there still exist some obstacles, Chan said that
the prospects for the realization of his blueprint are "quite
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
"If we seize this opportunity, our society will be able to
scale a new height," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Cuts Prices of Diesel, Kerosene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to mounting pressure, the
Nepali government has decided to lower the prices of diesel and
kerosene, but maintain the price of gas, local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The government has instructed the Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)
to refix the price of diesel at 15.5 rupees (27 U.S. cents) per
liter, down two rupees, and that of kerosene at 10.5 rupees (18
cents) per liter, down half a rupee, Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The gas price will remain unchanged at 39 rupees (68 cents) per
liter, he told a meeting of the Lower House Public Accounts
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma also told the meeting
that the NOC had been directed to fix the price of cooking gas,
another source of concern for the public, at 495 rupees (8.68
dollars) per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
But he said the old stock of liquefied petroleum gas will be
sold at 380 rupees (6.66 dollars) per cylinder for the coming
seven days.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed to price hikes of petroleum products
in order to reduce the heavy loss the NOC is suffering, said
Chand, adding that the government subsidy has reached 510 million
rupees ((8.95 million dollars) in the past five months alone.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been many complaints from the public since
the new price structure came out on June 12. According to the
price structure, the price of gas would be lifted from 34 rupees
(60 cents) per liter to 39 rupees (68 cents), diesel from 14
rupees (25 cents) to 17.5 rupees (30 cents) and kerosene from 9.5
rupees (17 cents) to 11 rupees (19 cents).
</P>
<P>
Public outrage against petroleum products and cooking gas price
hikes is gaining momentum, with protest movements taking place
now and then, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The major political parties all have voiced their opposition to
the proposed price hikes.

NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Two pilots of the Indian Air
Force were killed as the MIG-21 fighters flown by them collided
mid-air over an airbase in India's Assam state on Sunday, The
Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the delayed report, the collision was the first of
its kind in northeastern India.
</P>
<P>
Indian Air Force sources said the aircraft clashed because of
mistiming and the pilots failed to bail out due to low altitude of
the flight.
</P>
<P>
The Air force authorities had reportedly removed the wreckage
of the aircraft on Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tests Missile Defense Sensor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military today tested
over the Pacific Ocean a sensor designed to detect and track
incoming nuclear missiles, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
A rocket carrying an optical sensor and data system was fired
from Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands for the test
under the national missile defense program, it said.
</P>
<P>
The sensor, built by Boeing Company, located dummy warhead
targets from a Minuteman-2 missile launched 21 minutes earlier
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.
</P>
<P>
Now in its initial test stage, the sensor is designed to be
mounted on small rockets to collide with enemy nuclear warheads
once they are identified and tracked.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a
national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether
to deploy it within three years.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has announced plans to spend an
additional 2 billion dollars on the multi-billion missile defense
program over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Eyes World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian 5,000 meters world record
holder Haile Gebrselassie said here on Tuesday he would decide
about competing in August's world championships after trying to
reclaim the 10,000 meters world record.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Gebrselassie, who won Olympic gold at 10,000m
last year, said it was more important personally to break Moroccan
Salah Hissou's record of 26 minute 38.08 seconds than to go to
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie voiced his ambition at the news conference before
Wednesday's Paris Grand Prix Athletics Meeting, which was shiny
owing to some hottest names in the international athletic arena.
</P>
<P>
Among those track and field big guns, double Olympic champion
Michael Johnson noted at the conference that he was just focussing
on his race in Paris, not considering for the moment whether he
could obtain a possible wild card entry for August's world
championship in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, unable to run in the American trials because of a
strained quadricep muscle suffered in his 150 meters duel with
Canadian 100 meters world record holder Dovovan Bailey, also
shrugged off the questions from reporters whether he had ever
taken drugs.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's Kenyan-born 800 meters world champion Wilson Kipketer
would not tell how he had been preparing for the Paris Meeting but
assured that he would give all of himself to hit top.
</P>
<P>
The home favourite, double Olympic gold medalist Marie-Jose
Perec did not offer goals for the Paris Meeting. The Frenwoman
claimed she had been out of training for an entire week and was
still feeling uncomfortable with her legs.

<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian police in Naples arrested 17
people today suspected of producing child pornography and of
trafficking those pornographic photos and videos.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary sources said the suspects are charged with enticing
the children to a garage and apartments where paedophiliac
materials were produced.
</P>
<P>
The investigation began a year ago after one of the 19
children's mother reported the case to police, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Alfredo Ormanni said those children aged between six
and nine were subjected to violence in an elementary school and
continued later in apartments.
</P>
<P>
A school custodian among the 17 arrested was taken into custody
on the charge of providing information to the criminal ring about
those students with backgrounds of troubled families.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Limits on Petrochemical Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to strengthen macro
management of the petrochemical sector, China will restrict the
construction of the new ethylene production and oil refining
projects in the remaining years of the century, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Ma Chengquan, a senior
official with the State Planning Commission, as saying that China
will improve and expand existing refineries instead of setting up
new crude oil processing firms.
</P>
<P>
The current refineries and refineries under construction will
be capable of processing enough crude oil by 2000. The government
will take measures to improve its refineries, so they can increase
their capability of processing imported crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The government will launch an overhaul of existing crude oil
processing units, and will issue licenses to qualified processing
units after the overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said that China is unavoidable to increase imports of
crude oil because domestic oil production is hard to meet the
needs of the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
China will not approve new ethylene production projects before
2000 except for those foreign funded projects already
approved. Three of four large petrochemical bases capable of
producing at least one million tons of ethylene will be formed by
2010.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Haixia Brings Aurae to WNBA (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At 30 years of age, playing for
the Los Angeles Sparks in the WNBA's inaugural season is a tough
challenge for China's towering center, Zheng Haixia. But she loves
to face it.
</P>
<P>
"It's my long-time dream to play abroad with great world
stars," said Haixia, who bears the tag of "Great Wall of China" by
Australian coach Robyn Maher during the World Women's Basketball
Championship in Sydney in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to play in the new professional league, in which
many of the best players around the world have joined, and I am
confident that players from China are qualified," she said prior
to her departure for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team league made its debut last Saturday when Haixia
scored eigh points and grabbed five rebounds in her 18-minute
play. Unfortunately, her host Sparks lost to Charlotte Sting 57-67.
</P>
<P>
"All of us were disappointed at the defeat," Haixia said. "I
didn't play my game as in my home because I was too eager to show
well. It's a hard lession and I am sure I can play better later."
</P>
<P>
A 6-8 center and four-time Olympian, Haixia is not a stranger
to the fans in the United States, because of her outings to both
the Los Angeles and Atlanta Olympics and her pivotal role for the
Chinese national squad.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Haixia paced China to a silver medal at the World
Women's Basketball Championship with 26.3 points and 13.4 rebounds
per game. Voted MVP at the tournament, Haixia says it was the best
she's ever played.
</P>
<P>
Four months later, however, the same team was outscored 30
points by South Korea in the Hiroshima Asian Games, and China
failed to enter the Asian finals for the first time in twenty
years.
</P>
<P>
Haixia felt humiliated although she remained as top scorer of
19 points for the team.
</P>
<P>
During the Asian Games, the towering center shot a miserable 44
percent from the field and 56 percent from the free throw line,
against her 83 and 84 percent marks in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible game -- a disaster," she said. "I couldn't
believe it. Our defense was so poor that South Korea even scored
103 points with 10 three-pointers. They had never done that
against us."
</P>
<P>
Born in a peasant family in central Henan Province, Haixia
began her basketball career with a local sports academy when she
was 12 years old and already 5-10. Three years later, she grew to
over 6-7 and was drafted by the Wuhan Army club. In 1982, Haixia
joined in the Chinese youth team which won the Asian championship
and made her senior national debut the folllowing season.
</P>
<P>
"Eager to learn on and off the court, she had made great
strides in her first year in the national team," said Yang Boyong,
then national coach.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Haixia, at the age of 17, shot 59 percent from the
field as China finished third in the Los Angeles Olympics. "I was
the youngest of the team when I first took part in the Olympics,"
Haixia recalled.
</P>
<P>
She has since played in three more Olympics and four World
Championships, and China has become a fearsome squad in the world
from the moment Haixia started her national caps. She once scored
67 points in a friendly against a Soviet club.

"Both her weaks and the successes of her teammates in Barcelona
became catalyst for Haixia to work even hard for the Sydney world
championship," said coach Chen Daohong, who stepped off from the
post after Atlanta. "She needed to prove herself to the world and
resumed training even when she was undergoing medical treatment."
</P>
<P>
Haixia weighted 30 pounds lighter when the 1994 Worlds came
around and the effect was almost magical.
</P>
<P>
"Her play and conditioning has improved tremendously," said USA
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She is just so much bigger than
everybody else. She clogs up the passing lanes and presents all
kind of problems. If she weren't so big, she wouldn't be a
problem."
</P>
<P>
After the triumph in Australia, Haixia headed the Chinese team
to take the bronze medal in the Goodwill Games in St Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Yet, her back injury was flaring up and she could train only
sporadically prior to the Asian Games. But she was not to give
up. "As long as the team needs me, I'll be there," said Haixia, "I
want to be there for revenge against South Korea in the 1995 Asian
Championship and to take part in the 1996 Olympics."
</P>
<P>
And the moment came in July 1995 when Haixia and her teammates
defeated South Koreans 94-69 in the Asian Championship. Haixia won
the honour of MVP.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, she suffered another big blow when China failed to
enter the last eight with one win against four defeats in the
preliminaries, including a 72-75 loss to Japan, through she scored
a game-high 31 points.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing for us in Atlanta," said Haixia who
averaged 18.1 points per game as her team finished ninth place,
the worst record for the Chinese women cagers in the Olympic
history.
</P>
<P>
However, the setback couldn't keep Haixia offhands from the
sport she loved so much. After Atlanta she led the August First
club to retain the Women's National League title last October.
</P>
<P>
As Haixia was abroad for WNBA, China has no alternative for her
post, but it still has the merits to both Haixia herself and the
development of the Chinese women basketball, said Zhong Tianfa,
vice president of the Chinese Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
"Her departure didn't mean she will never represent China
again. Should she keep her form, she could still be in our
national squad, including the year of 2000," Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
"To play the 2000 Olympic Games? Then I'll be 33 years old,"
Haixia said to Xinhua last summer. "It'll be too hard for me
because I'll be too old."
</P>
<P>
If Haixia continues to play to her usual high level, don't be
surprised shen she turns up in the Sydney Olympics representing
China once again.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's solution to the Hong
Kong issue will serve as an example for solving problems that
at one time jeopardize world peace, a senior Mexican legislator
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's concept of "one country, two systems"
is a wise formula, said Augusto Gomez Villanueva, chairman of the
International Relations Committee of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China on coming July 1 is no doubt
an event of great significance not only for the Chinese, but also
for all mankind, Villanueva told Xinhua in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
By resuming the exercise of sovereignty, he said, the Chinese
leadership shows great wisdom in combining creativity and peace
with the firm enforcement of the principle of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
China will give the world an example of its force as a
sovereign nation and the way in which it will consolidate its
liberation and independence, the Mexican legislator said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt whatsoever that Hong Kong's return ... is an
example of the most important expression of oriental force."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong has always been and will
maintain its position as a world trade and financial center after
the Chinese government resumes the exercise of sovereignty there.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Slovenia, Romania's Entry into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
strongly renewed his country's support today for the early entry
of Slovenia and Romania into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"I firmly back the proposal to bring Slovenia and Romania into
the NATO's planned expansion," he said in an interview with CNN
television.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for admitting the two nations are very simple
because the southeastern part of Europe will become the most
complicated and volatile region in the continent, both politically
and economically, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister said at the closing ceremony of the
Denver summit that United States President Bill Clinton's refusal
to support the two nations' access to NATO was a serious mistake.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has claimed that only Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic should be in NATO's first wave of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy, France and other European nations also support
granting NATO membership to Slovenia and Romania as Slovenia, a
Balkan state, plays a crucial strategic military role in
connecting Hungary to other members of the alliance, while
Romania, which borders the Black Sea, would provide a needed
equilibrium in NATO's south.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands OPEC Measures to Stop Oil Overproduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aghazadeh urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) today to take steps to prevent its members from
pumping oil above official ceiling and guarantee crude oil price
stability.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of OPEC regular meeting on Wednesday, Aghazadeh told
reporters here that he was dissatisfied with the current oil prices
that had dropped sharply since January and urged OPEC to stop
the trend. Oil prices depended on actions OPEC took in the market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC sets the production ceiling for its members at 25.03
million barrels daily, but the real output is some 2 million
beyond.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have plunged from 23 U.S. dollars a barrel by 1996's
end to the current level of about 17 dollars, well below OPEC's
target of 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts suggest oil prices will continue to be
weak in the international market whatever the results the regular
meeting would achieve, because oil reserves have risen quickly
worldwide making OPEC members less competitive with the non-OPEC
members.

<HEADLINE> Italian Senate Approves Government's Financial Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Senate today endorsed a
government plan to bring down budgetary deficit to within three
percent of gross domestic product by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of parliament's endorsement came in its
approval of the government's 1998-2000 economic and financial
plan, which sets binding objectives for trimming the deficit.
</P>
<P>
As a key part of the document, the lower deficit would keep
Italy in line with a crucial parameter of the Maastricht treaty
for entry into the European single currency set to launch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government plan calls for cutting the deficit by at least
25 trillion lire (about 15 billion U.S. dollars) in two years.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 10 trillion lire (6 billion dollars) would be
made up by new taxes and revenues and the remaining 15 trillion
lire (9 billion dollars) by savings from government spending.
</P>
<P>
The planning document, submitted by the government in May,
passed the Chamber of Deputies, or the lower house of parliament,
on Friday.

GUANGZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zhujiang River, or Pearl

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Votes to End Bosnia Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives today, in a 278-148 vote, called for an end of
funding to U.S. military operations in Bosnia after June 30, 1998,
though the Pentagon opposes this strongly.
</P>
<P>
The date to end U.S. participation in the U.N. peacekeeping
mission was agreed by President Bill Clinton. But the Defense
Department fears that a mandatory withdrawal date would put
U.S. troops in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Franklin Raines, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said administration officials will
recommend the president veto the 1998 defense authorization bill
if the Bosnia withdrawal amendment is included in the final
version.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on its version of the 268.2
billion U.S. dollar defense bill next month.

Authorities point out that the tremendous amount of cargo
moving along the Zhujiang has led to its boom. Statistics show
that Guangdong now has 490,000 Hong Kong-funded enterprises which
have moved their factories to the interior and marketed their
products overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, large quantities of goods from Hunan, Guizhou,
and Guangxi have also been shipped along the Zhujiang to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The number of ships going to Hong Kong along the Zhujiang
reached 112,000 in 1996, handling more than 38 million tons of
cargo and accounting for one-eighth of Hong Kong's total handling
capacity, according to statistics from Hong Kong's Port
Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Container transport has been increasing at an annual rate of 35
percent in recent years on the Zhujiang. Now six of every ten
containers handled by Hong Kong are shipped by the Zhujiang either
way.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) of the
Guangdong Provincial Communications Department, nearly a billion
yuan will be invested in expanding and upgrading inland river
ports, in a bid to further tap the Zhujiang's potentiality.
</P>
<P>
Economists note that the further development of the river's
transport will enable Hong Kong to push its economic growth
northward into the inland areas of south China.

<HEADLINE> Agrochemical Sector Co-operation Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior chemical industry officials
reaffirmed their determination to improve international
co-operation in the agrochemical sector, according to today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Chemical Industry Minister Gu Xiulian urged foreign chemical
companies to bolster technology exchanges and expand economic
co-operation in the agrochemical industry with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Through joint effort, co-operation in technology, funds and
equipment, the agrochemical sector can be pushed into a new stage,
Gu said Tuesday at the opening ceremony of a two-day China
International Agrochemical Conference '97 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We warmly welcome friends from all countries to establish
joint ventures and co-operate in various forms," said the
minister, adding that her ministry intends to create a better
investment environment and working conditions for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongwu, vice-minister of the chemical industry, said that
foreign co-operation in the agro-chemical sector holds an
important position in the ministry's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
More than 30 of the ministry's 80 well-selected key projects
that seek foreign investment will involve the agrochemical
industry, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
To promote Sino-foreign co-operation in the agrochemical
sector, the ministry will take the following major measures:
</P>
<P>
Expand the sources of foreign funds utilization. During the
Ninth Five-Year Plan, the ministry, in addition to foreign
governmental loans, will make full use of foreign export credit
and commercial loans and absorb investment from big-name
transnational companies. Foreign investment will be encouraged to
flow toward new and high-tech projects, and projects located in
the central and western areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Construct a number of key projects. China will build a number
of large chemical projects equipped with advanced
technology. Breakthroughs are anticipated in establishing joint
ventures producing farm pesticides, rubber products and compound
fertilizers. Foreign companies are invited to establish joint or
co-operative firms through technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Introduce foreign advanced technology and equipment according
to State industrial policy. Efforts will be made to import
advanced technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Create a sound investment environment. During the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, a management network on the protection of chemical
industry intellectual property rights will be established and
administrative management will be enhanced to guarantee the
promulgation and implementation of regulations concerning
intellectual property rights protection.

<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The nation's biggest beer producer
is entering the stock market with an offer of 80 million A-shares,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Yanjing Brewery Co Ltd will issue shares today in order to
raise 570 million yuan (68 million US dollars), the company
announced recently.
</P>
<P>
Stock in the Beijing-based company will be listed on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange after the issuance is completed.
</P>
<P>
According to a prospectus, proceeds from the sale of shares
will be used to expand the company's annual beer producing
capacity from 600,000 tons to 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the companys' plan to raise its
production is based on the popularity of its products.
</P>
<P>
Market surveys found that Yanjing brand beer is the first
choice of beer drinkers in 35 of China's big cities.
</P>
<P>
Its production and sales, standing at 590,000 tons in 1996,
tops beer makers in China.
</P>
<P>
Today in Beijing, Yanjing beer, with 85 percent of the city's
beer market, can be seen in almost every restaurant. In Tianjin,
it has taken 25 percent of the market. Other northern Chinese
cities also report its popularity.
</P>
<P>
Hot sales of its beer has pushed the company's net profits to
jump to 143 million yuan last year from 67 million yuan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
These achievements have encouraged the company to increase its
annual capacity to one million tons by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Seminar Reviews Role of Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior trade officials and
researchers called for fair treatment of transnationals which
bring both pluses and minuses to the Chinese economy, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
While transnational companies have channeled in money China
badly needs, they have also sometimes backed domestic firms into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of transnationals holding majority shares in
joint ventures lies in their willingness to transfer advanced
technology and sufficient capital to China, delegates to a Beijing
seminar agreed.
</P>
<P>
But some feared powerful foreign investors would crush domestic
industries.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held against a recent drop in overall foreign
investment in China, prompting nationwide debate on how best to
court foreign money.
</P>
<P>
Transnational are understood to have bucked the declining trend
of foreign investment because - backed by strong financial power -
they are less liable to China's tariffs that tend to affect
smaller foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
There have been worries among some Chinese that the national
interest and economic sovereignty would be at stake if
transnationals control business in more sectors.
</P>
<P>
"If does not matter who is the big boss. What we need is our
own growth," said a company manager.
</P>
<P>
But is was agreed that an anti-monopoly law should come out as
soon as possible to prevent transnationals from cornering a
certain industry.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also urged the State to publicize investment guides
telling transnationals where they can or cannot hold a major
stake.

ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia have rejected a call by leading industrialized countries
for a broad-based government, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, with two-thirds of Afghanistan under their
control, was inclusive enough to satisfy all Afghans, the
Taliban's "Deputy Minister for Information and Culture" Abdul
Rahman Hotaki was quoted as saying Tuesday in Kabul.

The Taliban, who captured the capital Kabul last September,
would set about consolidating their administration on their own

broad-based government.

The G8, which includes Group of Seven (G7) members of Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, plus

MADRID, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chris Boardman enjoyed a bigger
overall lead after a third-place finish on Tuesday in the sixth
stage of the Tour of Catalonia.
</P>
<P>
Boardman, a time-trial specialist, showed his strength against
the climbers by finishing third, just nine seconds behind winner
Fernando Escartin of Spain.
</P>
<P>
With other challengers stumbled, Escartin moved into second
place overall, one minute 36 seconds behind the British rider.
</P>
<P>
The 160-km stage had proved largely uneventful until the tough
four-km climb to the finish.
</P>
<P>
Boardman kept with the pace as a series of riders attempted to
break for the line, while Escartin, a mountain expert, finally got
clear of the pack.
</P>
<P>
The 237-km leg between Gerona and Pal, in the mountain state of
Andorra, is the toughest of the race and is the last realistic
chance for Boardman's challengers to deny him overall victory.

<HEADLINE> Inter Stands firm over Ronaldo Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian football club Inter Milan
reacted angrily on Tuesday to suggestions from FIFA that it may
have contravened international transfer regulations in its signing
Ronaldo from Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Inter, being backed by the Italian federation, was adamant that
it had done nothing wrong and was hopeful that it would get the
all-clear to take Ronaldo to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said
that the transfer of the Brazilian striker may have contravened
its international transfer regulations even though the Italian
club claimed to have secured his services.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo's lawyers claim the world footballer of the year is a
free-agent, having obtained his release from Barcelona last Friday
when he bought out his contract for four billion pesetas ($27.6
million).
</P>
<P>
But FIFA rules state that a player cannot buy out his contract
for the purposes of obtaining an international transfer and that
the withdrawal clauses in Spanish league contracts are valid for
domestic transfers only. Moves abroad must be negotiated by the
two teams.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) - Phoenix point guard Kevin
Johnson has thought twice and will return to play for the Suns in
1997-98 after previously announcing his retirement from the NBA.

A three-time All-Star whose career has been plagued by nagging
injuries, Johnson missed 12 games last season but led the Suns
with 20.1 points and 9.3 assists per game.

following Senate rejection last night of government plans for
voluntary postal election of delegates.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- A major diplomatic row has broken out between Australia and

continue to oppose legally binding uniform targets on greenhouse
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Age

<HEADLINE> Dam to Help Tame Capricious Waterway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River will be tamed
when a major dam is built across its troublesome middle reaches,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Zhang Jiyao,
vice-minister of water resources who is in charge of the project
as saying that the Xiaolangdi Dam, getting its name for nearing a
village known as Xiaolangdi, about 40 kilometers north of Luoyang,
in central China's Henan province, is set for completion on
October 31 as construction work accelerates with international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest project of its kind on the Yellow River,
Xiaolangdi Dam is estimated to cost 4.5 million US dollars with
about 1.2 billion US dollars in loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the project will enable the river to withstand
the once-in-1,000-year flood, and it will also solve the river's
ice floods in early spring, with its reservoir designed to
minimize heavy silt build-up, irrigate farmland with four billion
cubic meters of water each year and generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The project is one of the most challenging in dam-building
history because of the complex geological structure of the site,
its large scale, engineering difficulties and about 200,000 local
people who have to be relocated, the paper says.

The survey said blacks and Asians polled were most supportive
with 74 per cent and 75 per cent respectively supporting
government involvement.

<HEADLINE> Second Seed Chang Crashed out of Wimbledon Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- World number two Michael Chang
of the United States crashed out of the Wimbledon Open Tennis
Championshiops Tuesday evening after losing a five-set battle to
Todd Woodbridge of Australia 6-7, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, 6-8.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was also downed by a Spanish player at the first
round of 1996 Wimbledon Championships, put up an extraordinary
fightback after losing first two sets, but the fifth seed was
unable to turn the tables around at the final set.
</P>
<P>
With Chang's victorious opponent rating the match as the
biggest win of his career, the American Chinese was obviously
unhappy, saying "it's a little disappointing, but I have the rest
of the season to look forward to."
</P>
<P>
Another major seeded casualty is Brzalian Gustavo Kuerton. The
new French Open champion also lost a five-set battle to Justin
Gimelstob of the United States 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 4-6.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Mark Philippoussis of Austrialia, one of the most
powerful servers in the world, was also defeated by Britain's
non-seeded player Greg Rusedski 6-7, 6-7, 3-6.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world number one Pete Sampras, Boris Becker of
Germany, Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov and other major seeds also
ousted their opponents in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, world number one Martina Hingsi of
Switzerland enjoyed a smooth sailing into the second round by
defeating Anne Kremer of Luxembourg in straight sets 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Despite of fierce resistance from her strong opponent, the
16-year-old Hingis, also the women's top seed, played some
astonishing tennis and finally snatched the first victory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eighth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicarrio of Spain, Ank
Huber of Germay and 10th seed Conchita Martinez also entered the
next round.

<HEADLINE> Small Island States Urges Actions Against Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Fearing of submersion,
small island states today called for actions against global
warming in the general debate at the 19th Special Session of the
General Assembly, which was opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
These nations, including Cyprus, Caribbean nations and Pacific
archipelagos, said their survival was threatened by the rise of
sea level, resulting from growing emission of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of Maldives said that "80
percent of low-lying islands such as those of the Maldives and
many in the Pacific Ocean would be totally submerged" if global
warming was not curbed.
</P>
<P>
"The process may be too gradual to make sensational headlines,
but the threat, nevertheless, would be no less real," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Jacob Nena of the Pacific Micronesia chain
said rising sea levels and more frequent storms had wiped out food
sources and some smaller atolls had already had to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
"Help us, help all of us, including yourselves, to see that the
legacy of Rio is not lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
The representative of Papua New Guinea, Ututa U. Samana said
his country was concerned by the lack of progress on climate
change. Activities threating the global atmosphere and contributed
to dangerous rises in sea levels threatened the existence of
people throughout the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Governments are negotiating a treaty to cut back greenhouse
gases. The Europeans have set specific goals but neither the
United States, Canada nor Japan have agreed to their targets of
reducing emissions by 15 percent below the 1990 levels by 2010.

<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A new international airport being

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises House Approval of MFN for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today praised the House of Representatives for backing his
decision to extend the MFN trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives this afternoon voted 259 to 173 to
turn down a bill, staged by Republican Representative Gerald
Solomon, of disapproving Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
"Today's vote was a vote for America's interests," Clinton said
in a statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"It sends a clear signal to our friends and foes alike that
when it comes to America's security and prosperity, our nation
speaks with one voice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed the House's
approval for China's MFN status.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce thanked the 259 members of the
House of Representatives who voted today to grant Most Favored
Nation status to China as critical to maintaining normal trade
relations with the world's most populous nation," John Howard,
Chamber director of international policy and programs, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S Chamber of Commerce has been a strong supporter for
permanent MFN status for China as a means to avoid the wrenching
annual debates, and again called for granting a permanent status.
</P>
<P>
"This annual review harms our credibility, costs us business
and helps our competitors," said Howard.

<HEADLINE> House Approves MFN for China With Healthy Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives
today rejected an attempt to overrule a decision made by President
Bill Clinton to extend the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status
for China, and approved to maintain the normal trade relations
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
The result came after Representatives turned down with a
healthy majority of 259-173 a bill, staged by Republican
Representative Gerald Solomon, of disapproving President Clinton's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Supporters for the normal trade relations between the United
States and China believed revocation of China's MFN could simply
deal damaging blows to the Sino-U.S. relations and affect greatly
U.S. strategic interests in the Asian Pacific region as well as
U.S. economic interests as the Sino-U.S. trade provides a great
amount of opportunities of jobs and cheap consumer goods for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Last year supporters of MFN, a misnomer for normal trade
relations enjoyed by almost every U.S. trading partner, won easily
286 to 141.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Representative Charles Rangel said he believed the
result of the vote could continue the dialogue between the two
countries and create jobs for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Clinton's decision of renewal of China's MFN also
said that cutting off normal trade ties would end up backfiring on
the United States and hurt Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
House Ways and Means trade subcommittee Chairman Philip Crane,
a Republican representative, said 50 percent of China's exports to
the United States and 49 percent of U.S. exports to China flow
through Hong Kong which is to return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Denying MFN to China would threaten 70,000 jobs in Hong Hong,"
Crane said.
</P>
<P>
The White House got a boost in its defense of normal trade with
China on the eve of the House's debate over China's MFN when three
former presidents, six former secretaries of state and 10 former
defense secretaries wrote letters saying withholding normal trade
relations with China was the wrong way to go.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: North Urged to Fulfill Commitment to Agenda 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNINTED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Though the concept of
sustainable development had now been accepted worldwide, efforts
of developing countries to implement Agenda 21 had continued to be
hampered by lack of resources, the 19th special session of the
General Assembly was told today.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly
of Cuba, urged the North countries to pay their ecological debt
since their irrational consumption patterns were responsible for
the environment's deterioration. They should not only change those
patterns but also transfer to the underdeveloped nations
environmentally rational technologies in the preferential terms
defined at Rio. Instead, the developed countries were trying to
change their Rios commitments and to set arbitrary restrictions
that would make sustainable development more difficult for the
underdeveloped world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world's poor had multiplied and become poorer
since the 1992 Rio Conference. There were 358 people in the world
whose assets exceed the combined annual income of states inhabited
by 2.5 billion people, some 45 percent of the world's population.
Official development assistance (ODA) had dropped to 1983 levels
while the debt service of third world countries was more than
three times ODA.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, president of Bolivia, said that
developing countries were striving to eradicate poverty and
developed countries wished to prevent a repetition of mistakes
made. Differences between members of the international community
did not justify the lack of progress since Rio.
</P>
<P>
Economic development must be combined with social development
and environmental protection. It was a shared responsibility. The
international community must demonstrate pro-active solidarity.
Resources from official development assistance must be increased
and utilized appropriately for the well-being of all people, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ohn Gyaw, minister for foreign affairs of Myanmar, said that
the last five years had made it clear that sustainable development
programs had inflicted considerable burdens on the developing
countries. It was sad that many developing countries were faced
with a declining volume of official development assistance and it
was crucial that the developed countries reaffirm their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, president of Maldives, stressed that
global climate change was a very real threat to small island
states. The Barbados conference on small island developing states
was an important follow-up to Agenda 21. But nothing had been
achieved since that conference in the way of additional resource
mobilization, technology transfer and capacity-building for
sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails Holbrooke's Statements on Cyprus as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today hailed
the statements by U.S. special presidential envoy on the Cyprus
issue Richard Holbrooke as positive.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Monday that he firmly opposed linking the Cyprus
problem with Greek-Turkish relations, especially concerning the
Aegean. The Cyprus issue should be resolved within the framework
of a single sovereign state, he added.
</P>
<P>
The solution of a single sovereignty in the framework of a
bi-zonal and bi-communal federation seemed unavoidable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that the
U.S. envoy seemed to want to deal in "a systematic and diligent
way" with efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Athens would wait for him to undertake the
initiative and should judge him in practice.
</P>
<P>
The government believed that Holbrooke's initiative would be
manifested after quite some time, possibly following forthcoming
direct talks between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and elections in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since Turkey "invaded" in 1974
following a Greek-engineered coup on the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash will meet on July 9 in New York for
U.N.-sponsored talks.

<HEADLINE> Dow Bounces Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rallied
back today, adding more than 150 points to the Dow Jones
industrial average, as investors made a buying opportunity of
Monday's steep selloff.
</P>
<P>
The Dow recouped 153.80 points to 7,758.06. The blue chip gauge
plummeted 192 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume reaching 542.65
million shares, up from 492.70 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 17.72 to 896.34, and
the NYSE composite index rose 7.68 to 466.17, leaving both
measures less than 2 points shy of record territory.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.11 points to 1,452.43,
beating last Thursday's record finish at 1,447.14.
</P>
<P>
But the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.56 to
619.86.
</P>
<P>
Stocks had started the session strong as investors decided that
the previous day's selloff was an overreaction to a perceived
threat by Japan to dump U.S. bonds.
</P>
<P>
Higher consumer confidence suggests increased spending, which
could aggravate inflationary pressures at the nation's busy
factories.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
today welcomed a majority of House representatives endorsing
continued trade relations with China by rejecting an attempt to
overturn President Bill Clinton's decision for the renewal of MFN
for China.

"This annual review harms our credibility, costs us business
and helps our competitors," said John Howard, Chamber director of
international policy and programs.
</P>
<P>
"American companies exported nearly 12 billion dollars worth of
products to China last year," he said. "This supported at least
170,000 high-wage American jobs. And the World Bank estimated that
China must invest 746 billion dollars in infrastructure
development over the next decade -- a potentially huge market for
U.S. products and services."
</P>
<P>
"If MFN had not been renewed, China surely would have
retaliated against U.S. exports, placing this thriving market in
jeopardy, helping our competitors," he said.
