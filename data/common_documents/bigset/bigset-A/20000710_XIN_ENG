at the inaugural function, adding that among the beneficiaries of
the foundation, 71 percent will be women.

<HEADLINE> MILF Denies Fall of Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) denied that its headquarters was taken by Philippine
government forces on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu said government troops only captured
the west side of Camp Abubakar, the MILF headquarters, in the
province of Maguindanao in the southern island of Mindanao,
according to a report of the ABS-CBN news channel.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada announced earlier in the
day that the military seized Camp Abubakar at around 11 a.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said government soldiers have seized major structures inside
the sprawling 10,000-hectare camp, including the armory where the
retreating MILF fighters left huge cache of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Eight soldiers were killed during the offensive while 37 others
were wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, reportedly informed the president that MILF
resistance was light contrary to its earlier pronouncement that
its fighters would defend Camp Abubakar at all cost.
</P>
<P>
With Camp Abubakar now in government hands, President Estrada
said his administration can move with more speed in transforming
Mindanao into a progressive economic center.
</P>
<P>
"With this development, we can look forward to faster
government efforts to give Mindanaoans the quality of life they
long deserve," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military began launching attacks on Camp Abubakar after the
MILF failed to meet a June 30 deadline set by the president to
sign an interim peace deal with the government and rejected
government demands to abandon its bid for independence and stop
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 soldiers reportedly had been deployed to take the
camp, supported by dozens of armored vehicles, Howitzers, bomber
aircraft and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Air Force light bombers and helicopter gunships
alternately conduct daily airstrikes on rebel positions in the
past week to soften the defenses around the camp.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada ordered the military on Friday to arrest top
MILF leaders once Camp Abubakar is overrun, saying that "They
should be captured because they are challenging the sovereignty of
this country."
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, threatened earlier to
retaliate if the government forces continue to attack Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between government troops and MILF fighters have
reportedly displaced at least 500,000 civilians since late April
when the military launched attacks on rebel encampments along the
Narciso Ramos Highway in Maguindanao.

<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
declared that the military overran the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front's (MILF) headquarters Camp Abubakar in the southern island
of Mindanao on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Camp Abubakar, which took place at around 11 a.m.
Sunday, will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and
lasting peace and development in Mindanao, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said government soldiers have seized major structures inside
the camp, including the armory where the retreating MILF fighters
left huge cache of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reportedly rests on a 10,000-hectare territory in
Matanog in the province of Maguindanao, housing six Muslim
communities in the area as well as the residences of MILF leaders
led by Chairman Hashim Salamat. Several military and civilian
facilities are also said to be inside the camp.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said government troops are now consolidating forces,
setting upperimeter security around the camp, and checking for
landmines left by MILF fighters who abandoned their stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Eight soldiers were killed during the offensive while 37 others
were wounded, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces
of the Philippines, reported to him that MILF resistance was light

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Urges More Funding for African Anti-AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Peter Piot, executive director
of the UN joint program on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS, on Sunday called for
a dramatic increase in spending on HIV/AIDS so as to meet the most
basic care and prevention needs in sub-Saharan Africa.
Speaking at the opening of the 13th International AIDS Conference
in Durban, he said that "the increasing global imbalance in
resources fuels the fire of HIV/AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, 3 billion U.S. dollars is needed for basic care
and prevention in Africa -- before we even consider the issue of
combination therapy. Incredibly, this figure is almost ten times
what is being spent today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Piot called on the governments of affected countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, donor governments, and other important
sectors, including business, to dramatically increase the
resources dedicated to HIV/AIDS care and prevention in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He noted that several countries in the developed world had
recently increased their contributions to address the global
epidemic, but much more had to be done.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the governments of the world's wealthiest
countries to cancel the debt of many of the hardest hit African
nations, so the billions of dollars spent on debt service could be
used on health care and HIV/AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries with the highest overseas debt are also
among the most severely affected by HIV/AIDS, and debt service
savings could be used for programs to provide care and reduce HIV
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Piot noted that African countries pay the world's richest
nations 15 billion dollars in debt repayment every year, while the
total domestic and international spending on AIDS in Africa barely
tops 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This drastic imbalance in resources is costing millions of
lives a year," said Piot.
</P>
<P>
"Current efforts are simply inadequate. The entire world must
do more."
</P>
<P>
This year's International AIDS Conference is being held for
the first time in Africa, where adult HIV infection rates top 25
percent in several nations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a global report by UNAIDS on the epidemic showed
that as many as two out of three 15-year-olds in the hardest hit
African nations, such as Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, were
expected to die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, the region hardest hit by AIDS, there
were four million new HIV infections during 1999 and the epidemic
continued to spread.
</P>
<P>
AIDS now kills ten times more people a year than war on the
African Continent, according to UN statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar has reiterated that the unity and peaceful co-existence
of all segments of the society are the highest priorities of the
present civilian government, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public function in northern city of Kano, capital
of Kano State, on Saturday, Abubakar reiterated that no amount of
blackmail and intimidation would make the government renege in
its resolve to ensure the peaceful co-existence cherished by all
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks in an apparent response to the recent
 development of the country of which some communities are
proposing the confederation.
</P>
<P>
The government valued the spirit of unity and harmony that
exist among the societies and vowed that the government led by
President Olusegun Obasanjo would not slack in its commitment to
ensure a peace nation, said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that diversities of tribe and culture of
Nigeria would enhance the government's efforts to a nation of
unity and harmony.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Barak Departs for Summit, Lack of Political Backing by Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
left here Monday night for crucial negotiations in the United
States with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But this time he does
not have enough political backing at home.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the commencement of the summit at Camp David near
Washington, three coalition partners, Yisrael Ba'aliya, National
Religious party and Shas, defected in a maneuver basically aimed at
derailing the summit.
</P>
<P>
They suspected that Barak has filled his briefcase with
concessions to the Palestinians, which they said would cause
disaster for the state of Israel, damage its national security and
interests.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the three parties took the Barak government
down to 13 cabinet ministers from 22, and more importantly, reduced
his coalition from 68 members to 42 in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Foreign Minister David Levy will not go to the summit
with Barak, citing that the Palestinian side is not ready to make
compromise on all issues the two sides will try to settle at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party has been trying its best to sabotage
the summit. Shortly before Barak's departure for Washington, it
tried to topple the government by asking the Knesset to vote its
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Never before has an Israeli leader embarked on such a crucial
mission for his country amid such a domestic crisis. Barak and
Arafat are going to try to conclude a framework agreement that
contains principles for a permanent settlement of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, under Clinton's watchful eye at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The disintegration of Barak's government is also causing serious
concern in the U.S. Administration. The Americans are worried that
Barak will arrive at the critical summit without power to make hard
decisions the summit will require.
</P>
<P>
Barak has brushed off his coalition crisis and turned to the
public with a plea to support him in his endeavors for peace. He
promised that, if a peace agreement is reached, he will bring it
before the people in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Barak further pledged to abide by the "red lines" he set for the
summit, which include no return to the 1967 lines, no foreign army
west of the Jordan River, Israel has no moral responsibility for
the Palestinian refugees, the majority of the settlers will be in
settlement blocs under Israeli sovereignty and Jerusalem will
remain united and under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Despite Barak's "red lines," the summit has to resolve the above
mentioned issues and Barak promised that he will bring home a peace
deal with the Palestinians which will strengthen Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Barak has indicated that the Jerusalem
and refugee issues are too complicated to be settled right now and
suggested to negotiate their settlement in the future. The
Palestinian side has reportedly agreed to that, but asking Israel
to give something in return by making compromise on other issues.
</P>
<P>
An opportunity to reach a comprehensive peace with the
Palestinians, and subsequently with the Arab states, now looms in
front of Israel. Missing it would mean fanning the dispute to
almost inconceivable levels of tension and strife.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that without political backing
at home, it is more difficult for Barak to make hard decisions at
the summit. But Barak is determined to strike the framework
agreement with Arafat and the summit could produce some positive
results if the two sides make compromises.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Committed to Egyptian-Libyan Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese opposition alliance on
Monday reiterated its endorsement of and commitment to an Egyptian-
Libyan initiative aimed at helping realize peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) stressed its stance on
Sudan's reconciliation process in a statement released after a
meeting held in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
NDA groups Sudan's northern Muslim opposition parties, which
want to share power with the government, and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), which has been fighting a 17-year war with
the government for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian and
animist-populated southern states.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance supports a call, included in the
Egyptian-Libyan initiative, for a peace conference between the
Sudanese government and the opposition to seek national
reconciliation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed last year a five-point peace plan,
calling for a permanent ceasefire between the Sudanese government
and the SPLA, besides the peace gathering.
</P>
<P>
The NDA leadership appreciated Egypt's efforts to coordinate
with the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD) on mediating peace in Sudan, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, IGAD has sponsored several rounds of talks between
the Sudanese government and the SPLA. But little tangible
achievement has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The NDA appealed to Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime
minister and leader of the Ummah Party, to rejoin the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi, formerly a key leader of the opposition, broke away
from the alliance after signing a peace agreement with the
government in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been keen on mediating between the Sudanese government
and the opposition in a bid to safeguard the territorial integrity
of its southern neighbor, for fear that a possible disintegration
of Sudan may jeopardize its major water source, the Nile.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Ugandan President
Yoweri Moseveni have been invited to attend the next round of
Burundi peace talks which may lead to the signing of a peace deal
to end the six-year civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, scheduled for Wednesday next week in Tanzania'
s northern town of Arusha, will be under the facilitation of
former South African president Nelson Mandela, according to
Mandela's chief aid Judge Mark Bomani on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Heads of state from Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and
Burundi have been invited to attend the upcoming talk, " Bomani
told Tanzania's official Daily News.
</P>
<P>
A date for the signing of the peace deal is yet to be set, but
the mediation team hopes that the agreement might be signed in the
course of the talks to be conducted through next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Broadcasting Corporation last week quoted
Mandela as saying that a peace deal may be signed on Thursday next
week.
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence that we will be able to sign a peace
agreement on July 20," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has mediated the Burundi conflict since December last
year after the death of previous mediator, former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been trying to speed up the talks, which have
dragged on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and the rebels from the
Hutu majority since civil conflict broke out in the tiny central
African country in October 1993.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Makes Efforts to Improve Computer Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plan includes a major new education program to improve
Internet skills, as well as better electronic communications
between the government and public.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet announced its Internet literacy drive based on a
study, which found that Switzerland is lagging behind several of
its competitors, including the United States, Sweden and Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to the study by a government-appointed commission,
Switzerland has a sophisticated information and communications
infrastructure but that there is a shortage of skills needed to
run it.
</P>
<P>
In response, the government has launched an education drive,
aimed initially at teachers. The objective, according to the
cabinet, is to create a "virtual learning space", using special
education software specifically designed for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for communications technology to improve
governmental contact with the public. "Action plan e-government"
is intended to make the state apparatus more "customer friendly",
and envisages linking, via Internet, the federal government with
the cantons and communes.
</P>
<P>
The plan also wants to establish "e-voting", whereby
Switzerland could hold paperless ballots. It is thought this would
yield a substantial saving, given that Swiss voters participate in
numerous referenda every year.
</P>
<P>
The third objective is to better regulate "e-commerce", chiefly
to tighten up tax loopholes. As a first step, the government
approved new rules compelling companies to register their e-
commerce activities in May. However, the study concluded that e-
commerce needs to be regulated internationally.
</P>
<P>
The study predicts that the education drive alone will cost
around 80 million Swiss francs (about 50 million U.S. dollars)
between 2001 and 2004. It says sales of excess gold reserves by
the Swiss National Bank could be used to fund the project after
2005 to the tune of SFr75 million over six to eight years.
</P>
<P>
The government is due to vote on the funding next year, as part
of the finance plan for 2002-04.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Hold Phone Talks on Okinawa Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton held a
phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday on
upcoming Okinawa G8 summit and U.S. failed missile defense system
test, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time that President Putin has picked up the
phone and called President Clinton so I think that's evidence that
they are establishing a businesslike relationship," White House
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said much of the conversation was about the upcoming G8
summit, scheduled on July 21-23, in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
They also mentioned the failed missile defense system test
conducted on Saturday, and the two presidents would discuss the
NMD system in the summit, he added.
</P>
<P>
"President Putin briefly mentioned that he was aware that the
test on Saturday had failed but that they would talk about missile
defense in Okinawa within the context of following up on their
discussion when the president was in Moscow" in June, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said earlier in Moscow
that President Putin would try to persuade Clinton to drop plans
to deploy the NMD system and offer new initiatives, including
further cuts to nuclear arsenals, to boost the case against the
NMD system, which Moscow said would be a threat to global
stability.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Clinton would hear from his national security team
before deciding whether to move the defense system forward.

<HEADLINE> 12 Percent of Swiss Timber Production FSC-Certified by Year-end  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Up to 12 percent of Swiss timber
will be certified under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) by
the end of 2000, following recent and forthcoming certification of
forests in several parts of the country, according to the
Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
"This rapid ongoing FSC-certification process is crucial to the
competitiveness of the Swiss forest industry," said Damian Oettli,
Head of WWF-Switzerland's forest campaign. "Forest owners can show
their commitment to environmentally and socially responsible
forest management practices, while the FSC label provides them
with an economic asset."
</P>
<P>
This development is the result of the adoption of Swiss
national standards on forest certification in June 1999. These
standards include - among other things - a commitment to establish
protected areas accounting for 10 percent of the certified forests.
WWF-Switzerland the Swiss Forest Owners Association, and other
major stakeholders have signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The independent evaluation and monitoring, the support of
environmental NGOs, and the worldwide presence of FSC
certification schemes were factors that encouraged the canton of
Solothurn's forest owners to have their forests certified under
the FSC," said Thomas Wallner, Swiss Canton Solothurn's Minister
of Economic Affairs. "FSC certification will also strengthen our
position on the timber market as, in addition to keeping our
present market share and customers, we will gain new ones."
</P>
<P>
The demand for FSC products is rapidly increasing in
Switzerland. The Swiss "Druckerei ropress Genossenschaft" was the
first print shop in the world to be certified. And Migros, the
country's largest retailer, offers a wide range of FSC timber
products to its customers. The company joined the WWF Woodgroup (
Switzerland) - a member of the Global Forest and Trade Network
coordinated by WWF - in 1997, and has actively supported the FSC
since then.
</P>
<P>
The FSC is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental
organization which enables the certification of well-managed
forests. More than 180 forests in 32 countries worldwide have been
independently certified under its auspices and over 10,000 FSC-
labelled products are now available around the globe.

<HEADLINE> Besieged U.N. Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone Low on Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
voiced alarm about its besieged peacekeepers in Sierra Leone,
saying they only had 10 days of supplies left and floods make it
impossible to bring in more goods.
</P>
<P>
Some 222 Indian peacekeepers and 11 unarmed U.N. military
observers have been surrounded for two months by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in their stronghold Kailahun,
some 320 kilometers east of the nation's capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"The effective re-supply of the U.N. mission contingent has
not been possible for a considerably amount of time. They now have
10 days worth of rations left," spokesman Marie Okabe said on
behalf of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is in Togo to
attend the summit of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
She said that rains have flooded roads, making it nearly
impossible for vehicles to reach the area. On Friday, the rebels
refused to allow a helicopter bringing supplies to land.
</P>
<P>
"So there was an escalation of obstacles in trying to re-supply
them," Okabe said. "We are taking the situation very seriously and
every effort is made to re-supply them by every possible means."
</P>
<P>
Okabe also said a large arms cache was found in the Lungi area
in the north but she had no further details.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Annan asked Liberia, whose leader is close with
rebel leader Foday Sankoh, to help gain the release of encircled U.
N. soldiers, saying he was "extremely concerned" about the troops.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who is in currently the government custody, violated
the Lome peace accord signed in July last year, and the RUF
fighters took U.N. soldiers hostage, and disarm them as they are
in the West African country to monitor the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Creates Heating Oil Reserve For Northeast Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
created Monday a temporary 2 million barrel heating oil reserve
for Northeast states, where fuel shortages put a squeeze on
households trying to stay warm during last winter's severe cold.
</P>
<P>
Through administrative action, Clinton ordered that crude oil
be drawn from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and
exchanged for 2 million barrels of home-heating oil that can be
set aside as a separate reserve for Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
Under current law Clinton lacks the power to actually release
the oil, and he appealed to the Congress to approve a mechanism
for it.
</P>
<P>
"Winter may seem far off on this hot day, but if we don't do
something now, reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place
before the cold weather comes," Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"The action I take today will leave us far better prepared to
face the winter months but it does not relieve Congress of the
responsibility to act," he added.
</P>
<P>
Consumers in Northeastern states such as New York,
Massachusetts, Maine and others are more dependent on distillate
oil to heat homes than the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Last winter, heating oil prices soared above 2 U.S. dollars a
gallon after a cold snap and transportation problems combined to
sharply reduce supplies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have cautioned that this winter could also
mean tight supplies of home heating oil if U.S. utilities switch
from more costly natural gas to distillate to fuel their
electricity-generating plants.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans said that political motives were behind Clinton
's announcement. Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
presidential nominee, could face pressure in the fall from
Northeast voters for heating oil relief, which could hurt his
campaign against Republican George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the house of Representatives voted to create a 2
million barrel Northeast heating oil reserve, but failed to
provide the 10 million dollars needed to pay for it.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Destroys 45 Planes in Anti-Drug Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Air Force destroyed in
recent months 45 planes serving drug traffic said Minister of
Defense, Luis Fernnado Ramirez on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Putting out of action of the airplanes prevented arms entering
for guerrillas and drug exports, said Ramirez at an interview made
known Monday by radio station RCN.
</P>
<P>
Two bimotor planes which were "put out of action" this weekend
carried weapons coming from Brazil and headed for guerrillas in
jungles of Vapue, southeast Colombia, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, "banning of all planes carrying
weapons and transporting drugs will continue fully vehement
because that is where the drug trafficker makes highest earnings".
</P>
<P>
He said that the weapons guerrillas receive are made in
European countries, especially Russia and "arrive to foment
violence in Colombia".
</P>
<P>
The Minister asked the international community to make greater
efforts to control sending of arms and chemical precursors for
narcotic processing.
</P>
<P>
Control of weapon and chemical prcursor exports is a
fundamental strategy for success of "Plan Colombia", with which
President Andres Pastrana intends development, peace and drug
fighting in the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Handshake May Provide More Information to Others Than You Think </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A new study backed up what the
etiquette books have been saying all along, that a firm handshake
helps make a good first impression for both males and females.
</P>
<P>
The University of Alabama study, led by psychologist William F.
Chaplin, involved 112 men and women in college. The students
completed four personality questionnaires and shook hands twice
with four handshake coders who had a month of training and
practice in shaking hands and evaluating handshakes.
</P>
<P>
Before the handshaking, the students did not know their
handshakes were being evaluated however.
</P>
<P>
Those with a firm handshake were more extroverted and open to
experience and less neurotic and shy than those with a less firm
or limp handshake, Chaplin and his colleagues said in the July
issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
Men tended to have firmer handshakes than women. And women who
are more liberal, intellectual and open to new experiences had a
firmer handshake and make a more favorable impression than those
who were less open and had a less firm handshake.
</P>
<P>
"We did find that handshakes are stable and consistent across
time and gender," the researchers wrote. "Given What we know about
the potency of first impressions, it might be a good idea to heed
the recommendations of experts...and try to make that first
handshake a firm one."

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
left here on Monday for the Ben Gurion International airport on his
way to the Camp David summit due to begin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak has just survived a no-confidence vote aimed at toppling
his government and thwarting his efforts to conduct crucial
negotiations with the Palestinians in the United States-sponsored
three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
In the summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Barak will try to hammer out a framework
deal with the Palestinians for the settlement of such thorny issues
as the status of Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements,
borders, water resources and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The motions against Barak's government was voted 54 for, 52
against, with seven abstentions. Although the opposition failed to
rally 61 votes required in the 120-seat parliament to bring down
the government, the result of the vote showed Barak's lack of a
majority support in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
This fact, together with his shaky 42-seat minority coalition
government following the defection of three right-wing parties,
increased doubts about the prime minister's ability to make fateful
decisions and decisive compromises that the upcoming negotiations
will require.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Issues Arrest Warrant Against Fugitive Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court issued arrest
warrant on Monday against Eshaq Belanas, an Iranian Jew suspected
spy and who was said to have fled the country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Hussein Ali Amiri, head of justice of Iran's
southern Fars Province, the fugitive was head of a spy network
working for Israel and is currently in the United States, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran will seek arrest of the fugitive through the International
Police (Interpol), the official said. However, he did not say
whether the Interpol had agreed to cooperate in the action.
</P>
<P>
A court in Shiraz, capital of Fars, had tried 17 Iranian
nationals for spying for Israel, including 13 Jews and four
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the defendants, two Muslims and 10 Jews, got prison
terms of between two and 13 years, while the other five were
acquitted, according to a verdict issued on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Amiri said the spy case will remain open until all those
involved in spying for Israel are brought to justice. He added,
however, that the court will not make public the list of fugitive
suspects for the time being for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of the Jews early last year, Iran has been
under severe pressure from Western countries to release them.
Israel has denied that the Iranian Jews had worked for its secret
service.
</P>
<P>
After the court verdict on July 1, Western countries stepped up
their criticism and pressed Iran to overturn the sentences. Iran,
however, insists that the trial and verdict were rational and fair
and no foreign country should meddle in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Barak Fighting Survival at Home Prior to Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is fighting in the parliament on Monday for the survival of his
ruling coalition in a vote on no-confidence motions before he sets
out for the three-way Camp David summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak's way to the Camp David summit has been tough since he
tried in vain to keep three rebellious right-wing ruling partners
in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset (parliament) is having a heated debate on
two no-confidence motions. One submitted last week by the
opposition Likud party against "Barak's concessions and
capitulations to (Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat even before the
summit".
</P>
<P>
The other one was concerning the doctors' strike which has been
going on for four months. The two motions are expected to be put to
a simultaneous vote.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, bolstered by the 26 Knesset members from the
three parties that quit the government on Sunday, is going all out
in a bid to muster 61 votes necessary to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak joined the debate to defend his positions on the peace
talks with the Palestinians after returning from a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. He delayed his departure
for the United States so that he could be in the Knesset to deal
with the motions.
</P>
<P>
The grave-looking prime minister found his speech frequently
interrupted by the disagreeing voices. He put off the departure so
that he and Transport Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak from Center
Party, who is in the Israeli delegation for the summit, can cast a
vote.
</P>
<P>
Barak reiterated his "red lines" on the negotiations with the
Palestinians: no return to the 1967 lines, a united Jerusalem under
Israeli sovereignty, no foreign army west of the Jordan River, a
majority of the Jewish residents of West Bank and Gaza will remain
in settlement blocs, and no Israeli recognition of legal or moral
responsibility for creating the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he received the mandate from the people to
forge peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In emotional exposition of his stance, Barak said "I, as a
solider of 35 years, know the meaning of security and the pain of
loss of lives."
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the profound change in our life styles. ... Peace will
bring economic growth, employment, health and investment in
infrastructure.... equal opportunities for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said,"Israeli power will be maintained in the
future to ensure peace. Israel is proceeding toward peace because
it wants a peaceful future for the children."
</P>
<P>
The defection of the 17-seat ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, the
four-seat Yisrael Ba'aliya and the five-seat National Religious
Party leaves Barak with a coalition of only one-third seats of the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
However, he is expected to get support from the 10 Knesset
members form the Arab parties and the two members of the Democratic
Choice faction of Knesset Member Roman Bronfman.

BAGHDAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Minister of Commerce
Mourad Medelci arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Monday
evening to attend the Algerian-Iraqi Joint Committee meetings, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will tackle the issue of promoting bilateral
cooperation in all fields, said INA.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Medelci is expected to hold talks with senior
Iraqi officials and sign contracts with the Iraqi side within the
framework of the United Nations oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has signed contracts worth 70 million U.S. dollars
during the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian deal, which started in 1996, allows Iraq
to sell a certain amount of oil in every six months to buy food,
medicine and other necessities to help offset the impacts of the
stringent U.N. sanctions imposed since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, as an Arab country, has been calling on the U.N. as
well as the Arab League to lift the decade-old sanctions and put an
end to the suffering of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Submits Resignation Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
submitted his letter of resignation Monday evening, ending his
colorful careers as air force general, businessman, minister and
president.
</P>
<P>
The letter was submitted to Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham
Burg at his office by President Bureau's Director General Arye
Shumer on Weizman's behalf. The letter will take effect in 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who was elected president in 1993 and re-elected in
1998, should end his second term in 2003. However, he was forced to
leave the ceremonial post ahead of schedule after the revelation of
his financial irregularities with a French Jewish businessman and
the subsequent police investigation.
</P>
<P>
His early resignation was regarded as a heave loss to Israel's
peace camp, as the fighter-turned-peacemaker, one of the most
outspoken and popular politicians in the Jewish state, was firmly
committed to supporting peace talks with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The president was charged by Israeli media reports last December
with accepting a large sum of cash gifts from a French millionaire
while he was cabinet ministers and legislators between 1988 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
The police launched a criminal investigation against the
president in January. On May 24, Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein and Prosecutor Edna Arbel announced that they would
close the case, but accused Weizman of serious ethnical violations.
</P>
<P>
Some of the charges, Rubinstein said, were closed without a
recommendation to indict only because the statute of limitations on
the charges had expired.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Weizman informed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of his intention to resign on July.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, born in Tel Aviv on June 15, 1924, is a nephew of
Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann.
</P>
<P>
He served in the British Royal Air Force during the World War
II. Later, he helped found the air force of the newborn Jewish
state and became its commander in 1958. He retired in 1969 with the
rank of major general and turned to politics.
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he joined Menachem Begin's cabinet as defense minister
and played a major role in Camp David negotiations for the 1979
Israel-Egypt peace treaty, the first peace accord between Israel
and an Arab state.
</P>
<P>
He quit as minister in 1980 to pursue a business career, partly
because he felt the government was not doing enough to settle
Israel's conflict with other Arab nations and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He later quit the right-wing Likud faction to join the left-wing
Labor party. In 1992, he retired from active politics and was
elected as the seventh President of the State of Israel a year
later.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset's faction heads will discuss Weizman's
resignation later Monday evening and a statement will be made
subsequently to the plenum on date of a new presidential election
and the deadline for nomination of candidates.
</P>
<P>
The election, scheduled to take place on July 31, will be a
secret ballot in the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, if no candidate could get the minimum
61 votes in the first round, a second round will be held
immediately. If the impasse persists, a simple majority in the
third round will be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The two leading candidates now are former prime minister Shimon
Peres from the Labor party, and Likud Knesset member Moshe Katsav.
However, any group of 10 legislators could submit a candidate
before July 21, 10 days before the election.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of a new president will take place a day after
the election, or on August 1, before the Knesset begins its summer
recess August 4.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Burg, who is also vice-president, will serve as acting-
president during the interim period between Weizman's resignation
and the inauguration.

HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
failed to attend the annual Organization of African Unity (OAU)
summit which started in Togo on Monday, the first time since the
country won independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
It could not be immediately established why Mugabe did not
travel to Togo. According to presidential spokesman George
Charamba, Mugabe, who was being represented by his Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge at the summit, could not travel because he
was busy forming his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted informed sources in
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that Mugabe was
boycotting the summit together with leaders of other African
countries who disliked Togo being the venue because Togo supported
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebels in Angola.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the United Nations Security Council revealed
that countries such as Togo and Burkina Faso were breaching a U.N.
resolution of sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Angola had mobilized some southern African countries to boycott
the summit.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is currently
negotiating with five pharmaceutical companies for reduced prices
on HIV/AIDS drugs in African countries, said Public Relations
Officer of Uganda AIDS Commission Anne Nagawasi here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda Drug Initiative Program Manager Dorothy
Ochora, Uganda would want zero prices if possible, because it is a
poor developing country and can not afford the prices.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agencies involved in this endeavor include the UNAIDS,
the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the United
Nations Children's Fund. The drug companies involved are
Beohringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo Wellcome, Merck &AMP;
Co. Inc. and E Hoffman-la Roche.
</P>
<P>
So far only Glaxo Wellcome has publicly announced a reduction
in price of its Combivir, a kind of HIV/AIDS drug, from a global
average price of 16 dollars to two dollars in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
There are around one million Ugandans living with or dying from
HIV/AIDS. The average cost of treatment is about 600 dollars a
month, but many Ugandans live on less than one dollar a day.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Sends More Troops to Border With Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has sent
reinforcements to its north-western border following an alleged
attack from neighboring Guinea, according to a report reaching
here from the Liberian capital Monrovia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issued by Liberian Foreign
Ministry on Sunday as saying that the attack took place on
Saturday morning in Koryamah, a border town in northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"This brings to three the number of attacks emanating from the
Guinean territory," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have steadily grown between Liberia, Guinea and Sierra
Leone, which regularly accused each other of sponsoring attacks on
each other's territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Liberian government is to "
issue a formal protest to the Guinean government, the Economic
Community of West African States and the United Nations about the
latest reported attack."
</P>
<P>
Liberia would do all it could to prevent the conflict from
spreading, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The former two attacks, which were launched in the same area by
unidentified insurgents from Guinea, took place in April and
August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has recently accused a "massive influx"
of British weapons, "under the guise of arming the so-called
Sierra Leone government forces", of raising tensions in the West
African region.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Expected to Visit Zimbabwe: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and
Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said here on Monday that the volume of
tourists to Zimbabwe is expected to improve after the
parliamentary election largely hailed as peaceful.
</P>
<P>
He told local reporters that the industry had suffered a
temporary setback because of negative publicity about Zimbabwe
abroad just before the country's biggest election since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of potential visitors were reluctant to come to
Zimbabwe because of the uncertainty of the political situation
just before the election held two weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still assessing how best we can improve the volume of
tourists to Zimbabwe, but we hope more people will start trickling
again to our beautiful country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moyo, his ministry would soon launch the Tourism
Recovery Plan to assure travelers in other countries that Zimbabwe
is a safe place to visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Executive of Zimbabwe Council for Tourism
Elias Nyakunu said the industry is at its lowest because of the
crisis Zimbabwe has been passing through.
</P>
<P>
Between 60 to 70 percent of business has been lost because of
the fuel crisis which started in November last year largely
because of a shortage of foreign currency, he said, noting that
some businesses had temporarily closed in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 1.2 million tourists visited Zimbabwe, earning
the country 157 million U.S. dollars in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is Zimbabwe's third biggest foreign
currency earner after agriculture and mining.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Revisionist Theories Lambasted at AIDS Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Dabo
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Many participants attending
the ongoing 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South
Africa on Monday attacked the revisionist theories that HIV does
not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first to be held in a developing country
and on the African continent, is being marked by a stronger chorus
of researchers and politicians alike who uphold the traditional
theory linking HIV with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The "revisionists" challenging the traditional theory are
dwarfed by a much larger number of "traditionalists", but the
dispute between the two schools of thoughts is believed to be
dragging efforts to find ways to rein in the rampant spread of
AIDS, particularly on the African continent, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates argued that wasting too much time to dispute the
cause of AIDS would weaken the political will and leadership in
the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
British scientist, professor Roy Anderson criticized the school
of dissident theorists, saying the basis of his research was
formulated on the premise that the HIV virus did in fact cause
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Without targeting certain government leaders by name, he said
the explosive spread of AIDS in Africa over the past 13 years
could have been curtailed if nipped in the bud, since it was
already known back in 1987 how to prevent the transmission of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he asserted that questioning whether HIV causes AIDS
would surely prevent certain governments from intervening timely
to curb the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Actions taken now and early can help to dramatically reduce
the epidemic," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
South African High Court judge Edwin Cameron, who stated
publicly that he is HIV-positive, told a plenary session that any
support for the revisionist theories would shake everyone engaged
in the combat against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Any flirtation with dissidents would create disbelief and
confusion among scientists and AIDS workers alike, he said while
delivering a keynote address for the first Jonathan Mann Memorial
Lecture. Mann, who played a major role in conceiving and
constructing a global response to the AIDS pandemic, was killed in
a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
In the national struggle to come to grips with the epidemic,
perhaps the most intractably puzzling episode has been the
flirtation with those who in the face of all reason and evidence
have sought to dispute the etiology of AIDS, Cameron said,
referring to certain South African officials.
</P>
<P>
"This has shaken almost everyone responsible for engaging the
epidemic. It has created an air of unbelief amongst scientists,
confusion among those at risk of HIV and consternation amongst
AIDS workers," Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with a population of 43 million, South Africa has
an estimated 4.2 million AIDS sufferers, one of the highest number
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Every month 5,000 HIV-positive babies were born in South Africa,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Their lives involve preventable infections, preventable
suffering, and preventable death. And if none of that is
persuasive, then from the point of view of the nation's economic
self-interest, their HIV infection entails preventable expense.
Yet we have done nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cameron, the true challenge for the AIDS
conference is to "make the future different". This includes the
provision of affordable drugs to the millions of people suffering
from the disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official Refutes Criticism Over HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang Monday refuted criticism against her
government's stance on HIV/AIDS, saying her country would devise
its own health policies.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would not bend to pressure to conform to the
expectations of the industrialized world in regard to the fight
against AIDS, she told reporters while attending the 13th
International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we don't care (about AIDS), but the
international community put pressure on us and very few support us
in getting on with our business of transformation," she said.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized the government's commitment to fighting AIDS,
reiterating that prevention and awareness is its primary goal over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The minister strongly defended President Thabo Mbeki, who has
been widely criticized for his interest in the debate between
revisionist "AIDS theorists who question whether the HIV virus
causes AIDS and scientists who link HIV with AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, when officially opening the conference Sunday night,
called on all parties to tolerate different viewpoints,
disappointing many orthodox scientists who had hoped Mbeki would
withdraw his defence of the so-called "dissident" scientists.
</P>
<P>
"The president of this country has never denied either the
existence of AIDS nor this causal connection between HIV and AIDS,
" Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
"Why should he deny something he has not said? The media should
turn it around and report correctly," she said.
</P>
<P>
The issues surrounding the HIV/AIDS debate were complex and
multi-faceted, she added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's reported unavailability to meet
with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate deals to buy cheaper
drugs, Tshabalala-Msimang said, "to say we are unavailable to them
... I dismiss that outright."
</P>
<P>
She singled out the U.S.-based drug manufacturer Pfizer as one
of the drug companies which had made offers to provide drugs to
HIV sufferers at a reduced cost, without consulting the government.
</P>
<P>
"I was not informed about this. I did not even know the terms
of the offer," she said.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang, who chairs the health sector of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), told another
briefing with four other SADC ministers, that SADC would develop a
drugs package which could be negotiated with multinational
pharmaceutical companies to suit the specific needs of SADC member
nations.
</P>
<P>
"This package will not focus only on the provision of anti-
retroviral drugs, but will address the issue of HIV-related
interventions in a holistic way ... including laboratory support,
treatment of opportunistic infections, infrastructure and capacity
building," she said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Probe Death of 13 Soccer Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police Monday said a
board of inquiry has been put in place to establish the cause of
the National Sports Stadium stampede during a soccer match between
South Africa and Zimbabwe on Sunday, which killed 13 people.
</P>
<P>
"While there has already been finger pointing from various
quarters aimed at the police, the complexity of the situation and
intertwining events has led to the board of inquiry composed of
four senior officials being established," said Chief
Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena.
</P>
<P>
He said the board would look into issues which included the
role and actions of the police and the security situation at the
stadium in Harare on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The board would require written as well as oral evidence from
people who witnessed the tragedy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let the nation be assured that nothing is going to be swept
under the carpet," he said. "Considering the urgency of the
situation, the findings and recommendations of the board should be
made public soon."
</P>
<P>
Police have been accused for causing the tragedy when they
fired teargas after few hooligans threw missiles into the football
pitch.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Human Rights Organization Monday condemned police
for using teargas on 55,000 soccer fans who were at the stadium on
Sunday, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
</P>
<P>
Police could have dealt with the few hooligans without using
teargas and allowed the game to proceed, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
It said Zimbabwe was being rated as a violent country because
each time people gathered for entertainment armed police would be
deployed there.
</P>
<P>
"Teargas should never be brought to entertainment places. It is
high time people should refrain from such bad behavior," the
organization stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was beaten 0-2 by South Africa in the World Cup
qualifier tournament.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Belgian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji met here Monday with Belgian King Albert II and he told the
king that Sino-Belgian relations is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they had cordial and friendly talks. The
Belgian king said his country has satisfied with the development
of relations between Belgium and China, particularly in recent
years when both sides have been making progress in developing the
friendly ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
King Albert II told Zhu that Belgium attaches great importance
to China's major international standing. He said his country will
uphold one China policy and not develop any official contacts with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After conveying Chinese President Jiang Zemin's kind greetings
to the King, Zhu said there has been 30-year diplomatic relations
between China and Belgium. The Chinese government is happy to see
the bilateral ties showing increasingly good development momentum,
in particular in the past few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the recent China visit by Belgian Prince Philips who
led a Belgian business delegation, the Chinese premier said the
visit has further enhanced Sino-Belgian economic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the two countries have had good cooperation in
many fields such as science and technology, education as well as
culture. The bilateral ties will be certain to have greater
advance under the concerted efforts made by both the Chinese and
Belgian governments and the king's care and concern, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier today also attended a luncheon hosted by
Belgian Prince Philips. He expressed his appreciation for the
prince's contribution to the development of Sino-Belgian relations.

PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert

minister's proposal to have a directly elected European president
in future.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily L'Humanite, Vedrine said that

<P>
Fischer proposal on May 12 that Europe have a federal-style

<HEADLINE> Belgian FM Explains Arrest Warrant to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian foreign minister had
to explain to the country's parliament on Monday when and why
Belgium had issued an arrest warrant against a Congolese
government official.
</P>
<P>
Louis Michel told the parliamentary foreign affairs commission
that it was last week when his ministry notified the Congolese
foreign ministry about the issuance of the arrest warrant against
Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia.
</P>
<P>
The move not only caused bilateral rows but also internal
dispute in Belgium as well.
</P>
<P>
The African country has recalled its Brussels-based ambassador
to "consult with" the incident while two of the Belgian cabinet
officials had to call off their scheduled visits to the Congo, a
former colony of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Democratic Christian Party from the Flemish-
speaking half of Belgium labeled the incident as the start of a
political dispute domestically.
</P>
<P>
A fax document from the Belgian justice ministry confirmed that
Belgium had issued the arrest warrant on June 6, long before the
Belgian foreign minister's trip to the Congo at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was only made known on July 3 after Michel
had returned from a ceremony on June 30 in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Belgium issued the arrest warrant against the Congolese foreign
minister on charges of crimes against humanity. The arrest
warrant was signed on April 11 by Brussels Magistrate Damien
Vandermeersh but was only issued almost a month later due to legal
and technical reasons, according to jurisdiciary explanations.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians made the move after Congolese refugees had accused
their foreign minister of inciting hatred against them in August
1998 in speeches using such discriminative words as "vermin" and"
extermination".
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued in line with a 1993 Belgian law
that demands arrest of those who have committed crimes against
international human rights no matter where they have committed the
crimes and what nationality they are of.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese foreign minister is now liable to arrest if he
enters Belgium or any other country that is willing to execute the
arrest warrant.

<HEADLINE> Canada's JDS Closes Biggest Take-over Deal with U.S. Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's JDS Uniphase Corp. closed
its ever biggest take-over deal with the U.S.-based SDL Inc. by
agreeing to pay 41 billion U.S. dollars in stock Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
JDS chief executive officer Jozef Straus said the agreement "
will help us accelerate the development of the next generation of
fibre-optic components that our customers need."
</P>
<P>
Officials with both companies believe the agreement could be
the biggest technology deal as well.
</P>
<P>
Under the take-over deal, JDS will exchange 3.8 shares of its
own stock for each share of SDL, which, based in San Hose,
California, is one of the few remaining fibre-optic component
manufacturers capable of challenging JDS's position as the world's
biggest in the field.
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, may have to come through the close scrutiny
by U.S. anti-trust regulators, who already imposed conditions on
their approval of JDS's deal with another U.S.-based firm E-Tek
Dynamics last month.

<HEADLINE> France Says ``Viable'' Palestinian State Good for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Monday that a ``viable'' Palestinian independent
state is good for Israel and called on Israel to be flexible in
the forthcoming summit to be held in Camp David near Washington on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily L'Humanite, Vedrine said that he
wishes both Palestinians and Israelis good lock and good courage
in the summit.
</P>
<P>
``But I hope more particularly that Mr. Barak would be aware
that Israelis have interest in a viable Palestinian state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
``If everything is locked (by Israel), without any margin of
maneuver in what concerns Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements,
refugees frontiers, surface and prerogative of Palestinian state,
no Palestinian leader will agree to it,'' said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David talks to be held between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and the Israeli prime minister under the auspices of
U.S. President Bill Clinton will cover the demarcation of the
frontier, the part natural resources to be controlled by
Palestinians, as well as the prerogatives for the future
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has ruled out a return to the frontier of June 4, 1967,
which the Palestinian has asked for.
</P>
<P>
In this case, a future Palestinian state will consist of two
parts-- Gaza Strip and West Bank, which are separated by Israel in
a form of fragmentation.

<HEADLINE> Eurocorps to Join French National Day Parade in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
officials at the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps said on Monday that
soldiers from the five other Eurocorps member countries will
parade separately under their own standards in order not to affect
the harmonization of the parade.
</P>
<P>
The five countries -- Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and
Spain, all have their own military traditions.
</P>
<P>
The Eurocorps paraded in armored vehicles on July 14, 1994, on
the Champs-Elysees because it did not want to cause negative
reaction from the French audience to the German soldiers joining
the parade.
</P>
<P>
That year, German soldiers for the first time since World War
II descended from the Triumph Arch along the Champs-Elysees down
to the Concord.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Denktash's Positions No Basis for Further Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with his Macedonian counterpart, Nikola
Klusev in Athens, Tsohatzopoulos urged Turkey and Denktask to take
advantage of the prospect provided for them for a solution to the
Cyprus issue through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
eastern Mediterranean island after a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia
instigated by Greece's military rulers.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks between the
two communities on the divided island have been held in New York
and Geneva respectively, and the third round of such talks started
on July 5, but the meetings will adjourn for 12 days from July 12
and then continue until early in August.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Denktask insists that Cyprus must be
united a two-state confederation following the recognition of the
breakaway north, but the Greek Cypriot side-led by President
Glafcos Clerides demands that the island must be reunited in a
federation formula in line with the U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Warring Parties in Sudan Urged to Pave Way for Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. emergency relief
coordinator, Carolyn McAskie, Monday asked the warring parties in
Sudan to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in
need and the safety of civilians and U.N. humanitarian workers
across the African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, McAskie expressed here "deep
concern" about the resumed hostilities between the rebel factions
and the Sudanese Government in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"The reported fighting around Gogrial in Bahr-el-Ghazal and
Mabaan in Upper Nile has caused the displacement of at least 4,000
people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It has also been reported that air raids on Rumbek and other
locations in the Bahr-el-Ghazal, Lakes area and Western Equatoria
last week, have resulted in the death of three people and the
wounding of several others.
</P>
<P>
"These events are of particular concern as they not only bring
about further deterioration of humanitarian conditions in the area
but also jeopardize the crucial humanitarian cease-fire that both
parties pledged to respect earlier this year," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is scheduled to expire on July 15, and McAskie
"urges both parties to respect and extend its provisions, in order
to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to all beneficiaries,
and the safety of civilians and United Nations humanitarian
personnel throughout the country," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation With West Important: Russia New Diplomacy Concept </HEADLINE>

<P>
"Russia is prepared to work hard to maintain positive
interaction with the U.S., to overcome the recent significant
difficulties in relations with Washington and to preserve the
infrastructure of the Russian-American cooperation that has been
built over almost a decade," says the concept.
</P>
<P>
"Despite serious and, in some cases, essential differences,
Russian-American interaction is a necessary prerequisite for
improving the international situation and maintaining global
strategic stability," it says.
</P>
<P>
This is primarily a matter of "disarmament, arms control, the
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the prevention
and settlement of the most dangerous regional conflicts," notes
the document.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to solve the problem of limiting and reducing
strategic nuclear armaments only through active dialogue with the
United States," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
"Regular bilateral contacts at all levels and the absence of
breaks and disruptions in negotiations on key political, military
and economic matters meet the mutual interests of both Russia and
the United States," the concept says.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a press conference on
the concept Monday that the Russian and U.S. presidents will
discuss issues of strategic stability at the upcoming Group-8
summit scheduled for late July in Japan's Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reiterated Russia has "a clear view" of the problems of
anti-ballistic missile defense and Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-
II."There will be no compromise or hesitation" from Moscow in
matters relating to START-II, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plans for crating a national missile shield are "a
road toward the creation of a unipolar world." "Russia will be
required to take appropriate steps, but we wish it's not our
choice," Ivanov emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia "proceeds from the importance of cooperation
with NATO in the interests of security and stability on the
continent," the concept says.
</P>
<P>
"Russia realistically assesses the role" of the North Atlantic
alliance and "is open to constructive interaction." "The intensity
of cooperation with NATO will depend on the fulfillment of key
clauses of the Russia-NATO Founding Act. First and foremost is the
pledge not to threaten or use force and not to deploy conventional
armed forces,nuclear weapons or their delivery vehicles on the
territory of new NATO members," the concept says.
</P>
<P>
Content-rich and constructive cooperation between Russia and
NATO is possible only if "it is based on due account being given
to both sides' interests and the unconditional realization of
mutual commitments," it continues.
</P>
<P>
It states that Russia takes a negative view of the enlargement
of NATO and its new strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
Russia regards the European Union as one of its leading
political and economic partners and seeks due recognition of its
interests in relations with the EU, says the concept.
</P>
<P>
It urges EU to consider Russia's interests in its enlargement
and to resolve concrete bilateral problems on the basis of the
Russia-EU relations strategy approved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes the attempts by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to target its activity at post-Soviet
states and the Balkans," the concept says.

<HEADLINE> Germany and Iran Pledge to Renew Traditional Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 10 (Xinhua)-- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and Iranian President Mohammed Chatami on Monday pledge to
rejuvenate the traditional close economic cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting in the Chancellor's
office, Schroeder said that "we want to again connect the
traditionally close ties between the two countries".
</P>
<P>
 The economic relations should be dynamically built up and for
this purpose, the German side will increase export guarantee for
Iran from the present level of 200 million Deutsche Mark to one
billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chatami was quoted by DPA, the German news agency, as saying
that his visit to Germany is a sign that peoples of the two
countries want to push forward the bilateral cooperation,
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights where Iran and Germany obviously
do not see with each other, Chatami said that relations of two
countries should be based on common grounds and differences be
resolved through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president arrived here on Monday as the highest
Iranian official to visit Germany in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
Chatami was greeted at the airport by German President
Johnannes Rau. In a subsequent meeting, Rau expressed the hope for
a new beginning in the bilateral relations and pointed out to
their long tradition, the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
The German-Iranian relations were marred in the 1990s by a
German court's charge of terrorism against the Iranian government
and the arrest of German businessman Kaufmann Hofer in Tehran. The
release of Hofer in January this year and the visit by German
Foreign Minister Joschhka Fischer to Iran in May paved the way for
bettering bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to German press reports, the bilateral trade volume
amounted to 9 billion DM in 1992, but fell to 3.1 billion last
year, the lowest level in two decades. The German businessman have
strongly urged the government to improve ties with Iran, because
compared with other countries such as France and Italy, they are
put at disadvantage in trade with Iran by strained political
relations.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Egypt Open Conference on Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- In a further show of rapprochement,
Iranian and Egyptian experts opened a round-table conference here
on Monday to discuss ways of improving bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and experts from both countries will discuss
bilateral ties, the situation in the Middle East and the foreign
policy of the two countries during the two-day conference held at
the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Institute for Political and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the conference, Abd Al-Menem, director of the
Egyptian Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies, said the
discussions are being held at a time when the ice in Tehran-Cairo
relations has thawed.
</P>
<P>
It is now the appropriate time for restoring relations between
the two nations after more than 20 years of separation, Al-Menem
said, adding that their close ties will benefit the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt are facing common challenges such as
technological development and globalization, he said, hoping the
countries' scholars can reach better understanding and help improve
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Educational and Research
Sadeq Kharrazi said Iran and Egypt have common historical,
religious and cultural bonds and the two should exercise deep
insight toward the future.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed diplomatic relations in 1979 after Egypt
gave asylum to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the late Iranian shah deposed
in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Tehran used to slam Cairo for cracking down on Islamic
fundamentalists who tried to overthrow the secular government and
install Islamic rule in Egypt, while Egypt accused Iran of
supporting terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
However, with the foreign policy of detente advocated by Iran's
moderate President Mohammad Khatami since his taking office in
1997, the two countries have markedly improved bilateral relations
and cooperation, especially in the cultural and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made a historic
telephone call to President Khatami to congratulate Iran on its new
membership in the Group 15 (G15) developing countries.
</P>
<P>
As it was the first top-contact between the two countries in 21
years of strained relations, many people considered it a prelude to
full resumption of ties.

<HEADLINE> Barak Will Try to Clinch Deal with Arafat: Egyptian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Monday expressed readiness and willingness to try to reach a peace
agreement with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during their
upcoming summit to be hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, a
senior Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Barak
stressed that he will be positive and do his utmost to make the
negotiations successful, Osama al-Baz, political advisor to
Mubarak, said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak gave the impression that he is determined to seek a deal
with the Palestinians at the summit in the U.S. Camp David
presidential retreat, al-Baz told reporters in a briefing. The two
leaders did not speak to reporters following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak came to Cairo not to "put a ceiling or mention forbidden
points" in the negotiations with Arafat, but to expound to the
president his view about what he expects to happen at the summit
and what he hopes to achieve, al-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Egypt has proposed compromise ideas to Barak, al-
Baz said that Egypt might have some ideas, but it did not submit
any such ideas as formal proposals because it is not a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the two negotiating parties to present ideas and
Egypt will try to help without imposing its point of view on any
party, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Barak later headed back to Israel to face a censure motion
against his government in the parliament. Despite the political
turmoil at home, he insisted on flying on to the United States for
Tuesday's summit, which is designed to seek a final peace agreement
between the Palestinians and Israel before a September 13 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Supports Barak to Attend Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman on
Monday expressed his support for Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
attend the upcoming three-way summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The summit could bring about peace for Israel and Barak must go
and solve the problems with the Palestinians, Weizman told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Weizman praised Barak for his efforts and courage to reach a
peace agreement with the Palestinians, saying that right now "Barak
is like a field commander commanding charges without help from the
soldiers."
</P>
<P>
Weizman is scheduled to submit his letter of resignation to
Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg Monday evening. The
resignation will take effect 48 hours later, ending his seven years
in the post of president.
</P>
<P>
After learning Sunday that the ultra-Orthodox Shas party was to
leave Barak's coalition, Weizman called upon Barak to form "as wide
a government as possible with as few disagreements as possible,"
but stopped short of calling for a national unity government that
will include right-wing opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to call for a national unity government. I am always
in favor of a national unity government, but what good would a
national unity government do if there are constant disagreements,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing and religious parties quit the Barak-led coalition
government one by one, accusing Barak of keeping them in the dark
and being ready to make too many concessions to the Palestinians
without eliciting compromises from the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, head of a right-leaning Russian immigrant
party, Yisrael Ba'aliya, resigned on Sunday as interior minister,
becoming the first coalition partner to turn his back on Barak on
the eve of crucial negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, Shas party, the second largest partner in
the coalition, also decided to defect and the National Religious
Party, which represent Jewish settlers, followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's coalition now has only 42 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The three-way summit will begin at Camp David, a presidential
resort in Maryland, the United States, on Tuesday with the
participation of Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed to reach a framework agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians on final-status issues such as the fate of
Jerusalem, borders, refugees, settlement and water ahead of the
September target for final peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Cyprus Due to Heat-wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Four people died in Cyprus as a
result of the heat-wave which hit the region during the last few
days and another 27 have been treated at hospitals, local media
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Cyprus during the last week reached 42 degrees
Celsius, with people seeking refuge to the beach and mountain
resorts for a cooler breeze.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, all the four victims of the heat-wave
were old people suffering from various health problems.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has ordered all hospitals be ready to deal
with any emergencies and has said that if considered necessary
staff could be called back from their vacations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, power cuts continued Monday in the capital Nicosia as
a result of damage in one of the transformers of the Cyprus
Electricity Authority, caused by the hot weather and the overuse of
air-conditioning units.
</P>
<P>
The life of residents, especially the medical activities in
Nicosia General Hospital were affected by the power cuts. No
problems in private clinics have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Electricity Authority called upon the residents of
Nicosia and its suburbs to make wise use of electricity, stressing
that this is essential in order to face the problem successfully.

<HEADLINE> Indian Population Increases by 2.6 Million in Two Months: UNFPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"India crossed the billion mark on May 11 (this year) and the
country will have an estimated population of 1,002,594,606
tomorrow, which is the World Population Day," UNFPA representative
in India Michael Vlassoff told the press here.
</P>
<P>
India's population growth rate for 1995-2000 is 1.64 percent
compared to the world average of 1.33 percent, said Vlassoff.
</P>
<P>
Though some states in the country, like Kerala, Goa, Tamil Nadu
and Andhra Pradesh, have achieved a fairly low fertility rate
among the local women, these achievements have been offset by
higher total fertility rate in other states, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed at the prospects of a population explosion, India
adopted this year a National Population Policy, the first of its
kind in the south Asian country's history, which set a population
control goal of achieving a total fertility rate of 2.1, or only
two children for each couple, by 2010.

<HEADLINE> India, Australia to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was decided during wide-ranging discussions visiting
Australian Prime Minister John Howard had with Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee on regional, international and issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
The evolving situation in Fiji also came up during the 40-
minute meeting. Both India and Australia have been strongly
demanding the release of Prime Minister Mahendra Chowdhury and
other hostages in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed steps to give a boost to Indian exports
to Australia with focus on removing tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
They also underscored the potential for broader commercial
cooperation and improved trade between India and Australia.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Australia's total trade with India amounted to 2.1
billion U.S. dollars and its investment in India is currently
estimated to be in excess of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Howard's visit, the first Prime Ministerial one from his
country to India in 11 years, caps a series of meetings and high-
level visits between the two countries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
During the visit of Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer to India in March this year, the two countries decided to
resume defense cooperation suspended by Australia soon after the
nuclear blasts in May 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russian New Diplomacy Concept Stresses U.N. Role, Ties With Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A new Russian foreign policy
concept released here Monday stresses the United Nations' role in
the world community and gives a top priority to the development of
relations with Asian states.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations must continue to be the main center for
regulating international relations in the 21st century, says the
concept.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will resolutely oppose attempts to downgrade role of
the U.N. and its Security Council in world affairs, which alone
has a right to authorize the use of force in peace enforcement,"
the document says.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force in contravention of the U.N. Charter is
illegitimate and will destabilize the entire system of
international relations," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
Taking "humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty" as
excuses for the unilateral use of force by circumventing the U.N.
Security Council, is unacceptable, reads the document, calling for
"faithful observance of the fundamental principles of the U.N.
Charter in particular the preservation of the status of permanent
council members," it says.
</P>
<P>
It states that the reforms of the United Nations must not
forego the veto rights of UN Security Council permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Moscow advocates increasing the effectiveness of the UN
Security Council as the main tool of the maintenance of
international peace and security and making that body more
representative. It "will consistently meet its commitments under
international treaties and agreements on arms limitation and
reduction and work for keeping the 1972 treaty on restricting
missile defense systems" in place, the document says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new concept emphasized that the general
improvement of the situation in Asia "is of crucial importance to
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Russia "will concentrate on its equal participation in the
solution of the Korean problem and balanced relations with the two
Korean states," the concept says.
</P>
<P>
A leading sphere of the Russian foreign policy in Asia "is the
development of friendly relations with the key Asian states,
primarily China and India," it says.
</P>
<P>
Russia is striving for the development of mutually beneficial
cooperation with China in all spheres. The agreement of economic
cooperation with the level of the Russian-Chinese political
contacts is a main task, the document says.
</P>
<P>
Russia "will also deepen the traditional partnership with India,
including in international issues," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Russia regards the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban treaty by India and Pakistan and their joining the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation treaty as an important factor in the maintenance of
stability in the Asia-Pacific region," the concept says,
</P>
<P>
Russia supports efforts to create nuclear-free zones in South
Asia, it added.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue the policy aimed at steady development of its
relations with Japan and at achieving true good-neighborly
relations between Moscow and Tokyo," Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told a news conference on the concept here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He assured that "by means of negotiations the Russian
Federation will continue looking for a mutually acceptable
decision on the demarcation of an internationally recognized

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Supporting Russian Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Monday
that it would continue to support the reforms and modernization
process in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made after a meeting of the European Union
foreign ministers' general affairs council.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, whose country has just
taken over the six-month rotating EU presidency from Portugal,
said that the council would ask the European Commission and the
council of EU economy ministers to pinpoint areas for continued EU-
Russian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said in a statement that the council
had recognized with interest the programs of political and
economic reforms launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation should be organized for the benefit of rule of
law and democratization for the sake of the entire society of the
country," said a written statement issued after the council
meeting, the first such meeting chaired by France after it took
over the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers agreed that the scheduled EU-Russia
summit would be of special importance in that it would be focused
on a long-term, effective cooperation program between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Russia summit is planned for October 30 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also instructed the European
Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to re-launch
the preparation of the aid program for Russia known as TACIS for
the period between now and 2003, especially a proposition for an
action program for the year 2000 with the aim of supporting the
ongoing political and economic reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Campaign Launched in HK to Crack Down on Porn Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A new campaign was launched
Monday in Hong Kong to crack down on pornographic articles,
according to the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
This year's campaign will target retail spots selling
pornographic VCDs, Acting Commissioner for Television and
Entertainment Licensing William Lee told a press briefing on the
details of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We will step up enforcement action to tackle the problem of
pornographic VCDs and their easy access to young persons under the
age of 18, which is of considerable concern to the community," Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is jointly initiated by the Television and
Entertainment Licensing Authority, the Hong Kong Police Force and
the Customs and Excise Department.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign aims to draw the public's attention to the
problem of young people being exposed to indecent materials and
promote a better understanding of the Control of Obscene and
Indecent Articles Ordinance," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The acting commissioner urged parents to pay more attention to
their kids and provide them with guidance on the selection of
leisure reading materials and use of the Internet. And teachers
and youth workers also play an important role in guiding young
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, frequent joint actions will be taken
against various wholesale and retail outlets, and the inspection
of passengers and goods at the airport and other entry points will
be enhanced, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
The authority will distribute pamphlets and promotional
souvenirs to give the public and in particular newspaper vendors
and persons-in-charge of video shops and computer software shops a
better understanding of the relevant legislation.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Will Not Lay Down Arms: Nasrallah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan
Nasrallah has denied reports that Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami had asked Hezbollah, or Party of God, to end its military
role in Lebanon and become a political party, Oriental radio
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said his guerrilla group, which spearheaded the
resistance movement against Israeli occupation of south Lebanon,
will continue activities after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop pullout on May 24, ending 22 years of
occupation in south Lebanon. But Hezbollah, supported by both Iran
and Syria, will continue struggle because "the files of Palestine
and Jerusalem will then be opened," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance should continue and weapons should be kept in
the hands of Hezbollah and other parties, in a broader resistance,
because Israel will continue to pose a threat to Lebanon's security
and stability," Nasrallah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon still accuses Israel of a number of encroachments of its
territory despite Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in accord with President Khatami right from the
beginning that Hezbollah has various spheres of activity to perform
in successive stages," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah is a resistance movement and a political party at the
same time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Asharq Al Awsat newspaper on Friday said
Khatami had asked Hezbollah to lay down arms now that Israel had
withdrawn from south Lebanon. Nasrallah visited Tehran early this
month for talks with top Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah also attacked the upcoming Camp David summit between
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak as "an attempt to abort the
victory of the resistance" in driving the Israeli occupation army
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"There is also the looming specter of the loss of the
Palestinian cause. Therefore, the resistance will continue and we
shall stay on in our positions even after the current Israeli
encroachments are terminated," Nasrallah was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Conflict Claims Heavy Casualties in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Monday conducted an operation to destroy a Tamil Tiger rebels
bunker line in the northern Jaffna peninsula, inflicting heavy
casualties on both sides, a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
"One officer and 18 soldiers were killed in action while 94
security forces personnel were wounded," said the statement,
adding that troops advanced from their defenses in Colombuturai
area and successfully destroyed the rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
It said troops confirmed heavy casualties to separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but figures were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said during the operation on July 4
government troops had killed at least 53 LTTE rebels south of
Nagarkovil, also in the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The battlefields in Jaffna have been mostly quiet since May,
after weeks of heavy fighting between government troops and LTTE
rebels who were engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake
their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting since 1983 to carve out a
separate homeland called Eelam in the north and east for minority
Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Arrests American Woman in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
have arrested an American woman working for a Kabul-based NGO,
along with seven Afghan women for violating Taliban rules, Afghan
sources in Islamabad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mary Macmakin, working in an NGO namely PAARSA, was arrested
last Friday in Kabul after the Taliban on Thursday issued letters
to all Kabul-based international NGOs, asking them not to recruit
Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's Department for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of
Vice apprehended the American national and her Afghan colleagues.
The Taliban authorities have not given any reason for the action.
</P>
<P>
Eight men who were arrested along with Macmakin were freed on
Sunday, however, the American lady and seven Afghan women are
still in custody, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction either from the United Nations
in Islamabad or from the United States. However, a report from
Kabul suggest that Ellien Dethot, U.N. Coordinator in Kabul has
lodged protest with Taliban and demanded immediate release of
Macmakin.
</P>
<P>
The radical Islamic militia of Taliban barred women from
employment after they captured the capital of Kabul in September,
1996.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Special Envoy Visits Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has sent a special envoy to thank the Czech government
for its support during the island worst military crisis, a
government statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera met Czech President Vaclar
Havel on Sunday, said the statement, handing a letter of thanks
from Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
"President Havel expressed his appreciation for this kind of
gesture and promised continued support," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera will meet Czech officials during the next two days
to discuss matters of mutual interest, especially trade between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In April, Sri Lanka turned to Czech and other six countries for
arms to counter a ferocious offensive launched by Tamil Tiger
rebels who overran several key army camps in an apparent attempt
to retake their former stronghold of the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government troops with reinforcements and newly
purchased arms have stalled the rebel offensive since May and
even started to conduct counteroffensives to regain lost ground.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka last Tuesday sent Cultural Affairs Minister Lakshman
Jayakody as a special envoy to India. Government officials said
that several similar missions will be undertaken shortly.

<HEADLINE> Strike Affects Philippines' Transport System Partly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The alleged nationwide transport
strike in the Philippines failed Monday to paralyze the transport
system in Metro Manila and Central Luzon but seriously affected
some other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The strikers were demanding an oil price rollback and non-
implementation of the road users tax and the seat belt law. They
also called for the creation of a special traffic court.
</P>
<P>
The Metro Manila Development Authority said most of the drivers
in the capital did not attend the strike and there were no class
suspension in the city's schools on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Militant strike groups also failed to paralyze the public
transportation in Central Luzon except in Angeles City where
passenger jeepney drivers cooperated on the call for a nationwide
strike.
</P>
<P>
Police said all of the estimated 500 passenger jeepneys
operating in Angeles City kept off the streets on Monday as a sign
of their protest.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no stop of public transportation in the
provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Tarlac, Zambales.
</P>
<P>
In Cebu City in central Philippines, three major transport
groups which count some 3,500 members attended the strike,
paralyzing the city's traffic and prompting schools in that city
to suspend classes.
</P>
<P>
The government fielded buses and other vehicles in the country'
s major cities to help ferry commuters affected by the strike.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora appealed earlier Monday to
militant groups to consider the consequences of their strike,
saying this would not in any way contribute to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Zamora noted that the recent oil price hikes were a result of
developments in the global market, of which the government has no
control of.
</P>
<P>
A transport strike, Zamora said, would only add to the people's
woes and defeat government efforts to minimize the effects of oil
prices hikes on the public.

<HEADLINE> French President Calls for World Solidarity to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac Monday urged the international community to create world
solidarity to combat AIDS, which has caused severe economic and
social regression, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's speech was delivered by the country's Health Minister
Dominique Gillot at the 13th International AIDS Conference which
opened in Durban, South Africa, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "It would be pointless to talk about ethics,
it would be pointless to talk about universal rights, if we are
not able to create world solidarity against AIDS."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the fight against the virus had been
fighting on two fronts -- in developing and developed nations.
</P>
<P>
He cited statistics which showed that since 1997 more than 33
million people have been infected by the virus, more than 16
million have died, about 3 million of which were in 1999 alone,
with Africa and Asia being the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
"When 90 percent of people infected with HIV live in the
developing world, it would be entirely unthinkable to accept a two-
speed epidemic," he said, "Since 1997, France has stated that
there cannot be two ways of fighting against AIDS : Northern
treatment and Southern prevention."
</P>
<P>
Chirac stressed that "everything possible" should be done to
ensure that new treatments be made available to those most in need
-- Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The president implored authorities world-wide to implement an
agreement recently signed by UNAIDS -- an integrated body of
United Nations agencies -- and pharmaceutical companies to
radically reduce the cost of drugs for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This would constitute "an important step forward", he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Back New Banana Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign ministers
on Monday backed the European Commission's new proposals to break
the banana import deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers' general affairs council expressed
support for the "first come, first served" proposals put forward
by the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, on
July 5.
</P>
<P>
The council asked the commission to report on the outcome of
the proposed banana import scheme.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been striving to work out new banana import systems
that comply with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
But months of efforts to settle the trade row over banana
imports have met a deadlock, commission officials admitted.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is under pressure to solve the dispute
because the United States has imposed 191 million U.S. dollars of
sanctions on EU goods in retaliation for its banana quota system.
</P>
<P>
Equator, the world's leading exporter of banana, has been
authorized by the WTO to slap 201 million dollars of sanctions on
EU goods.
</P>
<P>
The WTO sided with Latin American countries and the United
States that argued that the current EU quota rules favored EU
territories and former European colonies in the Caribbean over
Latin American exporters and U.S. marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the European Commission proposed that the EU
move to a tariff-only banana import system by January 1, 2006,
after a transitional period involving a complex tariff rate quota
system.
</P>
<P>
Yet intense discussions with the United States and other Latin
American countries failed to enable the EU to come up with a way
to divide the quota that satisfies all parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, the European Commission will push for
a transitional system of tariff quotas that would be allotted on a
"first come, first served" basis while the tariff-only system
would take effect in 2006 as previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that if no agreement could be reached on
the "first come, first served" basis by mid-October this year, it
planned to start negotiations on a tariff-only system.

OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were injured Sunday
evening in a head-on vehicle collision on a highway about 100
kilometres east of Montreal, according to provincial police.

referring to the man, who will face charges Monday even if he
remains in hospital.
</P>
<P>
A section of the highway was closed for several hours after
the traffic accident.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suffered a staggering blow
when right-wing and religious parties opposed to territorial
concessions announced Sunday they would quit his crumbling
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
-- Hoping to make their candidates competitive in at least
seven districts where Democrats are believed to have advantage
right now, U.S. House Republican campaign officials are preparing
to defy the Federal Election Commissions and inject huge amounts
of party money into key congressional races this fall without
waiting for a Supreme Court appeal that will determine whether the
practice is legal.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government disintegrated
Sunday as one right-leaning party after another quit in protest
against anticipated concessions to the Palestinians, leaving him
on unsteady ground on the eve of his departure to the Camp David
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Failure of a missile-shield test raises the likelihood that
Clinton will leave a decision on whether to deploy the 60-billion-
U.S.-dollar system to his successor.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and its major allies said they would consider
sanctions on 15 nations, including Russia and Israel, unless they
better fight money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Standard Football Fields To Be Constructed In Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The German Football Federation
will be establishing five new football fields in Mongolia next
year due to requests from the Mongolian Football Federation.
German Polytan Company will construct the football fields and
assemble an artificial lawn for the game.
</P>
<P>
The field will be designed at lengths of 105-110 meters and to
widths of 72-75 meters. These measurements qualify for
international standards. Polytan Company's experts will be in
Mongolia soon to identify the places, which are best fit to start
construction. They have decided to use the same model as they use
in Norway because Mongolia's weather is similar to Norwegian
weather.
</P>
<P>
As of today, there isn't a international standard lawn football
field in Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Beijing Subsidiary Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom's Beijing branch was
established today, separating governmental functions from business
operations.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jidong, general manager of the new subsidiary, said at
today's inauguration ceremony that they would give priority to
development of services including Internet, ISDN and special

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Hinders Normal Order of Tibetan Buddhism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Facts show that the Dalai Lama,
disguised as a "religious leader," is a politician in exile
engaged in separating his motherland, says a commentary in today's
Tibet Daily.
</P>
<P>
Headlined "Dalai Lama Is the Biggest Obstacle to Normal Order
of Tibetan Buddhism," the commentary said the Dalai Lama actually
regards Tibetan Buddhism as a tool he can wield at will.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) always persists in the "
religious freedom" policy. President Jiang Zemin has written in
favor of Tibetan Buddhism, saying he expects believers to love the
country and the religion, unite and make progress, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dalai Lama has been inducing monks and nuns to
cause trouble, using temples as the bases for realizing his dream
of Tibet independence, the article said.
</P>
<P>
His separatist activities have done great harm to Tibetan
Buddhism as well as large numbers of monks and nuns, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the Dalai Lama and his clique smuggled in
many reactionary publications containing rumors and hostile
remarks against the central government.
</P>
<P>
As a result, normal religious activities in some temples were
disturbed, leading to loose management and irregularities. Some
monks and nuns were coerced into engaging in political activities
to split the country, which were strongly criticized by the 10th
Panchen Lama of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, the Dalai Lama went so far as to violate religious
tenets by interfering in the selection of the 10th Panchen Lama's
reincarnation. He turned what should have been an auspicious
occasion in Buddhism into a political farce, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Dalai Lama has met five times with Shoko
Asahara, founder of the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult, and the two
have colluded for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
The CPC doesn't believe in religion, but respects believers'
legal rights for religious freedom, and opposes anyone who engages
in destroying the motherland's reunification, national unity, and
social stability, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Snakehead Arrested on Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The chief member of a major
Taiwanese gang of "snakeheads" profiting from smuggling mainland
women to Taiwan for prostitution has been arrested by police on
the mainland, police sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Shi Jianrong, 40, was arrested Sunday night at the Gaoqi
International Airport in Xiamen, Fujian Province in southeast
China just across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He was suspected of helping to smuggle mainland women to Taiwan,
where he sold them to nightclubs in Taipei and other Taiwanese
cities. The women brought up to 200,000 Taiwan dollars apiece,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The police said Shi and two other key members of the gang made
more than five million Taiwanese dollars from the business.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen police busted the gang in late May, arresting the chief,
Li Jianyi, and 12 of the members.
</P>
<P>
Shi was arriving in Xiamen from Macao, and was trying to find
the whereabouts of Li and the others, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The case is under further investigation.

Businessmen's Association (LASIAD) Chairman Ayhan Karahan said.

done by air. To travel fast and deliver goods in the shortest
possible time is a very important factor in terms of commerce," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Karahan said Lebanon not only buys goods from Turkey, but also
distributes them to other countries in the region due to its
special location.
</P>
<P>
Now the lebanese airlines, which has resumed flights to Libya,
will serve as a bridge linking Turkish producers with the North
African markets, he said.

<P>
The processing capacity of the refinery, which is located in

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
vowed Monday to speed up the development and rehabilitation of the
whole of Mindanao after Camp Abubakar fell into the hands of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Manila from a trip to Camp Abubakar where
he led in the formal takeover of the erstwhile main headquarters
of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the president said
the war in Mindanao has been won by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have won the war. It will be the beginning of the
development and rehabilitation of Mindanao. That is the top
priority now," the president told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that with the capture of the 10,000-
hectare camp, the morale of the soldiers has "been very, very high.
"
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has already ordered the military to apply the
full force of the law to those who will continue to defy the
government with their terroristic acts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president personally hoisted the Philippine flag
inside Camp Abubakar signaling the formal takeover of the camp by
the government after several days of relentless military attack.
</P>
<P>
With the conflict in Mindanao now nearing its end, Estrada said
he has now become more determined to pursue his goal of converting
the country's second biggest island into its next food basket.
</P>
<P>
Estrada called on the MILF, as well as the leftist New People's
Army, to end their rebellion against the government, saying the
country cannot progress unless its citizens put their acts
together and unite in the fight against poverty.

<HEADLINE> Three French Journalists Feared Abducted by Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Abu Sayyaf group
might have abducted three French journalists on Sunday in the
southern Philippines, bringing the number of their hostages to 37,
according to a police report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report reaching here from the southern Sulu province said
the three journalists failed to return to the provincial capital
of Jolo as of Monday afternoon after they visited the kidnapper's
jungle lair in Talipao town, some 15 kilometers southeast of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Police identified the three France TV media men as camera man
Jean-Jacques Le Garec, 40, reporter Maryge Burget, 38, and sound
man Roland Madura, 50.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted the French and German embassies in Manila to
order the immediate pull-out of all journalists from their
respective countries covering the now 78-day old hostage crisis in
Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Their group was the latest batch of foreign journalists who
came to personally visit the hostages held by Abu Sayyaf
kidnappers led by Ghali Andang, alias Commander Robot, and Mujib
Susukan.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the group left for Talipao at about 8:00 Sunday
morning but failed to show up as expected, prompting the police to
surmise that the trio were already held against their will.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf abducted German journalist Andreas
Lorenz of Der Spiegel magazine.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Lorenz, the Abu Sayyaf has also detained 13
evangelists from the Jesus Miracle Crusdade led by Wilde Almeda.
</P>
<P>
The Christian group trekked to the Abu Sayyaf camp to pray over
the 20 mostly foreign hostages kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf from a
resort off the coast of Sabah, Malaysia, in April.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ambassadors Win Game 1 of ABA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The NBA Ambassadors shook off
early setbacks to beat the Chinese All-Stars 95-78 in the opening
game of the best-of-three finals of the Asian Basketball
Association League here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth meeting of two teams. both squads finished the
20-game regular season with 18-2 records to reach the finals, and
they split their previous four meetings each other 2-2.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese started superbly with a 13-1 run as "Twin Tower"
Yao Ming and Wang Zhizhi single-handedly sliced open the
Ambassadors' defense.
</P>
<P>
Yao, a lanky forward from Chinese First Division club Shanghai
Sharks, stands 7-3 and Wang, a 1999 second-round pick of the Dalas,
is the other seven-footer in the Chinese squad. the tallest player
of the Ambassadors is 6-11 center Shawnelle Scott.
</P>
<P>
China's lead was short-lived as the Ambassadors, coached by
Hall of Fame point guard Nate Archibald, fought back strongly with
a 17-8 run as former Texas Christian standout Mike Jones virtually
dictated play.
</P>
<P>
Jones led the Ambassadors' assault instead of B. J. Mickier,
the team's leading scorer with 15.1 points per game in regular
season, who missed the finals with a stress fracture of right
fibula.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors trailed only two points at 21-23 after the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter had been a see-saw game before the visitors
wrapped up the first half 45-42.
</P>
<P>
The Americans got on the nerves of the Chinese with fast-paced
attacking and a well-knitted defense as the Chinese hoopers began
to make quite a few errors. The Ambassadors closed the third
quarter 71-62.
</P>
<P>
The Americans ran away in the final quarter, winning the match
with a 17-point margin.
</P>
<P>
Jones topped the Ambassadors with 22 points and 6 rebounds.
Rasul Salahuddin, former Portuguese League All-Star, contributed
16 points. Yao Ming pumped in 21 points to be the highest-scoring
Chinese and he also snatched 13 rebounds.
</P>

necessary, will be played Thursday in Beijing.

LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Venus and Serena Williams became
the first sisters to win the Wimbledon doubles as they cruised to
the victory in the delayed final against fourth seeds Julie Halard-
Decugis and Ai Sugiyama in staight sets 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The win means that Venus becomes the third consecutive women's
singles champion to win the doubles title as well, following
Lindsay Davenport and Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
Despite easing to the title, it did not look like becoming the
return to Center Court that Venus would have liked following her
wonderful singles victory.
</P>
<P>
She dropped her opening two service games of the women's
doubles
final, giving opponents Halard-Decugis and Sugiyama a golden
opportunity to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
However, Halard-Decugis, winner of the Wimbledon warm-up
tournament in Eastbourne, did the same as the servers struggled to
take the advantage.
</P>
<P>
While her serving was not up to scratch, Venus's volleying was
perfect and, with her younger sister, were showing team-work not
seen before in the tournament. They did clash rackets at the net
when at set point, but it simply confused their opponents and they
took the lead.
</P>
<P>
The second set was a far more clear cut affair as the Williams
sisters stormed into a 4-0 lead. Halard-Decugis and Sugiyama
fought back bravely, taking two games, but they could not restrain
the power of their opponents as Serena took the match with an ace.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Siemens will ally with six
mainstream Chinese websites making it possible for customers to
view these sites via Siemens mobile phones, an official with
Siemens announced today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The six websites -- Yahoo.com.cn, sina.com, netease.com, china.
com, 8848.com, Stockstar.com -- can be accessed through Siemens
handsets with WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Siemens WAP mobile phones users can reach the websites simply
by some clicks, beacuse the websites will be written into the
configuration files of the mobile phones according to an agreement
between Siemens and China Mobile Telecommunications (Group) Co.
</P>
<P>
Siemens will also provide General Packet Radio Services (GPRS)
systems to the Chinese enterprise either later this year or early
next year under the cooperation with China Unicom and China Mobile
Telecommunications (Group) Co., the country's leading providers of
telecommunications service.
</P>
<P>
GPRS is the evolution of GSM, the current European standard for
mobiles, to Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, or UMTS.
UMTS is seen as the next generation of mobile phone services, and
will allow cell phones to be used more like computers by
integrating voice, images, data and video.
</P>
<P>
GPRS will allow mobile phones to access the Internet and
download files from the Web as well as handle e-mail, use on-line
services and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
So far, the WAP mobile phones with Internet access are widely
advertised but not sold well in China's market. Analysts attribute
that to high fees for Internet subscription, narrow bandwidth, and
insufficient information in Chinese.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved remarkable
progress in its on-going housing reform nationwide, and most
provinces and autonomous regions have established programs to sell
houses to individuals instead of allocating residences to them as
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
In most provinces, autonomous regions and municipal cities,
around 60 percent of all public houses have been sold to
individuals, and the proportion surpassed 80 percent in Chongqing
Municipality, and the provinces of Zhejiang, Henan and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to Nie Meisheng, director of
the Housing Industrialization Promotion Center under the Ministry
of Construction.
</P>
<P>
She said the reform of the housing provision system has played
an important role in promoting residential home buying, and
ordinary residents have increasingly become the major players in
the housing market.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 70 percent of the commercial houses sold in
cities and towns across the country were bought by individuals.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has further improved the public housing fund-
raising system and accelerated the development of housing loans to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of employees participating
in the housing fund system had reached 69 million, and some 140.9
billion yuan had been collected for the fund, representing an
increase of 39.8 billion yuan over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various commercial banks have also extended loans
to individuals. From January to December 1999, the Industrial and
Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China, and the
Construction Bank, granted 74.6 billion yuan in housing loans to
individuals, with the loan balance topping 126 billion yuan, an
increase of 76.9 billion yuan compared with 1998.

<HEADLINE> IASIA Annual Conference Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The speeding up of economic
globalization and the rapid development of the high-tech industry
have had a profound impact on the political economic and social
sectors of all nations, and pose daunting challenges to all
governments, a Chinese State Councilor said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual conference of the International
Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA),
State Councilor and President of the China National School of
Administration (CNSA) Wang Zhongyu said a government has to
respond to the needs of its people if it wants its society and
economy to grow.
</P>
<P>
A nation, while adjusting to the ever-changing external
environment, must take more responsibility for the advancement of
science and technology, the buildup of overall national strength,
and for the improvement of the people's lives, Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's reform and opening-up in the past decades
is a developing country's response to the fast-changing domestic
and foreign environments. It also demonstrates the keen sense of
responsibility felt by the Chinese government toward its nation
and people.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a series of programs meant to establish an
efficient and practical government, build up a socialist market
economy, promote democracy and bring the country under the rule of
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's opening were Luo Haocai, a vice-
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Pichardo Pagaza,
president of the International Institute of Administrative
Sciences (IIAS), and Mohan Kaul, president of the IASIA.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 Chinese and overseas delegates are participating in
the four-day conference, which is sponsored by the NSA and the
Municipal School of Administration of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
IASIA was founded in 1962 as a branch of IIAS and became an
independent organization in 1971. The IASIA is headquartered
Brussels, with 170 members from over 70 nations.
</P>
<P>
The CNSA was officially launched in 1994 as a result of the
ongoing political reform in the country.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Direct Links Urged: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The July issue of Cross-Straits
Relation magazine published a bylined article urging the exchange
of mail service, trade and air and shipping services -- known as
the "three direct links" -- across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the issue of the "three direct links" has
become a focus since the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council expressed the willingness to have dialogue with the Taiwan
authority on the issue on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have reiterated the necessity of the "three
direct links," which is the requirement of cross-Straits economic
development and in the interests of the people on both sides of
the Straits, says the article.
</P>
<P>
Due to the joint efforts of the two sides, progress has been
made in the exchange of mail service, trade and air and shipping
services since 1987.
</P>
<P>
More than 16 million Taiwanese traveled in the mainland from
1987 to 1999, and the value of indirect cross-Straits trade has
exceeded 160 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the new leaders of Taiwan authority, disregarding the
interests of the Taiwan people, do not recognize the "one China
principle" and have formed new obstacles to the realization of "
three direct links," the article points out.
</P>
<P>
The article presses the leaders of the Taiwan authority to
retract the "two states" statement and to push forward the direct
exchanges and bring benefit to the people on both sides of the
Straits.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets Barak for Consultations on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for discussions on
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on the eve of a three-way
summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak arrived earlier at Cairo International Airport, where he
was greeted by his Egyptian counterpart Atef Obeid, Egypt's
official Middle East News Agency said. Barak went into one-on-one
talks with Mubarak at a presidential palace in northern Cairo
shortly after arrival.
</P>
<P>
Details of the talks were not immediately available. But
diplomats in Cairo expected that Barak would expound Israel's
positions on the final status talks with the Palestinians, which
have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Barak would return to Israel after the meeting to be present at
the parliament, which will vote later in the day on two censure
motions including one against his plans to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the political turmoil at home, Barak insists on flying
on to the U.S. for Tuesday's summit with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David near
Washington. The summit is designed to seek a final peace agreement
between the Palestinians and Israel before the self-imposed mid-
September deadline.

<HEADLINE> Bashar Casts Ballot in Syrian Presidential Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Bashar al-Assad, commander-in-
chief of the Syrian Armed Forces, on Monday cast his ballot in a
nationwide referendum which is set to elect him new president of
the republic after his father Hafez al-Assad died of heart attack
last month.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at a polling station in the Damascus-based al-Basel
Institute, Bashar was greeted by officials and voters who turned
out to vote when polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0400GMT).
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote, Bashar met with a number of teachers at
the institute, where he had received education, and thanked them
for giving him good education.
</P>
<P>
Over 9 million eligible voters of Syria's total population of 17
million are expected to cast their ballots at 11,185 polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
The voting, which will last for 12 hours, may be extended for
three hours in case of a heavy turnout.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Mohammad Harba is due to announce the
referendum result on Tuesday when the 250-member People's Assembly
(parliament) meets for a special session to approve the outcome of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Hafez al-Assad's demise on June 10, the
parliament amended the constitution to lower the age threshold for
a president from 40 to 34. In the days that followed, Bashar, an
eye doctor, was promoted from colonel to general and declared
commander of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
On June 27, the parliament unanimously approved the ruling Baath
Party's nomination of Bashar, 34, for the presidency and set July
10 as the date for the presidential referendum.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Security Advisor Optimizes About Summit Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Before departing for the Camp
David summit, Israeli Prime Minster Ehud Barak's security advisor
Danny Yatom said here Monday that the chances are good for Barak to
return with a peace accord acceptable to the majority of the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Yatom also reiterated that Israel will not recognize the right
of the Palestinian refugees to return home. He said Barak has not
changed his "red lines" regarding the return of the refugees,
namely, Israel is neither legally nor morally responsible for the
refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "a very small number" of Palestinians may be
permitted to enter Israel on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3.5 million Palestinian refugees now mainly
living in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. They were driven away from
home during the 1948 and 1967 Middle East wars.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Center Party leader Amnon Shahak said
Monday morning he believes new elections will be held shortly. He
is due to leave for Camp David near Washington to attend the
summit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Shahak, also minister of
transport, said he believed that there would have to be elections
since Barak could not continue to rely on a narrow coalition.
</P>
<P>
Following the successive resignations of the four-seat Yisrael
Ba'aliya party led by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, five-seat
National Religious party and the 17-seat ultra-Orthodox Shas party,
Barak's coalition was reduced to a crippling 42-seat minority in
the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz party, whose three ministers stepped down
in June over Shas's funding crisis, aired the willingness to return
to the government Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Barak also met with Am Ehad party leader Amir Peretz Sunday
night and asked him to join a narrow coalition. Peretz is expected
to respond to the proposal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak and his negotiation team are heading for the crucial
three-way summit in Camp David later on Monday in a bid to clinch a
framework deal for the settlement of the thorniest issues,
including the status of Jerusalem, the future of Jewish
settlements, borders, water, security and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The defection of the three ruling partners on the eve of the
negotiations has overshadowed the prospects for the summit, which
have already drawn extensive doubts due to the wide gaps between
the Israeli and Palestinian stances on key issues.

</P>
<P>
Iraq is keen to resume cooperation with Belgium "in all fields",

</P>
<P>
It is high time for the two countries to restore their normal

lifting the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian minister pledged that after his visit, he will make
efforts to help get the embargo lifted.
</P>
<P>
Habart expressed his country's readiness to cooperate with Iraq
in various fields, especially in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is one of the European countries vying for a slice of
Iraq's lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
Economic delegations from many European countries, including
France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Austria and Bulgaria, have visited
Iraq this year for closer trade ties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Tries to Save National Supermarket Bloc From Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Economy Ministry and the
Central Bank are due to hold emergency talks Monday to save the
Cooperative Supermarket Bloc from bankruptcy, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The looming bankruptcy of the debt-ridden chain of cooperative
supermarkets across Lebanon would turn some 2,000 more Lebanese
workers jobless and ruin some 25,000 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Industrial Association Jack Sarraf and the board
chairman of the supermarket bloc Munir Farghal are expected to
attend the meetings, to be co-chaired by Economy Minister Nasser
Saidi and Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh.
</P>
<P>
Farghal held a lengthy meeting with Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Sunday during which he revealed that sales of the supermarket chain
had lately slumped by 3.5 million U.S. dollars a month as a result
of recession, spiraling debts and the cessation of goods supplies
because arrears have not been paid to suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The overall debts of the bloc totaled about 103 million dollars
or more, the Safir newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is seeking to reschedule the debts while
Economy Minister Saidi will explore the possibility of French
partnerships to shore up the hard-hit sector, Al Mustaqbal
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Safir paper quoted unidentified sources at the supermarket bloc
as saying that an "organized apparatus" is orchestrating the drive
to bankrupt the cooperatives.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Manila Landslide Rises to 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said the
death toll in a landslide which struck the dumpsite in Payatas,
Quezon City of Metro Manila Monday morning has risen to 32 as of 6:
30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Mathay, mayor of Quezon City, told reporters Monday
evening that more than 500 families were affected and 100 shanties
were buried in the 9.14-meter landslide in Payatas dumpsite.
</P>
<P>
He added that 38 people were hospitalized and 780 others were
in an evacuation center.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead were children. Mathay said they were trapped
in their shanties because classes were suspended in Quezon City on
account of the strike.
</P>
<P>
Fears were ripe that the casualty count may still rise, with
the probers still uncertain as to how many, exactly, are still
buried and considered missing in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said teams from various
government offices have joined efforts in trying to retrieve the
dead and possibly rescue some more survivors.
</P>
<P>
Non-government organizations have also sent their own forces
and facilities to help in the rescue mission. The search and
rescue operations will continue during the night.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said President Joseph Estrada had ordered the provision
of everything needed by the victims of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Mathay said the shanties were inhabited by squatters who were
once resettled to other safer places but kept on returning, saying
that the place is their only source of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted to its erosion and eventually
became a "landslide said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy was precipitated by a tornado compounded by a fire
caused by faulty electrical wiring which added to the misery of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, at least two children died as a result of a similar
garbage landslide in the Payatas open dumpsite.

<HEADLINE> EU-Funded Reconstruction Project to Start in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction projects for
Mozambique funded by the European Union (EU) will get under way in
August, with an aim to repair the damages caused by the
devastating flooding in the southeast African country, said
reports reaching here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program outlined by the EU includes the rebuilding of the
urban infrastructures in the Chokwe town and the Xai-xai city,
located in south Mozambique near the Limpopo River, which flooded
in February and March, inundating a large area of fields and
destroying a lot of houses.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the flood control projects along the
Limpopo River is also considered as a priority of the EU-funded
program, according to the reports issued by the Portuguese Lusa
Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at the donors conference on Mozambican
reconstruction held in May, the European Union promised a sum of
67 million euros ( about 71.6 million U.S. dollars ).
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner for development and humanitarian aid, Poul
Nielson, said last weekend in Brussels that  2 million euros (2.1
million dollars) of the amount had been earmarked for immediate
projects, 13.5 million euros (14.2 million dollars) to support the
Mozambican government and 18 million euros (19 million dollars) to
recuperate urban infrastructures and protect the rural population.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Increases Power Export to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has gradually increased its
power export to Kenya from 10 megawatts in June to 70 megawatts in
the near future, Ugandan Energy Minister Syda Bumba told Xinhua
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The increase will not affect Ugandan consumers, because we are
exporting the power during the off-peak period between 11 p.m. and
6 a.m.," she said, adding that "instead of wasting that power, we
decided to export it to Kenya."
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Kenya are negotiating the new tariffs on the export,
which will be finalized after the completion of negotiations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has an installed capacity of 243 megawatts, while total
estimated peak demand on the system is 280 megawatts, leaving a
power deficit of 40 megawatts.

<P>
Last week, police seized 9,510 grams of heroin, confiscated 300,
000 yuan (about 36,144 U.S. dollars), and detained four suspected

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Medicine Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's medicine distribution
system is expected to undergo fundamental reforms, with chain
stores and delivery centers being set up to cut marketing cost,
today's Economic Information Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Yu Mingde, director of the drug department under the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), said that China has not yet
established a comprehensive, efficient drug circulation system due
to the slow pace of reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to focus on the sector's
reform in developing multiple ownership and introducing a modern
distribution system and marketing methods, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China encourages entrepreneurs to establish joint-stock
medicine companies or companies with limited liabilities to
facilitate the formation of "an open and orderly" drug
circulation system.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, in the next four or five years, a number of large
domestic drug company groups with international competitiveness
will emerge on the global market," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
For years China depended on state-owned wholesale outlets at
various levels to distribute medicine nationwide. Currently, there
are 16,000 such outlets, but only less than 400 of them reported
annual sales of over 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The average profit margin of drug trading firms was less than
one percent in 1999, yet their marketing cost was over 12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Poverty Relief Project Conforms With World Bank Policy &AMP; Charter: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes the
politicization of the business of the World Bank (WB) and will not
accept any conditions tacked on to a proposal by WB authorities, a
spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Finance said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to safeguard the integrity of the World
Bank charter, protect the interests of borrowers among developing
countries, and raise the people of all ethnic groups in the
project zone above poverty line as soon as possible, the Chinese
government plans to use its own money to carry out the poverty
relief project in Qinghai province of northwest China as it sees
fit.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Qinghai poverty relief project is meant
to help people of all ethnic groups in the area escape poverty and
improve the level of economic and social development in the area.
He said that the poverty relief project is in total conformity
with the policy and charter of the World Bank and welcomed by
people in the area.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that some developed-country shareholders of
the World Bank have proceeded from political motives and
shamelessly walked all over the World Bank charter by setting out
impossible conditions that will block the project, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"This just reveals the true nature of those who trample on
human rights under the disguise of 'human rights'," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that attempts to obstruct the poverty relief project
will not succeed, as the Chinese government's determination to
accelerate poverty relief work is unshakable.

WUHAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Yangtze River's largest flood peak
since the flood season this summer passed Wuhan at 14:00 on Sunday,
sources at the Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee said
today.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the flood peak was 25.6 meters high, 0.4

traffic control along the river, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The traffic control has been lifted today owing to rapid flood
recession.

<HEADLINE> 72nd Session of Council of Ministers Ends in Lome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The 72nd Session of Council of
Ministers in charge of preparing for the 36th annual summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) ended Monday morning, just
several hours ahead of the opening of the summit here with
compromise on the creation of the African Union whose headquarters
will be in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day session, the foreign ministers discussed a
lot of issues especially the creation of the African Union, an
initiative put forward by Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi at the
extraordinary summit of OAU in September 1999 in Syrte, Libya.
</P>
<P>
All member states agreed with the principle of the creation of
the Pan-African organization to replace the OAU, but differences
emerged over the issue during the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Some members like South Africa advocated a progressive
establishment of the African Union, while members like Libya
stressed that the union was an absolute necessity and that it
should be put in place no later than 2001 as stipulated in the
Syrte Declaration. The rest of members ruled out the possibility
of the union as the Charter of the OAU was still effective.
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty on the establishment of the African Union will
be high on the agenda of the summit which opens later Monday
morning to be attended by more than 30 African heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
Said Djinnit, assistant secretary general of the OAU for
political affairs, told a news briefing Sunday evening that there
was no hesitation at all within the OAU on the need of
establishing the African Union, and the debate mainly revolved
around the speed, the nature and the form of the proposed union.
</P>
<P>
He said the council of ministers also discussed ways to end
various conflicts on the continent: Angola, Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Comoros and
Somalia, and called for international assistance to the refugees
and displaced people as a result of war and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
They also recommended a series of measures to punish those
regimes taking power through coup, such as suspension of
participation of the OAU meeting.

LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former External Affairs
Minister Bolaji Akinyemi has urged the government to develop
diplomatic strategies in its effort to secure a seat for Nigeria
in the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Monday quoted him as saying in Ibadan, the
second largest city in the country, that Nigeria deserved a
position in the global body's most powerful arm in view of its
prominent roles in global politics.
</P>
<P>
"The bid is quite in order without mince of words, we deserve
it and I urge the government not to give up until we secure the
seat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Akinyemi, now a professor of political science with a field in
International Relations, said over the weekend that admission of
an African country into the council would make the august body
more responsive in seeking global peace.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Starts Visit to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
arrived here on Monday for a state visit to Germany by the highest
official of the Persian Gulf country in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was greeted at the airport by German President
Johnannes Rau and is scheduled to hold talks with Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder as well as Rau and address German businessmen in
the next two days. He will also visit Weimar to pay tribute to a
late Iranian poet buried there.
</P>
<P>
During the 1967 visit to West Berlin by then Iranian ruler Shah
Pahlavi, there were clashes among Pahlavi's supporters, opponents
and police, leading to the death of one German student.
</P>
<P>
As Iranian exiles planned large-scale demonstration to disrupt
Khatami's visit, the Berlin authorities took highest security
measures for the event, reportedly with some Iranians turned back
at the checkpoints along the border between Germany and other
countries and some arrests here overnight.
</P>
<P>
The German-Iranian relations were marred in the 1990s by a
German court's charge of terrorism against the Iranian government
and the arrest of German businessman Kaufmann Hofer in Tehran.
The release of Hofer in January this year and the visit by German
Foreign Minister Joschhka Fischer to Iran in May paved the way for
the improvement of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Production Accelerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial output grew by
11.2 percent for the first half of the year, the highest half-year
growth rate over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that
China's value added industrial output totaled 1.0996 trillion yuan
(132.5 billion US dollars) in the January-June period, 11.2
percent more than a year earlier. The growth rate was 1.8
percentage points higher than in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Monthly value added industrial output reached 209.2 billion
yuan in June, 12.2 percent more than the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS, the industrial sector has witnessed signs of
rising sales and diminishing stockpiles. For the first half of the
year, sales-output ratio of industrial products rose to 96.8
percent, 1.15 percentage points higher than a year earlier. In
June, the ratio climbed to 97.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stockpiles at state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and large and
medium-sized companies began to drop due to improving market
demand and control of supply in some industries.
</P>
<P>
NBS said SOEs, exports and hi-tech products helped boost
industrial output by 4.2 percentage points, 2.9 percentage points
and 1.7 percentage points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first half-year, SOEs and state-controlled firms in the
industrial sector registered a total value added output of 653.8
billion yuan, 9.8 percent more than in the same period of last
year. The growth rate was 2.2 percentage points higher than in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, exports of industrial products totaled 628.
5 billion yuan, up 27.2 percent over the same period of last year.
The growth rate was 21.5 percentage points higher than in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, output of information and telecommunication
products such as carrier wave equipment, optical communication
equipment, program-controlled telephone switches, personal
computers and integrate circuits saw increases between 22.4
percent and 90.9 percent. Output of handsets of cellular phones
increased by 1.4 times.
</P>
<P>
NBS figures show that the Chinese government's efforts to
overhaul the coal, metallurgical and sugar industries have begun
to work. In the January-May period, the coal industry reduced
losses by 440 million yuan; the metallurgical industry's profit
was 6.8 times that in the same period of last year; the sugar
industry reduced sugar output by 23.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Makes 54 Billion Yuan Fixed-asset Loans in 1st Half-year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 10 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of this year,
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) granted loans
of 54 billion Yuan (about 7 billion U.S. dollars) to fixed-asset
investment projects, up 47 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ICBC said that 26.2 billion yuan went to
highways, electricity, urban construction and other infrastructure
projects, accounting for 49 percent of the total, and 27.8 billion
yuan was for enterprise technological upgrading and high-tech
projects, accounting for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the bank doubled its fixed-asset loans
to the country's western part compared with the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past two years, the ICBC has provided
considerable loans to the state's key infrastructure projects in
an effort to support the state's policies of expanding domestic
demand and promoting economic growth.

Since 1998, the ICBC has granted loans totaling 170 billion
yuan to infrastructure projects, including 60.5 billion yuan for

<HEADLINE> Water Supply in Chinese Cities up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China supplied an average 215
million cubic meters of water for its cities per day in 1999, more
than 88 times those of 1949 when the People's Republic of China
was founded, "China Water Resources News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese cities used 46.75 billion cubic meters of water
last year; the figure for each urban resident reached 217.5 liters
per day on average.
</P>
<P>
The rise in water supply is partly attributed to the
construction of water supply facilities. Statistics show that
China invested more than 35 billion yuan (about 4.22 billion U.S.
dollars) to build urban water supply facilities over the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (from 1991 to 1995), and the figure
continued to increase over the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (from
1996 to 2000).
</P>
<P>
The country has adopted a series of policies on water saving,
environmental protection, the improvement of water quality and the
use of groundwater since 1980.
</P>
<P>
China has about 400 cities.

<HEADLINE> China Marks World Population Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Family Planning
Commission (SFPC) held a meeting here today to mark this year's
World Population Day, which has the theme of "saving women's
lives".
</P>
<P>
China will launch a series of activities across the country to
provide reproductive health care service for women, and give tests
and treatment for women's common diseases, said Zhang Weiqing,
president of the SFPC.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 600 pilot counties in China which
have launched better reproductive health care service, and
projects of reproductive health and family planning supported by
the United Nations are also launched in 32 counties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that family planning has helped free Chinese women
from the burden of early marriage, early child bearing and a large
number of children. They have got more time to involve themselves
in social, economic, political and cultural activities, and their
social status has been improved.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are still a large number of poor women in
rurual China, and problems such as gender discrimination and women
abusing still exist.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country will strengthen its family planning
policy and try to resolve problems related to population and women,
and promote the social status of Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
The world's population reached five billion on July 11 of 1987.

Population Day.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Support Barak's Attendance at Camp David Summit: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An absolute majority of Israelis
support the decision of Prime Minister Ehud Barak to go to Camp
David in the United States for the Israeli-Palestinian-U.S. summit
in a bid to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, a poll showed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll result, published by Israel's popular Hebrew daily
Yediot Aharonot Monday morning, will boost Barak's confidence
before the historic summit and corroborate his claims that he
received the mandate to negotiation directly from the grassroots
people.
</P>
<P>
The Yediot Aharonot poll, carried out by the Dahaf Institute,
showed that 52 percent of the Israelis interviewed believed that
Barak should go ahead with his plan to Camp David, while 45 percent
believed he should not and three percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
The poll was carried out Sunday on a representative sample of
502 adult Israelis, with a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is facing the most difficult times since he
took office last July, after three right-wing ruling partners in
his coalition resigned from his government one after another in a
24-hour period staring from Sunday, dramatically reducing his
control in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament) from 68 majority to
42 minority.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was announced by Clinton last Wednesday, will
try to resolve interim issues between Israel and the Palestinians,
as well as the final-status issues, such as the status of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
Camp David, the summit venue, carries special historic meaning
for
Israelis as Israel and Egypt signed their landmark peace deal there
in 1979, the first peace accord between the Jewish state and an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 53 percent of the Israelis surveyed
thought that Barak had a mandate to make concessions during the
summit, while 44 percent thought he did not.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure for Camp David, Barak resorted to
the public in a televised speech Sunday night, saying "I need to
stand above all these political differences and all these party
considerations and to make every possible effort in the search for
a peace agreement which will end the bloodshed between us and our
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
During his lightening trip to Britain and France last week,
Barak even said, "Even if I stay with nine ministers and one
quarter of the Knesset behind me, we will do it (the peace
negotiation)."
</P>
<P>
Now, Barak has 13 ministers and a third of the Knesset seats in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 43 percent of Israelis preferred to
holding a new election to resolve the coalition crisis, 39 percent
supported a national unity government including the major
opposition party Likud, while 18 percent backed a narrow majority
government led by Barak.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Companies Urged to Penetrate Italian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian companies have been
urged to penetrate the Italian market by establishing direct and
continuous contact with their Italian counterparts in order to
increase Malaysia's exports to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The companies could either do this by going to Italy themselves
or via the assistance provided by the Malaysian External Trade
Development Corporation (MATRADE), its Director of Trade Advisory
and Training Sukandar Abdul Latif said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the trade balance between the country and Italy
favored the latter last year, it is not impossible for Malaysia to
turn the table around in the near future, he said after opening a
business meeting between Italian and Malaysian companies here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The business meeting is part of a six-day Italian buying
mission to Malaysia organized by the MATRADE and a total of 11
Italian companies took part in the mission.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Malaysia exported goods of 1.96 billion ringgit (510
million U.S. dollars) to Italy against its imports of 2.03 billion
ringgit (530 million U.S. dollars) from Italy. Italy was Malaysia'
s 22nd largest export market last year.
</P>
<P>
He said signs for this prospect are already there as the first
four months this year saw Malaysia's exports to Italy increasing
to 691.3 million ringgit (181.92 million U.S. dollars) against
imports of 665.7 million ringgit (175.18 million U.S. dollars),
reflecting a surplus of 25.5 million ringgit (6.71 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main exports to Italy were telecommunications
equipment, textiles, electrical and electronic products, palm oil
and rubber goods while Italy's exports to Malaysia were industrial
machinery, telecommunication equipment, leather, chemicals and
iron and steel products.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Steel Production and Sales Record Double-Digit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Steel production and sales
recorded double-digit growth in the first half of this year
because of high demand caused by the country's infrastructure
development, according to a report of the latest local newspaper
Vietnam Investment Review (VIR).
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year the country's steel industry
produced 755,960 tons of construction steel, a 20 percent increase
over the same period last year, VIR quoted an official of Vietnam
Steel Corporation (VSC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, total steel sales of the country,
including imported steel, hit 1.45 million tons, representing 58
percent of the country's annual target and an increase of 23
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Higher sales and production meant that Vietnam's state-owned
steel mills have officially made profits of 4.07 million U.S.
dollars while foreign-invested joint ventures operating in the
industry have netted some 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese government's drive to boost demand for steel and
the implementation of major infrastructure projects have helped
push the sales along nicely", the official of VSC said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Improve Health Care for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
addressing women reproductive health seriously with the recent
adoption of a sessional paper on population and sustainable
development by the Parliament , a Kenyan population officer has
said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya would hold the World Population Day celebration next
week in Kisumu city in southwestern Kenya, with the theme "saving
women's lives through provision of better reproductive health",
Kisaya Kisaka was quoted by the East African Standard newspaper as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kisaka said at present 590 mothers in Kenya die out of every
100,000 live births due to maternity related deaths, urging the
government to improve reproductive health to reduce maternal
mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
Improved education for women would also help ensure reduction
of such deaths, he added.
</P>
<P>
The officer noted that a health survey conducted in 1998
indicated a sharp decline in infertility rates in Kenya, noting
that the country's total fertility rate is now 4.7 children per
women down from 5.4 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This also indicated improved awareness on the use of
contraceptive methods in spacing births, Kisaka said.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Portugal Sign Cooperation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Angola has signed an indicative
program of cooperation worth 20 million U.S. dollars with Portugal,
a source of the Angolan Foreign Ministry said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The accord, rubricated by the Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda and his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama, will cover
actions of education, public works and energy in Angola, a
Portuguese-speaking southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed at the weekend in Lisbon,
these actions of cooperation for the period 2000-2003 will also
fund the fight against poverty, entrepreneurial support, social
communication, construction and the creation of infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Joao Miranda announced that Angola
has disbursed 30 million U.S. dollars for an emergency program,
which allowed a slow solution to the most serious problems with
the populations. He added that the humanitarian situation in
Angola is improving substantially as result of the reduction of
the number of war displaced persons and the needy children.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan minister paid a two-day official visit to Portugal
at the invitation of the Portuguese government, with the aim to
discuss issues on the strengthening of bilateral relations. During
his first official visit to Portugal since he took office in
January 1999, Joao Miranda was audienced by the Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio, to whom he delivered a message from the
Angolan head of state Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

<HEADLINE> Russia Publishes New Foreign Policy Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday published a new
foreign policy concept approved by President Vladimir Putin on
June 28, which describes the country's diplomacy as "
omnidirectional, balanced, independent and based on national
interests."
</P>
<P>
"Russia will pursue an independent, balanced, open and
predictable foreign policy," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
told a news conference here on Putin's new foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The new concept calls for protecting the country's national
interests in a consistent and, if need be, tough way, but "this
approach has nothing to do with national egotism, isolationism or
confrontation," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate openness to cooperation and the search for a
balance of interests." He stressed.
</P>
<P>
Taking healthy pragmatism as its theme, "the concept provides
for foreign policy helping in a tangible way in the resolution of
domestic problems," Ivanov said, noting that this does not imply "
narrowing the sphere of Russian foreign policy activity."
</P>
<P>
"It will be more rational and cost-effective both politically
and economically," he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign policy will work for the security of the
country and the creation of "favorable conditions for economic
growth and the protection of the interests of our citizens and
fellow countrymen abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
"New challenges and threats to Russia's national interests" are
emerging in the international sphere, while the tendency towards a
uni-polar structure of the world, in which the United States
dominates economically and militarily, is strengthening, the new
concept says.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy of unilateral actions and weakening the role of
the U.N. Security Council can destabilize the situation in the
world, provoke tension and an arms race, exacerbate inter-
governmental contradictions, as well as national and religious
discord," it reads.
</P>
<P>
The document says Russia "will strive for a multi-polar system
of international relations that will reflect the diversity of the
present-day world and its diverse interests in a real way."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov emphasized that the new concept is "maximally concrete
as to the determination of Russia's priorities in the solution of
global and regional problems."
</P>
<P>
Russia "has always been and will be a great power, a powerful
military and nuclear power," Ivanov said, reaffirming that Moscow
will not violate international law or the U.N. Charter to achieve
its national interests.
</P>
<P>
"By means of the concrete actions of politicians, we are
demonstrating that the role of Russia is the role of a great power
in the world order of the 21st century taking shape today," said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to and will not relinquish our national
interests... Therefore, when toughness is called for, there will
be toughness. However, this should not be interpreted as
confrontation or aggression, it should be seen as the firm,
constructive defense of national interests," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese T-bond Market Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Today all Chinese treasury bonds
rallied narrowly except for Bond 010004, which edged down 0.04
percent at the close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the market totaled 1.18 billion yuan, down 427
million yuan from last Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Amend Traffic Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish parliamentary commission
has decided to work through the three-month summer recess to
prepare for reforming the traffic laws to curb the sharp rise of
the number of accidents which claimed 60,000 lives in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
The traffic investigative commission, established one day before
the parliament closure for the recess at the beginning of July,
will submit a reform bill in October for debate, local media
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to form such a commission was prompted by a
mourning father who walked from Istanbul to Ankara in an effort to
raise public awareness of Turkey's grave traffic problem which
seriously injured or disabled one million people in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Boray Uras, who lost his beloved daughter Selin and Selin's
fiance
in Istanbul last April, covered the 450-kilometer-long journey for
more than 20 days, an action that shocked Ankara. Dozens of
deputies signed a letter urging the parliament to amend traffic
laws.
</P>
<P>
The commission chairman, Ahmet Tan, said that it would identify
shortcomings in Turkey's driver education, infrastructure and
regulations, and collect opinions from universities and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey had lost more people to traffic
accidents than to wars and devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The great number of accidents was attributed to overspeed,
carelessness and insufficient training for drivers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli NRP Ministers Submit Letters of Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Construction
and Housing Yitzhak Levy, also leader of the National Religious
Party (NRP), Monday submitted his letter of resignation to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak before Barak left for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
NRP's two deputy ministers, Deputy Education Minister Shaul
Yahalom and Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs Yigal Bibi, also
resigned automatically.
</P>
<P>
Barak said as he accepted the letters that his heart was torn
apart over the future of Judea and Samaria (the ancient Jewish view
of the West Bank).
</P>
<P>
The NRP Central Committee held a meeting in Tel Aviv Sunday
evening and authorized its ministers to resign from Barak's
coalition. NRP opposes to Barak's attendance at a three-way summit
slated for Tuesday at Camp David near Washington, which will also
be attended by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at solving the differences between Israel
and the Palestinians on key issues such as the status of Jerusalem,
borders, refugees and settlements and trying to reach a framework
agreement for their settlement.
</P>
<P>
Barak's two other coalition partners, the ultra-Orthodox
religious Shas party and Yisrael Ba'aliya of Russian immigrants,
left Barak's coalition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the three parties took Barak's government down
to 13 cabinet ministers from 22 and reduced his coalition from 68
seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) to 42.
</P>
<P>
Barak will return to Israel later Monday from Egypt after
holding talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ahead of
Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
He will leave for Washington in the evening after Knesset's
voting on the motions of no-confidence against him submitted by the
opposition Likud party.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade with South Countries Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's trade with South
countries increased by 7.6 percent in 1999 over that in 1998,
according to International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade with these countries amounted to 97.2 billion
ringgit (25.57 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 against 90.3 billion
ringgit (23.76 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, she said when
opening the 14-day familiarization program for officials of
Investment Promotion Agencies of developing countries here
organized by the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority and
the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Program.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, exports to these countries last year
amounted to 56.8 billion ringgit (14.94 billion U.S. dollars), up
4.1 percent, while imports stood at 40.4 billion ringgit (10.63
billion U.S. dollars), up 12.8 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 6 Killed in Manila Dumpsite Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- At least six children have been
confirmed dead and many others hurt after incessant rains caused a
landslide Monday morning in a mountain-high garbage dump site in
Metro Manila, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Mathay, mayor of Quezon City where the dumpsite was
located, said some 70 shanties in Barangay (village) Payatas
inhabited by squatters who are earning a living by scavenging in
the dumpsite were buried under tons of domestic waste and garbage.
</P>
<P>
Mathay said the shanties were inhabited by squatters who were
once resettled to other safer places but kept on returning, saying
that the place is their only source of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He added that search and rescue operation is now the order of
the day and the city government is exerting all efforts and
mobilizing all available resources to help the squatter-victims
and their families.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted to its erosion and eventually
became a "landslide", said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy was precipitated by a tornado compounded by a fire
caused by faulty electrical wiring which added to the misery of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, at least two children died as a result of a similar
garbage landslide in the Payaas open dumpsite.

<HEADLINE> Half of Tanzania's Land Threatened With Desertification  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of Tanzania's
land is now under the threat of desertification due to increased
human activities, the independent Guardian newspaper reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The problem which in recent years was only confined to some
parts of central Tanzania has now spread to areas which are
hitherto not thought to be in danger of desertification.
</P>
<P>
The rate of desertification in Tanzania has surpassed efforts
to combat it, Richard Muyungi, assistant director of Environment
in the Vice-President's Office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly due to adverse weather changes and increased
human activity, explained Muyungi, adding that in some parts it
was caused by overstocking.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly the case in central Tanzania where there
are pastoralists with large herds of livestock, which exceed the
carrying capacity of the land and lead to overgrazing, said
Muyungi.
</P>
<P>
Other causes include deforestation, over-cultivation, excessive
mismanaged irrigation and over-population, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said refugees fled into the country are also causing
desertification, because when they settle in an area in large
numbers, they cut down all the trees and destroy vegetation.
</P>
<P>
However, Muyungi said efforts are being made by various
organizations and institutions to combat this problem and they
have managed to raise people's awareness on desertification.
</P>
<P>
While some NGOs are engaged in land management programs in
areas threatened with desertification, the Vice-President's Office
has been offering support to various district councils to that
effect in terms of expert advice as well as material support, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Most bare lands in Tanzania today were covered with thick
evergreen forests between 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Increasing populations pressure, cutting of wood for charcoal,
bush fires, and development of industries have made the country
lose 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of forests a year, while less
than 200,000 hectares of forests are planted annually,
environmentalists said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Apologizes to All Soccer-playing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Soccer chief
executive said in Auckland Monday that New Zealand Soccer will
apologize to every soccer-playing nation for Friday's action of
Charlie Dempsey, president of Oceania Football Confederation (OFC).
</P>
<P>
South Africa will receive a "special" letter of apology after
the New Zealander on Friday ignored OFC instructions and failed to
support South Africa's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, the
Television NZ quoted Bill MacGowan as saying Monday in the biggest
city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey abstained from the vote in Zurich, effectively giving
the event to Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We will be apologizing. We certainly will be," Chief Executive
MacGowan of New Zealand Soccer said.
</P>
<P>
"We will write, today, to all countries associated with FIFA,
explaining New Zealand Soccer's position because I think New
Zealand Soccer's taken too much of the brunt of this decision,
only because Charlie resides here, and stuff coming off the news
wires all over the world, it was a New Zealand Soccer decision,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
MacGowan noted Dempsey's abstention from voting "is clearly not
a New Zealand Soccer decision."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, 79-years-old Dempsey, after
meeting OFC delegates in Auckland on Sunday, announced he would
retire at the end of September, two years earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
He said he decided not to vote because he had been put under "
intolerable pressure" by supporters of the competing bids,
including attempts to bribe him.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of his departure for Camp David, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Sunday brushed off his coalition crisis and
turned to the public with a plea to support him in his endeavors.
</P>
<P>
"I need to stand above all these political differences and all
these party considerations and to make every possible effort in the
search for a peace agreement which will end the bloodshed between
us and our neighbors," Barak said in a televised press conference.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that, if a peace agreement is reached, he will
bring it before the people in a referendum, and further pledged to
abide by the "red lines" he set out for himself.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- With his coalition slashed in one day from 68 to 42 Knesset
(Parliament) members following the resignation of three parties,
Barak Monday departs as the head of the Israeli delegation to the
Camp David summit meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
For the third time since the inception of the government a year
ago, the religious Shas party Sunday announced its resignation from
the coalition, this time citing Barak's refusal to spell out his "
red lines" in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky's Yisrael Ba'aliya party also
resigned Sunday, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy's
National Religious Party will follow suit Monday, after getting the
go-ahead from his party's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister David Levy announced that he would
not join Barak at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The disintegration of Barak's government is causing serious
concerns in the United States. The Americans are worried that Barak
will arrive at the crucial Camp David summit without a majority in
the Knesset (Parliament) and effectively without a government.
</P>
<P>
The slashing statements made recently by Foreign Minister David
Levy and his decision not to attend the summit meeting heightened
the administration's fears that Barak may not be in a position to
make the historic decisions the Camp David meeting will require.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' announcement that they, like Israel, will hold
a referendum on any agreement, with the voters to include the
Palestinian refugees, only reinforced the Americans' evaluation
that the prospects for the summit's success are not good.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman will submit his letter of
resignation to Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg Monday. It will take
effect 48 hours later, ending his seven years in office and a long
career of service.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after Shas leader Eli Yishai announced his
party's intention to leave the coalition, Weizman called upon Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to form "as wide a government as possible with
as few disagreements as possible," but stopped short of calling for
a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Arye Shumer, director general of Weizman's Office, will submit
the resignation letter on Weizman's behalf to Burg, who will serve
as interim president until a new president is elected July 31 and
sworn in on August 1.

<P>

Egyptian Natural Gas Company (GASCO) has signed a contract with the
British-U.S. giant BP Amoco for the export of Egyptian propane gas.
Under the deal, BP Amoco would buy 80,000 tons of propane, worth 25
million U.S. dollars, from El Amria Natural Gases Complex,
affiliated to GASCO, during the fiscal year 2000/2001. This is the
first time that Egypt has exported propane.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa arrived in Lome late
Sunday on a three-day visit to Togo. During his stay, Moussa will
attend the meeting of the 36th session of the African summit to
kick off Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday held talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Borg el-Arab near Alexandria to
discuss Tuesday's Camp David summit, aimed at removing obstacles
blocking a final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the talks had focused on the
status of Jerusalem, which he said was the most urgent issue on the
summit's agenda.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Coup Leader Excludes Indians from New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's coup leader George Speight
excluded Monday the ethnic Indians and other nationalities from a
new government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press AAP, Speight said
the new government would be open to indigenous Fijians only for at
least the next two years, excluding ethnic Indians and other
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
He signed an agreement Sunday night with the military
authorities letting the Great Council of Chiefs to select a
president and a voice president latter this week and he will
release on Thursday all 27 hostages held in the parliament complex
since May 19.
</P>
<P>
Speight laid the blame on the military for the protracted
negotiations over a solution to the Pacific island's crisis. He
accused the military of colluding with former president Ratu
Kamisese Mara and the 1987 year coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka.
</P>
<P>
"They have tried all they can to manipulate the army in order
to serve their own means to get rid of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speight said the political ambitions of Rabuka were finished,
while his own future was up to the Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Speight reiterated he did not plan to be part of the new
government, although he would consider it if specifically invited.

<HEADLINE> EU Possible to Lift Fish Ban on Uganda in July  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) might lift
its ban on Ugandan fish export this month, the Monitor daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An EU veterinary committee will sit this month to consider the
ban which was imposed on Uganda's fish export to the EU since
March 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There is a proposal by some member states to consider lifting
the ban, and what is envisaged is that the issue may be considered,
" said Ryelendt Bernad, head of an inspection team of the EU on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Bernad said that lifting the ban is the most immediate, and
this is the long term issue of a definite monitoring
infrastructure to ensure that incidents like fish poisoning do not
occur again.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans used poison to harvest fish in early 1999, which
resulted in the ban on Uganda's fish export to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU threatened that if Uganda could not meet the new demands
by December 23, 2000, it would be permanently ruled out of the
list of countries allowed to export fish to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU's ban on Uganda's fish export reduced the country's
earnings by more than 30 million U.S. dollars over the past year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan to Ease Kenya's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will cut its power rationing
by half, from 12 hours to six hours a day, following the World
Bank's approval of a 75-million-U.S. dollar loan, leading Kenyan
newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will help Kenya install two mobile generators with a
capacity of 75 megawatts and 30 megawatts respectively on the
outskirts of Nairobi, the newspapers quoted Energy Minister
Francis Masakhalia as saying.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia said his government was in the process of
rehabilitating steam turbines at Kiperu in Mombassa in
southeastern Kenya, which will add another 30 megawatts to the
national grid.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Uganda would soon increase power exports to Kenya
from 50 to 60 megawatts to be used during the night, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
These are part of the measures the Kenyan government has taken
to ease power rationing by October, Masakhalia added.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged drought, power generation has greatly
affected by the low levels of the reservoirs, and Kenya has
introduced an intensifying power rationing nationwide since late
May.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 50,000 people in western
Uganda are facing food shortage after hailstones destroyed the
crops there, the New Vision daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some sub-counties in the Masindi District were greatly affected
by hailstones which destroyed finger millet, cassava, maize and
beans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Many people had not harvested the crops, and there is now a
threat of famine," Blasto Byabakama, district extension co-
ordinator, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Houses built of mud and wattle there were also destroyed, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The residents have appealed to the local government in the
district for a tax waiver this financial year, saying that they
could not afford paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, District Council Chairman John Majara said that
although the incident was regrettable, there could not be an
automatic tax waiver for the residents.

<HEADLINE> Cloned Cow Gives Birth to Calf in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A cloned cow gave birth to a female
calf Monday at the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center
in Ishikawa Prefecture on the Sea of Japan coast, the center
announced.
</P>
<P>
The cow and calf, born through natural delivery, are both
healthy, the center said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said it is
the first time that a cow cloned from somatic cells gives birth in
Japan, adding that it is likely also the first such birth in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The cow, Kaga No. 2, was born in August 1998 and became
pregnant through artificial insemination last fall.
</P>
<P>
The birth proved that cows cloned from somatic cells can bear
young as ordinary cows, and the birth has brought scientists
closer to realizing practical uses for cloning, such as improving
the quality and mass production of beef, officials at the center
were quoted as saying by the Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
Kaga No. 2 and its twin Noto No. 2 were the world's first cows
cloned from somatic cells. The center expects Noto No. 2 to give
birth in September.

<HEADLINE> NSA: Cradle of China's Public Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The annual conference of the
International Association of School and Institutes of
Administration (IASIA), which was opened here today, has brought
to light the rarely publicized National School of Administration
of China.
</P>
<P>
NSA is seen as one of the direct results of China's ongoing
political reform as it was set up in line with resolutions made by
the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
in 1987 and the Eighth National People's Congress conference in
1988.
</P>
<P>
At present, State Councilor Wang Zhongyu is the president of
the NSA. NSA president must be a leading member of the State
Council, the Chinese cabinet.
</P>
<P>
NSA's campus was built in the western part of this national
capital, covering a dozen ha., with a floor space of 110,000 sq.m.,
at a cost of nearly 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching and dormitory buildings, NSA has built up a
complete set of advanced auxiliary facilities including a library,
an information center, an electronic teaching center, a computer
center, and an audio and video center.
</P>
<P>
Currently, NSA has employed over 200 full-time and part-time
teachers, some of them being experienced government officials.
</P>
<P>
Between 1988 and June 2000, NSA had sponsored 160 training
courses attended by 7,467 senior and ordinary public servants in
central and local government departments.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the NSA has also helped train hundreds of public
servants for the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administration Region.
</P>
<P>
NSA has established close ties with similar institutions in
more than 20 countries and regions. While inviting many foreign
officials and noted figures to give lectures, NSA has sent its
teaching staff and researchers to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
David Lee, a senior advisory technician from the government of
the Macao Special Administrative Region, has just completed his
training at the NSA. "The teachers are very experienced scholarly
officials from the central government and we have benefited a lot
from their lectures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, NSA is going to hold training classes for foreign
government officials beginning later this year.
</P>
<P>
NSA has become a major base in China for training both senior
and ordinary government officials and managers of large and medium-
sized enterprises on the science of administration, said Zhang
Xiuxue, a vice president of NSA since 1994 when it was officially
inaugurated.

<P>
Chinese archaeologists have discovered a batch of animal
fossils and stone tools dating 100,000 years ago during a recent
excavation in the Three Gorges area in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made at an Old Stone Age site at Jingshuiwan,
Fengdu County, which covers more than 3,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>

others.
</P>
<P>

Beijing, featuring replicas of the Dunhuang caves and original
sutras found in the secret Library Cave.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, organized by the State Cultural Heritage
Administration and the Gansu provincial government, also displays
dozens of precious cultural relics and delicate copies of the well-
known Dunhuang frescoes.
</P>

same time.
</P>
<P>

in China, a 5,000-year-old country which is undergoing urban
construction amid an economic boom.
</P>
<P>

-- Well-Preserved Volcano Craters Found in Hainan
</P>
<P>
More than 50 well-preserved volcano craters have been found
near Qiongshan city in northern Hainan, China's southernmost
island province.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese geologists who have just made an inspection
trip to the area heralded the large number of craters, with intact
lava tunnels, as a modern geological museum of volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that some 70 million years ago, northern Hainan
had more than 30 volcanic eruptions, which produced the craters.
Some of the bigger ones have now been opened to tourists.
</P>
<P>
-- 4,000-year-old Percussion Instrument Unearthed
</P>
<P>
A rectangular stone musical instrument, confirmed to be a type
of percussion instrument used in ancient China, was recently
unearthed at the site of Qijia Culture in Qinghai Province,
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (
CASS) and the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research Institute
said that this is the first such instrument ever found in the
history of Chinese archaeology.
</P>
<P>
They said that the discovery may reverse the traditional theory
that ancient percussion instruments were triangular-shaped or
square. The Qijia Culture flourished in the transitional period
from the Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, some 3,500 to 4,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- China's Ancient Inventions Recorded at Dunhuang Grottoes
</P>
<P>
Frescoes and other cultural objects unearthed from China's
Mogao Grottoes provide evidence that China led the world in
scientific and technological development before modern science
appeared in the West at the end of 18th century.
</P>
<P>
The honeycomb of caves known as the Mogao Grottoes, in Dunhuang
city of Gansu Province in the northwest, are etched into the steep
cliff at the foot of Mingsha Mountain. Inside the caves are tens
of thousands of ancient documents, Buddhist sutras and murals
dating back to the 4th through 11th centuries.
</P>
<P>
The art of printing, which has helped to advance human
civilization, is known to have originated in China. The ingenuity
of the ancient Chinese is apparent at Dunhuang.

<HEADLINE> US Hopes for Positive Talks with DPRK: Delegation Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It has been 14 months since the US-North Korea bilateral
missiles talks. Much has happened since then," Robert Einhorn, the
Assistant Secretary of State for non-proliferation who is
representing US at the three-day talks, told reporters at the
outset of the resumed talks at the US embassy here.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation is headed by Jang Chang Chon, director-
general for US affairs at the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Einhorn said former US Secretary of Defence Bill Parry led a
comprehensive review of US policy towards DPRK during that period
which produced a new framework of US policy toward Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The US is prepared to move step by step toward a fundamental
improvement in relationship with the DPRK Koreans as Pyongyang
addressed issues of concern to the US and its allies, particularly
nuclear and missile questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the US is happy that DPRK has embarked on expanding
contact with the outside world, including resumption of normalized
talks with Japan, a summit level meeting with China and soon with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has also established relationships with Italy,
Australia, the Philippines, among others, and would soon
participate in the ASEAN regional forum.
</P>
<P>
He said the US hopes the summit between south Korean President
Kim Dae-Jung and his DPRK counterpart Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang
last month will lead to lasting peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Future of NZ's Diplomatic Ties With Fiji On Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radio NZ Monday quoted Goff as saying that the decision on
whether New Zealand maintains a diplomatic presence would be
affected by any involvement of the coup elements in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The Fijian military and coup leader George Speight signed an
accord Sunday night that will result in the release of the
remaining 27 hostages this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, including former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry,
have now been held in the parliamentary compound in Suva for over
50 days.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs of Fiji are scheduled to hold a
meeting following the release of the hostages when they will name
a new president, vice president and civilian government to replace
the interim government named by the military last week.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the accord, Speight spokesman Joe Nata
said he expects that the Council will consult with their group and
that coup supporters would become part of the new administration.
</P>
<P>
Speight himself said he is ecstatic at the signing of the
accord with the military, which he called a great day for Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand foreign minister said it is good news if the
hostages are released, but bad news that Speight and the people
behind him have achieved their objective.
</P>
<P>
He said he has no hope that the Great Council of Chiefs would
stand up to Speight when it meets on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Goff said if Speight and his people are pulling the strings in
the new Fijian government, the New Zealand government will toughen
its approach, including cutting back on aid, military assistance
and its diplomatic representation in Suva.

<HEADLINE> WHO Offers Aid to Fight Disease along Thai-Myanmar Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization said
it would invest 40 million baht (1.02 million U.S. dollars) to
tackle HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis along the Thai Border
with Myanmar, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The WHO financial aid would help reduce malaria cases, increase
condom use and cure tuberculosis, Korn Dabbaransi, Thai deputy
prime minister and public health minister, said Sunday at the end
of first meeting of health administrators on bilateral cooperation
in disease control between Thailand and Myanmar in Thai northern
resort city of Chiang Mai.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has been bearing a cost of over 200 million baht (5.
12 million dollars) every year in taking care of the health of
immigrants from neighboring countries," Korn said, adding that
Thailand is at the stage which it can no longer bear the cost
alone.
</P>
<P>
The health ministries of the two nations hope to reduce malaria
by five percent a year, achieve 100 percent increase in condom use
and enforce "directly observed treatment" by 85 percent in all
districts and towns along the Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
Due to the incomplete intake of medicines among patients,
malaria and tuberculosis cases were on the increase in Chiang Rai,
Tak, Ranong and Kanchanaburi provinces, all of which bordering
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Malaria cases rose from 100,000 to 120,000 between 1996 to 1998,
the public health ministry said, mostly among foreign migrants
seeking treatment along the border.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was also concerned about the increase of HIV/Aids
cases and reports that 80 percent of female sex workers in the
border towns of Tak, Chiang Rai and Ranong were Myanmar, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Health centers will be set up in border towns in Chiang Rai,
Tak and Ranong to tackle the three major diseases, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Korn was quoted as saying that the problem would never be
solved without the cooperation of neighboring countries and
international bodies.

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka to Consult Tamil Parties on Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government of ruling People's Alliance (PA) has planned to
reach consensus with Tamil parties in two weeks and present
constitutional reforms to Parliament for approval before it is
dissolved on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The PA government and the main opposition United National Party
(UNP) reached a landmark consensus last Friday on the
constitutional reforms aimed at ending the long-running ethnic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reforms aim to devolve more powers to regions
including one administered by Tamils, in an effort to wean the
minority away from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
who have been fighting for a separate homeland called Eelam in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), a mainstream
Tamil political party, has rejected the reforms for the devolution
of power reached by consensus between the PA and the UNP, the
local Island newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted TULF Vice President V. Anandasangaree as
saying that the reforms are no substitute for the federal
structure it had proposed.
</P>
<P>
He said his party will decide whether to accept President
Kumaratunga's invitation for talks Monday after their General
Secretary Sambandan returns from the United Kingdom Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Anandasangaree accused the government of wasting time by
talking to the UNP without going directly to the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE have rejected the constitutional proposals,
saying the separatist war will continue as the reforms fail to
address the issue of Tamil self-determination.

"During the last three months, we collected data on the number
of destroyed houses in 14 provinces, and were surprised that it
was such a high figure, up to half-a-million," Witoelar was quoted
by the Indonesian Observer Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the number of damaged houses will likely increase as
communal conflicts that have engulfed Ambon, capital of Maluku
province, since more than one and a half years showed no sign of
abatement.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of houses have been destroyed in Maluku
and North Maluku provinces, where religious riots have been taking
place since January 1999, claiming about 3,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government's commitment to help the
people in violence-torn areas repair their house will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
She said her office is making efforts to help the people whose
houses were destroyed during the riots or natural disasters get
access to banking credits.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government recently donated 3.5 million U.S. dollars
to help rebuild houses in riot-torn areas and in Bengkulu province,
which was hit by a devastating earthquake on June 4.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from donations, I have also received soft-loans from the
World Bank," she added.

the laid-off workers and helping them find new jobs.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Expected To Tour South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK) has
been receiving an increasing number of Chinese tourists since
China loosened its restrictions on its citizens visiting the
neighboring country two years ago, according to a senior official
of the ROK.
</P>
<P>
China and ROK signed an agreement in 1998 in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lee Sang-Joo, chairman of the Organizing Committee for the
Visit Korea Year 2001, made this remark here during the weekend at
a fair for promoting ROK tourism in China, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
The number of people from the Chinese mainland who toured the
ROK in 1999 reached 320,000, an increase of 50 percent on the 1998
figure.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese visitors to the ROK is bound to rise, as
all Chinese citizens are now allowed to travel to that country,
according to a new agreement signed by the two countries in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ROK dispatched its largest tourism representative
delegation, totaling 60 teams, to attend the fair. More than 160
people involved in tourism in China's Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu
provinces made wide-ranging contacts with their counterparts from
the ROK at the fair.
</P>
<P>
For its Visit Korea Year, the ROK intends to promote the
development of its tourism sector by holding more than 70
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China has released 1.1 million
fry of large yellow croakers into the East China Sea this year to
help increase their numbers.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are six-seven cm and 3,000 of them are as long as
15 cm.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 fry have been sent to the Zhoushan sea area,
China's largest fishing ground, off Zhejiang Province. The rest
went to nearby Xiangshan Bay.
</P>
<P>
The large yellow croaker was abundant in the 1970s, but
excessive fishing in the '80s and marine pollution in the '90s
sharply reduced their numbers and nearly left them extinct.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998 a total of 450,000 artificially-bred croakers have
been let go into the East China Sea.

BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's entry and exit inspection
and quarantine authorities are strongly promoting a multi-million-
U.S. dollar computerization program to improve efficiency and
facilitate an on-going reform.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine (CIQ) has passed a 250-million-yuan (30 million U.S.
dollars) investment plan to computerize the country's border
inspection and quarantine systems as well as to link local
branches, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
"As the internal reforms deepen, computer-related technologies
are playing an increasingly important role in entry-exit
inspection and quarantine administration," said Lin Dekang,
director of the CIQ's Information Center in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The massive investment plan, preliminarily scheduled to be
completed by the end of September, would finance a CIQ2000
informatization project, which includes a wide area network, an
information system, an administration system and a management
system, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also be a foundation for the connection of
inspection and quarantine administration networks at different

<HEADLINE> Sampras Wins in Wimbledon and Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LNDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A tearful Pete Sampras became the
most successful player in men's tennis by claiming the Wimbledon
singles crown for a seventh time on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The all-conquering American also set a record by winning his
13th Grand Slam title, eclipsing Australian Roy Emerson's record
of 12 Grand Slams after a 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 and 6-2 victory over 12th
seed Patrick Rafter of Australia.
</P>
<P>
There to see Sampras' triumph on Center Court were his ecstatic
parents, who were quick to embrace their son minutes after he had
clinched victory.
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional moment - and one which lit up the All
England Club in the gathering gloom.
</P>
<P>
Sampras certainly found it hard to stop the tears from rolling
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
"It means so much to me," he said as he pondered his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
Until Sampras took control of the match midway through the
fourth set, it was by no means certain just who would prevail.
</P>
<P>
Both players were in top form, Sampras showing no signs of the
tendinitis injury which had dogged him for most of the
championships.
</P>
<P>
But it was Rafter who started slightly the better.
</P>
<P>
The Australian won the first set after a lengthy tie-break -
but needed to dig deep into his reserves to do so.
</P>
<P>
Resuming at 4-4 and deuce after a two-and-a-half hour break, he
was in danger of handing Sampras a crucial break when he served a
double fault.
</P>
<P>
But, with the atmosphere beginning to build, the 12th seed held
his nerve as the set went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' serve, normally so reliable, let him down in a big way
in the tie-break.
</P>
<P>
Both players had chances but the American cracked first, his
fifth double fault giving Rafter the opening set.
</P>
<P>
It was a totally different story in the second set.
</P>
<P>
That also went to a tie-break - but this time it was Rafter who
blew a gasket when seemingly in control.
</P>
<P>
At 4-1 up, he was on course to increase his lead as Sampras
threw in another double fault and then over-hit a regulation
forehand.
</P>
<P>
But the defending champion hit back in stunning fashion,
celebrating his fifth straight point with a rare show of emotion.
</P>
<P>
That gave him a firm grip of the tie-break - and he did not let
go as he squared the match up a one set apiece.
</P>
<P>
Sampras seemed to step up a gear as a result, putting Rafter's
serve under even more pressure with a string of fiercely-hit
returns.
</P>
<P>
They eventually took their toll in the fifth game of the third
set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had failed to convert any of the nine break points
which had previously come his way.
</P>
<P>
But he made the 10th count as he went 3-2 in front.
</P>
<P>
That breakthrough proved vital, Rafter battling hard to level
but failing to stop Sampras from claiming the set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The fifth game was also the important one in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras broke for only the second time in the match to take
another giant step towards victory.
</P>
<P>
With the light fading, there were concerns that the match would
have to be suspended until Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Sampras ensured there was no need to make a special trip
back to Center Court by breaking again in the seventh game.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The 2004 World Cup soccer qualifier
between Zimbabwe and South Africa was abandoned with South Africa
leading 2-0 when Zimbabwean fans went on the rampage, throwing
bottles and stones onto the field with eight minutes left on
normal time in the National Sports Stadium here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Violent fans began throwing bottles onto to the pitch when
Delron Buckley scored his second goal for South Africa and the
police reacted by throwing teargas in all directions to chase the
fans from the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Players were left huddled at the center circle of the pitch, but
were later evacuated by armed police into their changing rooms.
</P>
<P>
Match Commissioner Hisham Azmy told reporters that the results
of the match would stand until they send their report to the
world football governing boy FIFA for recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"The match is officially over," said Azmy,
</P>
<P>
"We have already informed FIFA over the phone. We cannot
continue play under these conditions." he added
</P>
<P>
Though Azmy could not disclose the likely punishment for
Zimbabwe, it is believed that the country might be booted out of
the qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The match started on a balanced note with both teams showing
determination to attack with Buckley opening the score sheet for
South Africa in the sixth minute.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe struggled towards the end of the first half, but
virtually collapsed in the second half with South Africa pinning
them in their area for most of the half.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe coach Misheck Marimo, who replaced Dutch coach Clemens
Westerhof who was sacked last week for poor results, made three
substitutions in the second half, but it appeared the substitutes
actually worsened play.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup group qualifier is composed of Zimbabwe, South
Africa, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Malawi.

<P>
XI'AN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains that drummed northwest
China's Shaanxi Province in recent days greatly eased the months-
long drought, but at the same time caused hundreds of millions of
yuan in economic disaster, affecting a dozen counties.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain and hail storms which hit Ankang Prefecture in
southern Shaanxi in late June killed 35 people and damaged 70,000
hectares of crops, 10,000 hectares of which were ruined.
</P>
<P>
The rainstorms also destroyed many rural residential houses
and a large area of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has experienced serious drought for five consecutive
months this year, with one million hectares of farmland choked dry
by the drought and some 10,000 hectares of summer crops dried out
and produced nothing.
</P>
<P>
Rain has fallen steadily on this northwest China province since
the beginning of June. But heavy rain and hails in some areas have
brought about even greater disaster than the drought.

DAMASCUS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The day-long Voting on Monday in a
nationwide referendum to elect Bashar al-Assad president of Syria
ended at 10:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) with a massive turnout.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting started immediately after the closing of the total
11,185 polling stations which opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was to endorse Bashar, 34, to succeed his late
father, Hafez al-Assad, as the country's new president.
</P>
<P>
So far, there were no official figures for the turnout, but
observers and officials said the participation by Syria's 9.4

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Explore Ways to Revitalize Least Developed Continent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- More than thirty African heads of
state and government attended the opening session of the 36th
summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) here on Monday,
discussing ways to revitalize the least developed continent in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim
said the integration and unity of the African states is the only
way for the continent to make great progress in the new century.
</P>
<P>
He told participants in the Togolese Palace of Parliament that
as the forerunners of Africa founded the OAU more than thirty
years ago to get the continent liberated from colonial rule, the
present leaders should explore ways to make it prosperous.
</P>
<P>
"There must be new politics and unconstitutionally changed
governments are no longer accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Malawi President Bakili Muluzi said the time
has come for Africa to meet the challenges on the basis of the
progress it has made over the past years.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the general elections recently held in Zimbabwe as
democratic and successful, setting an example for other countries
in the continent to follow.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President and 35th OAU chairman Abdelaziz Bouteflika
said that while African states are cooperating in cooling old
hotspots, new conflicts are still coming into being.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea shows a harsh
reality in Africa, not to say those in Angola, Somalia, Sierra
Leone and others," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the OAU Declaration in Sirte, Libya last
year gave new momentum to African integration which has been
stepped up since the Abuja Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika called on the developed world, especially the
European countries, to write off the heavy debt burden on African
states in a cooperative way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anna appealed the rest
of the world to help Africa revitalize its least developed economy.
</P>
<P>
Africa, hit heavily by conflicts and diseases especially HIV/
AIDS, should take measures to develop its economy by investing in
transport, communication and information technology to meet the
challenges put forward by globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As the wind of changes were blowing in Africa in the 1980s,
the wind of democracy and rule by law is blowing in Africa now,"
Anna said, commending highly the elections held in several African
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts by African states to establish a union is
positive, hoping it will play an important role in cooperation in
economic and peacekeeping sectors.
</P>
<P>
As a long-term observer of OAU summit, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat also made a speech at the session, expressing
appreciation for the contribution made by African states in
Palestine's justified struggle for an independent state over the
past years.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reconfirmed that a Palestinian state will be established
on September 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who was elected new
chairman of OAU, stressed that there should be a new change for
African development in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The time has come for Africa to set up an African Union similar
to the European Union which will speed up the integration of
economies in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Following America and Europe but before Asia, Africa will have
its union to boost the establishment of an economic community and
a common market," he said. "A new united and prosperous Africa
will also strengthen the establishment of democracy and human
rights."
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit meeting will mainly focus on three themes:
regional cooperation and integration, security and stability, and
the challenges of widespread AIDS and poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the draft treaty on the establishment of
the African Union initiated during an extraordinary summit on
September 9, 1999 in Sirte, Libya as well as the treaty on the
African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Ways to end various conflicts on the continent, particularly in
Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra
Leone, and the related situation of refugees will also be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, OAU is designated to promote the unity
and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of members, coordinate and
intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for
the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism, the
organization has been focused on peace and development of the
African continent.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Plaintiffs Monday
requested 196 billion dollars in punitive damages from the tobacco
industry for smoking-related illness and death.
</P>
<P>
"This industry has left a half-century trail of deceit which
has decimated millions of Americans," said Stanley Rosenblatt, a
lawyer for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
"Never have so few caused so much harm to so many for so long,
and the day of reckoning has arrived," he told the jury as closing
arguments for the two-year trial began in Miami, Florida.

Each side has two days to summarize the class-action case on
behalf of 300,000 to 700,000 sick Florida smokers against the
nation's five biggest cigarette makers,including Philip Morris Inc.
and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Visits Russia to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Alexander
Kwasniewski paid a one-day working visit to Russia Monday for
improving bilateral relations, which have worsened to an ice point
since the two countries' exchange of expulsions of diplomats and a
hooligan attack against the Russian diplomatic building in Warsaw
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski's visit to Russia is "more than timely," Russian
President Vladimir Putin told the press after his meeting with
Kwasniewski in the Kremlin, highly appraising the Polish president
's trip to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The two sides mainly discussed the aspects of Russian-Polish
relations, bilateral economic issues, ways of coordinating their
actions in the international arena and broadening cultural and
humanitarian contacts, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Kwasniewski "for a constructive approach to the issues
discussed," Putin said Russia is interested in developing long-
term healthy relations and fruitful cooperation with Poland and
the meeting will do away with the obstacles in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced," he said, "that relations between Russia and
Poland will be raised to a qualitatively new level."
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, for his part, said Warsaw hopes for new political
dialogue with Moscow, describing his current visit to Russia as "a
chance to open a new chapter in Russian-Polish relations."
</P>
<P>
The talks with the Russian president and other officials were "
constructive and well-meaning, and were filled with confidence
that we must lay a new and solid foundation for cooperation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The ice in our relations is breaking up," hailed Kwasniewski.
"We must avoid things that are damaging our relations and move
ahead."
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to develop Polish-Russian relations in
the spirit of neighborliness, wishing difficulties in bilateral
relations brought about by recent history will be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for the development of neighborly Polish-Russian
relations must be shown to the people of the two countries, he
said, noting that it is also necessary to re-establish solid
knowledge of each other's culture.
</P>
<P>
Conferring the Polish awards to a group of Russian Interior
Ministry staffers who set free two Polish women from Chechen
rebels' captivity in Dagestan days ago, Kwasniewski noted the
significance of the humanitarian factor in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of a boost in Polish-Russian
economic relations, expressing confidence in raising annual
bilateral trade to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars "in the light of signs
of improvement in the trade shown in the past few months."
</P>
<P>
He announced that Putin and he mulled the possibility of laying
a gas pipeline from Russia to Europe through Poland and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Russian foreign minister called for an end
to the chill in relations with Poland, hoping the relations
between the two nations will be able "to move from cool to warm."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, also his first trip to Russia as the head of
state, Kwasniewski also addressed a Russian-Polish business forum.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Exchanges 60 Pct of Currency in Dollar </HEADLINE>

<P>
QUITO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Ecuador said
Monday that 60 percent of the country's currency has exchanged
into U.S. dollars after adopting America's currency for
circulation in the Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
An exchange rate of 155 million dollars still stands ground, of
which 140 million correspond to bills in sucres and seven million
in coins, said sources in a declaration made known Monday by daily

Fundamental Law for economic transformation anticipates the
dollar adoption as the exchange model and pushes back the sucre to
fractionary operations, whereby coins with a denomination equal to
dollar fractions.

<P>
In big stores, payment is made in dollars, be they coins or
bills, while in small operations it's kept in sucres and dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Credit Rises in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers borrowed money
freely in May, ringing up the biggest rise in consumer credit
since the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve said Monday.
</P>
<P>
After seasonally adjusted, total consumer credit increased by
11.8 billion U.S. dollars in May for an annual growth rate of 9.8
percent. That was the largest gain since January, when Americans
increased their borrowing by 15.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit in April grew by 8.8 billion dollars, less than
the Fed estimated one month ago. That translates into an annual
growth rate of 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May, the total amount of nonrevolving credit, such as loans
for new cars, vacations and other big-ticket items, rose 7.1
billion dollars at an annual rate of 10.5 percent, also the
biggest increase since January. That was up from 2.3 billion
dollars and a 3.4 percent rate in April.
</P>
<P>
Demand for revolving credit, such as that used for credit cards,
rose 4.6 billion dollars or at an 8.9 percent annual rate in May.
That was down from 6.5 billion dollars and a 12.7 percent rate in
April.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates six times over the last year
to slow the economy and keep inflation from escalating. The Fed's
rate increases are designed to raise borrowing costs and thus cool
demand for such big purchases as cars and homes.
</P>
<P>
Recent economic reports, however, indicate the U.S. economy is
slowing. Retail sales in May were sluggish, and the employment
report for June showed that businesses added fewer jobs during the
month than expected.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said such data could persuade the central bank
to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on August 22,
just as it did at the June meeting.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Macedonia Sign Military Cooperation Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Macedonia signed here
Monday a military cooperation agreement as part of efforts to
improve the relations between the two Balkan neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos and his visiting Macedonian counterpart, Nikola
Klusev, with the aim of developing border forces, mainly on the
Albanian borders as well as cooperation between Greece and
Macedonia within the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, both ministers agreed to increase the
effectiveness of their forces on the two countries' borders with
Albania to avoid new dangers posed for them by illegal immigration,
drug trafficking and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed opposition to any irredentist intervention
aimed at changing the existing borders of Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos reiterated Greece's supports for Macedonia's
efforts to join the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
On his part, Klusev expressed his wish to resolve the question
of Macedonia's name within this year, which has been the main
obstacle for the improvement of relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Macedonia have been at odds since
1991 when the latter gained independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece has opposed the use by Skopje of the
name "Macedonia," which Athens said implies the neighboring
country's territorial claim to one of its northern province with
the same name as Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the two countries have taken some steps to
better their strained relations by expanding trade ties and the
strengthening of cooperation in combating drug and immigrant
trafficking as well.

<HEADLINE> Russia Slams Latvian Court's Ruling on Soviet Veteran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Monday denounced a Latvian court's ruling to sentence Yevgeny
Savenko, an old former Soviet veteran, to two years in jail, as "
flagrantly inhumane."
</P>
<P>
Savenko, an 87-year-old ethnic Russian and a disabled veteran
of the World War-II, was sentenced to two years in prison Last
Friday by the Liepaja city court on charge of involving in a "
genocide of the Latvian people" in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian court ruling on the Savenko case is equivalent to a
death penalty, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement,
calling the sentence "a big inhumanity."
</P>
<P>
"In civilized countries, judges take into account the age and
health of defendants," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Latvian authorities, "despite all declarations
about the independence of their judicial system, have yet again
demonstrated partiality in administering justice."
</P>
<P>
Savenko's trial clearly demonstrates "a political order by
circles which would like to take revenge for the past by engaging
in the moral persecution of veterans of the anti-Hitler resistance,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude assumed by top Latvian officials, who contributed
to creating an atmosphere of intolerance towards the veterans of
the Great Patriotic War, has played a significant role in giving
an accusative bias to the Savenko trial," the Foreign Ministry
said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Exports Grow 23.3 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's exports in the first
five months of this year reached 5.151 billion U.S. dollars, 23.3
percent over 1999's same period of 4.176 billion dollars, the
National Administrative Department of Statistics reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that traditional exports (petroleum, coffee,
coal and ferro-nickel) meant 53.4 percent of the total of sales
abroad, that is, 2.752 billion dollars, with a growth of 34.1
percent in value and of 5.4 percent in volume in the period
January-May 2000 over the similar lapse in 1999.
</P>
<P>
These exports' increase is mainly attributed to the rise of
international prices of petroleum and nickel and the growth of
coal sales' volume.
</P>
<P>
Hydrocarburate exports in the period mentioned went up by 63.9
percent from 1.151 billion to 1.903 billion dollars, although in
volume they went down by 20.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, coffee sales abroad fell 30.02 percent in value
and 32.51 percent in volume. This means a fall of five percentage
points when going from 13.63 percent of the total of exports in
the period January to May 1999 to 7.73 percent in year 2000's
similar lapse.

MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
signed a decree Monday to raise the average monthly pension of all

After the decree comes into effect, the monthly income of the
retirees will surpass the law-set minimum living standard -- 851

</P>
<P>
Putin has tasked the cabinet with the fulfillment of the decree.
</P>
<P>
The goal is "to make the lives of ordinary Russian citizens
better and safer, and improve their quality," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Barak Can Make Peace Despite Problems at Home, Clinton Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak can make peace
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat despite Barak's political
problems at home.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to note that, ... a solid majority of
the people want him to come and want him to pursue peace," Clinton
said to reporters before flying to Pennsylvania for a governors'
conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is difficult. It is perhaps the most difficult of all the
peace problems in the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that "both Prime Minister Barak and Chairman
Arafat have the vision, the knowledge, the experience and the
ability and the sheer guts to do what it takes, ..., to reach an
agreement and then take it back to their people and see if they
can sell it."
</P>
<P>
Barak barely survived a no-confidence motion in the 120-member
Knesset (Israeli parliament) Monday. The opposition Likud party,
anxious about Barak's possible concessions to the Palestinians at
the upcoming summit at Camp David, failed to muster sufficient
votes to oust him.

<HEADLINE> EU Unblocks 55m Dollars in Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Monday
unblocked 55 million U.S. dollars in economic aid to Russia that
had been held up since last December due to concerns over the
situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The unblocking was agreed upon by EU foreign ministers who met
for their two-day general affairs council at which several EU
member states urged the freeing up of the economic aid to
demonstrate the union's willingness to build ties with Russia's
newly-elected President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued after Monday's council meeting,
the EU foreign ministers called on the Russian president to make
good on his government's commitment to economic and political
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that a priority of EU-Russia cooperation
would be to support "a modern economy that benefits the whole of
the Russian society."
</P>
<P>
The unblocked aid is part of the EU's special aid program for
Russia and the program is known as the TACIS. The 15-nation bloc
has funneled around 4 billion dollars to Russia since the program
went underway in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hubert Vedrine, French foreign minister whose country has just
taken over the six-month rotating EU presidency, said that the
council would ask the European Commission and the council of EU
economy ministers to pinpoint areas for continued EU-Russian
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said that the council had recognized
with interest the programs of political and economic reforms
launched by Russian President Putin.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation should be organized for the benefit of the
rule of law and democratization for the sake of the entire society
of the country," said the written statement issued after the
council meeting, the first chaired by France that took over from
Portugal the EU presidency on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers agreed that the next scheduled EU-
Russia summit would be of special importance in that it would be
focused on a long-term, effective cooperation program between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc is meeting Russia on October 30 in Paris for
the planned summit.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also instructed the European
Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to re-launch
the preparation of the TACIS aid program for Russia for the period
between now and 2003, especially a proposition for an action
program for the year 2000 with the aim of supporting the ongoing
political and economic reforms in the country.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Asks for IMF Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Former International Monetary
Fund (IMF) director Michel Camdessus requested here Monday further
reforms in the organism in order to face in better conditions
challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has upheld all sorts of reforms in the world without
applying modification of itself, Camdessus said at a press
conference in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
This organism has acted frequently as "fireman" of national
crises and left aside its role as the world financial architect,
said the director of the Center for Prospective Studies and
International Information (CEPI) from France.
</P>
<P>
"During my stay (of 13 years) at the foundation I pressed for
changes that have given their first results. Nevertheless, they've
been insufficient," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
"The task has not been finished, but it's progressing. The IMF
is at the center of these changes, wherefore it's necessary to go
quicker," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we cannot let ourselves be taken over by present
world euphoria. It's time to start changes within the IMF and not
await the next world economic crisis to present itself."
</P>
<P>
According to Camdessus, the IMF requires new agile credit
mechanisms for nations affected by external instability and
liberalizing of capital accounts in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus who on February 14 left the IMF post, proposed that
the Group of Seven industrialized countries listen to the rest of
other nations searching for joint solutions to global problems,
such as poverty.

Under the proposed pact, Vietnam would lower its tariffs and
undertake a broad range of measures to open its markets to U.S.
goods, services and investment.
</P>
