<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Bring Record High Water Levels On Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Water levels on the middle and
lower reaches of China's Yangtze River have been above the warning
line, and at record highs in some places, according to the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The river began to rise in June at the beginning of the flood
season, and frequent torrential rains in southern China recently
have brought the water level on the middle and lower reaches of
the river up. In some places, the amount of precipitation has been
more than 1 meter.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have caused flooding on the Xinjiang, Fujiang and
Changjiang rivers in central China in Hubei Province, and around
Dongting Lake in nearby Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on the Yangtze's main stream, which has taken
water from its branches, is also rising dramatically, with areas
from Yichang in Hubei to Nanjing in Jiangsu reporting water above
the danger line by July 2.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on the middle and lower reaches of the river where
flooding is at its worst are at record highs for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
Almost 2 million local people and soldiers in Hubei, Hunan,
Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have been working on dams and
dikes in flood areas and have reinforced more than 240 places
where dikes and dams have been breached.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's New Airport Runs Smoothly on 1st Day (2) (By Wang Qun and Chang Kefei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new airport was scheduled to handle about 450 flights, and
70,000 to 80,000 passengers on the first day.
</P>
<P>
But during the first few hours of operation, there were
problems with the baggage handling system, the flight information
display system, and even the escalators. The airport authorities
has already tackled some of the issues, and is dealing with the
rest.
</P>
<P>
Leeks said: "It's a good, positive sign that we're identifying
problems. That's all part of the challenge of running one of the
world's great modern international airports."
</P>
<P>
Gong Wang Yang, a young Philippine man flying in with his
family from Manila before noon, was satisfied with the speed of
baggage reclaiming.
</P>
<P>
"As we arrived at the baggage reclaiming area, our pieces of
baggage were already on the carousel," he said. Packing a dozen
pieces of luggage on two handcarts, Gong said the handcart was
easy to use.
</P>
<P>
At the departures hall, "Ask Me" ambassadors, all played by
college students, were helping passengers in need, replying to
their inquires, guiding them to check-in counters and the post
office where they could buy commemorative stamps.
</P>
<P>
Their work complemented information desks, sign-posting and
information kiosks that display information at one's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 retail outlets in the terminal building opened
for business Monday, selling fast-food, books and magazines, and
souvenirs to passengers and sightseers, who queued up to grab up
some commemorative items.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds and thousands of Hong Kong people flooded to one of
the world's most spacious buildings to catch a first glimpse of
the brand new airport on its opening day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had gotten a fully operational airport at Chek Lap
Kok by 6:30 a.m. Monday, about six hours after all lights along
the 3,390-meter-long runway at the old Kai Tak airport were
switched off to end its 73-year-old services.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new airport was backed by a successful
overnight relocation of the most critical airport equipment and
facilities from the old Kai Tak Airport. Over the 13 hours of work
up to 6:30 a.m. Monday, there were more than 1,100 vehicle
movements by land, sea and air, including 14 barge and 31 aircraft
movements.
</P>
<P>
"The overnight relocation went superbly," Leeks told reporters,
adding "many of the movements were ahead of schedule."
</P>
<P>
An integrated public transport network set forth for new Hong
Kong International Airport went into full operation Monday,
including railway, bus, taxi and ferry services.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Express, a railway built specially to carry
passengers between the central business district on Hong Kong
Island and the new airport in 23 minutes, commenced operation at
5:00 a.m., one hour earlier than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Built on a 1,248-hectare reclaimed island, the new airport is
part of the Airport Core Program, a series of 10 projects that
cost a total of 20 billion U.S. dollars. The airport took eight
years to finish and will cater for the aviation needs into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
At its opening, the new airport is able to handle 35 million
passengers and 3 million tons of cargo annually; ultimately, it is
capable of handling 87 million passengers and 9 million tons of
cargo. A second runway will be completed by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad will
pay a state visit to France from July 16 to 17, said French
officials on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This visit is in response to an official invitation offered by
President Jacques Chirac on May 24, and will be the first visit to
France by Assad since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The visit also comes at a time when the Middle East peace
process remains deadlocked while Syrian-Israeli peace talks have
been suspended since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Assad is expected to discuss with President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on ways to re-open the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Syria regard the situation in the Middle East
as dangerous, and have been maintaining permanent contacts and
consultation over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have improved their relations since President
Chirac took office in 1995 after a difficult time in the 1980s
because of Syria's intervention in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said recently that they were enjoying a "most positive
period" and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine described
bilateral relations as a "strategic partnership".

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Defense Minister to Visit Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis
Omirou will start a four-day visit to Russia on Tuesday for talks
with his counterpart Igor Sergeyev on military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Monday, Omirou said he
will discuss in Moscow issues of mutual interest in the light of
an existing agreement for military and technical cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will
also pay a four-day visit to Moscow from July 11 at the invitation
of Moscow Mayor Yuri Ruskov as a guest of honor at the World
Youth Games, to be held in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Clerides is expected to meet Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the two Cypriot leaders' visits to Russia were related
to Cyprus' purchase of Russian missiles which has led to tension
on the divided island, Cypriot government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said at his press briefing here that it was clear that
the Cypriot government did not intend to create tension itself.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missile system in 1997 in a bid to boost its air
defense. The missiles were scheduled for delivery in
mid-August. This controversial deal has triggered warnings from
rival Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which threatened to take "all
necessary measures" to prevent the deployment of the system.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides pointed out that Clerides would visit Moscow at the
invitation of the city mayor, while Omirou's visit is related to a
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouradov was
quoted as saying Monday that the Russian missile system was only a
defensive weapon that would have no harm to the Turkish Cypriots
or Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He told the Turkish Cypriot newspaper "Kibris" that the S-300
missiles would only be used in case of an air raid.
</P>
<P>
Asked what stance Russia would take in case of a war in Cyprus
over the missile dispute, Mouradov ruled out such possibility,
saying neither the Cypriots, nor Greece or Turkey wanted a war.
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not believe Turkey would launch strike
against the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, which was
declared unilaterally in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" that has been only
recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> UK on Course for Mini-Recession: Surveys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Three surveys have revealed a slump
in economic confidence among Britain's businessmen, fueling fears
that Britain is now on course for a "mini-recession."
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Directors (IOD), the Center for Economic and
Business Research (CEBR) and the London Chamber of Commerce have
all found evidence of a growing pessimism.
</P>
<P>
The CEBR's report warned that the UK economy is "uncomfortably
close to stagnation. In its latest quarterly economic forecasts,
the research institute said, "Rising wage pressure, combined with
an excessively strong exchange rate and wilting manufacturing
output, has heightened the risk of a mini-recession in 1999."
</P>
<P>
The CEBR's central forecast was that economic growth will slow
from 3.1 percent last year to 1.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in 1999 will average 1.8 percent, it said, while
unemployment will rise from 1.36 million this year to more than
1.5 million in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The institute also predicted the underlying inflation rate will
stay above 3 percent for the rest of the year, and that interest
rates will be above 8 percent by the year end.
</P>
<P>
Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the IOD, said at the
weekend that businessmen are becoming increasingly depressed by
the impact of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and
successive rises in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He told GMTV's program, "The degree of the fall in optimism
about the state of the economy generally is quite marked." He said
that a further interest rate rise by the Bank of England's
monetary Policy Committee (MPC) later this week will be "perverse
in the extreme" as the rates are already too high.
</P>
<P>
The London Chamber of Commerce's quarterly survey revealed that
service sector exports have fallen to the lowest level since 1991,
and 81 percent of businessmen want a weaker pound to revive
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, although there is growing evidence of a slowdown in
economic activity in Britain, wages and prices are still rising.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, many observers in the City fear that the MPC,
in its attempt to bring the underlying rate of UK inflation back
to the 2.5 percent target, will raise rates again, despite the
damage this will do to economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the UK economy is on the brink of a
painful period of `stagflation' -- a combination of weak economic
growth with rising inflation.

<HEADLINE> World's Chip Sales Slump Despite of Price Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Semiconductor sales worldwide in
May fell by nearly 13 percent from the year-earlier period to 9.99
billion U.S. dollars, the lowest monthly sales level since
February 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the downturn,
which has spread to nearly every category of chip maker and their
equipment suppliers, was brought by problems in Asia and pricing
pressures caused by low-cost personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Semiconductor Industry Association and market researchers
Pathfinder Research Inc. and VLSI Research Inc. predict decreases
in different levels. Some analysts don't foresee much growth until
2000.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley companies have either laid off workers or issued
warnings about second-quarter results, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Even mighty Intel Corp., despite its near monopoly on the
computing engines for PCs, has projected a flat second quarter and
lower profit margins. The company, hurt by falling prices on its
microprocessor chips, said last week that it would shut two
manufacturing plants in Oregon for eight days to help reduce
inventory of older chips and temporarily idle 1,700 workers.
</P>
<P>
The DRAM market, which deals with the memory chips of PCs, is
also being squeezed fast. Manufacturers in Taiwan pushed prices
down even faster, the paper said. Chips that cost three U.S.
dollars at the beginning of the year now sell for less than two
U.S. dollars. More factories are losing money while the market
prices are bellow their production costs.

<HEADLINE> Western French City of Nante Develops Tramway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The western French city of Nante will
expand its tramway network to promote public transport and reduce
pollution from waste of private cars, said city officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
The city, which is called "Venise of the West" because of its
numerous canals, launched its first tramway line in 1985 and now
has two lines covering 27 kilometers and serving 160,000
commuters.
</P>
<P>
Once a new line is staged from 2002 to 2005, Nante will have 46
kilometers of tramways.
</P>
<P>
The city's Socialist mayor and National Assembly deputy
Jean-Marc Ayrault said that the construction of the new tramway
line is not only for transport, but also for giving "a new breath"
to the city and attracting tourists.
</P>
<P>
An investigation shows that 92 percent of the city's
inhabitants are happy with tramway as their means for moving
around.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars in the city has dropped by nearly 60 percent
since 1994 because of the tramways.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is also considering renovating the
city's old train railways to link them with the tramways.
</P>
<P>
Once these old trains are again put into use, Nante will have a
85 kilometer public transport network, said officials.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Action After "Kosovo Liberation Army" Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- France on Monday called for
international action to prevent the Kosovo conflict spreading
after the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) took control of over 40
percent of the territory of the Serbian southern province.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has changed nature with the taking by the Kosovo
Liberation Army of 40 percent of the territory," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Secret-Gazeau.
</P>
<P>
Paris expected "energetic and immediate action" by the
international community, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people, including many women, children and the
elderly, have died in clashes raging since February between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanians majority seeking independence from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating warnings of possible western military
intervention in Kosovo, the spokeswoman stopped short of backing
independence.
</P>
<P>
France supported autonomy for the Serb province where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military committee was meeting in Brussels on Monday,
and the Contact Group of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia
and the United States will gather in Bonn to discuss latest
developments in the Kosovo situation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
France also regards Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova as the "central negotiator" representing Albanians in talks
with the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said contacts with the UCK were not ruled out
if they could help stop violence.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Germany have called for participation of
the UCK in Kosovo talks, but Belgrade has refused as it regards
the UCK as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian authorities have strongly opposed any external
interference in Kosovo, which it views as a domestic issue, and
also rejected the idea of independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Central Board of
Revenue (CBR) of Pakistan Moeen Uddin Khan said Monday that total
revenues collected during 1997-98 (July 1-June 30) amounted to
293.058 billion rupees (about 6.37 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here at CBR, he said that
revenues collection during 1997-98 reflected an increase of 16.1
percent over the collection in the same period of the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said that an incentives-oriented policy was being pursued to
encourage the tax collecting officers for the realization of the
revenue targets.
</P>
<P>
However, the achieved revenue collection is still short of the
revised budget target of 298 billion rupees (about 6.47 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The original revenue target set in the 1997-98 fiscal budget
stood at 324 billion rupees (about 7 billion dollars) which was
scaled down to 305 billion rupees (about 6.63 billion dollars) in
January, to 297.89 billion rupees (about 6.47 billion dollars) on
June 15.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Upbeat About Re-Election Despite Unfavorable Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- With an eye on the improving economy,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday expressed confidence about
winning re-election in the September elections despite the poor
showings of his ruling party in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before travelling to an Austrian spa for his
traditional summer vacation, Kohl repeated government projections
that the economy would grow at a rate of close to three percent
this year while unemployment would fall below four million this
autumn.
</P>
<P>
The structural reforms introduced by the government had
contributed to the economic upswing, Kohl stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, whose Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party is trailing
almost ten percentage points behind the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) in the polls, admitted that the SPD had
done more to mobilize voters than his CDU party.
</P>
<P>
But he said that with less than three months left before the
September elections, about three quarters of German voters had not
yet made up their minds and still open to supporting the CDU.
</P>
<P>
"We have not actually started our election campaign," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The September 27 general elections put Kohl against his much
younger SPD challenger Gerhard Schroeder, who is the premier of
the western Lower Saxony state.
</P>
<P>
Kohl stressed that the upcoming election campaign would see a
serious comparison of the actual policies pursued by the CDU and
the SPD, not rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"We can seize our chances, and we will win the election," Kohl
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Status of African Franc in Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Monday
approved the status of the African franc within the zone of the
future European single currency, announced French Minister of
Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries reached a political agreement in Brussels
on the status of the African franc, also called CFA franc, which
is used in a dozen French-speaking African countries whose
currency is pegged to the French franc on a 1-100 exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is based on a report by the European Commission
presented in July and will be subjected to approval by the
Frankfurt-based European Central Bank, said Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
Only a change of the nature of financial agreement between
France and the CFA franc countries or an enlargement of the CFA
franc zone to other countries needs the approval of the other 14
EU members, said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn estimated that the CFA franc countries would be
guaranteed of their financial status by the EU agreement.

Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu delivered a key speech at

Such behavior not only hinders the nation's socio-economic

<HEADLINE> Museveni Off to Eritrea on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
left for Eritrea Monday to hold talks with his Eritrean
counterpart Issaias Afeworki on the country's border dispute with
Ethiopia, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, accompanied by Eriya Kategaya, First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, was greeted at the
Asmara International Airport by the president himself and senior
Eritrean officials.
</P>
<P>
Their talks scheduled for Monday afternoon are expected to
center on regional issues and the strained relations between
Eritrea and Ethiopia in particular.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute on a strip of land in Zalambessa recently
resulted in a shoot-out skirmish between the armies of the two
neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is a small country with a population of 3.5 million.
Its independence in 1993 has made Ethiopia become a land-locked
country.
</P>
<P>
Before the border dispute erupted and worsened into a border
war, the two countries were very friendly to each other not only
because of the political and religious links between them, but
because of the intimate relations between their leaders.

JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Eleven workers were killed
and 14 others were injured Monday when a bridge under
construction collapsed at Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga Province,
northeast of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers feared the number of people killed in the accident
could rise as the search for survivors and bodies continued on
Monday evening, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Jan de Beer, coordinator at the Life Crisis Control Center in
Nelspruit, about 300 km northeast of Johannesburg, was quoted as
saying that five of the 14 injured were in a serious condition.
They would be airlifted to a private hospital in Nelspruit.
</P>
<P>
De Beer said the bridge, which was being built across a river,
apparently collapsed when one of the pillars gave way.
</P>
<P>
Peter Price, spokesman for Concorde Construction, the company
responsible for the construction of the bridge, said it was not
immediately clear what caused the pillar to collapse.
</P>
<P>
"We are not sure what happened. We were still constructing
the bridge when it collapsed," Price said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Accuses Netanyahu of Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition leader Ehud
Barak launched an attack Monday against Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, accusing him of losing credibility both at home and
abroad due to his damage to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The war of words was fought in a heated debate between the two
political rivals in a special session of the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Barak, head of the Labor Party, slammed Netanyahu for leading
Israel to "an all-out confrontation." He warned that the total
impasse in the peace process would cause a "certain explosion" in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Reciting a list of foreign leaders that had been fed up with
Netanyahu's policies, Barak said Netanyahu was totally isolated in
the international arena and had destroyed the prestige that Israel
once enjoyed during the rule of the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The list included such big names as Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian
King Hussein. The leaders had all refused to talk to Netanyahu,
Barak notedd.
</P>
<P>
Barak went further to point out that Netanyahu had even lost
credibility among his coalition. He cited the division between
Netanyahu and some Cabinet ministers over his handling of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
For example, Barak said, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon doubted the arrangement Netanyahu made with the Palestinians
on ending the military standoff in Gaza Strip last week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the Sunday Cabinet session that he was glad with
the arrangement. But Sharon told other ministers that Netanyahu
complained to him on Friday that he had not been informed of the
terms of the arrangement and he was not pleased with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has demonstrated that "even his own ministers
do not believe him," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Netanyahu stressed that the opposition should
support the government at "the crucial time" in the
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the opposition leader to stand with the
government of Israel to demand the Palestinians live up to their
obligations," he said. He reiterated the responsibility for the
long deadlock in the peace process rested on the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Likud Knesset members came to Netanyahu's aid by accusing the
Labor of launching an incitement campaign against the prime
minister. But in quick response, Labor Secretary-General Raanan
Cohen retorted that Likud members, who he said had incited against
the slain Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, "should be the last
ones to talk about incitement."
</P>
<P>
The Monday special Knesset session was demanded by the Labor,
which gathered 40 lawmakers' signatures needed to convene such a
session, to request Netanyahu to make a policy statement to the
parliament.

PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- French parliamentarians from both the
National Assembly and the Senate vote with a crushing majority to
approve the amendment of the French Constitution to allow the
overseas territory of New Caledonia to change its status prior to
gaining a possible full independence.
</P>
<P>
Among the 885 parliamentarians attending a joint session of the
two chambers of parliament in Versaille south of Paris, 827 voted
for the revision of the constitution, said National Assembly
speaker Laurent Fabius.
</P>
<P>
This was far more than the 515 votes, or those of three fifths
of the parliamentarians, needed for approving constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth amendment of the French Constitution under
the Fifth Republic since 1958.
</P>
<P>
The French government and the pro-independence and pro-French
parties of New Caledonia signed an agreement on May 5 on the
future of the South Pacific archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows New Caledonia to gain full administrative
autonomy in 15 to 20 years before deciding whether to choose
independence or not through a referendum.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Sees Sharp Cut in German Budget Deficit by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has presented a fiscal plan envisaging a nearly balanced budget by
the year 2002, German press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget plan which is due to go before the German
cabinet for approval Wednesday, Germany's budget deficit would be
reduced to 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999
and to 0.5 percent by 2002, Waigel was quoted by German media as
saying at a meeting of European Union finance ministers in
Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
Waigel's plan envisaged a total 1999 German budget of 465.3
billion marks (255 billion U.S. dollars), up just 0.4 percent from
the 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
The planned budget deficit would be cut from 56.4 billion marks
(31 billion dollars) in 1998 to 56.2 billion marks (30.9 billion
dollars) in 1999 and to 45.3 billion marks (24.9 billion dollars)
by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Suffer Most from Asian Crisis: U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Poor and vulnerable nations
suffer first and most as a consequence of the Asian economic
crisis and the international community should give them a hand,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a high-level session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council, Annan said developing countries are less able than
developed nations to withstand the fallout of the Asian crisis,
and even countries far removed from the Asian region are feeling
the impact.
</P>
<P>
African countries, he said, are experiencing collateral damage
in the form of reduced commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
"International cooperation must focus first on these nations:
on who do not have effective lobbying groups or whose voices are
otherwise not heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the impact of globalization on developing
countries, the secretary-general said the needs of Africa and the
least developed countries should be focused.
</P>
<P>
He urged the abolishment of non-tariff barriers facing these
nations, duty-free treatment of their exports and relief of their
unsustainable debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
He saw it "unacceptable" that official development assistance
by developed countries has fallen to its lowest point in history
when it is needed most.
</P>
<P>
The three-day session, featured by participation of leading
international trade and finance institutions and trade ministers,
is mainly devoted to finding ways of overcoming the impact of the
Asian crisis on world trade.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. survey shows that growth in dollar value of world
exports is expected to fall to roughly 2.5 percent in 1998 from
4.3 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1997.

JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings is due to pay his first state visit to South Africa from
Wednesday to Sunday, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that Rawlings, together
with his wife Nana Agyeman Rawlings, was expected to discuss
domestic and international issues of mutual concern, such as
conflict prevention and the strengthening of political and
economic ties in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings was scheduled to hold talks with South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki as well as other members of the government.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it was also likely that the issue of South
Africa's hosting of the Non-Aligned Summit next month would be
raised.
</P>
<P>
An agreement for the promotion and protection of investments
will be signed during the visit by South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo and his Ghanaian counterpart Victor Gbeho.
</P>
<P>
It was expected, the statement said, that the vision of the
African Renaissance would feature with a focus on the progress of
regional cooperation both in southern Africa and west Africa as
well as peace-keeping initiatives on the continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa exported goods worth more than 392 million Rand
(62 million U.S. Dollars) to Ghana in 1997, and imported goods
worth over 166 million Rand (26 million U.S. Dollars) from Ghana.
Several South African mining houses were involved in mining

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's independent
Parades Commission Monday gave the Orangemen the go-ahead to march
through the nationalist Lower Ormeau Road area of Belfast next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Alistair Graham said the decision was not a
"trade-off" for its block on Orangemen in Drumcree, Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off between 5,000 Protestant Orangemen and police has
continued since Sunday afternoon in the town of Portadown over the
security forces' determination to enforce the panel's ruling
barring them from walking down the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
Graham said the controversial parade in Belfast would be
allowed to go ahead on condition that the marchers pass the
contentious part of the Lower Ormeau Road by 8.30 a.m. (0730 GMT)
and that the Orange Order's pipe and drums bands stay silent.
</P>
<P>
"This was a difficult decision, but I'm sure we've arrived at
the right one," Graham said in Belfast. "We hope that this
decision will be respected by all parties."
</P>
<P>
But the Catholic residents in the Lower Ormeau Roan area
objected the ruling and pledged to fight the decision by seeking a
judicial review.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Envoy in Cyprus Assumes Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of Mission of the
U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) Dame Ann Hercus
assumed her duties here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hercus, a New Zealander and also deputy special representative
for Cyprus of the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, arrived here
last week to replace Gustave Feissel, who retired after 15-year
service in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday, Hercus said she will do her best
to help the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reach a settlement over
their disputes "within the existing U.N. framework."
</P>
<P>
"I am here to listen to the two leaders, to offer a new U.N.
perspective from time to time and follow through on initiatives,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Annan has reaffirmed to her "his determination to pursue
intensified efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement to
the Cyprus problem," Hercus said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into a Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
landed troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Accepts Netanyahu's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Monday accepted the policy statement made by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The statement was passed in a vote of 43 to 42 after a heated
debate, in which the opposition attacked Netanyahu's policies in
dealing with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Monday's special session was convened at the request of the
leading opposition Labor Party, whose leader Ehud Barak strongly
accused Netanyahu of leading the nation to an all-out war.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement, Netanyahu reiterated that it was the
Palestinians that should be responsible for the 16-month long
deadlock in the peace talks because they had failed to fulfill
their commitments to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu demanded the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
take real actions to implement its obligations, including ending
incitement against Israel, detaining terrorists, collecting
illegal arms and outlawing terror organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that that if the PNA accepted the principle of
reciprocity and fulfilled its commitments, then a breakthrough in
the peace talks would be achieved in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his insistence on security might not be popular,
Netanyahu promised that he would adhere to his stance in the talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Despite the scathing attack against him, Netanyahu urged the
opposition to support him in the peace negotiations in order to
keep Israel's security interests.
</P>
<P>
This was the first policy statement made by Netanyahu to the
Knesset in seven months. The opposition has complained that the
prime minister was boycotting the parliament by refusing to make
any policy statement since last December.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for 16
months since Netanyahu government started building a Jewish
settlement in a controversial site of East Jerusalem in March
last year. The current sticking point is the Israeli refusal to
accept an American initiative for a 13 percent withdrawal in the
next Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the deadlock in the peace process could ignite
violence in the region, PNA President Yasser Arafat has been
making efforts to solicit international pressure to press Israel to
carry out the long overdue troop redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Kabila, Mugabe Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
and his Democratic Congolese counterpart Laurent Desire Kabila
Monday held private talks for more than three hours here on
COMESA and security issues.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived here Monday morning, told the Zimbabwe
News Agency Ziana that the talks centered on the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) of which he is the
current chairman.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks, however, said discussions included
security issues, Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said it would take his country some time to reconstruct
its economy which was plundered by the late president Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
"Reconstruction is a very long program," he said, adding, "We
are doing well in all things. The rebuilding exercise for our
military is going on very well, and people are happy."
</P>
<P>
On whether the donor community was forthcoming in helping the
central African country to rebuild, Kabila said, "In Congo it is
our policy to first count on our own efforts and what belongs to
us before we look for outside help."
</P>
<P>
Last week there was a shooting incident outside the
presidential villa in the capital Kinshasa, which Kabila
described as "not very serious."
</P>
<P>
"That was just a small incident. It was not very serious. It
happens in other countries, even in Washington," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was evasive when questioned about the circumstances
surrounding the release of opposition leader Ettienne Tshisekedi,
who spent months in his rural home after an imposed internal
exile.
</P>
<P>
"Why do you want to talk much about individuals?" asked
Kabila. "There are many Congolese. Why only someone who was used
by the imperialists?"
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who was accompanied by Justice Minister Mwenze
Kongolo, left for home soon after the talks at a local hotel.

HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean delegation left the
country's second largest city Bulawayo Monday for a week-long
stay in Uganda in a bid to learn how the east African country is
coping with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF spokesperson said the trip would expose the

HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A two-week sub-regional workshop on
strengthening national education statistical information systems
(NESIS) started in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Zimbabwe's Education and Culture
Minister Gabriel Machinga said the inception of NESIS in 1991 had

<HEADLINE> Iran's Dependence on Oil Urged to Be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis Speaker Nateq Nouri
Monday called for efforts to reduce the country's dependence on
oil, saying that the country's single-product economy has become a
serious matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fourth power industry fair, Nouri said
sustainable development cannot be based on shaky foundations such
as oil.
</P>
<P>
He said the conversion of oil into a political tool in the
hands of "arrogant powers," the impact of economic crises on oil
prices and the fact that oil consumption is not confined to one
generation alone have turned oil into an unstable base for
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Nouri stressed
that "the country's independence can be guaranteed only when we
can stand on our own feet and can diminish reliance on oil."
</P>
<P>
All impediments to the expansion of non-oil exports should be
lifted, he said, terming skilled manpower and production as the
most important key to development.
</P>
<P>
Heavily hit by lower-than-expected oil prices, Iranian
government has pledged to transform the country's oil economy to
one less dependent on oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami is expected to announce a package
of economic reforms in the near future to inject new life to the
country's ailing economy.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Budget to Be Altered for Insufficient Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 budget of Romania will
have to be altered, only two months after being endorsed by the
parliament, the local daily Nine O'clock Monday cited Finance
Minister Daniel Daianu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that this measure was needed to keep the
budget deficit "within the safety zone" as the budget income in
the first semester of this year was less than expected. "A budget
deficit over 5.5 percent is a very bad thing for the national
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has to alter the income accomplishment
program because of the 9.4 percent GDP drop in the first part of
1998. The program for the first semester stipulated 33.986
trillion lei (about 3.54 billion U.S. dollar) budget income, but
only 32.673 trillion lei (3.4 billion dollars) was collected in
the end, a figure which represents 40 percent of the state budget
income.
</P>
<P>
Direct taxes (on profit and salaries) and custom taxes were
collected in full, and even exceeded expectations, but indirect
taxes (VAT, excise taxes) did not come through, according to data
given by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The budget income is to be altered to 32.567 trillion lei (3.39
billion dollars) for the first semester of the year, sources of
the ministry informed.
</P>
<P>
The budget adaptations will be operated top down, Finance
Minister Daianu announced, but he did not yet name the ministries
which would have to cut expenses.
</P>
<P>
The targets in the 1998 budget adopted on May read a 3.6
percent-of-the-GDP budget deficit, and zero economic growth.
Budget revenues are set at 75.044 trillion lei (7.82 billion
dollars), and the spendings at 97.902 trillion (10.2 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Equal Rights in Exploiting Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Monday urged that a legal regime on the Caspian Sea be determined
in the interests of all littoral states to ensure their fair
exploitation of the sea's resources.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the call in talks with visiting Turkmen President
Saparmurat Niyazov, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
His words in response to a recent report that some Caspian
states are seeking to divide the world's largest inland water, a
move Tehran is bitterly opposed.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been emphasizing the "equal rights" of Caspian states
to exploit sea resources instead of a division, by which it feared
its maneuvering space will be largely limited for its relatively
short coastal line, as compared with the other four littoral
states - Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkmen President Niyazov also stressed the need for
an immediate approval of the legal regime honoring the interests
of all the littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iranian-Turkmen ties, Khatami said that Iran and
Turkmenistan have excellent cooperation in boosting progress of
the two countries, and seeking peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov, who arrived here Monday morning on a three-day visit,
also voiced his satisfaction with the growing cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the set-up over 80 Iranian firms in Turkmenistan
indicated a growth in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The building of railway linking the two countries showed their
determination to develop their economic and industrial
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed to establish six committees on
oil and gas, commerce, health, transport and telecommunications,
finance and banking, and energy, to study and coordinate bilateral
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat Arrested for Espionage Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian Foreign Ministry
official has been formally taken into custody pending trial on
espionage charges, the Prosecutor General's Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the office didn't reveal the identity of the official,
who was detained last Friday while meeting with Cho Sung-woo, a
councilor of the South Korean embassy, but media reports
identified him as Valentin Moiseyey, deputy director of the
Russian Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian counterintelligence service, Cho is
the South Korean special service's station chief in Moscow, the
Interfax news agency reported. He was declared persona non grata
Saturday and ordered to leave the country in three days.
</P>
<P>
There were Russian Foreign Ministry documents in Cho's
briefcase and the South Korean diplomat declined to say how they
were obtained, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Moiseyev's case is now being investigated by the Federal
Security Service (FSB), the Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted FSB officials as saying that Moiseyev had
systematically provided confidential information to the South
Korean secret service, causing substantial damage to Moscow's
political and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of "high treason" as prescribed in the Russian
Criminal Code, Moiseyev could face up to 20 years in prison,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has protested over the expulsion, saying it will
take action after questioning Cho, who is to arrive in Seoul late
Monday.
</P>

Russia and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1990 and
have since enjoyed good relations.

LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Protestant Orangemen in
Portadown were preparing for a second night at their makeshift
encampment after being prevented from marching down the Garvaghy
Road.
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen insisted they would not leave Drumcree Church
until they could pass through the Garvaghy Road, a traditional
parade route barred by the Parades Commission last week, according
to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Although the standoff went on Sunday afternoon, Portadown
itself was calm. Police in black riot gear rested on the bonnets
of slate-grey tank-shaped armored trucks, balaclavas over their
faces.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order had urged its members to protest peacefully
and Sunday passed without major incident in the largely Protestant
town of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
However, in other parts of Northern Ireland, there was
widespread street violence overnight, with youths throwing petrol
bombs at police, blockading roads and hijacking cars as a protest
against the ban decision made by the Parade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The spreading conflict threatened to torpedo a hard-won accord,
concluded in April, to bring peace to Northern Ireland after 30
years of sectarian and political violence that claimed 3,600
lives.

PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
Monday described the situation in the Berber-speaking Kabylie
region as "grave," after a previously unknown armed group said it
would seek revenge upon those who killed Berber singer Matoub
Lounes.

<HEADLINE> Libyan, Chadian Planes Defy Air Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Libyan and Chadian planes landed
in a Libyan airport Monday in defiance of the United Nations air
embargo, the Libyan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chadian plane arrived in the morning at the Al-Abraq
airport, some 1200 kilometers east to the Libyan capital city
Tripoli, while the Libyan aircraft arrived at the same airport in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan plane was dispatched by Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi to the Chadian capital N'djamena to fetch Chad's President
Idriss Deby and his Niger's counterpart Ibrahim Mainassara. The
two leaders flew to Libya to attend the grand ceremony marking the
birthday of Islamic Prophet Mohammed to be held late Monday in
Al-Bayda, northeastern Libya.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Chadian delegation flew to Libya in the
Chadian plane.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Muslim representatives from worldwide are expected
to attend the prayer held in Al-Bayda.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the latest action was in line with the recent
summit of the Organization of African Unity, which called on its
member states to ignore the U.N. sanctions in cases of
humanitarian or religious needs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed an air and arms embargo on Libya in 1992 to
demand it extradite two Libyan men accused in the bombing of a Pan
Am airliner that killed 270 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi has repeatedly defied the embargo by sending planes to
Saudi Arabia carrying pilgrims for the annual Islamic
pilgrimage. He himself flew to Cairo to attend an Arab summit in
1996 and made a tour of West Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chadian plane was the second non-Libyan plane that has
broken the air embargo following an Italian lawmaker's flight to
Tripoli on a humanitarian mission in a small plane last April.

lives in the aircraft crash which occurred on June 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
After observing one minute of silence, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan made a statement by saying, "This may give us occasion

say that our work is to wage a war for peace; but it is
appropriate to say that we seek to build defenses against
violence, poverty, injustice and destruction."
</P>

"We must carry on the cause of peace -- in Angola as anywhere
else we can make a difference -- no matter how great the risk, no
matter how absent the immediate reward," Annan said.

July 1998 also marked the 50th anniversary of the first

WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott will meet with Indian and Pakistani envoys this
week in an effort to ease the tension in South Asia following
nuclear tests by both countries in May, U.S. officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, in charge of the South Asian nuclear portfolio, will
meet with Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, a former Pakistani foreign
minister and now a special envoy for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
in Washington later Monday.
</P>
<P>
He is planning to meet with Jaswant Singh, deputy chairman of
India's planning commission, in Frankfurt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States condemned both India and Pakistan for their
nuclear tests in May and immediately imposed sanctions on the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It at the same time called on India and Pakistan to refrain
from further testing as it could fuel a regional arms race or even
spark conflict.
</P>
<P>
Talbott last week also told journalists that the United States
was trying to use the diplomatic way to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The diplomacy that is already under way and that we hope will
intensify, accelerate and ultimately produce some results during
the months ahead needs to have an element of cooperation with the
two parties," he said last Wednesday.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
visit Russia in early September, the Interfax news agency quoted
the presidential press service as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin are expected to
discuss bilateral ties, regional and international issues,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in March that there would be no summit before
Russia's parliament ratified the START II treaty that would
dramatically cut the two countries' nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The Duma, however, is unlikely to ratify the accord, which was
signed five years ago, in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Duma deputy Andrei Nikolayev said Sunday that the lower house
would not ratify the treaty earlier than autumn.
</P>
<P>
"Before the document is debated, the deputies should
comprehensively explain Russia's nuclear security concept, on
which its defense capability depends in the long run, so that they
could make a clear-cut decision in which the political and
military tasks require nuclear weapons," Interfax quoted the
former Border Service chief as saying.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Plans to Build Dry Dock for Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Harbors
Authority (THA) is in the process of setting up a dry dock that
will be used as a transit facility for Rwandan cargoes.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Monday by William Kusila, the Minister of
Communications and Transport, who accompanied Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu for a tour to the Dar es Salaam Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The decision to put up the facility at Isaka in the northwest
region of Shinyanga followed consultations between the two
countries, Kusila said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the installation of the facility to be
completed by March next year, is aimed at facilitating the
transportation of Rwandan cargoes imported through the Dar es
Salaam port.
</P>
<P>
"I hope within eight months Rwandans will be able to clear
their cargoes at Isaka," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although few cargoes to Rwanda have been routed through
Tanzania over the past few years, Kusila said, the transportation
of the cargoes has not been easy due to floods caused by El Nino
that disrupted Tanzania's communication network including the
central railway line.
</P>
<P>
THA managing director Samson Luhigo said Tanzania will invest
heavily in the installation of the facility.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has already committed itself to the project," he
said, adding "We also want Rwanda to be earnest."
</P>
<P>
According to Luhigo, the Dar es Salaam port can handle four
million tons of dry cargoes but only half of the capacity is
currently being utilized.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, he said, Rwanda had about 2.4 million
tons of cargoes through maritime trade. Some 27 percent of the
total, or 640,000 tons, were routed through the Dar es Salaam
port.
</P>
<P>
The managing director said Rwandan goods passing through Dar
es Salaam dropped drastically from 162,953 tons in 1993 to
119,997 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
"The drop in traffic was alarming enough to prompt us to take
a fresh look at what could have gone wrong in terms of port
efficiency, transport modalities and other issues pertaining to
transit trade," Luhigo said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the problem, transport institutions from both
countries met clients and regulatory bodies in the Rwandan
capital of Kigali last year to seek solutions.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu commended the Tanzanian government for its
cooperation and said Rwanda will do its best to speed up cargo
transportation at the port.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, the Rwandan president who was also
accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation Jakaya Kikwete, visited the port's general cargo
terminal where 1,600 tons of salt are awaiting transportation to
Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Steps to Remind Low-Income Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
started a campaign Monday to alert low-income elderly Americans to
Medicare assistance that many don't know they are entitled to.
</P>
<P>
During an appearance in the Rose Garden Clinton said he was
ordering a series of steps aimed at improving awareness, including
sending more mailings to Medicare and Social Security households,
encouraging simpler application processes and making eligibility
information available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited a consumer group's study showing that many
low-income elderly and disabled Americans do not take advantage of
the assistance in paying their Medicare premiums.
</P>
<P>
"Over 3 million of the hardest pressed Medicare beneficiaries
still do not receive the help to which they are due," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Medicare, the government health insurance for people over age
65 and the disabled, charges a monthly premium -- now 43.80
dollars -- for coverage of doctors' office visits and other
outpatient treatment. It is deducted automatically from a person's
Social Security retirement or disability check.
</P>
<P>
Congress in 1989 instructed Medicaid, which insures the
nation's poor and is run jointly by the federal and state
governments, to pick up the tab for certain low-income
beneficiaries. Over the years, eligibility requirements have been
relaxed, opening the aid to more people.
</P>
<P>
The latest expansion will provide 1.5 billion dollars in help
over the next five years. An estimated 1.6 million additional
Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for help on a first-come,
first-serve basis, until the money runs out.
</P>
<P>
But participation remains low. Nationwide, only 4,723 people
were receiving the aid as of June, although enough money was set
aside in last year's balanced budget act to help nearly half a
million people in 1998, according to a study released Monday by
Families USA, an advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Russia Agree to Promote Military Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Russia Agreed here Monday
to promote a military dialogue in Cyprus in a bid to realize the
island's ultimate demilitarisation, a Greek Foreign Ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the two U.N. resolutions passed in
June provide a good basis for the assumption of initiatives to
promote a military dialogue and a reduction of the presence of
military forces on the island, aiming at its ultimate
demilitarisation, said the statement released after meetings of
Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou and Foreign
Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis with visiting Russian envoy for
Cyprus Vladimir Tchizhov.
</P>
<P>
The statement continued that Kranidiotis told Tchizhov that the
international community had to make it clear in every way to the
Turkish side that it would tolerate neither the status quo nor the
island's partition, nor any other solution that would be in
violation of the spirit and the letter of the relevant U.N.
decisions and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy stressed the need of strengthening contacts
between the two communities at the level of the society of
citizens because this could contribute to a de-escalation of
tension in the island, which has been divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of an abortive coup-backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo problem, the two sides expressed reservations
concerning the prospect of an international military intervention
and generally a further militarisation of the issue, and they also
repeated their positions of seeking a diplomatic solution to the
Kosovo problem, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with his Yugoslav
counterpart Slobodan Milosevic recently had opened a window to a
diplomatic solution, Tchizhov said, adding that the final status
of Kosovo should be the subject of talks and political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official also considered as particularly positive
the development of an international mechanism for monitoring
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Britain, China Discuss Possible Waste-Water Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott told the UK-China Water Sector Cooperation Seminar in
Shanghai that it is time for Britain and China to cooperate in
dealing with water problems.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told the more than 130 experts gathered for the
two-day seminar that there is a unique opportunity for cooperation
between the United Kingdom and China in the water industry, as the
new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
British business people spoke about their own experiences in
private-public partnership and about investment and waste water
treatment. By the 1990's, the UK had turned over ten regional
water industry administrations into companies and improved water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
British companies represented at the seminar said they hope to
build long-term relations with China. Bovis Construction Group and
Thames Water International have taken their business to Shanghai,
to work on providing 400,000 cu.m. of water a day.
</P>
<P>
The UK had 5.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of investment in the
field in China by the end of last year, making it No.1 among
European nations.
</P>
<P>
Prescott's China visit with people in the water business is
expected to be good for cooperation in the water industry, which
is listed by the Chinese government as a key area of environmental
protection.

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic said he
trusted captain Zvonimir Boban so much that he felt they were "two
bodies with a single spirit."
</P>
<P>
"We are in tremendous spirits, and I have complete confidence in my
captain, whom I've known since he was fifteen." said Blazevic on
Monday in Vittel east of Paris.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays we are so close that I feel we are two bodies with a
single spirit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blazevic said he knew several French players since he had coached
Didier Deschamps, Marcel Desailly and Christian Karembeu in French
club side Nantes FC.
</P>
<P>
"The Frenchman have one advantage: playing in front of a home
crowd. For us, that is a drawback like climbing Mont Blanc," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed the offensive runs by defenders Lilian Thuram and
Bixente Lizarazu is the French weakpoints that could be exploited.

Croatia will meet France in the World Cup semifinals at Stade de

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan Calls for Equal Division of Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkmen President
Saparmurat Niyazov said here Tuesday that the Caspian Sea should
be divided among the five littoral states equally and fairly.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov made the remark in meeting with Iranian Majlis
(Parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri Tuesday, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov said the differences among the littoral states -
Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakstan and Azerbaijan - arise from
the absence of a legal regime for the Caspian resources and lack
of a mechanism for their exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that the five states should make their final
decision on a legal regime to stop others from taking advantage of
the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Of the five Caspian states, Turkmenistan, Kazakstan and
Azerbaijan favor a division of the world's largest inland water,
while Iran and Russia hope each of them has equal rights to
exploit Caspian resources.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral relationship, Niyazov said Turkmenistan
considers it important and productive, and called on Iranian
parliament to share with his country the experience in elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the West has no accurate understanding of our
religious beliefs, culture and tradition and that's why they raise
the human rights issues."
</P>
<P>
"We believe in our religion and are willing to protect our
cultural identity and this is what the westerners should
understand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that Iranian Majlis is ready to share experience
with the Turkmen Parliament on elections and legislation.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Western countries for adopting double
standard in treating their allies and non-allied states on human
rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that reconstruction and development require security
and stability and Iran expects the Caspian states to open up the
avenues for economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen president arrived here Monday on a three-day visit
to discuss with Iranian leaders the division of Caspian resources
and Caspian oil transport through Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has close economic ties with Turkmenistan, its northern
neighbor. A gas pipeline inaugurated earlier this year now pumps
3.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year from Turkmenistan
to Iran.

Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a

Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand

LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has agreed to meet representatives of Protestant "Orangemen" for
an urgent meeting about the standoff with security forces in
Portadown, Northern Ireland, the BBC said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
But it said the meeting was not being arranged with a view to

Downing Street said the meeting would take place Thursday, but
the time and venue had not be decided.

Orangemen asked Protestant politician Ian Paisley to arrange
the talks as violence once again broke out in the province for the

</P>
<P>
Thousands of Orangemen have been camped out at Drumcree near
Portadown since Sunday when security forces prevented them from

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Lower Economic Growth Rate This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The administration of new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada does not expect the economy to grow
beyond 2.5 percent this year as projected by the previous
government, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During ceremonies marking his takeover from former Finance
Secretary Salvador Enriques, Espiritu admitted that the new
government more realistically expects the growth to be lower than
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, inflation rate, which was targeted by the
previous government to range between 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent
for the whole of 1998, is now expected to average over 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the much lower growth figure and higher
inflation expectation was confirmed following at least two
meetings of the cabinet economic cluster.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the government is expected to make a downward
revision in key economic targets following the region-wide
economic downturn caused by the continuing currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government of former President Fidel Ramos already lowered
last month the economic growth rate to between 2.5 percent and 3
percent from between 3 percent to 4 percent it set earlier.
</P>
<P>
On the fiscal sector alone, Espiritu acknowledged that there is
a strong possibility that the budget deficit, originally projected
by Enriques to hit 36 billion pesos (900 million U.S. dollars)
this year, could go beyond 40 billion pesos (1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The downscaling of key economic targets has been relayed to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) which will send a team here in
August to review the country's economic performance, Espiritu
said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the revisions would be discussed between the IMF
team and the Philippine government, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Schools Urged to Teach Local Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- It is government policy that the
teaching of indigenous languages within the school system should
be compulsory, Zimbabwean Minister of Education, Sport and
Culture Gabriel Machinga said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, the minister
said: "Every child in primary schools should be exposed to at
least one indigenous language and the English language."
</P>
<P>
It is disturbing that some schools do not make it compulsory
for pupils to learn vernacular languages, Machinga said, adding
that "it is always better for the responsible heads to teach the
correct thing without being forced."
</P>
<P>
In most of the country's private schools, Shona and Ndebele
subjects are optional, and only those interested sit for the
examinations at grade seven level.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, he said, has received proposals by groups
advocating for Shona, Ndebele and English to be accorded equal
status.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it is an advantage to students to be
proficient in all local languages.
</P>
<P>
The issue of developing local languages has been widely
debated in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some groups have said that Africa would remain backward
scientifically, technologically and economically unless schools
started using vernacular languages as the medium of instruction.

<HEADLINE> Report: 26.6 Million Hectares for Agricultural Reclamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China has 26.6 million hectares of
land that could be transformed into agricultural uses if rational
land development and requisition are taken into consideration, the
Beijing-based Economic Daily reported on July 5.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there are three major sources for
reclaiming farmland. Primarily, if China's per capita township and
rural residential land occupation drops to 100 square meters from
the present 153, then 6.3 million hectares would be saved, an
amount more than the total land area allocated for
non-agricultural use in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, about 40 percent of China's urban land calls for a more
efficient use, as the waste is most frequently seen in real estate
and industrial land use, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to scientific estimates, 15 percent of developed
urban real estate remains idle, which accounts for 266,666
hectares. As for industrial construction, an average site coverage
is usually 11-to-13 percent higher than that in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Urban planning and old city renovation can also help improve
the land-use rate and save 180,000-to-360,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, China has 35 million hectares of wasteland that can be
exploited for agricultural use, the paper reported. If only 2
percent of that land is opened up annually, the coverage can make
up for the farmland lost for various purpose during the same
period.

<HEADLINE> Building Permits Value Down in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The total value of building permits
declined in Canada for the second consecutive month in May,
Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities in the country issued building permits valued at
2.7 billion dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in May, down 5.9
percent from April.
</P>
<P>
The residential sector accounted for about three-quarters of
the month's decline, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the housing sector, municipalities issued 1.4 billion
dollars in building permits in May, down 8.6 percent from
April. The value of permits for both single- and multi-family
dwellings has declined for two consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
In the non-residential sector, construction intentions fell for
a third consecutive month in May, declining 2.8 percent from April
to 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Declines in planned commercial and institutional projects more
than offset the increase in industrial intentions.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the declines, total building permits issued during
the first five months of this year were still 13.2 percent above
the level during the same period last year, the agency added.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has put off its plan to
host the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) conference in 2000
due to funding difficulties, a minister was quoted by Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The country is concerned (about the present situation),"
Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Marzuki Usman told reporters
Tuesday in Denpasar, capital of Bali Province.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has hosted the conference three times in 1963, 1974
and 1991. The minister declined to specify which country will
succeed Indonesia as the host of the PATA conference.
</P>
<P>
PATA with about 2,000 members, including ministers and
businessmen, is regarded as having contributed significantly to
the regional development and marketing of the Asia-Pacific
region's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian tourism sector is most affected by a series of
problems in the country ranging from natural disasters to economic
and political crisis. The government projected the country's
foreign tourist arrivals may fall 5 percent this year from that of
1997.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that only 20 percent of the country's
approximately 4,200 travel bureaus were currently still operating
amidst the protracted economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign tourists, Indonesia's tourism industry will
launch a promotion campaign dubbed "Let's Go Indonesia" this
month.

<P>
CHENGDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- About 120,000 students living in
China's Sichuan Province of which some parts have been hit by
heavy rains still took the College Entrance Exams today on time,
thanks to local government efforts.
</P>
<P>
Rains have hit much of the province for the last four days,
stopping traffic and causing great difficulties for students who
need to take the exam.
</P>
<P>
Because of traffic snarls, the education department of one
prefecture in Sichuan had to carry exam papers by horseback in
some cases and police officers were asked to escort the exam
papers to ensure their safe arrival.
</P>
<P>
The Tanghu Middle School, one of the exam sites in the city of
Chengdu, was flooded, so the local government soon found an
alternative exam site, and saw to it that more than a thousand
students got to the exam on time.
</P>
<P>
A provincial education department official said that all of the
province's students were able to attend today's exams, in spite of
the heavy rains that have not stopped.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices on the Russian Trading
System (RTS) continued to slide Tuesday, with blue chips tumbling
seven to 10 percent in the first two hours in an apparent sign of
the country's deepening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The RTS index plunged 9.17 percent to 131.71 with a volume of
only 9.78 million U.S. dollars by 13:00 local time (07:00 GMT),
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The slump was attributed to dwindling confidence in the Russian
economy's ability to stabilize as many traders try to dispose of
their portfolios in favor of a safe haven in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the auction of the oil company Rosneft, rising
yields on treasury bills, the delay of an IMF decision on a
stabilization loan and persistent rumors of a ruble devaluation
also fueled the downturn.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing released a plan for
increasing grain market reforms today that will push state-owned
grain enterprises into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
This means that all state-owned grain enterprises, including
grain storage enterprises at the township level in the Chinese
capital will become self-regulating economic entities and will no
longer be subject to government administration.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, Beijing's mayor, says that all state-owned grain
enterprises should respect the market mechanism and have better
management and performance in a market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Wei, head of the Beijing Municipal Grain
Bureau, in addition to the greater commercial independence, there
will be a downsizing of state-owned grain enterprises in Beijing,
from 61,000 employees to about 30,000, and an effort will be made
to restructure these enterprises and to improve the quality of
employees.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to avoid any new deficits by June 1 of next
year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Customs Officers Foiling Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of the year,
customs officers in Gongbei in China's Guangdong Province dealt
with 523 cases of smuggling, involving 146 million yuan worth of
smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
A senior customs officer in the city of Zhuhai, one of China's
Special Economic Zones, says that as many as 61 major cases of
smuggling, each involving at least 300,000 yuan worth of smuggled
goods, had been stopped.
</P>
<P>
He says that in the first six months of the year, customs
officers dealt with 20 cases of smuggled oil products and cooking
oil, and confiscated 16,000 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers also stopped smuggled vehicles, drugs, and
pirated video and audio products, he says.
</P>
<P>
The Gongbei Customs office is now working hard to increase its
sources of information and improve inspection capability to ensure
order in China's import and export business.

<HEADLINE> Potential Gold Jewelry Market In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Demand for gold jewelry in China is
still strong and has great potential, according to Liu Shengyu, of
China Jewelry Import and Export Company, who spoke at a
publication ceremony today for a Chinese journal on the world's
gold market.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China's gold jewelry market is far from being
fully explored, even though every year over 200 tons of gold
jewelry have been sold since 1991. In 1997, China used 340 tons of
gold, making it the world's third largest consumer, after the
United States and India.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has grown at least 8 percent yearly since the
end of the '80s, which Liu believes has greatly helped the gold
jewelry market. The best indication of this, he says, is the more
than 10,000 gold jewelry shops that have appeared.
</P>
<P>
A survey to Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
showed that 40 to 50 percent of the residents had bought some gold
jewelry, and the figure in medium-sized and small cities and rural
areas was about 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, Liu says, per capita ownership of gold jewelry in
China is less than two grams, far less than the average for other
developing countries, and, "If every Chinese buys just a gram of
gold jewelry, then a thousand tons of gold will be needed, and no
other country has such a huge market."
</P>
<P>
"Every year there are more than 10 million young couples
getting married in China. If one couple buys only 10 grams of gold
jewelry, then a 100-ton gold market will appear," he adds. And,
the Chinese have a tradition of seeing gold jewelry as a sign of
wealth, and this helps provide a large gold jewelry market in
China.

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- French striker Guivarc'h has vowed to
break his scoring drought when his team play Croatia in the World Cup
semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Like all striker I am obsessed with goals. That will pay off one
day," he said Monday in Clairefontaine southwest of Paris.

performance and winning are what's most important, not individual
goals," he said.
</P>

The 27-year-old forward expected Croatia would use the same tactics
as the Italians in the quarterfinals.
</P>

"Playing against Croatia will be very exciting. I can't wait to
play. I'm very confident that we can win because we're ready to play."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Tanzania Pledge Stronger Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Rwanda and
Tanzania announced Tuesday that the two countries will intensify
bilateral cooperation and work together to solve regional
problems through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in a joint communique issued here
before Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu winded up his
three-day state visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, President Bizimungu and his
Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mkapa agreed to explore new ways
for further strengthening and consolidating of the existing
cordial neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents emphasized the greater need for the
consolidation of peace, security and stability along their common
border to create a conducive environment for trade and other
forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to regularly hold good-neighborly meetings, and
called for revitalization of cooperation arrangements in various
sectors between their two countries in the framework of the Joint
Permanent Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between the two presidents, Bizimungu
underlined the importance of the private sector in fostering
development in Africa, while Mkapa stressed the need to promote
trade between countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides have decided to construct a dry
dock at Isaka station on Tanzania's central railway to speed up
the movement of Rwanda cargoes.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also reaffirmed the need to build a railway
linking Isaka, Shinyanga region in the northwest of Tanzania,
with the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The line could be extended to the eastern areas of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as Uganda. They have
directed the relevant authorities of their countries to implement
the cross-border project.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, the two presidents underscored the
importance of regional cooperation and economic integration so as
to resolve some regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was commended for its desire to join the East African
Cooperation (EAC) as a move in the right direction. EAC is a
regional bloc comprising Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Bizimungu
and Mkapa called on the two countries at war to resolve the
crisis by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, they voiced support to the OAU mediation
efforts led by its current chairman, President Blaise Campaore of
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents held extensive discussions on the situation
prevailing in the Great Lakes region, particularly the crisis in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents welcomed the progress made in the first
session of the Burundi peace talks during June 15-21 in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha and the commitment made by all
parties represented in the peace talks to engage in serious
negotiations with the aim of resolving the conflict in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
They further welcomed the unanimous agreement by the Burundi
parties to put an end to hostilities. In this regard, they called
on all the belligerents to honor the commitment to suspend
hostilities immediately.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu left Tanzania Tuesday. Before flying home, the
Rwandan President held a press conference in the State House
here.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan President arrived here Sunday with his wife
Seraphina Bizimungu and a delegation of cabinet ministers and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Bizimungu officially opened the 22nd Dar es
Salaam International Trade Fair, visited the Dar es Salaam port
and Tanzania-China Friendship Textiles Co. Ltd, and held talks
with members of the Tanzanian Business Community.

<HEADLINE> China's Annual College Examination Begins (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The annual entrance examination
which will select elite students for China's colleges and
universities makes the whole nation the world's biggest
examination hall today.
</P>
<P>
About 3.2 million high school graduates were expected to attend
the national examination that began all over the country at 9:00
am this morning. There are 340,000 more students taking the exam
this year than last year, according to a spokesman of the Ministry
of Education.
</P>
<P>
One member of the giant army of examinees, Li Ran got to his
examination place one hour prior to the starting time.
</P>
<P>
"For the exam, I even quit watching the live presentations of
the World Cup," the student from the Beijing Erlonglu Middle School
said, looking a bit nervous.
</P>
<P>
Li has reason to give up his favorite soccer matches, since the
examination is considered a turning point in the destiny of many
Chinese: a college education often means job opportunities, a
successful career and the attainment of wealth.
</P>
<P>
"We've prepared for this exam for a decade," says a middle-aged
women whose daughter is taking the exam. "This (to help her
succeed) is the top priority of our family."
</P>
<P>
The woman waiting outside her daughter's examination room
refuses to be identified because she does not want her daughter
to know. "It may make her more nervous," she explains.
</P>
<P>
China has held this examination for 21 years since its
reinstitution after it was forced to halt during the chaotic
Cultural Revolution (1966-76).
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the exam, announced by the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, is regarded as a powerful engine that helped
to boost the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
With a tradition of respect for education, China initiated an
examination system to help ordinary people win official positions
more than 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Today, times have changed. As Chinese leaders urge the
revitalization of the nation through science and technology, study
at colleges and universities has become a symbol of success.
</P>
<P>
Some examinees and their parents have brought with them cold
drinks, food and even bags of oxygen, as they converge in front of
the gate of the Affiliated School of the Beijing Normal University
where the examination is being held.
</P>
<P>
"Preparatory work is OK, and even a medical team is ready,"
says a teacher named Ma. He explains that several students usually
faint from anxiety and nervousness every year.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry asks local departments to keep an eye out for
cheats during the exam. In some flooded areas, motor boats have
been deployed to transport examinees," says Wang Xuming, an
official with the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Psychologists appear on TV talk shows to comfort anxious
students and their parents. The State General Administration for
Environmental Protection has issued a circular forbidding noisy
construction prior to and during the exam, as it may adversely
affect examinees.

<HEADLINE> China's Annual College Examination Begins (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 1,000 Chinese universities and colleges will enroll an
additional 70,000 students this year, which means that one out of
every three examinees will be able to find a place on campus. In
spite of this, most people agree that they are under greater
pressure than ever before.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by psychologists at East China Normal
University and Shanghai University shows that the degree of nerves
and anxiety suffered by the students' parents has increased
dramatically this year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Wansheng, a father accompanying his daughter to the exam,
says that Chinese parents are feeling greater responsibility since
their daughter or son is usually an only child as a result of the
birth control policy adopted in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shouyu, headmaster of Beijing's No.15 Middle School, says
that the reform of state-enterprises and the restructuring of
government departments have made the employment situation
difficult, and that many companies require that their employees be
college graduates.
</P>
<P>
"This is an outcome of the fast growth of the Chinese economy,"
Wang adds.
</P>
<P>
Specialities the examinees most wish to study include finance,
accounting, foreign languages and computer science, subjects
closely related to the current reality in China.
</P>
<P>
It has been one year since China entirely abolished the
40-year-odd system of free tuition for college students. However,
some universities have shown a willingness to provide subsidies
for students from poverty-stricken rural areas if they pass the
examination this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has again urged that the system of
higher education, which originated from the rigid Soviet model, be
further reformed, and a plan to reform the current college
examination structure is now under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The media have suggested that students should not be the slaves
of examination grades, but must improve their overall capabilities.
</P>
<P>
This year's college entrance examination will be attended by
more boys than girls by a ratio of two to one, and 63 percent of
the examinees have expressed a wish to study natural science or
engineering.
</P>
<P>
Chinese language and politics are today's exam subjects, and
the remainder, including history, English, mathematics, physics
and chemistry, will be completed in the next two days.

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The White House said that U.S. President Bill Clinton would
travel to Russia in early September to meet with Russian President
Boris N. Yeltsin, even though the Russian legislature had not
fulfilled a request to ratify the Start-2 arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton will punish health insurance companies
that deny coverage to sick people, in violation of a 1996 law, by
excluding them from the lucrative insurance market for Federal
employees, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Fresh from his well-received nine-day journey through China,
President Clinton plunged back into the domestic political arena
Monday, challenging a recalcitrant Congress to advance his stalled
legislative agenda in areas such as health care, education and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
-- Mexico's ruling party suffered a sharp blow in election
results reported Monday, losing the governor's race in the rural,
northern state of Zacatecas, long considered one of the party's
most impervious strongholds. But it staged a startling comeback in
another important northern state, Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Economists predict the brunt of Asia's economic crisis will
hit the U.S. in the next six to nine months, according to a Wall
Street Journal survey. Most of the survey's participants believe
U.S. companies will slow production and cut employment, though the
economy is unlikely to contract.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets With Romanian Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met here today
with Romania's Democratic Party delegation led by vice-president
Alexandru Sassu.
</P>
<P>
Li, concurrently chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, first extended
his welcome to Sassu on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Romania relationship has withstood tests despite
changes in the international and domestic situations in both
countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are also delighted with the achievements of
Romania, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding party-to-party relationships, Li said the Democratic
Party of Romania (DPR), as an important ruling party, plays an
indispensable role in the political life of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, like the DPR, shoulders the enormous task of
developing the economy and improving people's lives in its
country, Li said, expressing his hope to strengthen exchanges and
cooperation between the two parties on the basis of the four
principles guiding party-to-party relationships (independence,
entire equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs), and to bring a long-term, stable,
healthy and comprehensive Sino-Romanian relationship into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Sassu sent DPR President Peter Roman's warm regards to Li,
adding that Roman had accepted Li's invitation to visit China and
hopes to make the trip as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Sassu told Li that he was deeply impressed by the great
progress China has made. The DPR wishes to further develop its
relationship with the CPC and exchange experiences with each other
on developing an economy, he said.

HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee on
Language Education and Research (SCOLAR) of Hong Kong on Tuesday
endorsed the award of 11.6 million HK dollars (1.49 million U.S.
dollars) to the University of Hong Kong to set up a support center
for teachers using Chinese as the medium of instruction.
</P>
<P>
The support center is one of SCOLAR's major recommendations to
the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) under a package of measures in support of the
mother-tongue teaching policy which is due to take effect at the
beginning of the 1998-99 school year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the support center, the package includes the
provision of a one-off grant for Chinese-medium schools to
organize school-based English Enhancement Programs and to set up
an English Corner within each school on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The package was accepted by the SAR government earlier this
year as it will provide additional support for Chinese-medium
school students in English language learning and for teachers
switching from English medium of instruction to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The whole package will cost about 68 million HK dollars (8.72
million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- FIFA will study how to help players to
combat heat and humidity in the next World Cup finals to be held in
South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Asked on Tuesday whether the FIFA Medical Committe would study the
effect of morning matches on players' performance, Chairman Michel
D'Hooghe said: "It's not a matter of hours. It's also a matter of heat
and dehydration."
</P>
<P>
At the 2002 World Cups, some games would kick off at 10 in the
morning to cater for the audiences in Europe and South America and may
continue until the noon when the summer heat will be intense.
</P>
<P>
But he said he could do nothing to change the kick-off times even
after he saw the Netherlands and Belgium battled in noon heat as high
as 50 degrees Centigrade at the last World Cup finals in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The rights of television (live broadcasting) is stronger than our
medical arguments. I deplore that," he said. "From medical points of
view, it is not sensible to play a game at certain periods of time in
a day and under certain extreme temperatures."

URUMQI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) today established a research institute in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to seek solutions to
desertification and sustainable development of oases.
</P>
<P>
With over 300 research fellows and experts, the CAS Xinjiang

salinization, and the deterioration of pasture land in Xinjiang's
vast and dry land expanse.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiyu, vice-president of the CAS, said the study of oasis
ecology and the improvement of oases environments is a frontier
subject vital to the sustainable development of the economy of
Northwest China, including Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Although oases constitute only 4.25 percent of Xinjiang's total
area of 1.65 million square kilometers, they are major production
and residential centers.

<HEADLINE> FIFA May Simplify Doping Procedures in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Cao Li
</P>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The international soccer's governing body
FIFA said it may simplify the doping procedures in the future World
Cups following several years of very low rate of doping cases.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have less and less problems," FIFA Doping Committee Chairman
Lars Peterson told Xinhua on Tuesday. "The risk will be reduced. Maybe
in the future we can simplify the procedures involved if not do away
with the doping tests."
</P>
<P>
FIFA said on Tuesday all the 240 samples taken from players in 60
World Cup games so far were negative. There are only four matches left
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Two players from each side in a game are tested, with the results
being reported in 24 hours by an IOC-accreditated laboratory in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons that FIFA maintains a doping control program in
major competitions like the World Cup are to support the general
anti-doping campaign in sports and to show to the youths that soccer
is a clean sport.
</P>
<P>
"A big federation like FIFA could not back away from this," added
the Swede. "They need our support. By doing this, we can show we can
play football at the high level without doping.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for the young players. They know these players
are clean."
</P>
<P>
FIFA's Medical Committee Chairman Michel D'Hooghe told a news
conference that in Europe the sport has only 1.26 positive cases in
every 1,000 samples, according to a report published two or three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the result of year's anti-doping education and
better collective medical control in the team sport.
</P>
<P>
Some other sports had as high as 7 percent of positive cases,
D'Hooghe said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Razes Quarter of Kenya's Game Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Three fires started by nomadic
herdsmen, charcoal burners and tourists have destroyed about a
quarter of Tsavo East National Park in southeastern Kenya, the
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the last fire was put down Monday night and now about
40 rangers are keeping a 24-hour watch to ensure no new fire
fronts opened up, KWS spokesman John Mramba told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The fire, first starting three weeks ago, destroyed nearly 365
square kilometers of Tsavo East's 1,100 square kilometers. Tsavo
East, together with the larger Tsavo West, comprise the biggest
wildlife park in this east African nation.
</P>
<P>
Together, they have 20,000 square kilometers and are located
about 290 kilometers southeast of the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
Most of the endangered species such as rhino and hirolla antelope
have their sanctuaries in Tsavo East.
</P>
<P>
However, the area under fire is not densely populated by wild
animals and all large animals have moved out of the area, Mramba
quoted sources in Tsavo as saying.
</P>
<P>
No reports on casualties are available.
</P>
<P>
Mramba said the first two fires extinguished over the weekends
were caused by charcoal burners and pastoralists burning bushes
to kill ticks.
</P>
<P>
The third fire had been detected at Kanderi area Sunday night
and was spreading fast as it was being fanned by strong winds. It
was believed to have been started by a lit cigarette dropped on
the dry grass by a tourist.
</P>
<P>
It was finally put down Monday night as the KWS "mobilized
everything on the ground" to curtain fire and create firebreaks,
according to the officials with KWS.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big fire with large fronts due to changes of wind
directions," said John Muhanga, KWS assistant director at Tsavo
East park.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Hawkish Minister Proposes Withdrawal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon said on Tuesday that he has proposed to the Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset (Parliament) a new
plan on Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After addressing the committee, Sharon told reporters that he
has suggested Israel hand over to the Palestinians less than the
proposed areas of the West Bank, but give them other incentives.
</P>
<P>
But he did not go further with his plan, saying that it has not
been discussed in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"If the current efforts to move the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks do not succeed, another direction must be tried," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly proposed that Israel pull back
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian
commitments to fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has
not. The Jewish state, citing security interests of the country,
insists that it will withdraw from no more than 9 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a key and hawkish member of the Israeli cabinet, argues
that even withdrawal from 9 percent of the West Bank will endanger
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
He has drawn up his own security map for the West Bank,
demanding to set up a 10 to 20-kilometer long security zone in
west of the West Bank and another seven to 10-kilometer long
security strip along the Jordan Valley.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Compete for Profitable Housing Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Competition seems to be mounting
among Chinese banks as they all try to gain a foothold in the
housing financing market at a time when the housing sector is
becoming one of the new growth areas in the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the four largest Chinese commercial banks, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), plans to include
housing financing in its package of major services in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Housing loans, which now account for only three percent of the
bank's total loans, is expected to increase to ten percent by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The bank also plans to issue 30 billion yuan in housing loans
this year, about 15 percent of all loans expected to be extended
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC has seen rapid expansion in its housing financing
since it first launched such services. Statistics show that
between 1991 and last May, the bank's housing deposits tripled,
reaching 72.7 billion yuan, with housing loans increasing by 250
percent to 60.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, the bank issued 12.2
billion yuan in housing loans, including 2.43 billion yuan for
residential house-buyers.
</P>
<P>
ICBC officials said that the bank will focus its housing
financing on large and medium-sized cities with good market
potential for housing sales, and give priority to large and
medium-sized real estate developers and building companies.
</P>
<P>
"Residential housing, government-subsidized housing for the
poor and renovation projects will be considered first in loan
applications, and commercial highrises, villas, and luxury
apartments will definitely receive no bank loans, " said an ICBC
official.
</P>
<P>
The bank also promised support for the secondary housing
market, since house trading is expected to be essential to
ongoing housing reform. The bank is now considering providing
loans and such services as settlements, consulting and asset
evaluation.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers of Sudan
and Malaysia Tuesday discussed two-way trade payment and air
cooperation between Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Sudan's national
carrier.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is contemplating to buy at reasonable prices cooking
oil, beef and mutton from Sudan which is a supplier of meat to
the Gulf states, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said after meeting his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Osman Ismail
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sudan in return has expressed interest in buying on credit palm
oil from Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Mustafa's visit was to continue discussions with
parties in Malaysia as a follow-up to his Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's visit to Sudan last May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Minister in the Prime Minister's
Department Abdul Hamid Othman who also met the Sudanese foreign
minister, Sudan has also agreed to provide suitable land to
Malaysia's PadiBeras Nasional Sdn Bhd (Bernas) (National Rice
Company) for paddy cultivation and Tabung Haji for oil palm
plantation.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hamid told reporters after the meeting that Mustafa
expressed his government's thanks to Malaysia for being the
driving force behind Sudan's opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is also thankful to Malaysia for the help in the
country's development, especially the cooperation extended by
Petronas (Malaysia's national oil company) in the field of oil
production, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pipe-laying project covering 1,500 kilometers through the
desert to Port Sudan would help to spur growth in settlement areas
along the route, Abdul Hamid said.

<P>
Mustafa also called on Mahathir and Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>

CHENGDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bajiu Ergu, 71, was somewhat
puzzled when he moved into his new home with an independent toilet
built at a cost of more than 30,000 yuan (about 3,600 U.S.
dollars). The elderly member of the Yi Nationality dared not
believe that it was his own house.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he lived in a mud-brick house together with his
sheep, pigs and other domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the local government, his family earned more
than 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 U.S. dollars) last year from raising
livestock, and the per capita grain outpout for the family was
more than 700 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The improved living standard for the family has been the result
of a project launched by the Chinese government to help Yi people
change their habits, and improve living conditions and the local
environment with a goal of eradicating poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
The project has brought benefits to a lot of Yi people in the
Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China's Sichuan
Province in addition to Bajiu Ergu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, at present, the per capita income for Yi
people in the prefecture has exceeded 980 yuan (about 110
U.S. dollars) and per capita grain production has surpassed 410
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
One million formerly impoverished people now are well-fed and
more than 150,000 families have moved into new houses.
</P>
<P>
The Yi Nationality is the sixth largest ethnic group in China,
with a population of more than 6.5 million. This ethnic group
scatters mainly over mountainous regions in the provinces of
Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan FM Calls for Regional Peace, Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadiragamar on Tuesday stressed the need to promote peace
and harmony in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kadiragamar was talking to the media at Islamabad Airport
before his departure for Colombo after a three-day visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Sunday as a special envoy of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to deliver an
invitation letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for
attending the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) scheduled to be held from July 29 to
31 in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to lessen tension in South Asia, the Sri
Lankan foreign minister said the SAARC can promote peace and
harmony in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that at the forthcoming SAARC summit a
good attempt would be made in this direction.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possible role of the SAARC in the wake of
the nuclearization of India and Pakistan, Kadiragamar said, "We
are looking into the question as to what other SAARC countries can
do to de-escalate tension in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka on its part would try to make a positive
contribution for this purpose as it was convinced that without
peace and security the region would only be limping along," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, who bade farewell
to Kadiragamar at the airport, said Sharif and his Indian
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is expected to have a bilateral
meeting in Colombo during the summit and Pakistan will again call
upon India to agree on a just solution to the core issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that India would rise to the occasion,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Gohar noted that Pakistan has been welcoming offers by the U.N.
secretary general and various countries of assistance and good
offices for the resolution of the core issue. But unfortunately
India rejected all these gestures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation arising from the nuclearization of
India and Pakistan, Gohar pointed out that now there is a greater
need to work for the solution of the Kashmir issue and for peace
and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC summit will be attended by leaders of its member
countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Rosario Green Macias that China is ready to work with Mexico to
establish a bilateral relationship of comprehensive cooperation

Located in the southwest part of Sichuan Province, Liangshan Yi
Autonomous Prefecture, with a Yi population of 1.6 million, is the
largest region in China inhabited by Yi people.
</P>
<P>
Bajiu Ergu said that for a long period and just like their
predecessors, Yi people ate corn and buckwheat as their staple
food and many of them were forced to eat tree roots and wild
vegetables for half a year because of a grain shortage.
</P>
<P>
The slave-owning system was abolished in the prefecture in
1952, when the Chinese government adopted a reform through
consultations and established the autonomous prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1993 show that 2.1 million out of the
prefecture's 3.82 million people lived with a per capita annual
income of less than 500 yuan (about 60 U.S. dollars), with the per
capita grain production less than 400 kilograms annually.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made poverty relief in the
prefecture a high priority. From 1994 to now, the central
government and governments at all levels in Sichuan Province have
allocated 33 million yuan (about 3.97 million U.S. dollars) to help
more people shake off poverty in the prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Financial Distress Dampens Economic Recovery in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bad economic news in the second quarter
of 1998 has cast a shadow on the relatively promising outlook for the
Russian economy at the beginning of the year, according to a United
Nations survey published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The weak signs of recovery began to fade with the publication of
zero growth figure for the first quarter," said the UN Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) in its Economic Survey of Europe. "The
April figures did not show any improvement and confirmed that GDP had
remained flat in the first four months of the year."
</P>
<P>
"Financial turmoil culminated in the last week of May when the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation raised its refinancing rate to
the crisis level of 150 percent as a last resort to defend the
currency," said the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration of the economic situation in 1998 is at least
partly due to the sharp fall of commodity prices which has led to a
substantial fall in export revenues,"said the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact of this fall is not confined to the corporate
sector but also affects Russia's external balances and the public
finances," it said.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE admitted that the outlook for the Russian economy was
not at all clear when the report was written. "Russian financial
markets continue to be characterized by a high degree of volatility,
and considerable uncertainties about the future remain," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Although this latest crisis was confined to the financial markets,
it does reflect a number of persistent and fundamental problems in the
Russian economy and these seem to have been the main cause of the
turmoil despite an apparent contagion effect from the Asian crisis,"
it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the UN/ECE expressed hope that Russia would move
ahead with a coherent and comprehensive program of institutional reform
in which the reorganization of the fiscal system should be the top
priority in order to realize financial, and thus macro-economics and
political, stabilization in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Continued Fall of Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in Nigeria
dropped to 6.2 percent in May, three percentage points less than
that of April, according to the Federal Office of Statistics
(FOS).
</P>
<P>
FOS, the federal agency responsible for compilation,
processing and dissemination of statistical information, also
projected that all things being equal, the inflation rate for
June would be six percent.
</P>
<P>
The continued fall of inflation rate, to economic watchers
here, seems to confirm that the government may have succeeded in
its determination to curtail the general price level.
</P>
<P>
The government said in the 1998 budget that it planned to
bring down the inflation level to nine percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Through the regime of tight fiscal policy measures, the
Nigerian government has been able to bring inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact, economists and economic watchers generally
insist that the figure should not be taken as a good measure of
the health of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Government has done well by substantially bringing down the
inflation level, but it needs to be said that the purchasing
power of consumers is still very low while manufacturing
warehouses are still full of unsold goods," the newspaper This
Day reported Tuesday, quoting an unnamed analyst.
</P>
<P>
To many analysts, with crippling fuel crisis pervading the
greater part of the year and the current political crisis which
have slowed down economic activities, the government may have
difficulties in achieving its projected growth target for this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, in its 1998 budget, targets a growth
rate of 5.5 percent for this year, compared with 3.77 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FOS officials also expressed fears that with the
slow start of rainfall this year, agricultural production has
been affected and this may contribute to a slowdown of the
economy.

<HEADLINE> SA Minister Expected in Zambia on Kaunda's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense Minister Joe
Modise is expected in Zambia Tuesday to discuss with the Zambian
government on the expected retirement from party politics of
former President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's eldest son, Panji Kaunda, said here Monday that he
was not aware of Modise's coming, Times of Zambia reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was still holding negotiations with the
government on his father's retirement package.
</P>
<P>
"We as the family are still negotiating for the old man's
retirement package and so far everything is going on very well,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that kaunda's family has proposed that the government
offer state lodge as Kaunda's residence.
</P>
<P>
The family has sidelined the United National Independence
Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda from the negotiations because it does
not want to confuse the issue with partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
Panji Kaunda said "UNIP is in opposition and we do not want to
use it to fight for the old man's retirement package...this is a
family issue and we will do it ourselves."
</P>
<P>
He said his father's name will be kept away from the political
limelight for the next four or more years so that peace could
return to the family.
</P>
<P>
He said he has requested that all of his father's aides stop
from operating at Kalundu House to create a homely atmosphere at
the house, where Kaunda's family is staying.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the government will move quickly to find an
office for the former president so all other political,
professional and career activities could be done away from home.
</P>
<P>
Four days after his release from under house arrest last month
Kaunda announced that he will quit party politics so that he can
serve the nation and the continent on a wider scope.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said that he will step down from politics at the next
extra-ordinary national congress of UNIP.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda had been the country's president since its independence
in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by current President
Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 74, was detained on December 25 last year for alleged
involvement in last October 28 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Six days after his arrest he was put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
In February this year he was formally charged with misprision
of treason.
</P>
<P>
After Kaunda's release South African President Nelson Mandela
who mediated the release expressed his hope that Chiluba will not
stop there so that he can make it possible for other leaders to
persuade Kaunda not to continue in party politics.

<HEADLINE> Import of Overseas Agro-Technology Pays Off in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang, a leading grain
producer in northeast China, has succeeded in raising the ratio of
science and technology in agricultural development to 30 percent
by introducing advanced agronomy practices from abroad, sources
with the Provincial Foreign Experts Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Because of rough cultivation and the use of poor seed strains,
the grain output of Heilongjiang had lingered around 10 billion
kilograms for many years, they said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the early 1980s, the provincial government each
year invited 200 foreign agricultural experts to give lectures or
pass on up-to-date agro-technology to their Chinese partners and
sent the same amount of Chinese agro-technicians to study abroad,
said Zhang Yichang, director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province invited two Japanese rice specialists to guide
rice cultivation with sparse-planting technology on dry land,
which increased the per unit output by 10-to-20 percent compared
with ordinary cultivation methods.
</P>
<P>
It has also imported high-yield wheat strains and virus-free
and tobacco flue-cured technologies from Canada, sugar beet
breeding technology from Japan and seed-coating technology from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
As a result, its annual grain output soared to 30 billion
kilograms. The economic results it gained from importing overseas
agronomy techniques in the past decade has surpassed 10 billion
yuan, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Urged to Continue Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Assembly
members-elect have commended the new leadership's wide
consultations on the country's political future but kicked
against any attempt to abort the current transition program due
to end on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The members made clear their positions on key national issues
in a statement adopted at a meeting held last Saturday in Abuja
and carried on major national newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The members commended the commitment of the new leader General
Abudulsalam Abubakar to continue the transition program as he
said in his maiden national broadcasting on June 9.
</P>
<P>
They hailed the magnanimity of the government in releasing
some political detainees and called for the release of all
political detainees, including Moshood Abiola, the presumed
winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The members, however, claimed that the current consultation by
the Abubakar government is incomplete as it ignored members of
the Local Government, Members-elect of the State and National
Assembly totalling about 11,500.
</P>
<P>
The said members were elected during previous elections held
under the transition program started by late military leader Sani
Abacha and inherited by Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The members stressed that the elections have been adjudged to
be free and fair by the government as well as reputable
international observers.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the cancellation of any election as a
solution to any political crisis will always result in the
consequence of exacerbating the crisis, as proven in the example
of the June 12 election, which is "undoubtedly the major cause of
the current political impasse in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
The members cautioned that it will be a mockery of Nigeria
before the international community if the government aborts the
current transition program as a product of the consultation
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The members maintain that all political structures and
transition agencies already existing should be retained and that
all Nigerians, including those who felt left out should be
encouraged to join the existing parties.
</P>
<P>
"We identify with and accept the resolve of this Government to
terminate on 1st October, 1998 and hand over to a democratically
elected government," the members said.
</P>
<P>
"For the avoidance of doubt, we the elected members of the
National Assembly, from all the five political parties fervently
stand by out mandate as it is representative of the true wishes
of all Nigerians," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Cheap Power May Become History in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa looks set to
lose its status as having one of the cheapest electricity prices
in the world, Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 16 countries showed that South Africa's
electricity prices for business and industrial consumers rose by
5.61 percent in the year ended April 1998. This was the third
year running that South Africa registered the steepest rise among
the countries surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The annual National Utility Services survey showed that 10 of
the 16 countries saw a drop in prices, such as the United States,
Britain and Germany. Swedish consumers benefit most with a fall
of 9.79 percent in the country's power prices.
</P>
<P>
South Africa provides its consumers with electricity at 17.49
cents (three U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
But experts said this is unlikely to last much longer as the
state power utility, Eskom, is heading for commercialization.
</P>
<P>
Sales and marketing manager for the survey, Tommy Taylor, said
the Eskom Amendment Bill recently approved by the National
Assembly would be a catalyst for price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The bill means Eskom will become a limited liability company
paying taxes and dividends - from which it is currently exempt.
</P>
<P>
Eskom may have to increase prices to help fund its commitment
to provide power to 75 percent of the population by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The electricity utility may also have to increase its capital
expenditure in the coming years should its overcapacity dwindle
in the face of the ongoing expansion of its grid to meet its
electrification commitments.
</P>
<P>
An Eskom managing director said earlier that the utility's
revenue growth was projected at 1.8 percent in the year to
December, down from the 9.4 percent rise last year. He said the
volatility in commodity markets is threatening Eskom's sales.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said government was still talking with municipalities,
the national electricity regulator, large users and Eskom on the
restructuring of the electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
"But everything points to much more expensive power," he said.

<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered U.S. government
delegation headed by Thomas Pickering, the Under-Secretary of
State for Political Affairs arrived in Nigerian capital Abuja
Monday night for talks with the new leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Others in the team are Susan Rice, the Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs, and General James Jefferson of the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Pickering told the media upon arrival that his party will talk
with Abubakar the future of Nigeria as well as bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Pickering's visit is part of the international consultations
on Nigeria's transition to democracy following the death of late
military leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
A European Union delegation headed by the British Foreign
Office Minister Tony Lloyd, the Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaoku and the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had earlier held consultations with
the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had suggested sending a delegation to Nigeria shortly
before Abacha's death on June 8, but Nigeria insisted that it
could only receive the delegation after the U.S. lifts its visa
ban on senior Nigerian officials.

<HEADLINE> Booming Southern China Backs HK Shipping Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official said here
Tuesday that the rapid economic growth in southern China would be
strong backing for Hong Kong to maintain its position as a
regional shipping center.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address at the Tripartite Shippers' Councils
meeting, Stephen Ip, secretary for economic services, said, "Hong
Kong is fortunate enough to be situated right next to the Pearl
River Delta, one of the fastest growing economic areas in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Ip noted that the strong export and import demand of the
numerous manufacturing centers in the Pearl River Delta has
supported the rapid growth of Hong Kong as the main port for South
China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been the world's busiest container port for six
years in a row, handling 14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units
(TEUs) of containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also the world's largest international air freight
center. The old Kai Tak Airport handled 1.79 million tons of cargo
in 1997, while the new Chek Lap Kok airport, opened for commercial
aviation on Monday, is able to handle up to 3 million tons of
cargo each year at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary for economic services, Hong Kong
will start to construct a new container terminal, CT 9, later this
year and the first berth is expected to come into use in late
2001. With six berths, the new terminal is designed to handle 2.6
million TEUs when it is fully completed in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now is building its first river trade terminal to
handle the increasing volumes of cargo from southern China.
Starting from October 1998, the terminal will go into operation in
phases and will eventually handle 1.3 million TEUs of containers a
year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together three of the most influential
shippers bodies in Asia, namely the Hong Kong, Japan and South
Korea Shippers' Councils.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is witnessing the
emergence of some innovative use of the Internet, Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting K. C. Kwong of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that there is tremendous potential for
the further development of electronic commerce (e-commerce) in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The reason is simple, we have an excellent communications
backbone on which business applications could be built," Kwong
told a telecommunications and information technology forum.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the development of such business applications on
the Internet in Hong Kong, Kwong said, it is important for the SAR
government to provide the right environment.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, the government should take the lead in
using the Internet for the delivery of public services on-line,
known as Electronic Service Delivery.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is simply to create an environment and to provide a
ready access means to pump-prime the development of electronic
commerce in Hong Kong," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Bring $4.27m to Zanzibar in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) - A total of 86,495 tourists
visited Zanzibar in 1997, bringing 4.27 million U.S. Dollars
revenue to the government, the Minister for Information, Culture,
Tourism and Youth Development has said.
</P>
<P>
Issa Mohammed Issa told Monday the Zanzibar House of
Representatives, which is in session for debating the 1998/99
budget, that the number of visitors has increased from 69,159 and
the income from 1.66 million U.S. Dollars in 1996, Tanzanian
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He asked the House to endorse a total of 1,420,959,000
Shillings (about 2.153 million U.S. Dollars) for both recurrent
and development expenditure for the 1998/99 fiscal year which is
being on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise in the numbers to concerted efforts to
market the isles abroad by the Tourists Commission, pledging to
make more efforts to consolidate the tourism infrastructure by
upgrading roads, controlling beach erosion and improving
management.
</P>
<P>
Issa also said that the privatization of state-run hotels will
be sped up to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The (Tanzanian) Union and Zanzibar governments have agreed in
principle to privatize the ailing Furaha ya Visiwani Hotels
Limited to bail the company out of its present financial
quagmire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lying in the west of the Indian Ocean and 40 kilometers off
the mid-Tanzanian coast, Zanzibar consists of Unguja, its sister
island Pemba and dozens of small isles. It is famous for the
Arab-style Stone Town, the widely planted cloves and beautiful
beaches.

<HEADLINE> State Development Bank Reports Marked Growth in Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (SDB), a
policy-oriented bank designed to finance the infrastructure and
primary industries in China, issued 53 billion yuan (about 6.4
billion U.S. dollars) in loans during the first six months of this
year, up 19 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The notable growth actually reponds to a national call for
increasing bank loans to infrastructure to ensure an annual
economic growth of eight percent, according to the SDB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The bank has adopted a series of special measures this year to
secure sufficient and timely loans for infrastructure projects,
including revising its loan-extension plans and signing
preliminary loan agreements with some loan recipients having good
repayment records and financial strength.
</P>
<P>
The bank has increased its loan credit line for the first six
months this year to 53.9 billion yuan, a rise of 24 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank originally planned to extend 100 billion yuan in loans
in 1998, but later revised it to 120 billion yuan in response to
the government's demand for an increase in bank loans to offset
the impact of the Asian financial crisis on the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Some profitable projects also enjoyed a simplified
loan-application process and received early loans by signing
preliminary contracts with the SDB.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged To Be More Aware of Disastrous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong has called upon the nation to be more aware of its uniqueness
and the disastrous affects of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony of launching the National Education
Exhibition Tuesday, the Prime Minister said the exhibition seeks
to make Singaporeans more aware of the uniqueness of the country
and highlights a must to learn the nation's history that many
young Singaporeans are unaware.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the current situation, he said that Singapore has
been relatively unaffected by the Asian currency crisis which he
described like "a bolt from the blue."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the crisis "dramatically transformed a stable
and rapidly growing region to one fraught with grave uncertainty
and instability."
</P>
<P>
He said that as "Asia is facing a meltdown, How can Singapore
preserve itself, and escape disaster?"
</P>
<P>
The crisis is a timely reminder that challenges can arise
unexpectedly, he said.
</P>
<P>
On display at the nearly month-long exhibition are historical
documents, publications, pictures and material objects to show the
island-state's modern history from the time of the colonial rule
to the present.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 participants including a number of government
ministers attended the inaugural ceremony of the exhibition, the
first large-scale show of its kind in the country.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Yield Expected to Rise in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's coffee production is
expected to rise to 25,000 tons in 1998/99 (August/July) from
20,000 tons in the previous year, according to a report issued
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Improved husbandry and a rising availability of fertilizer and
pesticides were helping to boost production, Barthelemy Niyikiza,
the chief of the Burundi Coffee Office (OCIBU), was quoted by a
report from the Kenya Times newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers who were formerly displaced by insecurity in the
tiny central African nation were able to return to their fields
last year and resume tending previously abandoned coffee trees,
said Niyikiza.
</P>
<P>
"The quality and quantity of the 1998/99 crop will be higher
than last year because there has been better maintenance and we
have been able to distribute fertilizer and treat trees with
pesticides," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In previous years, many farmers were displaced and could not
work their fields, so the coffee was not maintained and the trees
were abandoned," he said, "Now the peasants have started to
return to their fields."
</P>
<P>
Officials at OCIBU, the state-run organization responsible for
selling Burundi's crop of mostly Arabica coffee, said the 1998/99
crop was being harvested and sales would probably start in
August.
</P>
<P>
Coffee production in the country reached a peak of 41,000 tons
in 1994/95, but has steadily declined since then because of a
civil war that has claimed an estimated 150,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Output levels were further sapped when neighboring countries
imposed a trade embargo on the land-locked nation in mid-1996 to
punish a military coup.
</P>
<P>
The embargo cut off access to pesticides and fertilizer, but
OCIBU officials say those supplies are arriving again.
</P>
<P>
Niyikiza said OCIBU would start treating trees with pesticides
and begin distributing fertilizer this month in the hope of
boosting production for the 1999/2000 crop, forecast at 30,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Coffee brings in more than 80 percent of Burundi's foreign
exchange revenues. The majority of Burundi's coffee is grown in
the north and west of the country, with most exports going to
Europe and the Untied States.

Industrials Index (STII) dropped 12.32 points to 1115.18.
</P>
<P>
Turnover totaled 87.92 million shares, valued at 168.04 million
Singapore dollars (about 98.32 million U.S. dollars). There were
189 losers against 78 gainers while 322 stocks remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBF Cap was the most active stock which closed on a turnover of
10.47 million units. DBS Land had 6.35 million counters done.
TchongInthk was next with 6.26 million shares changing hands.

down 40 cents to end at 9 Singapore dollars and Robinson 24 cents
to close at 4.2 Singapore dollars.

<P>
Dealers said shares were lower as concerns lingered on among
players that the Singapore dollar might continue to be pressured
by fears of heavy investment losses by a member of the Brunei
royal family.
</P>
<P>
They also said concerns over Japan's reforms, notably its tax
reforms, also continued to discourage the market.
</P>
<P>
Commentators said shares were battered from their morning highs
to a lower close after Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Singapore
was likely to slide into a recession in 1999.
</P>
<P>
They said Goh's comments affected the sentiment in the stock
market and sent the Singapore dollar sliding back toward the 1.7
to one U.S. dollar level.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (xinhua) -- Former Dutch player Arnold Muhren said
the secret of the Dutch team's success in France'98 is ball possession.
</P>
<P>
Muhren said the Dutch team have proved that they can beat the
best team by defeating Argentina in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"Holland have done very well so far. If they can beat Argentina,
they can defeat anybody, even Brazil," Muhren said:"But they must
play their own game."
</P>
<P>
Muhren said:"They are a very good possession side. They like to
have the ball and keep the ball. From there they like to try and reach
Dennis Bergkamp and Kluivert, and they must do the same thing against
Brazil."
</P>
<P>
Muhren said he believed the semi-final would be a stage for
Bergkamp to stamp his mark on the World Cup finals:"Dennis has been
relatively quiet, even though he had a big hand in the two goals
against Argentina. But we all know he can play better than he has
done in the last couple of games."

investors still sought the safe haven of banks, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries closed up 17.5 points, or 0.64 percent, at

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
aimlessly Tuesday in the wake of the long weekend in the United
States and a lack of firm reform news from Japan.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, the Australian dollar closed
little changed Tuesday, only marginally higher at 61.62 U.S. cents
from Monday's close of 61.56 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Peter Whitley, foreign exchange manager of Australia's Colonial
State Bank, said trading was very light as the foreign exchange
market went back into "hold mode."
</P>
<P>
"Japanese yen volumes were the lowest in about two months today
so it is not just Aussie, it is every currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corp. Tuesday said it expected the besieged
Australian currency to crash through its record post-float low of
57.1 U.S. cents, reached in July 1986, to 55 U.S. cents during the
September quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Westpac's General Manager of economics Bill Evans said a
continued fall in commodities prices over the next six months
would be the negative factor for the unit.
</P>
<P>
"As markets become more disillusioned with Japan's lack of
commitment to genuine structural reform, the Australian dollar
will again come under pressure, due to further deterioration in
the commodity outlook," Evans said.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was buying 86.15
Japanese yen from 86.41 yen and 1.1177 German marks from 1.1187
marks.

<HEADLINE> People's Bank of China Bans Lottery-Attached Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
issued a circular today demanding all commercial bank and postal
savings banks to stop rewarded savings business, or a kind of
saving business attached with lottery.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the PBOC, this move is aimed to
standardize the operations of commercial banks, eliminate the
phenomenon of attracting savings with high interest, protect
depositors' legal rights and interests, and promote the service
quality of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The circular demanded all commercial banks and credit
cooperatives to stop rewarded savings immediately.
</P>
<P>
This type of savings was first initiated in 1950 and was
stopped by the PBOC in 1960. Some financial institutions renewed
this practice in 1980 and the PBOC has since formulated some
relative rules.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC noted that the lottery-attached
savings have had some positive impact on the banking
industry. However, with the deposit business increasingly
competitive, various problems have arisen from rewarded deposits,
the spokesman said, leading to the decision to stop the business.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Harness Ulan Buh Desert Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Full-scale efforts are underway in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to harness the Ulan
Buh Desert which was formerly the source of 150,000 cu.m. of sand
entering the Yellow River each year.
</P>
<P>
Shifting sand from the Ulan Buh (Mongolian words meaning red
bull) Desert also intruded and buried 250 hectares of nearby
farmland annually. The desert, the eighth largest in China, covers
one million hectares in the Bayannur League in western Inner
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
A group of agricultural and forestry production and research
organizations, including six state-owned farms, have been formed
since the 1960s to tame the raging "red bull". However, the
large-scale campaign to harness the desert has only been in place
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In late 1996, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region formed a
special leading group responsible for harnessing and developing
the Ulan Buh Desert in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region adopted an comprehensive plan to harness
the desert based on academic papers prepared by a group of
specialists sent to conduct research and devise execution measures.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the desert control effort will transform
120,000 hectares of wasteland into cultivatable fields which will
produce an additional 440 million kg of grain and provide jobs for
80,000 surplus rural laborers, according to one desert control
expert.
</P>
<P>
The desert's forest cover will rise from the current 2.6
percent to 22.9 percent, the expert noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, related local governments have drafted wide-ranging
preferential policies to encourage desert control projects, with
related policies effectively attracting farsighted investors.
</P>
<P>
So far, approximately 30 Chinese and foreign investors have
provided investments of more than 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars) for desert control and development efforts. Investors are
currently engaged farming and animal husbandry enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's gold output this year is
expected to exceed 160 tons, Wang Dexue, head of China's Gold
Administration, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Gold production in China in the first five months of this year
was 28.3 percent higher than the same period last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China's actual gold output last year was 166.3
tons, making China the fifth largest gold-producing country after
South Africa, the United States, Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
China's production of gold has grown steadily for the past 20
years, with a yearly growth rate exceeding 10 percent, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the increase in China's gold production to the
decline of gold prices in recent years which forced increased
production to maintain economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said that low gold prices also led non-government
enterprises to sell more gold to the state.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the cooperation between China and overseas
business people in the field of gold industry will be further
enhanced in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Solid Thuram Big Key to French Team Defence Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The French team have conceded just a
penalty goal by Michael Laudrup in the World Cup finals and that
owed a lot to the solid right back Lilian Thuram.
</P>
<P>
Thuram is defensively solid and alert though rarely spectacular.
He can go forward fluidly, rarely squanders possession, passes
intelligently and gets back to cover well in defense. Only Cafu of
Brazil can boast himself a better wing-back at the France'98 World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Thuram can play in the center of defense or as a defensive
midfielder. But in his 37 international matches, he mostly played
as a right-back.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asia Software Exhibition Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Software Development Asia
'98 (SDA '98) exhibition-cum-conference opened here Tuesday with
the theme of "Creating Waves in Asia's Software Development
Industry."
</P>
<P>
The economic uncertainty in the region does not seem to have
dampened support for the three-day event which has attracted a
record 42 local and foreign exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors put on show 60 products which may be of special
interest to applications, software, web and multimedia developers,
system administrators, applications developers, programmers,
software engineers and other information technology (IT)
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Opening the SDA '98, Malaysia's Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding called upon software
developers to intensify their efforts to capture the local market
for packaged software for which sales are expected to grow at an
annual rate of 17.4 percent until the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the software market in Malaysia is lucrative despite
the economic gloom and the growth rate itself should result in a
final sales figure of 664.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Malaysia imports close to 2 billion
ringgit (about 500 million dollars) worth of software a year.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we in Malaysia must condition ourselves to assume
the lead in the production rather than just the consumption of
software," he said.
</P>
<P>
Funding for software development is also made available in
Malaysia through the Industry Grant Scheme (IGS) which is
allocated 100 million ringgit (about 25 million dollars), the
Multimedia Grant Scheme (MGS) with 50 million ringgit (about 12.5
million dollars) and Demonstrator Application Grant of 50 million
ringgit (about 12.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total software market for the Asia Pacific region is
estimated at about 26 billion ringgit (about 6.341 billion
dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Goal-keeper to Answer Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Croatian goal-keeper Drazen Ladic has
conceded only one goal in the World Cup finals but were still rated
the worst among the four goal-keepers left in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Former Scotland goal-keeper Bob Wilson said Ladic is the worst
of the four goal-keepers after Dutch Edwin van der Sar, Brazilian
Claudio Taffarel and Frenchman Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
"Ladic is perhaps the most flawed of the remaining four keepers.
Goal-keeping is about consistency and it is the crucial feature
which he lacks." said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
But the 35-year-old Croatian veteran has a chance to hit back at
the criticism when his team play against hosts France in Wednesday's
semi-final match at Saint-Denis.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Officials Discuss Tensions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian and Israeli
officers have held talks on defusing tensions in the Gaza Strip
after last week's standoff between Israeli troops and Palestinian
police, Israel Radio reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security chief in Gaza Mohammed Dahlan and head of
Israeli army's Southern Command Yom Tov Samia discussed for four
hours Monday night in Beersheba, southern Israel, on ways of
opening roads closed by Israel in the Gaza Strip to Palestinian
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Sources attending the meeting said the two sides reached an
understanding on several issues, though not an agreement.
</P>
<P>
They said the Palestinians and Israel agreed to tour the
disputed coastal road near the Gush Katif Jewish settlement in the
south of the Gaza Strip before deciding on any agreements.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Dahlan told reporters in Gaza that he was
hoping to seek a settlement that would allow the Palestinians to
freely use the coastal road.
</P>
<P>
The tensions began last Thursday when Palestinian police and
civilians blocked access to the settlement to protest against
Israeli closure of a section of the coastal road.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the standoff, Israel sent tanks and armored
personnel carriers to reinforce key positions while Palestinian
police took fortified positions a short distance away.
</P>
<P>
The two sides ended the standoff Friday after intensive
mediation by the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip said on Monday
that if the Israeli army opens the coastal road to the
Palestinians, they will respond by blocking roads in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it closed some roads in the Gaza Strip,
including the coastal road, merely for "security reasons." The
Palestinians have strongly opposed the move, which they said has
violated the agreements signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the
standoff was "a provocative act from the Palestinian side." The
Palestinians, in return, have accused Israel of "preparing for
war."

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Sets Conditions for Water to Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday that his country has agreed in
principle to supply water to Singapore but with conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We have assured them that we will give them the water but
there must be conditions to supplying water," he told a press
conference after opening a two-day international conference on
corporate governance here.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the conditions, Mahathir said, "In principle
we have reached agreement. We just couldn't reach agreement on the
details."
</P>
<P>
"As you know, even between the states in Malaysia it's so
difficult to resolve the problem of supplying water from one state
to another," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was asked to comment on his meeting with his Singapore
counterpart, Goh Chok Tong, here in February during which they
reportedly discussed the water supply issue.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar told the parliament
last week that several outstanding issues in Singapore-Malaysia
bilateral relations remained unresolved, including the water
supply issue in which Singapore was reported to have sought
legally binding conditions when the present two agreements expire
in 2011 and 2061.
</P>
<P>
Singapore gets about half of its daily water needs from
Malaysia's Johor State under the two existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "Points of agreement are points of agreement but
treaties are different matters. The points of agreement have yet
to be ratified. We don't ratify them either at the cabinet level
or at the parliamentary level. This involves relations of two
countries and we cannot just change treaties without reference to
parliament."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the water supply issue was related to the
Singapore Central Provident Fund (CPF) issue involving about
200,000 Malaysians working in Singapore, Mahathir said he could
not see how the two issues could be related.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday the Malaysian cabinet urged Singapore to allow
peninsular Malaysians, who no longer worked in the republic or
were retrenched, to withdraw their savings from the CPF which
reportedly is holding more than 1 billion ringgit (about 250
million U.S. dollars) in Malaysian workers' savings and only
allows peninsular Malaysians full withdrawal upon reaching 55
years of age. However, those from Sabah and Sarawak, East
Malaysia, can withdraw their savings upon completion of employment
contracts in Singapore.

while doctors are encouraged to replace traditional medecines
with genetic products, which are less expensive.

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- French team doctor warned his team not
to play another extra-time in the semi-final match against Croatia
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If they play extra-time again, it will be difficult for them

be 100 percent for 90 minutes. But if they have to play for longer
than that they might tire."
</P>
<P>
France have played extra-time in their last two matches at the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"It has been easier for the players to recuperate after the
Italy match. I was surprised to see how quickly they got rid of the
physical strain," said Ferret.
</P>
<P>
Ferret said all the players, including Emmanuel Petit and Youri
Djorkaeff who suffered slight injury, will be fit for the semi-final
match scheduled on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hui Nationality and Islamic Studies Thrive in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The study of the Chinese Hui
nationality and the culture of Islam has made great advances in
many fields of research during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
China has now more than 10 research institutes and several
hundred scholars engaged in the study of the Hui nationality, said
Yu Zhengui, an authority on the Hui nationality and president of
the Ningxia Academy of Social Sciences, adding that a number of
masters and doctorate degrees have been awarded in this field.

</P>
<P>
As China's sole provincial-level autonomous region of the Hui
nationality, Ningxia has formed a special institute specializing in
the study of the Hui nationality and Islam.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the research staff has delivered 500 theses

various aspects besides Islam, covering ethnic customs,
architecture, medicine, population, language and sports, with a
large number of publications now available.

<HEADLINE> Booming Southern China Backs HK Shipping Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official said here
Tuesday that the rapid economic growth in southern China would be
strong backing for Hong Kong to maintain its position as a
regional shipping center.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address at the Tripartite Shippers' Councils
meeting, Stephen Ip, secretary for economic services, said, "Hong
Kong is fortunate enough to be situated right next to the Pearl
River Delta, one of the fastest growing economic areas in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Ip noted that the strong export and import demand of the
numerous manufacturing centers in the Pearl River Delta has
supported the rapid growth of Hong Kong as the main port for South
China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been the world's busiest container port for six
years in a row, handling 14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units
(TEUs) of containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also the world's largest international air freight
center. The old Kai Tak Airport handled 1.79 million tons of cargo
in 1997, while the new Chek Lap Kok airport, opened for commercial
aviation on Monday, is able to handle up to 3 million tons of
cargo each year at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary for economic services, Hong Kong
will start to construct a new container terminal, CT 9, later this
year and the first berth is expected to come into use in late
2001. With six berths, the new terminal is designed to handle 2.6
million TEUs when it is fully completed in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now is building its first river trade terminal to
handle the increasing volumes of cargo from southern China.
Starting from October 1998, the terminal will go into operation in
phases and will eventually handle 1.3 million TEUs of containers a
year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together three of the most influential
shippers bodies in Asia, namely the Hong Kong, Japan and South
Korea Shippers' Councils.

<HEADLINE> Internet Stock Boom Creates Another Billionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, a
Chinese-American, reached billionaire status Tuesday as a result
of Internet stock boom.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 29, became the latest Net executive to gain entry into
the billionaire boys club as Yahoo's opening price climbed to 178.875
U.S. dollars. He holds 5.7 million shares, or a 12.2 percent
stake in the Silicon Valley company.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo's other co-founder, David Filo, was just one step ahead
of Yang into the club. The 32-year-old executive, who holds nearly
5.9 million Yahoo shares, reached billionaire status last week.
</P>
<P>
The company's stock has been on a rocket ride since early June,
when it traded slightly above 100 dollars a share. In fact, it
repeatedly has set new 52-week highs, with Tuesday marking the
latest peak.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Former Star Reveals Secret of Dutch Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (xinhua) -- Former Dutch player Arnold Muhren said
the secret of the Dutch team's success in France'98 is ball possession.
</P>
<P>
Muhren said the Dutch team have proved that they can beat the
best team by defeating Argentina in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"Holland have done very well so far. If they can beat Argentina,
they can defeat anybody, even Brazil," Muhren said:"But they must
play their own game."
</P>
<P>
Muhren said:"They are a very good possession side. They like to
have the ball and keep the ball. From there they like to try and reach
Dennis Bergkamp and Kluivert, and they must do the same thing against
Brazil."
</P>
<P>
Muhren said he believed the semi-final would be a stage for
Bergkamp to stamp his mark on the World Cup finals:"Dennis has been
relatively quiet, even though he had a big hand in the two goals
against Argentina. But we all know he can play better than he has
done in the last couple of games."

<HEADLINE> Don't Politicize Mines Sale, Trade Union Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Congress of Trade Union
President Fackson Shamenda has warned that the privatization of
the country's main foreign exchange earner, copper mines, should
not be politicized because doing so will be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted him as saying here on Monday
that Zambians have to take a painful decision on the sale of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and avoid indecision.
</P>
<P>
He said "indecision was what brought our economy down during
the UNIP (former ruling party) era and this mistake must be
avoided at all costs."
</P>
<P>
When selling the mines, market forces have to determine the
pricing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mines are currently at their lowest production and
are a drain on the economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Frederick Chiluba reiterated last Saturday that his
country will sell its copper mines in full value.
</P>
<P>
Zambia discontinued the negotiations last April with Kafue
consortium on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines, which make up
65 percent of the ZCCM assets, over disagreement on the prices of
the two mines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two other foreign mining companies pulled out, citing
falling international copper prices as the main reason for their
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, donors pledged Zambia an aid of 530 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, some donors said recently that they will not release
the pledged aid until ZCCM is privatized because the money ZCCM
is losing equals the amount of the aid the donor community
pledged to give Zambia and that if it is released, it will go to
bailing out the ailing ZCCM.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Doubts Government's Report of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian parliament has cast
doubt on the government's report of the country's high economic
growth, planning a probe into the situation.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has found the government has reported a
situation much higher than those by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said Jordan's economy grew at a rate below 1
percent for 1996 and at 2.5 to 3 percent for 1997, while the
government figures put the two years' rates at 5.2 and 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Economic and Finance Committee at the Lower
House of Parliament Ali Abul Ragheb was quoted by Jordan's
official news agency Petra Tuesday as saying the committee
considers the discrepancies as a "serious issue."
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to convene several meetings in the coming
two weeks with private and public sector officials to discern the
"reality of the economic situation in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a top priority for the parliament," said Ragheb. "We
are not trying to create a scandal out of this issue but to reach
a conclusion on the country's economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find out who is responsible for this and minimize
the negative consequences of this issue," Ragheb added.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Jawad Anani earlier admitted such inconsistencies, but
denied that the government tried to conceal real economic growth
indicators.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Razzaq Bani Hani, director of the research department at
the Jordanian Ministry of Planning, has said that Jordan's
economy declined in real terms in the past two years and the World
Bank's figures are "more reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Hani attributed Jordan's economic decline to the recent
political developments in the region, namely, the deadlock in the
Mideast peace process and the decrease in Jordan's exports to Iraq
and other Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Some private sector representatives have said that such
"serious distortions" could undermine Jordan's credibility,
especially with regard to the 1989-98 economic reform program
structured by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The two international organizations have provided the kingdom
with millions of U.S. dollars in loans and grants under this
program to revive the kingdom's economy.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Malaysia's Growth Target Needs to Be Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday that the
country's 2 to 3 percent growth projection for 1998 needs to be
revised.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention any new figure, saying it would be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
"But the government will try to stimulate the economy by
establishing new funds and through other measures," he told
reporters after officiating at the 1999 budget dialogue with the
theme "Toward Engineering a Speedy and Sustainable Economic
Recovery" here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar hoped that the country would not go to register negative
growth for this year, saying, "We are looking at the figures and
want to know how fast can the (country's latest) stimulus package
be implemented."
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, he said, it is very critical that all agencies
and departments take measures to speed up the implementation of
projects and approvals.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that during the current economic slowdown, daily
meetings were held between him and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
as "we work effectively as one team."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia registered a negative growth of 1.8 percent for the
first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar announced in mid-June a stimulus package, setting aside
7.031 billion ringgit (about 1.793 billion U.S. dollars) as
supplementary budget allocation in an effort to generate real
gross domestic product growth.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor to Apply for Bail in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Kampala City Mayor Nasser
Sebaggalla will apply for his bail in a Boston federal court
Tuesday after his case was shifted there from New York last week.
</P>
<P>
The embattled mayor is hoping that he will be granted leave to
return to Uganda after this detention hearing as he is waiting
for the full trial, the Monitor daily said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala is charged with depositing altered checks worth
329,000 U.S. Dollars in his personal account in Bank Boston as
early as early 1997 and making false statements to Customs
officers about the amount of cash he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to plead not guilty to all the charges against
him, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, expected to be presided over by U.S. Magistrate
Judge, Marianne Bowler, is supposed to determine whether the
mayor should be detained pending his criminal trial later this
year or be allowed to remain under conditions in the United
States or be permitted to return to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Sabaggala was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York
on June 13 when he was to board a flight en route to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Back in Uganda, there is an outcry for his stepping down from
the top position of the capital not only because of this scandal,
but also because of his inadequate academic qualifications
required of the post.
</P>
<P>
He was made mayor in April in a contraversial election in
which he was accused of being unable to speak good English and
not possessing an A level certificate.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural development
program jointly undertaken by Mozambique and South Africa was
hailed as a success, with some unnegligible problems.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was drawn from a preliminary study by the
Research Center of the Mozambican Rural Mutual Aid Association #,
Noticias daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joao Uthui, an official involved in the study said that the
major problem with the program is that there is no clear
definition to the real aim to the program, which is affecting the
coordination between the investors and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Uthui said that the difference in the forms of investment and
income distribution results in unfair participation in the
development of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 local Mozambicans were involved in the development
program jointly undertaken by 25 South African Boer farmers and
25 Mozambican partners.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated by Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano and his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela in May
1996, with 2,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Leading Kenyan Coffee Houses Return to Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight leading Kenyan coffee
houses, suspended from last week's coffee export auction, have
been allowed to return to the weekly auction opening Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Mild Coffee Trade Association (MCTA)
received apologies from the eight members which, according to
industry sources, had criticized the association's performance,
newspapers published here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The management committee, having taken into consideration the
unconditional apologies received from all the suspended members,
decided to lift the suspension," the MCTA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Since the suspensions have been lifted, they will participate
in Tuesday's auction," said a spokesman for the Coffee Board of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The suspended coffee traders were Cetco, C.Dorman, Taylor
Winch, Pati, Ibero Kenya Ltd, Green Coffee, Gourmet and Hans
Sickmuller, according to the MCTA.
</P>
<P>
The row with the MCTA began two months ago when some coffee
houses told a visiting delegate from the International Coffee
Organization (ICO) that their interests were not adequately
represented by the MCTA.
</P>
<P>
The delegate made those views known at a sitting of the ICO
and also argued that those Kenyan trade houses not satisfied with
the MCTA could obtain additional private representation.
</P>
<P>
These views filtered back to the MCTA, which felt deeply
offended. The association wrote to 17 individual companies asking
them to confirm if they share those views. Those which replied in
the affirmative or did not reply were barred from last week's
auction.
</P>
<P>
The market average at last week's coffee auction was posted by
the Kenya Coffee Auctions Ltd at 117.12 U.S. Dollars per bag
weighing 50 kilograms for sale, sharply down from 148.87 Dollars
per bag in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the suspended coffee houses represent about 70
percent of the foreign coffee trade in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's leading producers of quality
premium Arabica coffees.

The 27-year-old Frenchman has played many positions in his career

different positions and it was tough. However now I realize it stood
me in good stead. I have now got defensive awareness and positioning
which helped me progress tactically." said Petit.
</P>
<P>
"I lost two and a half years because of all my positional
problems. But now I'm in top form." said Petit.
</P>
<P>
Petit now plays the left-sided fullback for the French team.

<HEADLINE> France to Recognize Palestinian State: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to recognize a
Palestinian state if it is declared after the interim agreement
between the Palestinians and Israel ends next May, a report on the
Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources in Paris as saying that the decision
was made with a consensus among France's top leaders, including
President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
They said the French leaders have emphasized that a Palestinian
state is first of all a "legitimate result" of the Middle East
peace process and a vested right of the Palestinians under the
principle of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry so far has refused to comment on
the issue, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the ministry has stressed that France has
always been positively looking on the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state, it added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he will declare an
independent Palestinian state next May whether or not a final
peace agreement is reached with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
annex part of the West Bank if the Palestinians take the action.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven security officers and
88 civilians have been killed in bandit and cattle rustling

</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the government show that the 115 people
died in a total of 414 bandit assaults between January 1995 and
May this year, the Kenya Time newspaper reported Tuesday.

pursuing bandits in bomb and land-mine blasts or when their
stations were attacked by gunmen, who at times comprised
militiamen from war-torn Somalia, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The civilians either died after they were shot by bandits or
fell to the crossfire between police and bandits in the vast arid
province.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, three civilians who were acting as scouts for
security officers pursuing bandits in Garissa District, were
slain by bandits who went on to slaughter nine police officers.
</P>
<P>
The official data also indicate that the rate of slaughter of
security officers escalated in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 27 late offices, 14 law enforcement officers were
shot dead in action in Wajir and Garissa districts last year
alone and another four were shot dead this year.

Cumulative economic losses caused by all the bandit attacks
were estimated to reach about 3.8 million Shillings (64,400 U.S.
Dollars), said the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 head of livestocks were taken away by the
rustlers during the period and nearly one-third of them were
recovered later.

<HEADLINE> West Lake Selected As Model Scenic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- West Lake, a famous tourism resort
in Hangzhou, has been selected as one of China's ten model scenic
zones with a higher-degree of civilization and cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which is hemmed in green hills from three sides,
covers 60 square kilometers in the central part of Hangzhou in
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The West Lake Scenic Zone boasts more than 100 scenic sites,
which draw over 12 million domestic visitors and 400,000 tourists
from overseas annually.
</P>
<P>
The local government has extended great efforts since early in
the 1980s to clean the formerly heavily-polluted lake.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the late 1980s, Hangzhou completed a 3,100 meter
diversion pipeline to pump water from the Qiantang River into the
lake. The system has a 300,000 cu.m. daily pumping capacity and
has diverted more than 150 million cu.m. of water since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the area north of West Lake has been transformed
into a scenic corridor stretching three kilometers. The corridor
features six small scenic sites and landscaped areas covering
90,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The city has extended great efforts to both develop the
environment and provide high-quality tourism services. With the
support of the city government, Hangzhou residents have in recent
years aroused several thousand volunteers to involved themselves
into actions to protect greenery in the West Lake area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city government again initiated public welfare
activities to do something to beautify tourists boats and yachts
and tourist spots around the lake, and the lightings on the lake
have been re-aligned this year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Draws Disaster-Toll Reduction Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will complete the
formation of an action plan to reduce the human and economic costs
of natural disasters by June next year, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will include 416 separate disaster control
plans for 340 unions in 16 of the country's 64 districts, which
cover all the cyclone-, flood- and drought-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
Disaster preparedness specialist Khan Chowdhury presented a
draft plan at a workshop held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The disaster action plan is part of the project titled "Support
to Comprehensive Disaster Management."
</P>
<P>
The entire project will cost 210 million taka (about 4.47
million U.S. dollars), which will be jointly financed by the
Bangladesh government and two U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to increase awareness of the risks of natural
calamities and the practical possibilities for reducing human and
economic risks through action at households community union and
sub-district levels.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the plan also aims to improve local warning
dissemination systems in relation to cyclone and flood, and to
implement local plans for evacuation, rescue, relief and initial
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Tropical cyclone, drought and flood are the country's major
natural calamities, which have caused massive losses to the
national economy every year.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 percent of the country's land and 43 percent of its
population were affected during the 1979 drought period and some
10 major tornadoes during 1969-91 claimed thousands of lives in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 died in 1970 in a cyclone alone, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sinopec Incorporates Guangdong Oil Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petrochemical
Corporation (Sinopec), one of China's designated petrochemical
leaders, is continuing to vigorously implement its expansion plan
in south China.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec formally incorporated 116 oil firms in Guangdong
Province in a Monday ceremony held in Guangzhou, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
China is currently implementing a plan to form two major oil
conglomerates -- the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
and the Sinopec. The former will control the exploration and
production of oil and gas, with the latter focusing on production
of petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec Vice-chairman Zhang Jiaren said the new Guangdong
Provincial Petroleum Group Co. will continue the commitment to
supply the local oil products market, the largest market of its
kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The restructed petroleum firms in Guangdong have a total
workforce of 20,000 people, with combined assets of five billion
yuan (602 million US dollars) and sales revenue of 10 billion yuan
(1.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The State Council's reform plan calls for CNPC and Sinopec
to control all of the nation's oil and gas fields, oil refineries,
petrochemical enterprises and fueling stations.
</P>
<P>
The Sinopec's business activities will focus on eastern and
southern parts of the country, with the CNPC concentrating on
northern and western China.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC incorporated all oil companies and fueling stations in
southwest China's Sichuan Province in early June.

<HEADLINE>   Mahathir Calls for New Rules for Firms Resilience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday called for the formulation of new rules,
regulations and laws to improve the resilience of corporations.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the present laws and rules and banking practices tend
to aggravate the problems of corporations during economic turmoil.
These will have to be studied and new sets of rules, regulations
and laws formulated," he told an international conference on
Corporate Governance here.
</P>
<P>
The loss of control over exchange rates and the cross-border
flow of capital are responsible for the financial turmoil now
assailing the countries of East Asia, he said. "The ease with
which currency devaluation accompanied by share depreciation can
distress even the most sound of companies points towards a need
for new rules and regulations as well as laws to improve the
resilience of corporations."
</P>
<P>
The idea is not to help bad companies but to enable good
companies to survive when their failure is not of their own
making, he said, adding that to turn them around and their
survival and profitability is not just for their own but for the
good of the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said the sovereignty of nations in terms of currency and the
movements of capital have now been lost and the free flow which
should bring wealth to the poor countries of the world has now
brought about their impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
Corporate governance must be reviewed and obviously there are
weaknesses which have to be attended to, he said.

<HEADLINE> SriLanka to Start Documenting All Artifacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Archaeological
department, in a bid to put a stop to the loss of archaeological
treasures in the country, will soon start documenting all
artifacts, the department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said records indicate that millions of dollars worth of
artifacts are smuggled out of Sri Lanka annually.
</P>
<P>
Under the department's plan, Dambadeniya in North Western
Province has been selected as the first location for this
exercise. The task will be a long-drawn-out process and may need
at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The government also seeks foreign assistance. Britain will send
two archaeological experts to Sri Lanka to help local experts, and
financial and other types of assistance including equipment will
be available later, the department said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department has purchased equipment worth about
50,000 U.S. dollars for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Stock Market Index Down 42.78 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Caracas Stock Market Index was
down 42.78 percent in the first six months of the year, a market
research company, known as Metroeconomica, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, Metroeconomica said in its monthly report, the
index of the Caracas Stock Market, one of the three in Venezuela,
dropped 19.85 percent from May, and 46.59 percent from June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The index was brought down by the impact of the ongoing
financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the deep plunge of oil
prices at the world market, where Venezuela has a major stake.
</P>
<P>
As the second largest oil producer within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela's oil industry
serves as one of the pillars of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the downturn of Asian economies in October 1997, however,
prices for Venezuelan crude slipped from last year's average 16.49
dollars per barrel to the current level of less than 10 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Given the circumstances, in Asia and on the oil market,
analysts said, the uncertainty in this Latin American country's
stock market is likely to last through 1998, or into early 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian police recovered on Monday
three Van Gogh and Cezanne paintings stolen from the National
Gallery of Modern Art in Rome 48 days ago.
</P>
<P>
While recovering the priceless art works, the police arrested
eight people, including a woman employee of the gallery, in early
morning operations carried out in Rome and Turin.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "a bleeding wound" was closed, Deputy Prime
Minister and Cultural Minister Walter Veltroni told a news
conference that the paintings would be exhibited in the gallery
from Tuesday, still in places where they were stolen.
</P>
<P>
The theft took place on May 19, when masked gunmen bound the
guards and then snatched "The Gardener" and "L'Arlesienne" by Van
Gogh, and "Le Cabanon de Jourdan" by Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the police described the process of retrieving the
stolen paintings a "difficult and risky operation," as they had to
make sure not to damage the works.
</P>
<P>
Besides the paintings, weapons and drugs were also found in the
houses of the arrested suspects, seven of them having previous
crime convictions.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was still under way as eight other people

<P>
YANGON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A national training workshop under a
six-country memorandum of understanding for sub-regional
collaboration on drug control is being held here to strengthen the
capacity of signatory countries in project design and management.
</P>
<P>
The six-country MOU on control of illicit drug trafficking and
abuse in the sub-region, involving China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar,
Thailand and Vietnam as well as the United Nations Drug Control
Program (UNDCP), was initiated in October 1993 at the U.N.

<P>
The seven-day training workshop, which began on Monday, is
sponsored by the Myanmar Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control
and the UNDCP.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, aimed at improving skills of the participants in
project design and management, covers project identification,
formulation and appraisal as well as implementation and
management, the official New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, the six countries' ministerial and senior

<P>
TIRANA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 Albanian soldiers
joined a war game on Sunday in the countery's northern Skurraj and
Burbini regions near Kosovo, of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Codenamed "Skurraj 98," the war game was the fourth and largest
so far this year in Albania, and the only one involving air and
ground forces in combined military operations.
</P>
<P>
The aviation, infantry, artillery, anti-chemical warfare and
special forces were backed by two fighter-bombers, two
helicopters, and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The one-day exercise was aimed at enhancing officers' ability
to carry out military planning, organizing and commanding jobs,
and at promoting the military's capability of combined operations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Fatos Nano, Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga and
Chief of General Staff Aleks Andoni were there to see the exercise.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Hajdaraga told participating soldiers that such
exercise was of special significance at a time when armed clashes
in Kosovo could further escalate in spite of recent peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
in Kosovo, a southern province in the Serb republic of the
Yugoslav Federation, were fighting for independence from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Moves to Ease Credit Squeeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- With greater exchange rate
stability in the past few months, Thailand is moving to ease the
credit crunch in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been holding steady around 41 to the U.S. dollar,
enabling the government to gradually increase liquidity in the
market, said officials from the Bank of Thailand, the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The baht traded on Monday at 39.91/41.70 to the dollar, up
slightly from 41.45/41.55 quoted last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The situation has allowed the Bank of Thailand to buy a
"significant" share of one-year bonds auctioned by the Financial
Institutions Development Fund (FIDF), a move expected to increase
cash availability.
</P>
<P>
The auctioned bonds are worth 10 billion baht (250 million
dollars) in two lots starting late last month. The government says
as much as 500 billion baht (12.5 billion dollars) in long-term
bonds will be sold to help restructure funding costs for the FIDF,
which is now dependent on the short-term market for funds.
</P>
<P>
The fund has run up liabilities exceeding 1.1 trillion baht (27
billion dollars) over the past year from its support for ailing
finance companies and banks. The huge demand for capital has
helped push short-term interest rates upwards, as local financial
institutions lend excess liquidity to the fund through the bond
repurchase market.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the liquidity crunch, Thailand needs 26.1 billion
dollars in capital inflow over the next 12 months. From October
1996 to February this year, Thailand lost 12 billion dollars
through capital flight and over next 12 months, Thailand will have
to repay 6.1 billion dollars of short-term foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Another 8 billion dollars will be needed to repay Bank of
Thailand's swap obligations.
</P>
<P>
In the first bonds auction held by the FIDF, the accepted
yield-to-maturity was 15 percent and fell to 14.7 percent for the
second round last week. Yield bids ranged from 12.75 to 18.75
percent in the first round, and 12.75 percent to 17.5 percent for
the second, according to a statement from Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It said regulators have relied on setting interest rates
through the bond repurchase market as a key instrument in
supporting the baht, as higher interest rates increase the
benefits of holding baht instead of dollars.
</P>
<P>
But greater stability in exchange rates has allowed the central
bank to gradually ease interest rates in the market. Bank
authorities said caution is needed in cutting down rates to avoid
upsetting the baht, spurring capital flight and fueling inflation.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Chatumongol Sonakul said that as exchange
and interest rates stabilize with market forces, the central bank
has greater flexibility to adjust liquidity in the system.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest review by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) gave the green light to the central bank to ease monetary
policies and pump 50 billion baht (1.25 billion dollars) into the
system.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate is moving in a way it should. The central
bank's policy is to pump more money into the system, but it has to
be done gradually and in line with investment demand," Chatumongol
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is some investor demand for money for favorable business
prospects. But overall investment is still depressed while
consumption remains," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF program calls for reserve money to expand to 471
billion baht (11.7 billion dollars) by the end of September, and
505-512 billion baht (12.6-12.8 billion dollars) by the end of
this year. At the end of the first quarter, reserve money was 451
billion baht (11.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Even so, injecting additional funds was only a short-term
measure to ease the credit crunch, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
Given this situation, regulators were proceeding with medium-
and long-term measures to reform the financial system. Open market
operations, where the central bank purchases or sells securities
in the market to manipulate liquidity and interest rates, would
also be developed.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is said to favor using bond market
intervention to help achieve economic targets, a monetary policy
model similar to that used by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has been able to maintain low inflation and develop
a competitive bond market through its model.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Tourism Takes Steep Dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian tourism took a steep
dive with tourist arrivals in the first five months of this year
38 percent less than the same period last year, the Cambodian
Tourism Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said about 83,000 visitors arrived at Pochentong Airport in
the five months, compared with 134,000 visitors in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline is caused by violence in the Southeast Asian
country, particularly in the capital Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has seen a fast growth in Cambodia in recent years,
with 220,000 tourist arrivals in 1996. But growth came to a sudden
halt in July 1997 when fighting broke out between the two
premiers, Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Though industry insiders expects a full recovery of tourism in
October, much depends on the outcome of the July 26 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Tourism operators believe foreign travellers would come back if
stability and security could be restored after the elections. But
their hopes could fail if the elections don't go smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Issue Remains Priority, Says OSCE Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The solution to the Kosovo crisis
has become a priority for the whole international community,
including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said in Sarajevo
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Geremek, who is the present OSCE chairman, told reporters that
the crisis could endanger peace and stability in the whole Balkan
area.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is the first organization to put forward a way to
resolve the crisis in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo
which is acceptable to both Serbian and ethnic Albanian sides,
Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
This solution would confirm the integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia as well as ensuring compliance with the
justified demands of Kosovo ethnic Albanians, especially those
relating to a special status for Kosovo, the Polish foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand an immediate cessation of violence and conflicts,
the beginning of fair negotiations and a debate on the special
status of Kosovo," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Enhances Protection of Wild Animals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ji Xuebing, a farmer in Binchuan
County, southwest China's Yunnan Province, recently discovered
that the eagle's nest on the roof of his house contained five
apparently abandoned fledglings.
</P>
<P>
Ji and his family soon realized that the mother had been
missing for several days and immediately fed the starving birds.
</P>
<P>
The young eagles learned to fly within four months and Ji
decided to set them free in a nearby forest.
</P>
<P>
An official of Yunnan Provincial Protection Center for Wild
Animals noted that local residents exhibit the same concern as Ji
by protecting thousands of wild animals, including wild birds,
bears and elephants.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the province strictly abides by the Law on
the Protection of Wild Animals which prohibits sales of wild
species.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, two men were severely punished for killing wild
elephants in the tropical forests in south China's Xishuangbanna.
</P>
<P>
The care Yunnan citizens show for wild animals can also be seen
in their love for red-bill gulls from Siberia.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of gulls flock to Kunming, the provincial
capital, in both winter and spring. Local residents welcome the
birds with both food and medical care if needed.

<P>
The Yunnan Animal Protection Association has organized
a number of campaigns to promote a greater understanding of the
need to protect and the relationship between human beings and wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province is home to 1,731 vertebrates species, or 54
percent of the total number of related species in China.
</P>
<P>
A number of species, including Asian elephants, golden monkeys,
Indochina tigers and green peacocks, are under world-class
protection.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has opened 108 nature reserves covering 2.02 million
hectares, or five percent of the province's total land area. The
province strictly prohibits hunting in the reserves, according to
a local official.
</P>
<P>
The province also established over a dozen shelters which are
currently providing treatment for more than 20,000 animals or
birds, said one local official, adding that most animals are
eventually set free.
</P>
<P>
Extensive protection efforts have promoted a significant
increase in the number of wild animals, with statistics from
related departments showing that the number of elephants has grown
from 60 only a few years ago to 250 today, the number of golden
monkeys has jumped to over 600 and the population of green
peacocks has surpassed 1,000 birds.

<HEADLINE> Colombia: Eyes on China, Russia for Coffee Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's National
Coffee Federation plans to spend one million U.S. dollars to
promote its market share in China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The funding, said the trade association on Monday, would boost
Colombia's coffee sales in the two countries and help offset the
decreasing demands on the European and U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
While coffee consumption in Europe and the United States is
down 1.4 percent on annual basis, the crop's output is on the rise
worldwide, forcing the association to look for other markets.
</P>
<P>
In China and Russia, where great market potentials are yet to
be tapped, coffee producing countries altogether have already
spent 10 million dollars on promotional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's National Coffee Federation alone contributed one
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In China, the average coffee consumption is one cup per person
a year now. But given the country's large population of over 1.2
billion, the sales will get better.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, average consumption is 131 cups of coffee per year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee producing countries, which consider 1998 as a bad year
with plunging international prices, hope promotions will bring up
their sales in China and Russia to international standards.

<HEADLINE> Measures for Indian Infotech Development Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A special team set up by the
Indian government on May 22 has put forward a series of
recommendations for the development of information technology and
software in the country and set the target of annual software
exports at 50 billion U.S. dollars by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The National Task Force on Information Technology and Software
Development submitted the "IT (information technology) Action
Plan" to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee last Saturday, the
Times of India reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The action plan said infotech is expected to create more than a
million jobs in the next five years when its recommendations are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The suggested measures included introduction of sweat equity to
IT employees, blanket approval for Indian IT firms to acquire
foreign companies and zero duty on all IT products by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
The team also suggested a 100 percent depreciation on all IT
products in two years, tripling of working capital requirements
for industry, an end to Internet access monopoly, Internet access
through cable, introduction of authorized independent service
providers in all districts by 2000 and Internet service to all
schools, polytechnic, colleges and universities by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has already appointed a four-member
ministerial committee comprising the ministers of finance,
information and broadcasting, human resources development and
defense to examine the report by the task force headed by Deputy
Chairman of the Planning Commission Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
The report said the software and IT services industry should be
treated as a priority sector by banks for the next five years,
besides creation of at least four venture capital funds with a
corpus of not less than 500 million rupees (about 12.5 million
U.S. dollars) each to cater exclusively to IT entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Permission could be granted to railways, defense, state
electricity boards, powergrid corporations as well as
organizations to use their fiber optic backbone to provide service
to the public by interfacing existing or new public networks, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The task force also proposed a fund of 7 billion rupees (175
million dollars) to tackle the "Y2K" or year 2000 bug problems in
computers of government organizations, besides recommending that
each ministry or department earmark 1-3 three percent of its
budget to it.
</P>
<P>
The task force, which has made 108 recommendations, was
required to identify bottlenecks for IT development in India and
measures to remove them, and to formulate a draft on the national
informatics policy with the aim of enabling the country to emerge
as an "infotech superpower" in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Software has become one of India's major foreign exchange
earners with 68 billion rupees (about 1.7 billion dollars) worth
of software exports in 1997-98, an increase of 65 percent over the
previous year.

BONN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A German Soccer hooligan was arrested
Monday in Hamburg and charged with the attempted murder of a
French gendarme who is still in a coma after being attacked by
thugs during the World Cup in France, according to reports from
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
Hanover prosecutors said the 24-year-old, named as Tobias R.,
was "strongly suspected" of involvement in the attack on Daniel
Nivel on June 21.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old Nivel was clubbed to the ground and kicked
after a group of around 50 fans ran riot at the end of
Germany-Yugoslavia match in the eastern French town of Lens.
</P>
<P>
Tobias R. was arrested at his home early Monday on charges of
attempted murder and causing serious bodily harm, and of
threatening public order.
</P>
<P>
When questioned, he admitted being in the vicinity of the
attack, but denied being directly involved in the assault on
Nivel. However prosecutors said they had used eyewitness reports
and photographs to identify him.
</P>
<P>
He had been questioned by German police over the incident once
before, but was released due to a lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Tobias R. is the first German hooligan to be charged in Germany
in connection with the attack. Other suspects arrested on the
basis of photographic material were released for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Two other Germans have already been arrested in France over the
attack.

NEW DELHI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government claimed
Monday that there was no change in its basic position on what it
calls the discriminatory nature of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Indian press has indicated lately that the government's
position on the CTBT is shifting from criticism toward
consideration of joining if certain concessions in technology
transfer are secured.
</P>
<P>
The country was currently in the process of conveying this view
to the "key interlocutors," said a major Indian newspaper, the
Hindustan Times.
</P>
<P>
However, the Press Trust of India (PTI), in dismissing the
conclusion as premature, quoted official sources as saying that
India's basic position on the issue "remains unaltered."
</P>
<P>
"We are at the intermediary stage and fully engaged in the
process of dialogue with key interlocutors to come to a mutual and
joint agreement," said the sources. They said India had already
initiated talks with Russia, France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The sources confirmed that Deputy Chairman of the Planning

<HEADLINE> Number of Poor in Jakarta Reaches 1.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor people in the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta is estimated to have risen to 1.4
million, or 14.7 percent of the city's 9.5 million population, The
Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4 million poor people come from 191,776 families, with
each family assumed to consist of seven family members, said
Rusmandesiar, head of the population section of the Central Bureau
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the number of people living below the poverty line in
Jakarta was 497,000, or 5.6 percent of the city's total population
of 8.79 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor in the capital dropped to 231,000 in 1996,
or 2.5 percent of the then population of 9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rise of poor people in the capital, Rusmandesiar
said it was caused mainly by the country's deteriorating economy.
Inflation was running high at above 40 percent in the first half
of this year and forecasts suggest the economy would contract by
15 percent this year.

<P>
A free fall of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar has also
devastated per capita incomes and caused the poverty line to move
upwards, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Central Bureau of Statistics said the
number of poor people in Indonesia has increased from 22.5 million
in 1996 to 79.4 million now due to the monetary crisis gripping
the country since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure would increase to 95.8 million, or about 48 percent
of the country's total population of 202 million by the end of
this year as no economic recovery is in sight, the bureau said.

JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The rare Sambar deer which three
years ago was on the brink of extinction has been successful bred
in Indonesia's East Kalimantan Province, local press reports said
Tuesday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The program began in 1991 with three pairs of deer and now
there are 94 deer roaming on a 1,000-hectare park, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Outside the park, deer of this species, which can weigh up to
200 kilograms, are prized by hunters for their meat," he said,
adding that around 5,000 deer are thought to be killed annually by
hunters.

<HEADLINE> Machine-Building Industry Retains Key Role in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's massive infrastructure
construction efforts and growing automobile production will
significantly increase the demand for machine tools and invigorate
the old machine-building industry, according to He Guangyuan,
former minister of the machine-building industry.
</P>
<P>
During a recent scientific manufacturing seminar in Wuhan, He,
who is currently president of the Chinese Machine-building
Engineering Society, still cited the loss-making machine-building
industry as one of the most vigorous growth points in China's
industrial sector, with an average annual growth rate of 14
percent over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
China's machinery exports yielded about 30 billion U.S. dollars
in foreign exchange revenues for 1997 and accounted for some 20
percent of total exports. China's output of power generating
equipment ranks the fourth in the world, with the output of
machine-tools holding a sixth place ranking.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, large projects, including power stations,
petrochemical plants, ports, transportation systems, steel and
automobile production create a massive demand for machinery and
equipment, he noted. China has more than 120 automotive
manufacturers and over 600 refitting factories.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which makes up 23 percent of the total national
industrial output value, has been honored as the core of Chinese
industry.

environmental issues arising from urban development.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of the kind, would focus on possible
solutions to these problems, so as to lay the ground work for a
program of action for future urban planning worldwide.
</P>

to go up to 70 percent at the end of the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2015, at least 100 mega-cities are expected to
emerge, each home to the population ranging from 5 to 25 million.

<HEADLINE> Individuals Embrace Legal Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Legal consultation used to be
beyond the reach of ordinary Chinese, but is now becoming much
more common, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, China had 11,000 individuals, privately-owned
industrial and commercial enterprises, and contractors who had
hired lawyers as legal consultants, according to statistics from
the Department of Lawyers Administration under the Ministry of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
These three categories make up the clients of China's "family
lawyers," or privately-hired lawyers.
</P>
<P>
These clients come from nearly every part of the country with
Central China's Hunan, Hubei and Henan provinces spearheading the
trend.
</P>
<P>
Though a tiny number compared with the country's huge
population, these 11,000 spell a significant improvement in
Chinese people's legal sense.
</P>
<P>
In China, family lawyers have only appeared in recent years as
the market economy has brought more complicated social
relationships.
</P>
<P>
"The extension of the legal system and the popularization of
laws have improved citizens' legal awareness," said Zhou
Yuansheng, the department's section chief. "They have learnt to
use laws to settle disputes and defend their legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
China restored its lawyers' system in 1979. Nineteen years
later, the country has about 8,400 law firms with over 100,000
lawyers, according to ministry statistics.

</P>
<P>
The 35-year leader of the Federation of Young

SOFIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian and Turkish governments
signed an agreement on Monday which lowers tariffs of industrial
products by 70 percent and aims at fully liberalizing the trade of
industrial products between the two countries by 2002.

It was the most favorable trade agreement by far yet signed by
Bulgaria, he said.
</P>

mossambica and whitebait were practically unheard of in China's
Qinghai Province, but they have now become a regular feature on
the tables there, thanks to events of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The growing business in this plateau area is a dramatic change,

</P>
<P>
The province has used high-tech methods to raise aquatic
products, including a development project financed by the UN Food

</P>
<P>
It also established a fingerling propagation center, and
produces two million carp fingerlings annually and is making an
effort to get a better breeding system for rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
Fishery developers are making the most of local reservoirs, in
addition to ponds, to raise fish, as market demand is still on the
rise, an official of the provincial Aquatic Product Bureau
said.

WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Former welterweight champion
Charles Murray was arrested Sunday after punching two police
officers in a street brawl in Rochester, New York.
</P>
<P>
Murray, 29, was charged with second-degree assault of a police
officer. It was his fourth arrest in four years.
</P>
<P>
Police arrived on the scene to break up a fight involving more
than 150 people. The first officers tried to disperse the fight
using pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Murray was trying to break up the fight, too,
but he was struck on the head with a nightstick by an
officer. Murray punched two officers after that. One officer was
treated for facial injuries at hospital, the other didn't need
medical care.
</P>
<P>
Murray was treated for a cut on his head. He was held without
bail Sunday night until his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
Murray won the IBF welterweight title in 1993, but hasn't had a

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Calls on Japan to Shore up Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan must "move
aggressively and quickly" to rehabilitate its banking sector for
the sake of other crisis-hit Asian economies, said Michel
Camdessus, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the recent fall of Japanese yen "a crisis with the
crisis", he said the new development could seriously jeopardize the
ongoing recovery of the economies that were hit first since the
Asian economic woes began a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"It adds to the market instability that is again affecting
other countries within the region, as well as some countries,
including Russia, outside it," he told a U.N. Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC) forum dealing with the impact of the Asian crisis
on world trade.
</P>
<P>
Turning to recent U.S.-Japan joint intervention to bail out
yen, Camdessus said it would be illusory to consider that only
interventions themselves can bring yen to the proper level.
</P>
<P>
"Interventions are only meaningful when they come in support
and as a harbinger of structural measures that are much more
fundamental which japan has begun to undertake," he said,
referring to reforms providing tax relief by the Japanese
Government.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said it is also vital that countries with balance of
payments surpluses recycle these surpluses in the form of "untied
loans" and humanitarian aid to countries in the process of
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Creditors should grant generous terms for their loans and
should keep their markets open, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Says Kosovo Conflict Impact May Spill over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has warned that the deteriorating situation in Kosovo could
potentially destabilize the entire Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
In a new report to the U.N. Security Council, which was
disclosed by the U.N. Department of Public Information on Monday,
Annan said a new outbreak of violence in Kosovo caused some 6,900
refugees to flee to Albania by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 10,000 people have been internally displaced
within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while approximately
45,000 have been displaced within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He called on the parties concerned to demonstrate restraint and
resume negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I am increasingly concerned that unless hostilities in Kosovo
are stopped, tensions could spill across borders and destabilize
the entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Most of its population are
ethnic Albanians. Over 200 people have reportedly been killed this
year in clashes between Serbian forces and the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army which is seeking independence from Serbia.

<HEADLINE> UN Survey Finds Western Economies Achieve Dynamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations economic survey has
found that the western economies have achieved dynamic growth in
the first half of 1998 despite a deepening economic crisis in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economic developments in the western market economies were
generally positive in the first half of 1998, said the U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) in its Economic Survey of
Europe published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The expected negative effects of the east Asian crisis on net
exports have only gradually started to appear and so far they have
been offset by stronger domestic demand, the UN/ECE said.
</P>
<P>
In North America, the economic expansion has continued at a
high rate. In western Europe, the cyclical recovery has continued
at a moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, the survey said, the economic and social costs of
adjustment to be faced after the turbulence in the financial
markets have become more visible in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A significant deterioration of the economic situation in Japan,
which moved into deep recession, and the associated sharp
depreciation of the yen have seriously dampened prospects for
recovery in the region, according to the UN/ECE survey.

<HEADLINE> Solar Power Markets to Continue Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- World solar markets are growing at
ten times the rate of the oil industry, U.S. Worldwatch Institute
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Solar power has grown at 16 percent annually since 1990
compared to merely 1.4 percent for oil energy growth, the
Washington-based institute said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, sales of solar cells expanded over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Solar power capacity has reached 800 megawatts, representing
only less than one percent of global power supplies.
</P>
<P>
As governments move to implement the Kyoto Protocol on climate
change and replace fossil fuels, solar power is poised to
benefit.
</P>
<P>
The institute said for the 2 billion people worldwide who are
not yet connected to power lines, solar energy is often the most
affordable way to get electricity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Raise Funds for DPRK Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States acknowledged
on Monday that it had not yet raised enough fund to supply the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with heavy fuel
oil, but expressed confidence that the problem could be solved.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure we are going to be able to fulfil our side of
the bargain," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1994 U.S.-DRPK agreement, the United States should
provide 500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil to DPRK every
year as it was to freeze its nuclear program in return for a new
light water reactor, to be built by a new consortium, the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).
</P>
<P>
The United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union
are board members of KEDO.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said so far this year KEDO had delivered only
about 152,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil. By the end of the
month, that figure will have risen to 216,000, he said, meaning
284,000 tons will be needed in the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the administration was consulting with Congress
about extra funding for oil purchases. And he said the United
States will also help KEDO raise additional funds from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rubin indicated President Bill Clinton had expressed
readiness to use "certain provisions of U.S. law" to come up
with the extra funds. But he gave no details.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Foreign Minister Visits Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys
Tarasyuk said here on Monday he will discuss trade and economic
cooperation with U.S. officials during his visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said at the National Press Club he will
also discuss Ukraine's efforts to join the European Union when he
meets Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with the United States has been crucial in
consolidating Ukraine as a stable, democratic, viable partner and
ally of the United States," Tarasyuk said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that while the United States is Ukraine's
largest foreign investor, it would be unrealistic to say that
American investors have no problems in his country.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine recognizes the existence of disputes and is working to
settle them in a constructive and civilized manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, the third largest recipient of U.S. assistance, has
recently been spared a substantial aid cut after making
significant progress in resolving complaints of U.S. investors
over corruption, red tape and other impediments to business.
</P>
<P>
Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, foreign
businesses have invested about two billion U.S. dollars in
Ukraine, a figure described by State Department officials as
abysmally low when compared with the country's potential.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk is also scheduled to meet Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ukraine's joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is not on the agenda of his visit.
</P>
<P>
"One may not exclude in principle Ukraine's joining ay security
institution, NATO included," he said, but adding that "proper
conditions must be prepared" for the process. "At this moment we
cannot say that these conditions are right in Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
"That is why the issue of Ukraine joining the alliance is not
on the agenda today," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
NATO has indicated that any European country, including
Ukraine, will be accepted if they meet criteria of NATO.
Russia strongly opposes Ukraine's joining the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Cannabidiol May Protect Brain Cells From Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists say that a
substance in marijuana may be useful for protecting brain cells
from the damaging effects of stroke and disease, The Washington
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the National Institute of Mental Health found
that cannabidiol, a chemical substance in marijuana, appears to
protect the brain cells of rats in experiments in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the July 7 issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, Aidan J. Hampson and his colleagues put
cannabidiol into laboratory dishes with rat brain cells that had
been exposed to toxic levels of a brain chemical called glutamate.
</P>
<P>
Strokes can cause the release of levels of glutamate that
overstimulate and kill brain cells. Cannabidiol of antioxidants
can protect against this process. In the experiments,
cannabidiol did exactly that, performing better than vitamins C
and E.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that the substance may be useful for
protecting the brain from strokes, as well as brain diseases
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government will
promote its trade cooperation with Peru in an effort to increase
its market share in Latin America, according to British government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing Monday before Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's visit to Britain, British officials said although
British exports to Peru have increased over the past few years,
Britain's market share in Peru remains weak.
</P>
<P>
"The UK has a poor market share in Latin America. The talks
with Peru are part of efforts to address this," said one British
official.
</P>
<P>
The Officials also noted that the British government is pleased
with the measures taken by Peruvian government to end Peru's
cocaine production but is expected to urge for more action.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain has just provided 250 million
pounds (about 410 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Peru to help the
country fight against drugs trade.

<HEADLINE> Growth of Developing Countries to Fall to 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in
developing countries in 1998 is expected to be half of that in
1997, falling to almost two percent, Secretary-General of U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the Asian economic crisis, the downward
revisions in gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts have
been more substantial for developing than for developed countries,
he told a U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) session.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, the three-day forum with participation of
leaders of Breeton Woods institutions is dealing with the impact
of the Asian crisis on world trade.
</P>
<P>
"Given the bleak prospects for recovery in East Asia, we expect
the widening of the income gap between the North and the South to
continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in many years, excluding China, growth in
the developing world will fall below that of the developed
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, developing countries are expected to be
affected more than the developed countries by negative trends in
the volume and export prices of their goods, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of growth in East Asia has been the single most
important factor in the recent declines in the prices of many
commodities, including oil, agricultural raw materials and
metals.
</P>
<P>
"For some of these countries, up to a quarter of export
earnings may be lost," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to financial globalization, the UNCTAD chief said it
is much more difficult to manage integration into international
capital markets than it is to successfully insert oneself into the
international trading system.
</P>
<P>
"This is why one should avoid pushing or pressuring developing
countries into premature financial liberalization, thus denying
them the option to protect their economies from international
financial instability, and volative and speculative capital
flows," he said.
