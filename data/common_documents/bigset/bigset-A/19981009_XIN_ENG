<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Michael Tebbutt of
the United States failed to make the last eight as he walked out
for a back injury on Thursday in the Shanghai Open ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
Gambill stopped at 5-0 in the first set of the match against M
ichael Tebbutt of Australia when the back injury, which he
suffered during the Davis Cup competition, betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
Tebbutt now faces his quarter-final rival Ramon Delgado of
Paraguay, who stormed back from one set down to dispose off
Indian Leander Paes, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Australian Mark Woodforde is now one step away from a matchup
with his world No.1 doulbes partner, Todd Woodbridge, after he
beat Sargis Sargsian of Armenia 6-2, 6-2.

<P>
Woodforde will meet fifth-seeded Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands, who defeated German Karsten Braasch 6-0, 6-3
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victory for Woodforde sets up a semi-final vie against the

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners, Union Meet Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The NBA and its player union
resume collective bargaining negotiations Thursday in New York in
a last-ditch effort to keep intact the league's record of not
ever having lost a regular-season game to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The owner-imposed lockout, in effect since midnight June 30,
already has led to the pre-season schedule being canceled and the
open of training camps being postponed.
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress in negotiations - the sides have had one
bargaining session since the lockout started - makes it
increasingly doubtful if the season will start on November 3.
</P>
<P>
"I was more optimistic than pessimistic over the summer, but
lately that has turned around," said Seattle center Jim
McIlvaine, union secretary-treasurer.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting will be big, the only way we're going to get
started on time."
</P>
<P>
Said Indiana Pacers forward Mark Pope, "Opening the season on
time seems like it would take a miracle, and I don't see one
coming."
</P>
<P>
The league will make a decision on canceling regular-season
games next week.
</P>
<P>
Neither side is optimistic much progress will be made during
today's session. Union executive director Billy Hunter has said
he won't present a counterproposal to the league's most recent
offer, made almost two weeks ago, because it was the same as the
previous one.
</P>
<P>
Hunter complained the owners have made "ludicrous" proposals,
and union President Patrick Ewing said the last offer by the
owners was "disrespectful."
</P>
<P>
The key issue blocking an agreement is the salary cap. Owners
say player salaries are increasing faster than revenues and want
a salary cap teams cannot exceed.
</P>
<P>
They proposed eliminating the Larry Bird exception, the clause
in the previous agreement that allowed teams to re-sign their
free agents without regard to salary cap, thus creating a soft
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
The union says the Bird exception is untouchable and will not
negotiate on it.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Act in Next Few Days: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Thursday that NATO is to deliver its
planned air strikes in Kosovo in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
After meeting NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, Madeleine
Albright told a press conference that the western military
alliance was expected to act in the next few days should Belgrade
fail to comply fully with the United Nations Security Council
Resolution (UNSCR).
</P>
<P>
But Albright, scheduled to fly later in the day to London for a
meeting of the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, said that NATO
was not giving out any deadline but time was running out.
</P>
<P>
"He (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) had months to
comply and now he has but a few days which is frankly what we
needed (for taking action)," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state, who has just wound up a Middle
East trip, said that it was obvious that Belgrade failed to comply
with the UNSCR after consulting with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
She said she was sending Holbrooke back to Belgrade after the
Contact Group meeting in London to convey a "clear and simple"
message that Milosevic must comply with a manner that is adorable
and verifiable the long-standing political, humanitarian and
military demands from the international community or face grave
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that judging by the three lengthy discussions
between Holbrooke and Milosevic, the Yugoslav president did not
understand the seriousness of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The time was coming for NATO to authorize the activation of the
use of force, said Albright after her discussion with Solana on
the role of the allies in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
She said that she agreed with Solana's assessment that NATO had
the legitimacy to act to stop the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking for the United States, I believe it's time for the
alliance to move to the next phase of its decision-making and that
is to take the difficult but necessary decision to authorize
military force if Milosevic fails to comply," stressed Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said that NATO action was necessary
though Milosevic had avoided in the past few days to provoke in
the hope of driving a wedge into the unity of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"That will not happen," said Albright. "We must be prepared to
take action because we know if we are not there, there is nothing
to stop them for going back to business as usual."
</P>
<P>
The situation on the ground in Kosovo had not changed
fundamentally, added Albright who pointed out that Yugoslav
infantry, artillery and armored units were still deployed in key
points in Kosovo and special police were still deployed heavily
along the roads and many of them were digging in for the coming
winter.
</P>
<P>
She described the Yugoslav withdrawal as a "televised show of
soldiers leaving Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a complete and verifiable withdrawal of the
forces responsible for the violence," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said that people had to take into
consideration of Milosevic's long-standing unwillingness to
negotiate seriously and the accumulated barbarities of the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
"Time and again Milosevic has promised us to do things that he
had no intention of doing and time and again he has taken
half-measures to avoid the consequences of actions," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that Milosevic was expected to continue to do the
minimum and necessary to avoid NATO action and that Milosevic had
better understand that the minimum was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that is good enough is full compliance," said
Albright who added that Milosevic must immediately end all
military and police operations in Kosovo and withdraw all units to
their bases in a way that can be verified, provide the
international community with unfettered access to monitoring the
situation in Kosovo, and agree to a timetable for a political
settlement based on the draft the Contact Group has endorsed and
cooperate with the war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state said that diplomats of the
six-nation Contact Group all had gone through the "extra mile" for
peace.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Western countries were telling both the
Serbians and the Kosovo ethnic Albanians that they did not support
for independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are for Serbia out of Kosovo and not for Kosovo out of
Serbia," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But a good diplomacy has had to know when diplomacy has reached
its limits, she added. "And we are rapidly reaching that point
now."
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the Kosovo crisis had taken to a crossroad
both the Balkans and NATO.
</P>
<P>
She described NATO as the institution of choice when it comes
to preserving peace and defending western values in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"NATO must be prepared to act when a threat of this nature
exists on Europe's doorsteps," said Albright.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Government Bodies Urged to Buy Local Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Thursday called on government bodies to buy locally produced
cars in a bid to boost the domestic automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
"The ministries and national agencies should give priority to
the Egyptian car-making industry to cover their needs of passenger
and transportation vehicles instead of having to import them,"
Mubarak said during a visit to the Egypt Achievements Exhibit held
here.
</P>
<P>
He called for more facilities for local automakers to encourage
the domestic car market.
</P>
<P>
"Any top government official who will import a car, provided
that the market is abundant with locally produced vehicles, will
be called into question," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt does not manufacture its own cars, leaving the market
crowded with imported cars. The Egyptian National Automotive
Company and private companies have been assembling cars locally in
joint ventures.

CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa has
agreed to assist Mauritius in building a dam at an approximate
cost of 133 million U.S. dollars to meet the needs of potable and
irrigation waters, Thursday's Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported.
</P>
<P>
The bank has sent a delegation of experts to the island-country
to assess the feasibility of the project, but the volume of the
loan has not been divulged.
</P>
<P>
The experts' report pointed out that the Midland dam in northern
Mauritius will satisfy the needs of the region of irrigation
waters until the year 2010, and of drinking water up to the end
of 2025.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- A study made by the Tunisian Ministry of Trade
reveals that production of the textile and clothing sector has
grown five-fold over the past 10 years, occupying the first rank
among local industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia also occupies the fourth rank among exporters of
clothes to the European Union (EU). It ensures about 6 percent of
the European imports of clothes.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian Ministry of Economy and Industry
will allocate 50 million U.S. dollars for the projects undertaken
by the governmental "Cities and Industrial Park Areas Authority"
already incorporated in the Palestinian development plan for the

billion-U.S. dollar infrastructure fund for related projects in
its 52 member states, "Al Hayat" reported Thursday.

AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has decided on a
comprehensive strategy to reform the National Electric Power
Company, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company will be split into three separate divisions: the
first is in charge of power generation and assumes ownership of
all the company's assets; the second is in charge of distributing
power; the third is in charge of transmitting power.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The prices of all types of cars have recently declined
by 10 to 20 percent in Jordan, mainly due to devaluation of
currencies of some Asian countries and world economic recession,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is fierce competition in saturated local
market, the paper quoted Hassan E`layyan, general manager of
South Korea's Hyundai Company in Jordan, as saying.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Administrative Council of Jordanian Exports
Development and Trade Centers Corporation decided to open a
trade center at the Jordanian Embassy in Algeria, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The center is expected to raise Jordanian export volume to
Algeria and provide information of the Algerian markets for

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Join Hands in Combating Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ended their two-day
meeting here Thursday after deciding to work together to revive
the economies hit by the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement that they had discussed
a set of "bold measures" to restore investor confidence in the
region and facilitate economic recovery covering investments,
trade and services.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not elaborate, saying only that these
measures, if approved by the governments of the ASEAN countries,
would be announced by the ASEAN heads of government at its sixth
summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December this year.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers welcomed the decision of the
ASEAN finance ministers to establish an ASEAN surveillance
mechanism to prevent future financial crises similar to the
current one in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The surveillance process is also aimed at monitoring
developments in ASEAN member countries and in the international
economy that could affect individual ASEAN economies and the
region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
To avert the sharp decline of foreign investments into the
region, the ministers approved and signed the Framework Agreement
on ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) and established a ministerial-level
AIA council.
</P>
<P>
The AIA, to be established by the year 2010, will provide to
ASEAN, in a collective manner, and to the individual member
countries, greater benefits in attracting foreign direct
investments to revive the economies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers also approved and signed the Protocol
on Notification Procedures that obliges member countries to give
advance notice 60 days prior to taking any actions that will
impair or nullify the benefits enjoyed by other member countries
from any ASEAN economic agreements.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering, the ministers also agreed to accelerate
the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area by reducing the
tariffs of more products to zero percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To promote greater intra-ASEAN trade and mitigate the impacts
of the financial crisis, six ASEAN member countries -- Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand --
agreed to use local currencies in regional trade during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Urges "Constructive" Cooperation From NLD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Thursday
urged the country's opposition party, the National League for
Democracy (NLD), to contribute in a positive and meaningful way to
achieving a thriving economy and a stable multi-party democratic
system.
</P>
<P>
The official Information Sheet quoted Lt. Col. Hla Min, an
official at the Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense
Ministry, as saying that "now is the time for responsible,
constructive cooperation, not whimsical and symbolic gestures
designed merely to attract attention."
</P>
<P>
Hla Min, who briefed foreign diplomats here Wednesday on the
current political situation in Myanmar, rapped the NLD for having
unilaterally rejected further meetings between the government and
the NLD. In August, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, and NLD Chairman U
Aung Shwe met to discuss prospects of launching an era of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hla Min criticized the NLD for making the inclusion of the
party's general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, whom the government
calls a "private citizen," a precondition for any further
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomes official meetings with legal
representatives of political parties, Hla Min said, pointing out
that an inclusion of a "private citizen" in such official meetings
is "inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the regional economic crisis is still biting
with much work remaining ahead, and stressed the need to work
together to develop strong policies on economic development,
anti-narcotics, national security and the establishment of a
National Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If political crisis leads to a crisis in national security,
then Myanmar's very existence is in danger with domestic armed
groups probably taking advantage of political confusion to split
the country into a number of mini-states," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The government has insisted on the exclusion of Aung San Suu
Kyi from dialogue between it and the NLD. The NLD, on the other
hand, sticks to its position that such dialogue must include her
attendance for being a key leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the NLD formed a 10-member Committee Representing
the Parliament Elected in the 1990 Multi-Party General Election
and set up a People's Parliament unilaterally after the party's
deadline for the parliament to be convened was ignored by the
government.

<P>
SINGAPORE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Narcotics Bureau
(CNB) of Singapore announced Thursday that its officers have
arrested more than 1,700 suspected hard-core drug addicts in 11
operations in the state this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was released after the CNB rounded 94 people
suspected of drug offenses in island-wide raids Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the detainees, 44 tested positive, the CNB said.
</P>
<P>
The CNB said the raids were mounted to hunt down recalcitrant
addicts who have relapsed.
</P>
<P>
Following the raids, the CNB said there are no longer any
so-called "black areas" in Singapore where drugs are openly bought
and sold in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's anti-drug law amendment took effect in July,
toughening penalties against hard-core drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, 49 hard-core addicts were sentenced to
imprisonment terms ranging from five to seven years in addition to
three to six strokes of the cane.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Kicks off Presidential Election Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese cabinet kicked off the
presidential election process at its exceptional session on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Information Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa told
reporters that the cabinet has decided to draft a bill on amending
the constitution to pave the way for Emile Lahoud, commander of
the Lebanese Army, to stand for the election.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's constitution, any senior public servant who
wants to run for the presidency must quit his or her post two
years prior to the election.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud was endorsed as the presidential candidate during a
summit between Lebanese President Alias Hrawi and Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad last Monday in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which is maintaining about 40,000 troops as
peacekeepers in Lebanon, agree to coordinate stances on key issues.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, 62, a close ally of Syria, was appointed as army
commander in 1989, just prior to the end of the country's 15-year
civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has gained popular support due to his accomplishments in
rebuilding the army into a cohesive and stabilizing force of the
country after its disintegration during the civil war.

<P>
ATHENS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation increased from
5.0 percent in August to 5.2 percent in September this year,
according to figures released by the Greek National Statistics
Service (NSS) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the rise in inflation to rising prices in
durable goods, food as well as an increase in education services'
prices.
</P>
<P>
The NSS remained confident that inflation could drop following
the Greek government's measures to contain consumer price
inflation in the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
To combat inflation, the Greek government has decided to lower
a special fuel and heating oil tax and reduce food price in super
markets.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban said on
Thursday that Iran's accusation of Taliban incursions was "totally
baseless."
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Kabul quoted Taliban spokesman
Maulvi Wakil Ahmad as saying that the Iranian troops had been
shelling near the Afghan border for the last three days with some
missiles landing on Afghan soil.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Wakil said Iran was doing this to cover up their own violations
of Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Azizollah Jafari, the commander of the Revolutionary
Guards' ground forces, said Taliban militiamen attacked an Iranian
border post in the Saleh-Abad region of Torbat-e-Jam, in the north
of Khorasan province, with machine-guns and artillery on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
He said his forces inflicted "heavy casualties" on the Taliban
militia during a three-hour clash on the Iran-Afghanistan border.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian forces responded and the clashes lasted for three
hours," he was quoted by the Iranian News Agency (IRNA) as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Mediate Turkish-Syrian Crisis, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Martin Indyk said here Thursday that Washington will
begin its mediation to defuse the Turkish-Syrian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
Indyk said Washington will exert efforts to "strike a compromise
between toning down the tension and taking into account the
Turkish apprehensions."
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Turkish side to be patient and advise Syria to
take the matter seriously," he added.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Mideast neighbors Syria and Turkey have
deteriorated in recent weeks with Syria bridling at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel and Turkey threatening Damascus
for allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Indyk called for "serious political dialog" to solve the issue,
saying that U.S. President Bill Clinton welcomes Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak visited Turkey and Syria Tuesday to offer a set of
proposals to start a direct dialog for an immediate solution.
</P>
<P>
"Both Egypt and the U.S. believe the situation is quite serious
and that there is an urgent need to tone down the escalation in
order to deal with the real fears which haunt Turkey which is
extremely concerned with the activities of the outlawed Turkish
Kurdish rebels in Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indyk is part of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's team
that flew to the region Tuesday to narrow Palestinian-Israeli
differences on a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank in exchange for serious Palestinian crackdown
on terrorism.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy on Mission to Reduce Afghan-Iran Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi arrived here from Tehran Thursday
night on the second leg of his visit to the region to try to
reduce prevailing tension between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials of Pakistan's Foreign Office and the
U.N. representatives in Islamabad met Brahimi shortly after his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will hold formal talks with Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long stay in Islamabad, Brahimi is also
scheduled to meet Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send Brahimi to the region was made after the
Six Plus Two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the U.S.
and Russia) meeting at the United Nations last week called for
renewed U.N. efforts to broker peace in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China and
Russia and the United States agreed at the U.N. meeting that the
world body should send its representatives to address the
Afghanistan conflict in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
While the Taliban now control over 95 percent of Afghanistan,
the international community has called for a broad-based
government in Kabul.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Confusion and Division Grow Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fact that
NATO announced the beginning of a countdown to formally authorize
military intervention over Kosovo, confusion and division are
growing among Western countries over what to do next about what
they saw as emerging humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, Serbia's
province of mainly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Outspoken threatening remarks by NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana, reported on Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, do not
agree with what was stated by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who said, on a visit to the Middle East, that no
consensus has been reached over a next step on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"No one is in a rush to use force" against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, James Rubin, U.S. State Department spokesman said
on the sidelines of Albright's Middle East tour, adding that no
one ever stated that NATO would definitely make a decision within
this week.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both Britain and the United States, which has
been promoting a NATO decision to take military action against
Serb target to force full compliance with U.N. resolutions,
stressed on Wednesday afternoon that no deadline had been set.
This was again contradictory to Solana's previous statement that
the military action would take place within days.
</P>
<P>
At present, military threats are co-existing with diplomatic
actions to seek a political solution. However, Western countries
have all good reasons to hesitate and disagree with others over
the use of force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western alliance has deep concerns over the legal
basis for military intervention in what Belgrade long claimed its
internal affairs. At the same time, Italy and Germany asked NATO
to seek a U.N. agreement before air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Resolution 1199 and a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, explicitly or implicitly, gave no
green light for NATO to formally activate its military forces over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi called for more diplomacy
before reverting to force, saying air strikes would have to be
"legitimized" by the 185-member United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Italy, with major U.S. and NATO airbases at Aviano, Vicenza,
Villafranca and other locations, is a key element in finalized
NATO planning, if any, for air strikes against Yugoslav military
targets.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that if NATO bypasses the United Nations to
stage military action against Yugoslavia, it will constitute a
flare violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Russia, one of the five permanent members of
the Security Council with veto power, intensified its diplomacy
and insistence on foiling any intention at the Security Council to
okay military intervention against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian stance, together with concerted appeals for
peaceful solution in the international community, largely added to
the Western hesitation and division over the next step on Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians have been battling with Serbs for
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, which groups six nations including Russia,
announced the postponement of a meeting, originally scheduled for
Thursday in London. Such a move was interpreted by the world
community once again as the disagreement among powers over a next
step.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many countries in the Yugoslavia region, known as
the powder keg in the Balkans, are multi-ethnic, any imprudent
action could have wider negative implications.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, which have been pressing for Belgrade's full
compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding an end to the reported
humanitarian catastrophe in the Serb province, actually do not
hope to see the independence of Kosovo, the goal of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
They rattled the threat of military action as a warning for
Belgrade to accept what West has offered. "The goal of our policy
is not to use force, if not necessary. The goal is to achieve
compliance with the international community (demands)," said U.S.
Richard Holbrooke, who failed to persuade Belgrade to give up its
position at the end of the third-round talks with Yugoslav
President Solobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Any military attacks on Yugoslavia would bring threats to the
security of NATO soldiers in neighboring Bosnia, who are
implementing a multinational mission of stabilization in the
war-torn region. Serbia, a dominant republic of Yugoslavia, said
that Serbs would respond to any possible NATO strikes with
retaliatory attacks on NATO soldiers in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Western countries are currently engaged in a series of
consultations over what to do next on Kosovo. Belgrade has
formally asked the Organization of European Security and
Cooperation to send a team to Kosovo in order to gather first-hand
information on the situation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The return of 50,000 refugees and withdrawal of security forces
in Kosovo, reported by U.N. agencies, send a strong message to the
world that the international diplomatic efforts do not fail.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the unilateral use of force will not bring about a
fundamental settlement of the Kosovo issue, and it may, on the
contrary, reinforce the separatist and terrorist forces in the
region and intensify the tension in the Balkans.

NICOSIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is
striving to turn Cyprus into a regional services center, President
Glafcos Clerides said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the opening ceremony of the
EuroMediterranean Services Exhibition "CyServ '98," which is aimed
at upgrading the island's services industry.
</P>
<P>
Clerides pointed out that the services sector contributes 73
percent to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus aims to achieve even better results that will have a
positive effect on all sectors of the country's economic
activity, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his remark, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism
Nicos Rolandis depicted a bright future for further enlargement of
the services sector not only in Cyprus but also in other countries.

of productivity of services.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 services companies from Greece, Israel, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon and Malta, as well as 50 others from Cyprus are
participating in the four-day exhibition.
</P>
<P>
They include companies and organizations related to the
services sector such as consultancy, accounting, advertizing,
information-technology, market research, banking, tourism and
education.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs to Hold Free Elections: British Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs to hold free and
fair general elections as a means to gain long-term stability, a
special emissary from British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Free and fair elections are crucial to Indonesia's long-term
stability," Derek Fatchett, who is Minister of State for Foreign
and Commonwealth Affairs, said at the end of a two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with President
B.J. Habibie, Fatchett said the holding of general elections was
one of the main topics of his discussion with the Indonesian
leader as well as with the Independent Election Monitoring
Committee, a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
"I can announce today that we are also ready to give practical
assistance to help Indonesia in the political field, notably to
help it hold free and fair elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the House of Representative have
agreed that the general elections should be held in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said the British government welcomed the steps
President Habibie and his administration had already taken towards
the holding of free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The human rights situation in Indonesia had improved and the
British government was closely cooperating with Indonesia's
National Commission on Human Rights in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said his government was strongly committed to helping
Indonesia achieve economic recovery and make changes toward
greater democracy.
</P>
<P>
The British government would also continue to assist Indonesia
in dealing with its economic problems through the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international channels, he
added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Fatchett said, he also met Defense Minister
Gen. Wiranto and members of the National Commission on Human
Rights.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia Remains World Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia is still an active player
on the international arena despite current hardship, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with visiting Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat
Primakov told reporters that "Despite the tough times Russia is
suffering, we continue playing an active role on the international
arena."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not always in the limelight advertising its
participation... But even in the shade we play our positive role,"
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia does not oppose itself to anyone, and
its role is positive. Russia's role "is aimed at achieving
stability, settling conflicts peacefully, and establishing a just
peace in all the regions of the globe," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East policy, Primakov said Russia supports
"Palestinian demands for a just peace which will create all
conditions for normalization and a normal existence of all peoples
inhabiting this region, instead of bringing about a settlement in
the interest of one against the other."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the settlement of the Turkey-Syria standoff, he
said Russia was using diplomatic channels to remove tension in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching this situation attentively and doing
everything through diplomatic channels to ease tension," Primakov
said.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Insist on UN Mandate for Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Greens party, the most
likely junior partners in the new German government, stressed
Thursday that it would oppose any German participation in a
possible NATO military action in Kosovo without a U.N. resolution
approving the use of force.
</P>
<P>
In a position paper issued Thursday in Bonn, Greens' expert on
defense affairs, Angelika Beer, said her party would not give up
its demand for sufficient legal basis prior to any military
intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
She also called for more diplomatic efforts, including closer
cooperation with Russia, to defuse the rising tensions in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
German commentators said that the pacifist Greens is facing a
major foreign policy test on the Kosovo issue at a time when it is
just trying to negotiate a workable alliance with the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) to form the next German government later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
alliance in the general election on September 27, has said that it
supports the offer made by Kohl's government to provide 14 Tornado
jets for possible NATO air strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Guenther Verheugen, a SPD expert on foreign affairs who could
become defense minister in the new government, Thursday expressed
the belief that the existing U.N. Security Council resolution on
Kosovo has provided sufficient legal basis for a possible NATO
intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, any German participation in the NATO intervention must
be approved by the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament),
which has been virtually paralized during the transitional period
after the election.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Kohl, who acts as caretaker chancellor at
the moment, and Gerhard Schroeder, the incoming chancellor, held a
special meeting in Bonn Thursday for discussions on the Kosovo
situation.
</P>
<P>
The talks came just hours before Schroeder left for Washington
to meet U.S. president Bill Clinton. The Kosovo conflict is
expected to be one of the top issues on Schroeder's agenda.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Killed in Clashes With Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian was killed on
Thursday during the clashes between Palestinian protesters and
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Hebron, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted as dozens of Palestinians threw stones at
Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves in the
Israeli-controlled downtown sector of Hebron. And the soldiers
responded with rubber-coated bullets.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Palestinian youth was hit on the head by a
rubber bullet and died in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
A number of other Palestinians were injured in the clashes,
including a cameraman who was working for the Agence France-Presse
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The cameraman, Hussam Abu Alan, was also hit by a rubber
bullet on his head. He was reportedly wounded seriously but
not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Following the clashes, Yigal Sharon, top Israeli army
commander in Hebron, said in a statement that when troops fired
rubber bullets at stone throwers, they were not aware that a
photographer was among them.
</P>
<P>
He held Palestinian police responsible for the violence,
noting that they had done nothing to restrain the stone throwers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians in Hebron launched a general strike on
Thursday in protest against the eight-day blockade and curfew
imposed by Israeli troops on the city.
</P>
<P>
Israel lifted the closure Thursday morning, which had
barred Palestinians from entering and leaving the city.
</P>
<P>
But the curfew remains in effect, which confines some 30,000
Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled city center to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The blockade and curfew were imposed by Israeli troops last
Wednesday after some 20 Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were wounded in a hand grenade attack in the downtown
area of the city.
</P>
<P>
Palestine National Liberation Movement (Al Fatah) distributed a
leaflet on Tuesday, calling for a general strike on Thursday and
demonstrations on Friday in Hebron unless the blockade and curfew
were lifted.
</P>
<P>
About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in
downtown Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and
protected by large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Optimistic About Iran-Afghan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi expressed optimism here Thursday night
that the existing tension between Iran and the Taliban would be
peacefully resolved.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media upon his arrival from Tehran on the second
leg of his peace mission, Brahimi said the situation is very grave
and should be addressed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, accompanied by Assistant Secretary General Ibrahim
Bakara of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, said: "We
have no time to lose. There is a crisis, the crisis needs to be
addressed as soon as possible. It needs to be addressed tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said his talks with Pakistani officials and the Taliban
begin in Islamabad Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Six Plus Two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus
the U.S. and Russia) group at its recent meeting in New York
decided to send Brahimi to the region amidst growing tension
between Iran and Afghanistan over the killing of Iranian personnel
in Mazar-i-Shafir early August.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that I have come here reasonably optimistic.
There is a good chance to make progress and move away from the
dangers of the situation towards a better and satisfactory
resolution of the problem," Brahimi said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi described his talks with Iranian leaders as highly
successful and said Iranian leaders expressed their commitment to
solve the problem through diplomatic and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He said he has received an invitation from the Afghan Taliban
to visit Afghanistan but "due to our security concerns, I would
not be able to go to Afghanistan until these concerns are
removed."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman said last Saturday that
Brahimi's mission to the region will remain incomplete unless he
visits Afghanistan. Taliban leader Mulla Muhammad Rabbani has sent
a letter to Brahimi inviting him to Afghanistan for talks with
Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the border clash between Iran
and the Taliban, Brahimi said: "This has been exaggerated by the
press as usual and that it will be contained."

<HEADLINE> People Relieved as Roadblocks in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- People in the Somali capital
and the business community of southern Somalia sighed with relief
Thursday after the roadblocks between Mogadishu and Afgoie town,
30 km south of Mogadishu, have been removed.
</P>
<P>
About a hundred heavily armed militiamen led by Hussein Ali
Weheliye (Erfo), the security chief of Afgoie town, launched an
operation at 4:00 a.m. local time Thursday to fight against
illegal roadblocks set along the Afgoie road.
</P>
<P>
According to Erfo, the operation which lasted a few hours
ended with 25 illegal roadblocks dismantled. The militiamen at
the illegal roadblocks were most probably notified by their
fellow men earlier Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"We met no resistance at any point and therefore arrested no
one in connection with the roadblocks," said Erfo.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still five more checkpoints at the K-7
strong point and its surrounding areas manned by militiamen loyal
to faction leader Osman Ali Atto, who continue demanding lorries
and public buses for extortion money.
</P>
<P>
Erfo said his men will not abandon the road. Meanwhile, he
will assign permanently two battle wagons and its infantry
militiamen to patrol the road against the erection of new
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
A bus driver who arrived on the Afgoie road Thursday said he
spent less than an hour after paying the militiamen at the
remaining roadblocks 50,000 Somali Shillings (about 6.25 U.S.
Dollars) on his trip to Mogadishu. Earlier, he had to spend 15
times as much.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the security chief and his men demolished eight
illegal roadblocks along the road between Afgoie town and
Ballidogle airport, 90 km south of the capital. During the
operation ten militiamen were rounded up for manning the illegal
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Before the two operations, it took the drivers more than six
hours to make 30 km between Mogadishu and Afgoie town due to the
innumerable roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the operations will revive the hope of
hundreds of lorry and bus owners who have got out of the business
just for the sake of those roadblocks.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa's Economy to Grow by 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa's economy is
likely to grow by three percent in 1998 if the weather
conditions, maintenance of peace and political stability and
economic environment are favorable, a report said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The estimated growth rate would be determined by the above
mentioned conditions, said the report of the Intergovernmental
Committee of Experts for Southern Africa (ICE) released at the
end of the ICE's fifth meeting held from October 5 to 8.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the economic and social conditions in the
sub-region, the report noted although overall GDP growth rate in
1997 was positive at 2.4 percent, it was, nonetheless, 20 percent
lower than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the performance varied among countries and
between economic sectors, saying that the growth in agricultural
production had declined to 6.8 percent in 1997 from 10.3 percent
in 1996, owing mostly to the adverse El Nino phenomenon that
persisted in the sub-region throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
And the performance of the mining sector in 1997 was rather
poor, in particularly in the mineral and metal subsector due to
lower demand in the world market.
</P>
<P>
There were, however, improved performance and developments
registered in the transport and communications sector, which is
particularly reflected in the upgrading of roads, ports and
railways infrastructure as well as improved telecommunications
services in the sub-region, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As far as the debt problem, which hinders the sub-region's
economic development, is concerned, the report criticized the
initiatives now pursued to alleviate it and even the recently
launched Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative as
"inadequate".
</P>
<P>
"The agony of the debt problem should be ended," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community to work out a
"comprehensive" solution to end the debt problem and carry out a
"far-reaching" reform of the international financial system and
institutions as well as a "fundamental" reform of the
international assistance process itself.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, whose theme is "Cultivating Effective
Partnership in Southern Africa - Development is everybody's
business", attracted about 80 delegates from Botswana, Malawi,
Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Regional bodies such as the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the
U.N. agencies in Zambia were also represented at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows Not to Give in to U.S. Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu declared Thursday that he will not give in to
U.S. pressure during the scheduled U.S. summit meeting next week,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks during a meeting with leaders of the
National Religious Party (NRP), a far-right partner in his
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The NRP requested the convening of the meeting to warn
Netanyahu not to make concessions under U.S. pressure at the
summit with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be held at the Wye Plantation in Maryland,
where Israeli and Syrian negotiators met for the first
face-to-face talks three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The NRP has threatened to topple the government if Netanyahu
agrees to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians, but it holds now that the most important question is
whether Israel will get security guarantee, especially for the
Jewish settlements, when it relinquishes part of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu also agreed to the NRP request at
the meeting that he convene a special cabinet session next
Tuesday to brief the ministers on his position at the coming
U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
NRP cabinet minister Shaul Yhalom said that Netanyahu made
clear at the meeting that he will not surrender to any pressure
at the summit. He said the prime minister promised to NRP leaders
that he will declare at the special cabinet session that Israel
will withdraw from only 1 percent of the West Bank in the third
phases of further pullback.
</P>
<P>
Substantial progress was made on various issues in the
trilateral talks Wednesday between Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the Israel-Gaza
border, but sources close to the talks said the timetable and thescope of the th
ird withdrawal is among the problems remaining
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Washington has reached understandings
with Israel over the third stage of further Israeli withdrawal,
but the PNA is demanding a larger scope.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to seek support from within his government,
Netanyahu convened his "kitchen cabinet" earlier Thursday to
brief the other three members -- Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky -- on his talks with
Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu has invited the three ministers to
go with him for the U.S. summit. NRP leaders demanded that another
NRP minister, Yitzhak Levy, be also invited to the U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross continued his
mediation in the region Thursday, holding three hours of talks
with the Israeli-Palestinian joint committees to discuss interim
issues, especially the opening of the Palestinian airport in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The airport has been a contentious point between the two sides
for the past 18 months, mainly due to Israeli security
concerns. U.S. officials have said that Ross will try to wrap up
an understanding on the issue before he leaves the region Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai held a working session in Tel Aviv with
George Tenet, head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
on security issues, mainly the Israeli demand that the PNA take
measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The CIA is trying to bring the two sides closer for an
understanding on security cooperation, which some said is also
one of the main problems facing the U.S. summit.

<HEADLINE> IMF/World Bank Meetings Ends with Calls for End of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance officials from 182
nations ended a week of discussions here Thursday with a broad
blueprint for an approach needed to end the worst global economic
crisis in a half century.
</P>
<P>
At the annual International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank
meeting, the finance ministers and central bank governors from the
world widely discussed the worsening global financial turmoil and
a world recession and worked out strategies to deal with them,
focusing on strengthened international financial architecture and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees there is a way out of the crisis. It is an
uphill way, but it is there," IMF Managing Director Michael
Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus predicted that the IMF, which has put together 137
billion dollars in bailout packages for nations leveled by market
turmoil so far, would soon have an additional 90 billion dollars
in resources.
</P>
<P>
But that requires a U.S. Congress approval of 18 billion dollars
American share of that amount.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus expressed optimistic over the situation and said "an
extensive agenda awaits us in moving toward a more durable
international monetary system."
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James Wolfensohn also said the his agency
and IMF were working closely together and "have a time-tested
approach to face this crisis and any others that come down the
line."
</P>
<P>
As one of the actions, the IMF immediately announced it was
closer to agreement with Brazil on an international package to
support the Latin American nation to overcome its financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued on behalf of the IMF and Brazil said
"discussions will continue in the days ahead, with the aim of
reaching agreement soon" on a detailed economic reform program
that could receive the financial support of the IMF and other
lenders.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that Brazil would get a total of 30 billion
billion U.S. dollars or more as the IMF tries to stop a financial
contagion that has already leveled a number of Asian countries and
Russia from spreading to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The United States worried that if the financial turmoil topples
the biggest economy in Latin America it could spread to other
nations in the region, which absorb nearly 20 percent of U.S.
exports.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Not to Withdraw Diplomatic Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- There was no need for Greece to
issue a travel advisory for Yugoslavia or withdraw its diplomatic
mission from Belgrade, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that Greek diplomatic
authorities remained in Yugoslavia and were ready to provide any
assistance to Greeks who choose not to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece did not consider it useful to take any
other decision.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government was now watching the developments closely
in Kosovo and was firm in its position that every effort should be
made for a peaceful solution to the crisis, Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis had contacts with other European leaders on the
developments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greece, unlike other European Union countries, has repeatedly
voiced its opposition to any possible NATO military intervention
in Kosovo, saying that all diplomatic and political approaches had
yet to be exhausted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Blamed for Repatriating Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican official Thursday
came out to blast South Africa for repatriating refugees without
notifying the Mozambican side in advance.
</P>
<P>
Noe Mathe, Director of Social Coordination of Maputo Province,
said here that what Pretoria did has brought great pressure on
the Maputo provincial administration in settling the large number
of returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mathe said the South African authorities should have given a
note to the Mozambican government before hand, so that they could
get prepared for receiving the refugees who were kicked out by
South Africa as illegal residents.
</P>
<P>
Some of the counties bordering South Africa in Maputo Province
are hard hit by drought and it is difficult to send them back
there under this situation, Mathe said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambican News Agency, the South African
authorities have been repatriating hundreds of Mozambican
refugees each week via Ressano Garcia county alone.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are several tens of thousands of
"illegally" Mozambicans living in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Two Top Pakistani Army Generals Go on Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Two top three-star generals of
the Pakistani Army went home Thursday following the appointment of
Gen. Pervez Musharaf as new chief of the Army Staff, the News
Network International reported, quoting defense sources.
</P>
<P>
Without confirming their resignation, an officer from the Inter
Service Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of General Staff Lt.
Gen. Ali Kuli Khan and Quarter Master General Lt. Gen. Malik
Khalid Nawaz went on leave effective on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Gen. Jehangir Karamat
resigned from his office Wednesday night, just two days after his
criticism of the policies of the present government. The ISPR also
confirmed that during a meeting of the new chief of the Army Staff
with the principal staff officers at General Headquarters, both
Kuli Khan and Khalid Nawaz were absent.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, Kuli Khan, the most senior officer
in line after Gen. Karamat, was supposed to get the job of COAS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official from the Ministry of Defense confirmed
that the two generals had gone on leave.
</P>
<P>
"So far no resignation has been submitted by the two," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The tenures of Lt. Gen. Ali Kuli Khan and Lt. Gen. Khalid Nawaz
are to expire early next year.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted a retired army general as saying that
the two would tender their resignations in a couple of days.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Army Chief Quits Amid Row With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- To the surprise of many,
Pakistan's powerful army chief, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, resigned
Wednesday from his job, three months before his three-year tenure
expires.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in Pakistan's history that an army chief
resigned after a row with the government over how the country
should be run.
</P>
<P>
Karamat's unexpected resignation followed his proposal on
Monday to establish a national security council to
institutionalize the national decision-making system.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was reportedly annoyed by the
proposal floated by Karamat at the Pakistan Naval War College in
Lahore, has accepted Karamat's resignation and appointed Lt. Gen.
Pervez Musharaf as the new army chief.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the proposed national security council
would give the influential Pakistani army a greater say in
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Karamat cited Pakistan's fledgling economy, spiraling sectarian
and ethnic violence and growing frustration in the three smaller
provinces as the main reasons for him to suggest establishing a
national security council.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions during his annual address at the
Pakistan Naval War College in Lahore Monday, Karamat said unlike
countries with economic potential, Pakistan "could not afford the
destabilizing effects of polarization, vendettas and insecurity
driven expedient policies."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan should now focus on the economy, deal with its
relations with foreign countries in a better way, and stabilize
the internal situation, especially that in Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Karamat said that could be done only by establishing a
structurally tiered system with clear responsibility at each
level.
</P>
<P>
A national security council or committee at the apex would
institutionalize decision-making if it was backed by a team of
credible advisors and a think-tank of experts, said Karamat.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties hailed Karamat's proposal which
sent a clear signal to the government of the army's discontent
over certain policies and the general situation in the country.
The opposition termed Karamat's proposal "the final warning" to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it was the first time that Karamat,
who assumed office in January 1996, has suggested direct army
involvement in policy decisions through a national security
council.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, dogged by
economic turmoil and bitter opposition to a proposed
constitutional amendment which would create a new Islamic order in
the country, has yet to make official comment on Karamat's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Thursday, the resignation of Karamat
and appointment of Musharaf as the new Army Chief came after a
meeting Wednesday morning between Prime Minister Sharif and
Karamat. The meeting was described as "far from amicable" by
informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Karamat said later in his letter to Sharif that "unnecessary
debate" has started on his proposal for the establishment of a
national security council, so he decided to step down so that "a
healthy tradition is set for future."
</P>
<P>
He also told the News, an English daily in the country, that he
resigned "due to the controversy sparked over my statement two
days back."
</P>
<P>
He said he sought early retirement because he felt distressed
by the "unnecessary debate" over his proposals which he made in
good faith and with sincerity of purpose.
</P>
<P>
While there is support for Karamat's proposal from different
sections of the country, the government seems to be livid at his
statement which some say was a "public charge-sheet" against Prime
Minister Sharif and his style of governance.
</P>
<P>
While the armed forces remain the most powerful institution in
Pakistan, the last 10 years have seen their overt role in shaping
politics slowly diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Fearing government-military confrontation, Pakistan's former
army generals have criticized Sharif over Karamat's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of the government would escalate the crises being
faced by the PML (Pakistan Muslim League)," retired Lt. Gen. Faiz
Ali Chishti said.
</P>
<P>
Chishti said the recent statement of Gen. Karamat was issued
with the consensus of the three services. "Ignoring the feeling of
the Armed Forces will push the country towards a new crises," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how the government would respond to
Karamat's proposal and deal its relations with the army.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Currency Depreciates Against Dollar Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of Israel's
currency shekel dropped on Thursday to 4.31 to one U.S. dollar,
devaluing by more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A report of Israel Radio said the representative rate of the
Bank of Israel closed at a new record low in the day.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, the shekel has fallen more
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation has raised speculations over whether the
central bank should intervene in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest plunge, Israel's opposition Labor Party
called on the government to take immediate measures against the
depreciation, noting that the plunge would endanger the economy.
</P>
<P>
There are no reports about the reaction of the government.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman said on Wednesday that
"what is happening now to the shekel is a reflection of what is
happening to the global economy."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Israeli financial market is in crisis,
calling on people to refrain from going panic.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the negative atmosphere on
international markets, rather than anything happening in Israel,
is the main reason for the recent devaluation of the shekel.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
confidence index dropped 1.8 points last month, the fifth
consecutive month of recorded decline, Business Day paper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The business index dived 5.7, two and 4.1 points respectively
in the previous three months, according to figures from the South
African Chamber of Business (Sacob).
</P>
<P>
Sacob said Wednesday the further slippage in the business mood
last month was mainly the result of the renewed instability in
global financial markets and the negative implications this had
on emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Complicating the matter were domestic weaknesses, such as
strikes and the balance of payments, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa remained resilient compared with other
emerging markets and the country soon could see a return in
investor confidence, Sacob said.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on solid ratings of South Africa by
international ratings agencies and the positive influence this
had on financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investor Service, a leading international rating
agency, recently gave a better investment grade rating to South
Africa which put the country before most other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent volatilities in the world markets which hit
South Africa, Sacob said there was a possibility of an interest
rate cut before the end of this year, especially in the light of
a more stable currency.
</P>
<P>
The South African Rand strengthened to 5.73 Rand to the U.S.
Dollar Wednesday, its highest level since July, largely owing to
the Dollar's sharp falls on international currency markets.
</P>
<P>
South African Reserve Bank deputy governor James Cross said
Wednesday that hedge funds were starting to leave the country and
this would help the Rand to strengthen and facilitate an
environment in which interest rates could ease.
</P>
<P>
Sacob forecast a 0.5 percent economic growth for the country
this year, which is far below the government target of two
percent but clearly away from the general fears of a recession.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Impose Higher Taxes to Curb Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday stressed the importance of agriculture
and warned to impose higher taxes on imports of farm products.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who was touring the northern region of Arusha, said
that wheat produced locally lacked market while some businessmen
imported wheat and sold at much lower prices.
</P>
<P>
"We'll in that case be forced to increase tax on such and
other products threatening our local markets," the president
warned.
</P>
<P>
He said solutions to the problems should be found so that the
government could protect domestic products and secure income of
farmers, according to reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing government officials, members of parliament,
magistrates, and regional leaders of opposition parties, Mkapa
said time has been ripe for Tanzania to review problems facing
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said the prices of farm products are so low that even
production costs cannot be recovered, citing an example that in
the eastern region of Tanga a liter of milk sells at only 150
Shillings (675 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar).
</P>
<P>
"The crusade against poverty will not succeed if we don't
review problems facing farmers and livestock keepers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the backbone of the country's economy, as it
comprises 55 percent of the national income and 80 percent of the
country's population are agriculture-oriented, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president also calls for the protection of agriculture and
a rapid increase in its output so that people could live a better
life.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Intending to Offer Base to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Thursday denied a South
African media report of its intention to offer bases in its
territory to the rebels against the government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Presidential aide for press and public relations, Richard
Sakala, stressed that Zambia will never accord the rebels bases.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is neutral in the conflict and has not sent any
troops to Congo (K) and that this is one of the reasons why it
has been mandated by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to mediate over the Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sakala also denied that rebel leaders had met with President
Frederick Chiluba and Zambia's defense chiefs recently in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said no such meetings were held in view of the fact that
Zambia is a proponent for peace in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The report by the South African media is a deliberate
publication intended to tarnish Zambia's image, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sakala confirmed that a rebel delegation met with SADC
secretary general recently in Zambia in compliance with the SADC
resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
The South African weekly Mail &AMP; Guardian reported in its
latest issue that rebels met Chiluba and some defense chiefs in
Lusaka last week with a view to setting up bases in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Turkey, Syria to Solve Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday expressed deep
concern over the on-going tensions between Turkey and Syria,
urging Turkey to solve its differences with Syria through dialog.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Cabinet after a meeting chaired by President Saddam
Huusein expressed its concern over the irresponsible statements
made by some Turkish officials, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that any harm inflicted upon any Arab country is
harm on the Arab nation and Turkish people alike as well as on
good neighborly relations and Turkish-Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, a spokesman for the Iraqi National Assembly,
or parliament, called on Arab people, parliaments and Arab
Parliamentary Union to show solidarity and unify their position
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly massed troops backed by tanks and heavy
artillery along its border with Syria, sparking fear of a military
conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have long been at odds over issues including
the alleged Syrian support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels, Turkey's
close military cooperation with Israel and water sharing.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have accused Syria of sheltering its
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting since
1984 for autonomy in southeast Turkey, and threatened to wipe out
Kurdish bases in Syria. Syria has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming a military alliance
with Israel, which it said endangers Arab security, and building a
string of dams on the Euphrates River that could reduce Syria's
water supply.
</P>
<P>
Some Islamic countries, including Egypt and Iran, call for
political dialog to solve the Turkish-Syrian tensions.

<HEADLINE> URGENT:U.S. House Approves Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Thursday approved launching a formal
impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Bill Clinton, the third
such investigation in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 258-176 with 31 Democrats joining 227 Republicans
to start the first presidential impeachment inquiry since the
Watergate scandal of 1974. No Republicans voted against the
measure, although one did not vote.
</P>
<P>
The vote followed two hours of heated floor debate and a
236-198 rejection of a Democratic motion to limit the time and
scope of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee was expected to begin hearings
later this year on possible charges resulting from Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and maybe
other charges to be filed later. If the hearings lead to articles
of impeachment there would be no House vote until next year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Govt to Dismiss Dissident Public Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government
Thursday threatened to dismiss public servants who had been
actively involved in opposition protests in the country's recent
political crisis, South African Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a simple matter because these people have violated
the provisions of Lesotho's public service act which prohibits
government employees to actively participate in politics," SAPA
quoted Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said government ministers had been ordered to convene
urgent meetings with their departmental staff to convey a message
that the culprits should resign or they would be forced out.
</P>
<P>
This means that Lesotho's estimated 10,000 public servants
could be reduced by half as early as next week, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Thabane said some government employees had used government
resources to further the objectives and aims of opposition
parties. Some employees had allegedly been involved in the
hijacking of government vehicles which were used to ferry
opposition supporters to various parts of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted unnamed analysts as saying that the move of the
government would not augur well for Lesotho's current situation.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said it would be unconstitutional for the
move to expel employees because of their political affiliation.

JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's overall
labor market shed 500,000 jobs over the past four years,
Statistics South Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a report that 19 percent of women and 28 percent of
men were jobless in 1997.

<P>
The number of jobs in the agricultural sector declined from
1.4 million in 1994 to 637,000 in 1997.

<P>
DAMASCUS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
Thursday welcomed the Iranian initiative for mediation of
Syria-Turkey tension, calling for dialog to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with al-Assad Thursday afternoon, visiting Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi handed over a message from Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami to al-Assad which addressed the
Syria-Turkey tension and Iran's efforts to contain it, said Syrian
presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Kharrazi discussed the ways of enabling the dialog
to dominate in settling the disputable issues, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Kharrazi held talks with his Syrian
counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa, which also focused on the role Iran,
the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, could play in solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi arrived here earlier in the day after Khatami held
separate telephone conversations with Syrian and Turkish
presidents on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami showed understanding for Syria's stand on handling its
differences with Turkey through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring and supporting the
Kurdish Workers' Party rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast
Turkey, a charge denied by Syria. Turkey has reportedly massed
heavy troops along the border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called on Turkey and Syria to solve their differences
through political means and to avoid any possible confrontation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hints More Missile Attacks Against Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. official suggested
on Thursday that further U.S. missile attacks against the
Afghanistan operations of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden are
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We will take those actions we believe are necessary," Karl F.
Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for south Asian affairs,
told Congress.
</P>
<P>
"They consider that Mr. Osama bin Ladin is a guest.... We
believe that this man is not a guest, that he is a murderer and a
terrorist," Inderfurth said.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth also expressed concern over recent border clashes
between Taliban forces and Iran, but said he doubted the recent
massing of Iranian troops along its northeastern border signaled a
war between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that the purpose of these exercises has been to
intimidate, not to necessarily presage an Iranian attack inside
Afghanistan," he told the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
near eastern and south Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, U.S. fired cruise missile against a purported
terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and other missiles at the
Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. launches the similar strikes, Inderfurth
said, "Those options are clearly available to us."
</P>
<P>
The attack in Afghanistan sent "a powerful message that
terrorists cannot find safe haven, even in nations that harbor
them," he added, calling Afghanistan "a vipers nest of terrorist
training."
</P>
<P>
"So, this must be dealt with, and the Taliban must understand
that its providing safe haven does make them complicity in the
activities that are conducted by the terrorists themselves,"
Inderfurth said.
</P>
<P>
"Our message is simple: Osama bin Laden, an international
terrorist leader still operating from Afghanistan, must be brought
to justice, and Afghanistan must stop being a terrorist base," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has linked bin Laden to the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa. Hundreds were killed and wounded
during the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- European share prices crashed
Thursday in the wake of the dollar, which has fallen sharply amid
persistent fears for the growth prospects of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut in Britain failed to give the London
stock market a much needed boost as the market slid downwards
amidst fears of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
The stock market dived to its lowest level this year after the
Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.25 percent, less than many
in the financial City would have liked.
</P>
<P>
As the market stumbled its way into the afternoon session, it
dropped to a day low of 4,599.2, down 229.7. But it managed a
half-hearted fight-back and closed the day down 130.0 at 4,698.9.
</P>
<P>
Financial organizations were amongst the biggest losers with
Prudential Corporation down 75p at 638p, Sun Life &AMP; Provincial
down 37p at 487p and CGU down 27.5p to 835p. Also, exporters led
the leading index down as the pound rebounded on the previous
session's heavy falls.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Dax index plummeted 4.98 percent in
electronic trading to close at 3,861.89 points. Among Germany's
most depressed shares was Bavarian car maker, hit by both the
dollar and the pound.

CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Thursday voiced guarded
optimism over the prospects for the on-going Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations to produce a deal on Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is closely following up the contacts between the
Palestinians and the Israelis with the assistance of the
Americans," said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, following talks with
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Martin
Indyk in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Indyk briefed Moussa on the outcome of the two-day talks among
Palestinian and Israeli leaders and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who arrived in the region on Tuesday to narrow
the Palestinian-Israeli differences on a U.S. proposal on a 13
percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in return for
serious Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere now prevailing the negotiations is far better
than before," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Albright's team had come to the region to prepare for the
mid-October Washington summit grouping U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been stalled since
March last year due to the construction of Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem. A breakthrough has been hoped for at the
Washington summit particularly on the Israeli second redeployment
from the West Bank.

JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Sesotho government, opposition parties' and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) are due to meet next Monday to push
for a peaceful end of the political crisis in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Mamoepa, spokesman for South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, told a media briefing Thursday that Sesotho government
and opposition parties had told chairman of the SADC delegation,
South African Safety and Security Minister, Sydney Mufamadi that
they were ready to report back on a SADC proposal for the
formation of a transitional structure.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said the SADC was fairly optimistic that political
parties in Lesotho were committed to move their country out of
its impasse.
</P>
<P>
The Sesotho government and opposition party alliance early
this week agreed to take a proposal from the SADC on the
formation of an interim coalition government before a new
election is held within 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said earlier that a transitional committee would help
create conducive conditions for the holding of free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
The proposed committee would comprise one or two members from
each party taking part in the election, and would ensure equal
treatment for all political parties by state-owned broadcasting
and information services in the period leading up to the
election.
</P>
<P>
It would also appoint a new independent electoral commission
to review Lesotho's electoral system.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Ready for Air Strikes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that he had authorized U.S. participation in air
strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In remarks during a health care speech at the White House,
Clinton indicated a growing impatience with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to comply with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had authorized the U.S. representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels to approve an order activating U.S.
participation in NATO military strikes if Yugoslavia did not stop
an offensive against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's move
did not indicate that any military action was imminent.
</P>
<P>
An "activation order" for NATO military action is expected as
early as this weekend unless Milosevic complies with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the United States was confident that ultimately
NATO would reach a consensus in favor of the strikes. Italy has
said the West needs a U.N. legal mandate for intervention.
</P>
<P>
Clinton argued that because of Milosevic's "unconscionable"
action, there was now a danger of violence spreading to
neighboring countries and a humanitarian crisis developing as
winter sets in on the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We would far prefer to secure President Milosevic's compliance
with the will of the international community in a peaceful
manner," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"But NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our
interests and to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the

<HEADLINE> Canada To Ban Split-Run U.S. Magazines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada is to discuss a new
legislation to protect its national magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
Bill C-55, tabled by Heritage Minister Sheila Copps on
Thursday, would introduce a ban on Canadian editions of foreign
publications.
</P>
<P>
Once the new law is endorsed, fines of up to 250,000 Canadian
dollars (162,500 U.S. dollars) will be levied against U.S.
magazine publishers who solicit Canadian advertising for split
runs, in which foreign content is matched with Canadian
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, said the new regulation was potentially
discriminating, adding that the U.S. may launch a complaint at the
World Trade Organization or under the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to win this fight because it's an important fight
for Canada," said Copps.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just about Canadian magazines, it's about
countries' capacities to protect and to promote their own
culture," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian magazine industry endorsed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It's very good news," said Francois de Gaspe Beaubien,
president of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
"American publishers, the foreign publishers, will not be able
to come in and undercut and skim the advertising service market in
Canada," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign magazines account for 50 percent of yearly Canadian
magazine sales, or 350 million Canadian dollars (227 million
U.S. dollars), and 80 percent of newsstand space.

<HEADLINE> Drug Problems Hit Italian Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian drug problem could hit
Turin's chances to host the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, the bid
organizers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from the International Olympic Committee will be in
Turin for three days next week to evaluate the city's bid.
</P>
<P>
But the resignation of the Italy's Olympic Committee (CONI)
president Mario Pescante over the dope-testing fiasco in soccer,
and the fact that the entire remaining CONI leadership could be
disbanded at any moment by Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni,
will not be lost on the IOC officials.
</P>
<P>
The latest blow to Italy's already battered image came on
Wednesday, when the IOC closed down the CONI-approved laboratory
at Acqua Acetosa which has been at the centre of the doping
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will make it decision at a meeting in Seoul on June 19
next year.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Turin and Sion, the other four candidates for the
Games are Helsinki (Finland) in a joint bid with Lillehammer
(Norway), Zakopane (Poland), Poprad Tatry (Slovakia) and
Klagenfurt (Austria).

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Groups Love Movies Dubbed in Their Own Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-eight-year-old farmer
Wei Shaofeng was excited recalling the first time he watched a
movie in which everyone spoke the language he speaks.
</P>
<P>
"The movie seemed to be shot in my village. I understood
everything," said Wei, who is from China's largest ethnic
group, the Zhuang nationality.
</P>
<P>
Baise Prefecture, in western Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
is a settlement of Zhuang people, and the place where late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping staged an uprising and created the Seventh
Red Army in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Audiences were touched when they heard Deng Xiaoping speaking
the Zhuang language in the movie "Baise Uprising." Some watched
the film twice or more, and others walked tens of miles through
mountain paths to see the movie.
</P>
<P>
"We started to dub movies in the Zhuang language in 1958 when
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established," said Wei
Jiguang, an official in charge of ethnic-languages translations
for the Guangxi Film Company.
</P>
<P>
Projectionists acted as simultaneous translators at the
beginning to help audiences understand the plot.
</P>
<P>
"This action has been widely received by Zhuang and other
ethnic groups," said Wei Jiguang.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuang nationality, with a population of 15.43 million, is
the biggest ethnic group in China, and the Zhuang people are
mainly distributed over south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi now has nearly 100 translators working in nine cities
and counties, including the capital city of Nanning, and Baise,
Long'an and Jingxi. The translators work dubbing films into the
Zhuang, Miao, and Tong languages.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1985, the government of the autonomous region has
appropriated a special fund for dubbing. Over the past few years,
over 130 movies annually, on average, have been dubbed into ethnic
languages, attracting an audience of over four million viewers.

BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Footballers are facing
unannounced out-of-competition doping tests starting next year
could a proposal be agreed officially by FIFA and UEFA.

Doctor Michel D'Hooghe, head of FIFA's and UEFA's medical

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows Despite Bad Weather: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said Uganda's economy has grown very well in spite
of adverse weather conditions last year.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday afternoon when addressing the
nation in a big function here marking the 36th anniversary of the
country's independence.
</P>
<P>
"This year, in spite of the adverse weather conditions which
we experienced and a slowdown in the three high growth
sub-sectors in recent years, namely, manufacturing, electricity
and construction, we have still been able to achieve a growth
rate of 5.5 percent," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This is lower than the average of 6.5 percent which we've got
accustomed to in the last 10 years, but it's still high even by
world standards," he added.
</P>
<P>
The annual headline inflation stood at a negative 2.4 percent
in August and the overall balance of payment has improved
recently compared with past years.
</P>
<P>
The gross international reserves have risen to a new high,
equivalent to five months of imports and services, much more than
in 1986 to 1987 when the reserves could only cover three weeks of
imports and services, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni attributed the economic growth maily to good products
management, freeing of exchange rates and liberalization of
trade.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the liberalization of trade, more traditional
crops were exported. Production of coffee, he said, went up from
2.5 million bags per annum to 4.5 million bags.

<HEADLINE> Italy Agrees to Revise Milan Airline Traffic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Friday that Italy had agreed to revise its traffic redistribution
plan for Milan's two airports.
</P>
<P>
The revised plan would ensure a non-discriminatory and
proportionate redistribution of airline traffic between the Linate
and Malpensa airports.
</P>
<P>
"The new rules will ensure effective competition and they will
work in favor of passengers," said the European Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
</P>
<P>
The main elements of the agreement are expected to be
incorporated into an Italian government decree regarding the
airline traffic distribution in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government decided last November to redistribute
airline traffic between Milan's existing airport Linate and the
new airport Malpensa 2000 which is expected to start operating on
October 25.
</P>
<P>
Under that resolution, all carriers with more than two million
passengers a year will continue to fly in and out of the
easily-accessible Linate while other flights will have to fly in
and out of Malpensa, 53 kilometers from Milan, which still lacks
ground transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union (EU), ruled on September 16 that Italy's airline
share-out plan is incompatible with EU law on fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, nine European carriers including British
Airways, Iberia, TAP, Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic,
Austria Airlines and SAS complained to the commission that the
share-out plan was discriminatory and disproportionate.
</P>
<P>
They argued that due to the insufficient road and rail links
between Milan and Malpensa, passengers would continue to choose to
fly Italy's national carrier Alitalia out of Linate, which is
close to Milan town center.

BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Japan will hold a meeting focusing on economic development in both
Asia and Japan, EU officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the EU-Japan cooperation in face of the world
financial problems will be discussed at the meeting in Tokyo for
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among those who will attend are European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioners Martin
Bangemann and Anita Gradin, and Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Koumura.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will center on proposals to kick-start the Japanese
economy as a vital step toward Asian economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, however, will also raise the issue of bad
debts in the Japanese financial system, plans for further fiscal
stimulus and progress toward deregulation and structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union is expected to give Japan a list of some
200 deregulation proposals during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Japanese relationship is hailed as having great
significance in light of the fact that they share over 45 percent
of the world's total gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relationship was forged in 1991 through a
Japan-European Community declaration. The European Community later
developed into the European Union in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Senior Corrupt Official Expelled From Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) recently expelled Yu Fei, former vice chairman of the
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee for
corruption centered on abuse of power for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
Yu used the power of his position to help a company operated by
his daughters earn profits of 28 million yuan from the illegal
transfer of land-use rights.
</P>
<P>
Yu's daughters and a son-in-law formed the Hong Kong Decheng
Company in 1992, but failed to obtain registration to buy, sell or
transfer land.
</P>
<P>
Yu convinced various departments to sell 220 hectares of land
in Huizhou near Daya Bay to the provincial economic and technology
cooperation office in 1991-1992.
</P>
<P>
The transaction was, in fact, nothing more than a front and the
Decheng Co. purchased the land at the exorbitantly low price of
180 yuan per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Yu later abused his power even further by forcing the local
government to acquire the company's land-use rights at 380 yuan
per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Chunqing, spokesman for the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said that Yu's actions not only caused
losses which harmed the nation and diluted the benefits of Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Yu engaged in serious violations of Party discipline," said
Yuan. He urged Chinese officials to steadfastly avoid corruption
and refrain from engaging in actions for personal of family gain.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Be Bridge Between China, Britain: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Friday expressed
his hope that Hong Kong will become a bridge between China and
Britain when the two countries embark on a new era of relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in honor of visiting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair Friday evening, Tung said that a relationship
of friend between China and Britain is vital to Hong Kong, a city
in which the two countries can meet in commerce, in culture and in
friendship to create lasting bonds and benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Hong Kong is now proudly a part of China but Hong
Kong and Britain will always have a special relationship." The
relationship is one of history, of culture and of partnership in
almost every field of social, academic, artistic, sporting and
business endeavor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many thousands from Britain still make their
homes in Hong Kong, and contribute to the society and the
government; many thousands from Hong Kong still live in Britain,
study there and delight in all that Britain offers to the world.
</P>
<P>
Blair Friday also highlighted the striking links between
Britain and Hong Kong in a luncheon speech. He said that Hong Kong
is the 12th largest export market of Britain, and 40 percent of
Britain's exports to China go through Hong Kong. Britain absorbs
80 percent of Hong Kong's investment in Europe. "Hong Kong, once
the barrier, has become the bridge between Britain and China,"
said Blair.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister flew in here from Shanghai Friday
morning on the last leg of his five-day official visit to
China. He is scheduled to leave here Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Slides Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market
continued sliding over the past week, mainly due to the price
retreat of banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
According to a weekly market review, issued Friday by Cyprus
Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the CISCO
All-Share Index closed on Thursday at 424.6, a 7.7 point decline
from last week.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for this week's decline is the price retreat
of banking stocks, as the banking sector accounts for over 60
percent of total market capitalization," the review said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses of the past few weeks, the stock market's
capital appreciation is estimated at 9.1 percent since year end
1997. Taking into consideration the market's dividend yield for
the same period which is preliminary estimated at 4.3 percent, the
total stock market return so far within 1998 rises to 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the mild downtrend that captured the market since the
end of August appears to be reinforced, the review said, adding
that in the absence of further economic developments and in the
light of the current deadlock in the political front of island's
peace process, the stock market does not seem braced up for any
decisive upswing.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this week was 5.6 million
Cyprus pounds (about 11.2 million U.S. dollars), compared to 4.9
million pounds (about 9.8 million dollars) the week before.

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Syrian Crisis To Be Solved Diplomatically: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kemal Kharrazi said here Friday that the most important thing is
to find a peaceful solution to defuse the escalating tensions
between neighboring Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who arrived in Ankara Friday morning following his
visit to Damascus, is exerting efforts to find ways to ease
the mounting Turkish-Syrian tensions.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Kharrazi said that the peaceful
solution to the crisis between Ankara and Damascus is "the
joint wish of all the Muslim countries".
</P>
<P>

Mohammad Khatemi and Kharrazi for their friendly approach to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that "they know our concerns, they are trying to

<HEADLINE> Interview: Spanish Commissioner Upbeat About Trade With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Trade Commissioner
in Hong Kong, Ernesto Tejedor, said he feels confident of and
optimistic about his country's trade with China's mainland and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Tejedor also said he
believed that Hong Kong's economy could soon recover from the
regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
"As a giant market with great potential, China is our target
market in the future development. There are some 50 million
consumers with very high buying capability," the commissioner
said.
</P>
<P>
Tejedor was confident of China's economic future. "There is no
problem so far as its economy continues to develop rapidly with
foreign investments coming in," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy, more closely linked with other parts of
the world, could recover its vitality soon, although it is
suffering from the results of the regional financial crises,
Tejedor said. "As soon as the results of the bubbles economy is
overcome, Hong Kong's economy could soon recover, in maybe one or
two years," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
"It's something temporary and it will not affect our investment
and business interest in the Hong Kong market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish trade with Hong Kong during January-June 1998 was
valued at 1.1 billion U.S. dollars. That indicates Spain should
still see increases in trade in some segments this year even
amidst the Asian economic downturn, Tejedor said.
</P>
<P>
Spain's overall exports to Hong Kong in the first half of 1998
reached 478 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Spanish companies and exhibitors had an enthusiastic and strong
presence at two recent international exhibitions in Hong Kong --
the Asia Pacific Leather Fair and the international beauty
industry trade fair Cosmoprof Asia, in a show of confidence on the
part of Spanish manufacturers in the important Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Some of Spain's beauty product categories are enjoying rapid
growth in Hong Kong and China's mainland, and Spanish leather
goods are available in quality retailers in both Hong Kong and
China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
After Japan, Hong Kong is Spain's second largest trade market
and is just ahead of China's mainland. But Spanish exports to
China's mainland and Hong Kong this year are expected to surpass
those to Japan for the first time in history. "That is really a
good news," Tejedor said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish exports to Hong Kong this year are expected to reach
650 million to 700 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 10 to 15
percent over last year. "This is very good results compared with
the dramatic decrease of our exports to the surrounding
Southeastern Asian countries like Indonesia (80 percent) and
Thailand (50 percent)," he continued.
</P>
<P>
And Spain's exports to China's mainland this year are estimated
to be 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Spain has so far done footwear promotions in China's mainland
only through Hong Kong. About 50 percent of Spanish exports to
Hong Kong are eventually re-exported to China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
But with a second Spanish trade representative office
established in Shanghai in November this year, Spain will begin
next year its leather products promotion in China's mainland for
the first time, he said. Spanish companies will also participate
in Fairs in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to do more business there," he added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Government to Set Free 10,000 Genocide Suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
planned to free about 10,000 genocide suspects, the Rwanda News
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Minister of Justice Faustin
Nteziryayo Thursday night at the end of a one-day meeting in
Kigali, capital of Rwanda, which was attended by the minister,
prosecutors in the country and representatives of the Ministry of
Interior, and the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Nteziryayo explained that most of the 10,000 suspects to be
released are people detained without sufficient charges, or those
whose files are incomplete.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda abides by the rule of law. It is ununderstandable
that someone is kept in prison for four years without any file,"
Nteziryayo said, adding that those who will be released will be
sent back to their communes.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 people will join about 1,500 others who were set
free for different reasons ranging from old age, terminal
illness, to lack of enough evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
It was explained that the decision was first adopted during a
consultative meeting attended by President Pasteur Bizimungu,
cabinet ministers, governors, representatives of political
parties on August 4.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at streamlining the domestic and
external politics of the country, as well as discussing
mechanisms for solving current crucial problems.
</P>
<P>
After a year and a half of trials in the country's criminal
courts, only a small portion of the genocide suspects, about 400,
have been judged, of which over 120 were sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The first 22 genocide criminals were executed in public on
April 25 this year in five different locations of the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Presidential Palace Dismisses Coup Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace Friday dismissed speculations that a coup against the
Joseph Estrada administration may be staged when the president
pays a four-day state visit to Singapore starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre and Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in separate interviews that the coup
is not likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said that Vice President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo will be the acting president during his trip to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, Senator Miriam Santiago hinted that a coup may be
staged when Estrada leaves the country, citing that the vice
president may end up running the country for the rest of the
six-year presidential term.
</P>
<P>
She hinted that some power-hungry opponents of President
Estrada are desperate to cut Estrada's term short and his trip to
Singapore could be the perfect time to stage a coup against him.
</P>
<P>
"That would not happen because firstly, the vice president is a
very democratic person. She knows the limits of her power and she
has also very good relations with the president," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
"I would say such forces are not existing because the Estrada
administration has a very strong support from the people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also branded as "mere speculation" Santiago's warning of
a coup.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any reasonable chance that something as
untoward as a coup d'etat would take place," Zamora said, adding
that Macapagal-Arroyo will only be the caretaker of the government
for a few days.

Antonescu, who met International Olympic Committee (IOC) presid

national Olympic committee can't take such a radical decision."
</P>

Earlier this year, the COR, headed by former tennis player Ion

doping regulations and asked the sports ministry to extend the

<HEADLINE> Race Still Affects Job Chances in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Four years after the
introduction of a democratic South Africa, race still plays an
important part in getting a job in the country, Statistics South
Africa (SSA) has found.
</P>
<P>
White South Africans who did not have matric had a 32 percent
chance of finding a job, while their black counterparts had only
an eight percent chance, according to the national institution's
unemployment report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report found the gap was narrower among blacks
and whites who had matric, with whites having a 56 percent chance
of finding work compared with blacks' 49 percent chance, local
newspaper Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that race was still a key issue in
determining whether those who did not have matric become employed
or not, SSA head Mark Orkin said. But he added that blacks who
had matric were rapidly being absorbed into managerial jobs.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive report, released ahead of the presidential
job summit at the end of this month, highlighted a number of
trends, including a shift in employment from the formal to the
informal sector and high rates of unemployment among the youth,
women and blacks.
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, informal sector jobs grew by 600,000
as the overall economy shed 500,000 formal sector jobs, the
report showed.
</P>
<P>
The informal sector was larger than estimated, with 1.8
million people being employed, while the formal sector hired 7.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
Overall unemployment rose from 20 percent in 1994 to 22.9
percent last year, and joblessness rates were highest among the
youth at 35 percent, the report said. Nonetheless, South
Africa's labor absorption rate continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
In the report, SSA used, for the first time, the International
Labor Organization's definition of unemployed, a narrower
definition than previously used in the country.
</P>
<P>
The previous broader definition reveals that unemployment rose
from 31.5 percent in 1994 to 37.6 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Declares 3 Major Cities No Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army has declared
Kampala, Jinjia and Entebbe, the three largest cities in the
country, a no fly zone which took effect this week for security
reasons, The Monitor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The army commander Major-General Jeje Odongo confirmed the
development Thursday evening and was quoted as saying that this
move is intended to secure national security.
</P>
<P>
"There is growing violation of our air space. This is a
normal action taken for security reasons that bear in mind
threats from Sudan," the army commander noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have communicated and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
of Uganda must by now have alerted international airlines. Any
aeroplane that comes within the no fly zone must consider itself
a possible target," Odongo warned.
</P>
<P>
The report said the move taken by the army may affect all
commercial, charter and scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor also quoted deputy director of the Military
Intelligence Major Noble Mayombo as saying that the air force has
stepped up air defense in light of hostilities from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Sudanese planes had bombed areas in
northern Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang Disagree Over Dead Cattle Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea on Friday denied an
allegation by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
that the oxen donated to the DPRK died as they were fed with harmful
materials in South Korea before shipment in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Calling the allegation groundless, South Korea proposed a joint
investigation with the DPRK into the case.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said Thursday that 71 of the 500 oxen donated by South
Korean Hyundai Group founder Chung Joo-young died and autopsies
showed they were fed with indigestible materials, such as vinyl
and rope, before their shipment.
</P>
<P>
In its investigation report sent to the South Korean Red Cross
Society, Pyongyang said "pieces of vinyl and ropes were found in
the stomachs of all of the dead oxen."
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang also said most of the survivors were in bad condition
and deaths were being reported almost every day.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK urged the South Korean government to punish those
responsible and ensure no recurrence of similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Chung Joo-young brought the oxen with him in June this year
when he went to the DPRK to tap tourism potentials of the
Mountain Kumgang area.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air Ordered to Suspend 138 Domestic Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Friday
ordered Korean Air to suspend 138 flights on 10 domestic routes
for six months from October 25 due to recent spate of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Korean Air passenger planes have been involved in seven
accidents, with 70 passengers injured, in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The flag carrier has been operating 933 flights a week on 25
domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
"These accidents in such a short time caused widespread
uneasiness over air travel and dealt a blow to the national
economy," said the Ministry of Construction and Transportation
Friday after its month-long probe into the accidents.
</P>
<P>
The forced suspension is expected to amount to a loss in
revenue of 40 billion won (29.39 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among the flights to be suspended, 40 are between Seoul and
Pusan, 25 between Seoul and Cheju, 12 between Seoul and Taegu, and
13 between Seoul and Ulsan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will order the suspension of two
international flights a week between Seoul and Tokyo from next
year after a Korean Air plane skidded off the runway at Seoul
Kimpo International Airport narrowly averting a crash.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said it had decided to launch a task force to
conduct safety checks on Korean Air over the six-month suspension
to prevent further accidents.

<HEADLINE> India, Beneficiary of Asian Market Crisis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Losses of other Asian markets
will mean India's gains, as India is poised to be the big
beneficiary of the currency meltdown in the region, said a report
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Equity sell-off and currency falls across Asia have left India
with the third-highest capitalized market behind Hong Kong and
Taiwan, said the report by the All India Association of
Industries.
</P>
<P>
There are various reasons for the shift in the focus of foreign
institutional investors. India is now emerging as one of the
favored destinations for fund managers "at the expense of Hong
Kong, Malaysia and Singapore", the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these developments India has moved up from being
the sixth highest capitalized country in Asia, excluding Japan, to
the third position with market capitalization of 90 billion U.S.
dollars as on August 11, 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from being the third largest market, India also has
significant amount of companies with over a billion U.S. dollars
in market capitalization, the report added.

<HEADLINE> HK to Become Regional Innovation, Technology Center, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong could become, within
 a few years, the center of innovation and technology of the
region, Professor Chang-lin Tien, former chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong could also be a world-class design and fashion
center, a regional center for multi-media based information and
entertainment services, a world center for the development of
health food and pharmaceuticals based on Chinese medicine, a
leading supplier of value added components and products, a
regional supply center for professional and technological talents
and services, and the marketplace for technology transfer between
China and the rest of the world, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
These were some of the key points in a vision outlined here
Friday by Tien when he presented the first report of Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa's Commission on Innovation and Technology
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Tien was appointed chairman of the commission in March this
year when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government must invest at least five billion
HK dollars (641 million U.S. dollars) in fostering innovation and
technology and setting up an Applied Science and Technology
Institute, Tien said at a press conference on the report Friday.
</P>
<P>
To invest less would be a waste of money, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said in the report: "Hong Kong faces a number of major
challenges. There is a strong competition from neighboring
countries for Hong Kong's regional roles in trade, finance,
transportation and communications."
</P>
<P>
"With respect to manufacturing, Hong Kong must strive to
retain, support and further develop high value-added activities.
Hong Kong is also facing stiff competition from other low-cost
economies in the low-end product category," he added.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental challenge is how Hong Kong should position
itself in the knowledge-based global economy of the 21st Century,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tien said, "The vision of making Hong Kong a center of
innovation and technology is a timely response to these
challenges."
</P>
<P>
He said that innovation and technology increased the
competitiveness of firms by introducing more efficient ways to
perform existing activities or creating greater buyer value. They
may be applicable to every aspect of the value adding change.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Hong Kong's science and technology base
should be strengthened. "The government should adapt its
education and manpower policies to address employment issues
brought about by innovation and technological change," he added.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the vision would be a long-term process and a major
challenge to Hong Kong, he said. While industry must make its own
choices and investments, the government should play the role of a
promoter, facilitator and supporter.
</P>
<P>
He suggested in his report that the SAR government should,
among others, build up a human capital, meeting the needs of a
fast changing, knowledge-based economy; enhance technological
collaboration with China's mainland; foster university-business
partnership and low information, financing and regulatory
barriers.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a talent pool and the free flow of
talents is as important as the free flow of capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
And the Hong Kong SAR could not realize the vision by lonely
efforts. "Hong Kong should collaborate with south China cities
like Shenzhen as well as the Pearl River Delta," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tien said that the first report was presented to the chief
executive so that feedback could be collected from the community.
The commission is set to complete its work by June 1999 when it
presents its final report.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Investors to Make Use of Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged investors to
make full use of locally produced items to enhance the country's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the Shoprite retail shop of South Africa in
Mazabuka, southwest of Lusaka, Minister of Local Government and
Housing Bennie Mwiinga said the investors should contract local
farmers and manufacturers to stimulate economic growth, according
to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the influx of South African products like
bananas, carrots and tomatoes which are available locally but
imported into Zambia by Shoprite.
</P>
<P>
If investors are not satisfied with the quality of the local
products, then there is need for the investors and the local
farmers and manufacturers to come up with strategies on how to
produce items to the required specifications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Products such as milk, chickens, vegetables and beef which are
in abundance in Mazabuka should not be imported as they could be
supplied by local farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shoprite General Manager Mauitz Alberts said Shoprite is
dealing with about 103 local suppliers in Zambia and that it is
buying local supplies worth of 6.5 billion Kwacha (about 3.3
million U.S. Dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
So far the shopping chain has employed about 1,200 people in
its countrywide network of shops, according to Alberts.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Hints at Fall Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard, premier of
Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec, gave his strongest
hint that an election might be called this fall, a national
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm tempted to give a go to an election in the fall. And I will
have to make a decision about it very soon," Bouchard was quoted as
saying by Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we have to stop the conjecture. ... And I think that
people are entitled to know whether or not there will be an election
this fall," he said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Bouchard left open the possibility of a spring
election. But he said on Thursday that it is normal for a
government to call an election after four years in power.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's Parti Quebecois (PQ) party was elected on September
12, 1994 for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Several election dates had been suggested. Quebecers could go to
poll as early as November 16, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls indicated that PQ's support in the province was
catching up with the opposition Liberal Party, which got a big boost
when Jean Charest became its leader early this year.

government against signing peace agreements with the
Palestinians.

Meanwhile, Sharon is expected to travel with Netanyahu to
Washington next week, attending the three-way summit meeting of
the U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Provide Aid to Lesotho: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
provide emergency humanitarian and relief assistance to Lesotho,
South African Press Association quoted a U.N. official as saying
Friday in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The.U.N Development Program (UNDP) would organize an
assessment to determine the needs of those worst hit by the
upheavals after a Southern African Development Community (SADC)
military intervention late in September, U.N. resident
coordinator Edward Omotoso said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP would also launch a program to assist and facilitate
the implementation of any agreement eventually reached by the
political parties in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The assistance follows recent disturbance in which heavy
losses were inflicted during the Lesotho turmoil which was
resulted from allegation that the May 23 general election was
rigged in favor of the government.
</P>
<P>
Omotoso said the Lesotho crisis had debilitated the health
system's ability to deliver care to the large numbers of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's main hospital, Queen Elizabeth II in Maseru, was
reportedly forced to transfer patients requiring blood
transfusions to Bloemfontein, South Africa, because the
hopsital's HIV blood testing device had broken down.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organizatio will provide emergency relief
at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital and at St. Joseph Hospital. It
will also supply surgical equipment and assist in monitoring the
outbreak of contagious diseases in riot-hit Maseru and other
parts of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Food Program would provide emergency food aid
by mobilizing international donors and would also assist the
Lesotho government to identify its need for goods, Omotoso added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Approves New Drug for Migraine Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Health Canada has approved a new drug
that promises quick relief for migraine sufferers, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, zolmitriptan, is the latest in a family of molecules
known as triptans that researchers believe block signals from the pain
generator in the stem of the brain.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to treat migraines, so we're pleased to have a new
soldier join the battle," Yves Meloche, a neurologist who heads the
Montreal Migraine Clinic, was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said triptans mark an important evolution in the treatment of
migraines, and approval of the new drug should send a message that
help is available to sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The prescription drug, sold under the brand name Zomig, is a
product of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. It costs 12.95 Canadian dollars
(8.4 U.S. dollars) a pill.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that 3.2 million Canadians suffer migraines. These
headaches affect three times as many women as men, principally because
of hormonal triggers during menstruation and menopause.

<HEADLINE> Canada Heading to Mild Recession Next Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada is heading into a "mild
recession" in 1999, according to a new economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The gloomy forecast, from J.P Morgan Securities Canada Inc., is
believed to be the first to predict that Canada will experience not
just a slowdown in growth, but a shrinkage of gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The predicted slide into recession will drive Canada's jobless
rate up to almost 10 percent and inflation rate down to 0.5
percent, said Morgan Canada's economist Ted Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
At last count, Canada's unemployment rate was 8.3 percent and
the inflation rate 0.8 percent, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Canada will try to revive the slumping economy with
interest rate cuts that will amount to 1.75 percentage points over
the next year, Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate cuts would not be able to prevent the country's
GDP from contracting in both the second and third quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economic growth would resume in the fourth quarter of
1999, but for the year as a whole, total GDP growth would fall 0.1
percent from its 1988 level, according to the forecast.

LUSAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official has
complained that the economy of his country has been badly hit by
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Valenting Kayope told the press here
Thursday when returning from bilateral negotiations with the
European Union (EU) that his country is in the worse economic
position due to its failure to meet some of the donors'
conditions, The Post newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that political dialog should not be one of the
conditions attached to aid.
</P>
<P>
Zambia presented a statement during the negotiations
underlining the fact that conditionalities are not necessary in
securing financial support from the donors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kayope, who led a six-member delegation to Brussels, Belgium,
for preliminary talks, said the African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) and EU negotiations will be based on private sector
investment, trade and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which started on September 30, will review
contractual agreements between the ACP and EU and are expected to
last 18 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday assured non-Muslims and women that his government
would fully safeguard their rights.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the assurance after the National Assembly passed
the 15th Constitutional Amendment Bill which makes the Holy Quran
and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet the supreme law of the country,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
"It is my foremost duty to protect their rights as Islam fully
guarantees the rights of non-Muslims and women," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that the Constitutional Amendment
would break the status quo in the country which "is main hurdle in
the dispensation of justice to the poor and oppressed people."
</P>
<P>
"There is law of jungle prevailing in the country and it could
not be changed under the existing system," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said the enforcement of Islamic Shariah would guarantee
dispensation of justice to the oppressed people at their
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister further said that "we want to make Pakistan
a cradle of peace and social justice where the voice of the
down-trodden is fully and properly heard."
</P>
<P>
"I want that the problems of the poor are resolved and the
cancer of injustice, terrorism, violence and corruption that has
afflicted our society is removed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the 15th Constitutional Amendment Bill, the federal
government shall be under an obligation to take steps to prescribe
what is right and to forbid what is wrong, to eradicate corruption
at all levels and provide substantial socio-economic justice, in
accordance with the principles of Islam, as laid down in the Holy
Quran and Sunnah.
</P>
<P>
Nothing contained in this Article, the Bill says, shall affect
the personal law, religious freedom, traditions or customs of
non-Muslims and their status as citizens.
</P>
<P>
The provisions of this Article shall have effect
notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution, any law or
judgment of any court, according to the Bill.

<HEADLINE> HK Employers Reminded not to Cut Wages for FDHs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Labor Department
Friday reminded local employers of foreign domestic helpers (FDHs)
to pay their FDHs wages in line with the employment contract,
which should be no less than the minimum allowable wage stipulated
by the government.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the department is concerned about media
reports that some FDHs are being recruited and paid at wages less
than the minimum allowable wage of 3,860 HK dollars (494.87 U.S.
dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
"Employers should pay their FDHs no less than the wage amounts
specified in their standard employment contracts," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Employment Ordinance, underpayment of wages is a
prosecutable offense in Hong Kong. An employer who underpays his
employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a
maximum fine of 200,000 HK dollars (25,641 U.S. dollars) and to
imprisonment for one year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman advised any FDH who is being underpaid to
approach the Labor Relations Service of the Labor Department for
advice and assistance. "All complaints alleging underpayment of
wages will be investigated by the department," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reminded employment agencies that they
should not conduct job placements involving FDHs at wages lower
than the minimum allowable wage.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Civil Servants Begin Strike over Minimum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Civil servants in the Lagos
State, Nigeria, began an indefinite strike Friday to press for
the payment of 5,200 Naira (about 60 U.S. Dollars) monthly
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the Council of Industrial
Unions (COIU) in Lagos State directed about 60,000 workers to
stay at home from Friday "until otherwise directed by the
council" due to the continued refusal to respond to the demand
for the payment of minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The COIU issued a three-day ultimatum Monday to the state
government to pay the new wage or face an industrial action
throughout the Lagos State, This Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lagos State Administrator Col. Mohammed Buba Marwa
said the state government was not in a position to pay the new
salaries as approved last month by the federal government for its
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the state's monthly revenue was 930 million
Naira (about 10.8 million U.S. Dollars) while the new salaries
will cost the government 850 million Naira (about 10 million
Dollars) monthly.
</P>
<P>
The face-off took a new turn Wednesday when the state
government sacked COIU Chairman Ayodele Akele on the pretext of
his anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industrial unrest taking place in the Rivers
State entered the seventh day Friday over the same issue and
civil servants in other states may follow suit in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Ruling Council, Nigeria's ruling body, is
reportedly scheduled to hold a meeting next week in Nigerian
capital Abuja to tackle the growing industrial unrest over higher
wages.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Killing of Israeli Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu condemned the killing of an Israeli woman Friday by
a Palestinian man, saying it underlines Israeli demands that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) should uproot terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks after an Israeli woman was stabbed
to death by a Palestinian man in the West Bank. Israeli Radio said
the identity of the 20-year-old victim has not been released, but
Israeli army radio reported earlier that she was an Israeli
soldier.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settler leaders urged the Israeli army to enter the
Palestinian village where the assailant lives to punish his
family, saying that Israel should not give up lands to the
Palestinians and expect them to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at about 11 a.m. (0900 gmt) when
the woman was waiting for a bus at a road crossing near
the Jewish settlement of Tomer, about 10 kilometers north of
the Palestinian-ruled town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, who came from a nearby Palestinian village,
was captured after Israeli security forces opened fire and hit
in his legs, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Palestinian man was being interrogated while
he was treated in an Israeli hospital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several people were injured in the West Bank
town of Hebron as hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted before a funeral for a Palestinian who
was killed by Israeli soldiers in a clash Thursday. The
Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post said the 21-year-old man
was a Jordanian who was apparently visiting his relatives in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The stabbing Friday cast a shadow for the coming Washington
summit next week between Netanyahu, PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, during which an agreement is
expected to be reached on the Israeli second withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting in the West Bank since Israel sealed
off the areas and the Gaza Strip last month following the killing
of two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has repeated its threat to attack Israelis for
retaliation, including committing suicide bombings and kidnaping
hitchhiking Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Confident of Full Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) told visiting
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Friday afternoon that he was
confident of a full recovery of Hong Kong's economy and held a
positive long-term view of the future of the city.
</P>
<P>
During a one-hour meeting, the chief executive exchanged views
with Blair on the latest development of the Asian financial
turmoil, SAR government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Tung also briefed the prime minister on the political and
economic challenges people in Hong Kong had experienced since
Hong Kong's return to China last year.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's economy, the chief executive said that there was
"no quick fix" while fully appreciating the short term economic
difficulties that Hong Kong is facing.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government has been introducing immediate and timely
measures in response to latest economic changes over the past few
months," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The measures include fiscal measures in February, a market
stimulation package in June and measures for the financial market
in August. Altogether they amount to 53 billion HK dollars (6.8
billion U.S. dollars) in terms of tax cuts and government
expenditure, according to Tung.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the measures will not only provide some
degree of relief, but will also lay a solid foundation for the
recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to creating the best possible environment for
our economic development, and we look forward to continuing and
increasing British participation in our economic development,"
Tung added.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also assured Blair of Hong Kong's
commitment to the linked exchange rate and the maintenance of a
free and open market.
</P>
<P>
The SAR has no plan for foreign exchange control, Tung told
Blair.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the initiative taken by the prime minister
in advocating a new global order for the international financial
market," Tung said. "There is a need for concerted efforts among
nations, in particular the G7 members, in order to take the matter
further."
</P>
<P>
Tung also reiterated Hong Kong's commitment to a "strong and
robust framework" that was essential for the development of
democracy in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai earlier Friday on the
last leg of his five-day China visit.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Share Price Up 7.45 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The composite stock price index in
Seoul stock market Friday soared up 7.45 percent, or 22.74 points,
closing at 327.96 due to falling interest rate and rosy prospects
for export following the Japanese yen's rally against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume surged to 113.29 million shares on a turnover of
627.1 billion won ( 471.5 million U.S. dollars). Friday's rise
is the third biggest gain this year after a 8.5 percent reap on
June 17 and a 7.65 percent increase on January 30.
</P>
<P>
Winner outnumbered losers at 625 to 141 while 92 shares remained
unchanged. Foreign investors were selling shares worth 64.1 billion
won (46.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the foreign exchange currency market here,
Friday's exchange rate of the won to the greenback ended at 1,330,
up from Thursday's 1,361 won.
</P>
<P>
The value of Japanese yen also enjoyed a continuous rise with
the exchange rate of 115-116 yen against one dollar on the Tokyo
market Friday. A stronger yen is widely seen to reduce South
Korean import from Japan while making South Korean exports more
competitive in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said the yen's appreciation nearly eclipsed the
recent anxieties over a global economic downturn and the current
crisis in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Official Wounded in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A security official of the
Israel-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded Friday by a
roadside bomb in south Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb was detonated when the official
was driving his car passing the village of Hasbiyeh village in
the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The official was wounded moderately and his car destroyed
in the bombing, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, later claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In response to the bombing, Israeli artillery troops pounded
villages and hilltops in the western Bekaa Valley which is
believed to be hideouts of Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate report of casualties from the
shelling.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in parts of
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's anti-occupation movement spearheaded
by Hezbollah, has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its
proxy SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, some 14 Israelis and 27 SLA militiamen
have been killed during clashes with Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists to Hike Though World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expedition team
composed of some 20 scientists and climbers will hike through the
Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon, thought to be the world's longest and
deepest, during a 50-day exploration.
</P>
<P>
"A great many of the world's wonders are expected to be
discovered during the expedition," Gao Dengyi, head of the team and
executive vice-chairman of the China Association of Scientific
Expedition, said here today at a setting-out ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southeastern region of the Tibet-Qinghai
Plateau, known as "the roof of the world," the Yarlung Zangbo
River Canyon is about 496 kilometers long with an average depth of
more than 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Before Chinese scientists made careful studies of the canyon in
1994 and identified it as the world's largest, the Grand Canyon in
the southwestern United States and the Cerro Colca Canyon in Peru
had been considered the longest and deepest canyons in the world,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some experts from the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping
will use the Global Positioning System and other modern scientific
methods to ascertain the exact length and depth of the canyon, and
will share the data with the whole world, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
"That won't alter the fact that the canyon is the largest in
the world," Gao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The team plans to take Chaqu, a small village on the top of the
horseshoe canyon, as the expedition's base. From Chaqu, the team
will then explore the upper and lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that no one has ever before attempted to hike through
one particular 15-km section in the central part of the canyon,
and their effort will be the first.
</P>
<P>
The team members also plan to find a 60-m high and 150-m wide
waterfall which has been seen by the locals.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to find it. If it does exist, it must be one of
the largest falls in the world," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists on this trek are from various fields such as
atmospheric science, botany, zoology, geography and environmental
science. Rebecca Lee Lok-si, an explorer from Hong Kong and vice
chairman of the China Association of Scientific Expeditions, will
join the exploration.
</P>
<P>
The first exploration of the canyon, which is expected to find
many new plant and animal species, will provide precious materials
for the study of the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, said Yang Yichou, a
geographer with the team.
</P>
<P>
The team sent 20 people on a walk through the canyon in April
this year, he added, and this was good preparation for the
large-scale expedition now.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team also includes television and newspaper
reporters, and a documentary film of the journey will be produced
and released worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police to Investigate Soeharto's Brother-in-law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police are
investigating the issuance of 3 billion U.S. dollars worth of fake
promissory notes, a case which allegedly involves former president
Soeharto's brother-in-law Ibnu Hartomo.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney General's Office, which has found the case to be
criminal in nature, has submitted it to the police," police
spokesman brig. Gen. Togar Manatar Sianipar told Antara News
Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ibnu, who was deputy chief of the National Resilience Board in
1986, allegedly issued fake promissory notes for a housing project
for members of the military.
</P>
<P>
Sianipar said this is a violation of Article 264 of the
Criminal Code on faking valuable notes, which carries a penalty of
a maximum of eight years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The case was uncovered in 1991 when two Americans sued the
Indonesian government because they could not encash the notes.
</P>
<P>
"Ibnu has not yet been investigated as we are still questioning
witnesses. A special team is ready to leave for the United
States," Sianipar said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib has said foreign parties were
pressing the government to pay for the promissory notes.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto resigned on May 21 amid a deepening economic crisis,
protests and an explosion of rioting in Jakarta in which almost
1,200 died.
</P>
<P>
Public pressure to bring Soeharto to account for alleged
corruption and cronyism has mounted since the former president
resigned.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie has set up an official probe into his
predecessor's wealth because of the allegations that Soeharto and
his family amassed a fortune during his 32-year rule and stashed
it abroad.

<HEADLINE> Bank to Offer Automobile Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank
(CCB) has begun offering automobile loans at its Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou branches with ratification from the People's Bank of
China, the first time a state-owned commercial bank has offered
such service.
</P>
<P>
A CCB spokesman said these new loans are expected to expand
effectively market demand, to some extent reverse the declining
trend of national industrial production, and ultimately energize
efforts to reach this year's goal of eight percent economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Since China implemented opening and reform policies in the late
1970s, its automobile industry has developed rapidly with design,
performance and production scale greatly improved. However, due to
inadequate banking services, the automobile market is short of
effective demand, and auto producers are suffering from increased
stock and delayed payment.
</P>
<P>
The bank launched its automobile loans on the basis of
extensive market investigation and feasibility studies, the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The CCB has auto loan experience in offering such loans to taxi
companies, the spokesman said. The bank's extensive business
network in large and medium-sized cities will help the development
of automobile loans.

<P>
The company, Zambia Bottlers, last month increased prices of
its pruducts, coca-cola, fanta and spirte by 80 percent because
of what it said high duty imposed on raw materials.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the Zambian government promised to reduce
the excise duty on Coca-Cola from 25 percent to five percent, but
it failed to meet its promise. In September, the company
suspended its production, but later said it would remain
operational in Zambia despite the controversial excise duty.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it is concerned about the government
inability to honor its promise but expressed its confident that
the government will settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials have branded the company as a
"black-mailer" which has for a long time been evading taxes.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday called on
other countries not to interfere in its internal affairs by
supporting the actions of a group of Malaysians who run down their
national leaders abroad.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
here when commenting on news reports that some supporters of
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim have gone to
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines to seek sympathy for Anwar
who was removed from the government early last month.
</P>
<P>
"We have already told these countries not to meddle in the
internal affairs of our country," Abdullah was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We understand they sympathize with the problem we are facing
now. But it should not be to the extent of supporting
unconstitutional actions aimed at bringing changes in the
government and the country's administration. We can't accept such
interference," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said whatever problems faced by the country,
especially political ones, must be resolved by Malaysians
themselves who understand their roles and responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Not to Intervene on Baht Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Finance Minister
Pichet Panvichartkul said the Bank of Thailand did not act to
influence the movement of the baht on the foreign exchange market
recently, the Thai News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress that no one has done anything to the
baht. The move (strengthening baht) has been made by market
forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
The baht has strengthened sharply over the last six or seven
days and hit a high of 38.44 to the U.S. dollar Thursday from
between 40 and 41 baht against the dollar at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kitt Patpongpibul, deputy governor of the Bank of
Thailand, said the firmer baht signals well for the government to
keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
He said the firmer baht will benefit the government policy of
easing interest rates. He attributed the renewed baht strength to
improved investor confidence which resulted in increased capital
inflows.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Bank of Thailand will keep a close watch
on the baht movement to ensure it would not be too volatile or
move to fast for corporations and industries to adjust themselves.

<HEADLINE> Macao Banker Appeals to Taiwan for Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A celebrated Macao businessman
said here Friday morning that Taiwan authorities should value the
righteous cause of the Chinese nation and hold cross-Straits
political talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that cooperation (between the Communist and
Kuomintang parties) benefits the country, while separation sap its
vitality," said Ho Hau Wah, general manager of the Tai Fung Bank of
Macao and chairman of the Macao Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a gathering marking the 87th anniversary
of the Revolution of 1911 which overthrew thousands of years of
feudal monarchy and paved the way for democratic revolution in
modern China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, leader of the revolution and founder of the
Kuomintang Party, joined hands with the Communist Party in the
1920s to fight against reactionary warlords.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hau Wah acknowledged that cooperation between the two
parties made significant contributions to the Chinese nation,
adding that the reunification of China is the common wish of the
people across the Taiwan Straits, and is a major trend which no
one can resist.
</P>
<P>
The banker expressed his hope that the Taiwan authorities will
make concerted efforts with the mainland to revitalize the Chinese
nation, build a reunified and prosperous China, and contribute
still more to the peace and progress of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth return of Hong Kong (to the motherland) and Macao's
upcoming return will surely provide favorable examples and
facilitate the resolution of the Taiwan question," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hau Wah pointed out that Sun Yat-sen was a great and
patriotic figure who was in opposition to the disintegration of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people from all walks of life in Macao took part in
the gathering at the Kiang Wu Hospital, where Dr. Sun Yat-sen once
worked.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai National flag carrier, Thai
Airways International (THAI), announced Friday that it has
canceled orders for one Airbus Industrie A330-300 and two Boeing
777-300s as part of its cost-reducing and fleet adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came after Thai Transport and Communications
Minister Suthep Thueksuban ordered the order withdrawal on
September 30 to help save Thailand's expenses, Thai News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
THAI said it would inform Airbus Industrie and Boeing
Commercial Airplane of its decision to cancel the order for the
aircraft which had not been on production lines.
</P>
<P>
The national airline had placed a deposit of 148 million
dollars for the aircraft and was required to pay another 216
million dollars to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
The three aircraft were part of the 21 new planes that THAI had
planned to buy during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
THAI said it would instead lease new aircraft as part of its
fleet modernization. Earlier reports said THAI was making another
negotiation with Airbus Industrie to change a purchase contract
for five Airbus 300-600s into an 11-year lease deal.
</P>
<P>
The five aircraft were already completed but THAI had yet to
find a budget to pay for their delivery. THAI has already paid 9
million dollars in fine plus interest for having the delivery
delayed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Hire More Teachers to Curb Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
plans to employ another 4,000 primary and secondary school
teachers this year in a bid to curb the rising illiteracy,
Tanzanian education minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing teachers and students of the Tabora Teachers
Training College recently, Minister of Education and Culture
Professor Juma Kapuya said that to arrest the situation, the
ministry has worked out strategies to employ more teachers in
both government and private schools by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The east African country's literacy rate has dropped from 87
percent to 75 percent due to the shortage of teachers, said
Kapuya.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Friday, the ministry is carrying
out a census on the number of teachers who are on the government
pay-roll because it seems that many teachers who have resigned or
died are still listed.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the census is completed, the government will employ
teachers in primary and secondary schools at village, district
and regional levels, said Kapuya.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report shows that crippled by heavy external
debt, Tanzania is spending less and less on education.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 teachers so far have been employed this year,
the minister said, adding that the goal for this year is 6,000.

JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli woman soldier was
stabbed to death by a Palestinian in the West Bank Friday and the
attacker has been caught after being shot and wounded by Israeli
security forces, radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was attacked when she was waiting for a bus at a
road crossing near the Jewish settlement of Tomer, north of the
Palestinian town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, who came from a Palestinian village near
Tomer, was caught after Israeli security forces opened fire and
hit in his legs, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told Israel Radio that the Palestinian man
repeatedly stabbed the woman before she fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the attacker is being interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers
erupted again Friday in the West Bank town of Hebron, where
a Jordanian visitor was killed and several Palestinians were
injured in clashes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting in the West Bank since Israel
sealed off the areas and the Gaza Strip last month following
the killing of two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas
by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has repeated its threat to attack Israelis for
retaliation, including committing suicide bombings and kidnaping
hitchhiking Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenyan Economic Recession to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy will remain
depressed into the next year, the Central Bank of Kenya said in
</P>
<P>
The lasting recession is "mainly because of the problems in
coffee and sugar production and the adverse effects of the recent
bomb blast in Nairobi," said the economic review.
</P>
<P>
The looming global recession is also expected to further erode
prospects for Kenya's economic recovery by reducing consumers
demand and depressing the prices of the country's exports, it
added.
</P>
<P>
"The depressed performance is evident in almost all sectors,"
the bank said, citing such key reasons as current fiscal
imbalance, lack of working capital, reduced investments caused by
high cost of domestic funds and low investor confidence, poor
state of infrastructure and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by about 1.5
percent in the year ending in June 1998 compared with 2.3 percent
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance is also reflected in low trading at the
Nairobi Stock Exchange, whose share index stood at 2,853.1,
declining by 17.7 percent in the year to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is estimated to have grown by only 0.6 percent in
the year to June 1998 compared with 4.4 percent and 1.2 percent
in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in agricultural growth stems from the lz"=
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee ex in the firstive months of 1998
declined by 24.7 percent to seven billion Shillings (117 million
U.S. Dollars) compared with 9.3 billions Shillings (155 million
Dollars) over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports of horticultural products declined by 11.6 percent in
the year to June 1998 compared with 4.5 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Tea production, however, continued to recover particularly in
the first half of 1998 with its output increasing by 29.4 percent
in the year to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from tea export also rose by 89.0 percent to 15.5
billion Shillings (2.58 billion Dollars) in the first five months
of 1998, thanks to the favorable international price and the
El-Nino rains that boosted output in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's manufacturing output growth rate went down to 1.4
percent in the year to June 1998 from 3.7 and 1.9 percent in 1996
and 1997 respectively, resulting from the sector's inability to
compete with cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade, restaurant and hotel estimated to have
fallen to 3.1 percent in the year to June 1998 from 8.0 percent
and 3.9 percent in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Transport, storage and communication declined to 1.3 percent
in the year to June 1998 from 4.0 and 1.8 percent in 1996 and
1997. The poor performance in the sector was mainly caused by
the poor infrastructure, particularly roads.
</P>
<P>
Finance and insurance in the country is also estimated to have
declined to 4.6 percent in the year to June 1998 from 7.1 percent
and 5.2 percent in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank vowed to take appropriate measures
including reducing the public debt to avert any further decline
in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government's domestic debt rose to 151.8 billion
Shillings (2.53 billion U.S. Dollars) at the end of August, from
150.4 billion Shillings in July, the CBK said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy ran into trouble last year after the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a key loan on the
grounds of official corruption and poor "governance" in the
country, a decision which sent interest rates soaring.

<HEADLINE> UN Refugee Agency Slams Report by US Rights Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) on Friday refuted a report by the U.S.-based
Human Rights Watch which criticized the UNHCR's efforts to help
Myanmar refugees stranded in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that Human Rights Watch did not check with
the UNHCR before releasing their report this week, since it did
not take into account recent developments," the UNHCR office in
Bangkok said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The group said the UNHCR had been "unnecessarily weak in its
efforts to challenge the Thai policies that undermine refugee
protection."
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statement said the report had ignored the Thai
government's invitation to the agency to expand its role in
helping the Myanmar refugees on the Thai-Myanmar border and open
new offices in three provinces there.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR had announced earlier that it would open three
offices in three Thai border provinces to help resettle the
refugees at the Thai government's invitation.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the UNHCR's expanded role at the border, in
close cooperation with the Thai government, will contribute to
enhancing the protection of the refugee population," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 Myanmar refugees are stranded on
Thailand's western border with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials had said earlier that Thailand, as a
host to refugees and displaced persons, recognized the need for
international solidarity and burden-sharing as the solution to
refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also called on the international community to provide
financial support that would enable the UNHCR and related
organizations to cope with the refugee problem more effectively
and sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Myanmar refugees, there are some 38,000
Cambodians in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, 8,177 displaced persons have been
voluntarily repatriated under the UNHCR assistance, and some
37,000 have returned spontaneously.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Concludes Mediation Efforts in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Karrazi left Damascus Friday morning for the Turkish capital city of
Ankara, after a two-day mediation efforts to defuse the tension
between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In statements to newsmen before departing Damascus, Karrazi
described his meeting with President Assad as satisfactory and
constructive.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his assessment of the Syrian-Turkish problem,
Karrazi said there were appropriate grounds for its solution,
expressing hope that a practical settlement will be found.
</P>
<P>
President Assad Thursday welcomed the Iranian mediation
efforts, underlining that Syria supported and called for dialogue
as a means to resolve controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
Due to arrive in Ankara Friday, the Iranian Foreign Minister
will hold talks with Turkish officials to continue his mediation.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the current chairman of the Organization of Islamic
Conference which embraces Syria and Turkey as members.
</P>
<P>
The current tension between Syria and Turkey erupted early this
month, with Turkey accusing Syria of harboring militants of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in its territory, but the
Syrian side categorically denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been massing troops along its border with Syria and
threatened to use force to uproot those alleged military training
camps of the PKK inside Syria if Syria does not stop supporting
the Kurdish rebels in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for an independent Kurdistan in
southeastern Turkey in the last 14 years.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former U.S.
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake has tried to facilitate a
peaceful solution to the on-going Ethio-Eritrean conflict, an
Ethiopian government spokeswoman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said that Lake held talks with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other prominent
officials Thursday after he came from Asmara in his shuttle
diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the border dispute
between the two countries in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman didn't reveal any details about the talks
between the U.S. envoy and the Ethiopian officials.
</P>
<P>
She said that as scheduled the U.S. team would return to
Eritrean capital Asmara.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Tripartite Talks Again Make No Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The third round tripartite
negotiations of Cambodia's three major political parties ended in
a stalemate again Friday, but they all agreed to hold a summit
meeting under the auspices of King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, chief representative of the Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) and co-minister of interior affairs, told reporters that
Friday's talks yielded no concrete results because the two
opposition parties -- the Funcinpec and the Sam Raincy Party (SRP)
-- stuck to their positions held since July's election, which made
things complicated.
</P>
<P>
"But the participants agreed to hold a three-party summit
meeting under the auspices of the King in order to break the
current political deadlock," Sar Kheng said.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who met with the French
ambassador to Cambodia Friday, said he remained optimistic about
breaking the current political deadlock which he described as a
"temporary atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The CPP, which is the winner of the National Assembly election
on July 26 but does not gain the two-thirds majority needed to
form the government on its own, is eager to see a new government
installed so the government can regain international legitimacy it
lost after last year's faction fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Funcinpec and the SRP have claimed that the CPP's electoral
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The two
parties insisted their allegations be thoroughly investigated
before the National Assembly can hold first official meeting.
</P>
<P>
The working groups of the Funcinpec and SRP still demand a
change in the seat calculation formula and a general amnesty for
all opposition politicians and supporters facing court action for
their roles in anti-government demonstrations staged after the
election.

STOCKHOLM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Nordic stocks dropped sharply
Thursday over fears that a weaker U.S. dollar and flagging American
domestic demand would hurt firms depending on export sales, the
press here reported Friday.

The Helsinki Stock Exchange index plummeted by 8.2 percent,
Stockholm closed down 6.7 percent, Oslo fell by 5.75 percent

percent.

Investors were worried by American Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's warning that the outlook for the U.S. economy
was not so bright, with the possibility of a lower demand. In
addition, American investors have sold off large placements in
peripheral countries.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Falls Further in Kenya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Month-on-month overall
inflation in Kenya continues to fall to 4.0 percent in September
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said.
</P>
<P>
The decline came after the sustained slowdown in the expansion
of money supply, stability in the Shilling exchange rate and
recently better supplies of basic foods, according to the October
issue of the CBK Monthly Economic Review available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The underlying month-on-month inflation fell to 8.4 percent in
September from 9.8 percent in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Three months annualized underlying inflation remained low at
1.6 percent last month. The average annual underlying inflation
remained at 9.3 percent in September, nearly the same level as in
August.
</P>
<P>
The overall inflation also declined substantially in
September, mainly thanks to the improvements in the supply of
basic foods, particularly to the lower income group.
</P>
<P>
Three months annualized overall inflation fell to negative
16.7 percent in September from negative 13.6 percent in August
and average annual overall inflation declined to 8.1 percent from
8.4 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said in order to keep the underlying month-on-month
inflation at below five percent by June 1999, it will maintain
tight fiscal policies to curb the expansion in the broad money
supply in the year to June 1999 at below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling on money supply takes into account the expansion
in domestic credit that results from the recent reduction in cash
ratio requirement.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the decline in the international prices of
essential imports, particularly fuels, had also contributed to
the fall in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Kenya experienced double digit inflation during the early
1990s, with the three month's annualized rate
reaching a three digit figure of 101.1 percent in
June 1993 but by late 1994 inflation subsided to single digit.

<HEADLINE> Merged Zambian Opposition Urged Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian opposition parties have
been urged to concentrate on finalising their merger before
holding inter-party talks with the ruling Movement for Muti-Party
Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Dante Saunders, Secretary General of the Zambia Democratic
Party, said in an interview here Thursday that the opposition
parties needed to merge into one strong group to be able to
bargain with the MMD in the proposed inter-party talks, Times of
Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Saunders criticised the MMD's motive to resume the talks,
saying the ruling party had realised that the opposiiton was in
the process of coming together and deliberately brought up the
idea of resuming the failed talks to disturb the merger.
</P>
<P>
The MMD and three of the country's 18 opposition parties, the
United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president
Kenneth Kaunda, the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) and the
National Party (NP), Wednesday set October 21 as the date for a
preparatory meeting to resume the inter-party talks which flopped
last year after Kaunda was arrested for an alleged involvement in
the foiled military coup in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The talks are designed to solve in the country's political
process some outstanding issues such as re-registration of voters
and amendament of the existing constitution proposed by the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Saunders also invited other interested politicians to join the
planned merger if they wanted to defeat the MMD during the next
presidential and parliamentary elections in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties in the past weeks had been moving to
merge so that they could speak with "one united voice" to finally
dislodge the MMD from governing in the general elections.

<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Journalists
Association (ACJA) on Thursday called for respecting and
protecting the rights of journalists to report.
</P>
<P>
The association stressed that the Party and the people depend
on journalists to provide a voice to ensure correct public
supervision.
</P>
<P>
An ACJA committee for guaranteeing the legitimate rights and
interests of journalists sent telegrams to the association's
subordinate units in northeastern China's Heilongjiang Province
expressing support for Xiao Zhizhuo, a female journalist who was
viciously attacked while conducting a recent interview on an
unauthorized construction project.

responded with verbal abuse. Xiao's glasses were broken and she
sustained an injury to her right eye in an ensuing melee involving
construction workers.
</P>
<P>
The ACJA urged concerned departments in Heilongjiang to
expedite the investigation of the incident and render appropriate
punishment to those involved. The association also called on the
general public to support and assist journalists attempting to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan in a meeting with Yugoslavian ambassador to China Slobodan
Unkovic today expressed deep concern over developments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the Kosovo issue is the internal affair of
Yugoslavia, and the threat to use of force by some countries has
aroused intensive worries, he said.
</P>
<P>
It should be noticed, Tang indicated, that massive military
conflicts have terminated in the region, and the situation at
large has tended to ease. And the relevant sides are striving to
seek a settlement of the issue through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Given the above facts, Tang said that any military action
targeting Yugoslavia will violate the United Nations Charter
and other universally acknowledged international regulations, and
will do nothing but make the situation more complicated, or
even give rise to serious outcome.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is China's consistent stand to oppose
resolutely the use of force or threat to the use of force in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The international community, China included, is making enormous
efforts for seeking a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis,
with the relevant sides undertaking diplomatic consultations.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that all sides will take still more active
measures to implement the relevant UN resolutions, pay more
attention to the human factors, and cooperate in a constructive
way with the international community, "all of which will
undoubtedly contribute to the final settlement of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government hopes that the Kosovo crisis will be
resolved peacefully as early as possible on the premise of
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia, and ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of
various ethnic groups in the region, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Unkovic said the Yugoslavian government highly
appreciates China's principled stand toward settling the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is opposed to military interference from other
countries, and will continue to adopt measures to create
conditions for the settlement of the issue by political means, the
ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Slides Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market
continued sliding over the past week, mainly due to the price
retreat of banking stocks.
</P>
<P>
According to a weekly market review, issued Friday by Cyprus
Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the CISCO
All-Share Index closed on Thursday at 424.6 points, suffering 7.7
points decline since last Wednesday (September 30) when the
market closed at 432.3 points.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for this week's decline is the price retreat
of banking stocks, as the banking sector accounts for over 60
percent of total market capitalization," the review said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses of the past few weeks, the review said, the
stock market's capital appreciation is estimated at 9.1 percent
since year end 1997. Taking into consideration the market's
dividend yield for the same period which is preliminary estimated
at 4.3 percent, the total stock market return so far within 1998
rises to 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the mild downtrend that captured the market since the
end of August appears to be reinforced, the review said, adding
that in the absence of further economic developments and in the
light of the current deadlock in the political front of island's
peace process, the stock market does not seem braced up for any
decisive upswing.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions for this week (5 trading
days) was at 5.6 million Cyprus pounds (about 11.2 million
U.S. dollars) compared to 4.9 million pounds (about 9.8 million
dollars) the week before.

<HEADLINE> China's Hydrological Systems Reduce Flood Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts calculate that
losses of more than 40 billion yuan (about 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars) during this summer's deluge along the Yangtze River
could have been greater if not for information provided by the
country's hydrological systems.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xuewu, director of the Hydrological Bureau under the Yangtze
River Water Control Commission, said that the bureau's
hydrological systems along the Yangtze provided timely and
accurate information for decision-making during this summer's
flood fighting.
</P>
<P>
This information enabled flood-control departments to drop
plans to control floods, and thereby reduced the number of flood
victims by over nine million people and the flood-affected area by
more than 16,000 sq km, according to Ji.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the six flood-peak periods along the
Yangtze alone, hydrologic information helped reduced losses by
more than six billion yuan (about 725 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ji said that his bureau has 866 hydrometric stations, 481
water-level stations and over 4,200 precipitation monotoring
stations along the Yangtze River, forming a large information
network.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central and provincial governments have
earmarked some 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) annually
to the development of hydrological systems along the Yangtze.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Organizations Expand Regional Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China and France strengthened
links between local organizations in the two nations earlier this
week when the Nord-Pas de Calais Region in the latter opened a
Beijing representative office.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to China Pierre Morel attended the opening
ceremony on Thursday and said the establishment of the office
represents a major step in implementing the partnership between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac visited China last year and
leaders of the two nations agreed to expand cooperation between
local governments and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nord-Pas de Calais became the first local French region to open
a representative office in Beijing following last month's visit by
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. The Regional Development
Agency (RDA) of Nord-Pas de Calais will operate the office.
</P>
<P>
The Channel Tunnel links the region, one of France's major
transportation hubs and industrial areas, with England. Nord-Pas
de Calais accounts for 30 percent of the country's textile
production and 13 percent of total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Morel said that increasing cooperation between local regions is
a rapidly expanding aspect of Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Three other French regions have also set up long-term
cooperative ties with cities and provinces in China, including
ties between Rhone Alps and Shanghai, Bretagne and Jinan in east
China's Shandong Province, and Toulouse and Chongqing Municipality
in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government should not be the sole player in
enhancing Sino-French relations. He stressed that governments at
various levels, organizations and individuals must join forces to
expand cooperation in all fields, including culture, trade,
finance and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The regional council founded the RDA in 1984 as part of an
effort to create favorable conditions for the region's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
RDA President Christian Bataille said the representative office
in Beijing will promote China business opportunities for French
companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. The
agency will provide information, consulting to help reduce risks
facing small enterprises entering the vast Chinese market. The RDA
will also help French companies find cooperative partners.

Nord-Pas de Calais, the third largest export region in France,
Calais forged friendly ties with Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China, some 14 years ago. The region's trade volume with
China is expanded to hit four billion Francs (741 million US
dollars) over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The RDA has helped small French companies obtain numerous
orders from China, including a contract with a Tianjin cement
plant for heavy machinery valued at 7.4 million US dollars. The
agency has also helped a number of French companies establish
joint ventures throughout China.
</P>
<P>
China exported goods valued at 556 million US dollars worth of
goods to Nord-Pas de Calais over the past few years, with the
region exported 71 million US dollars worth of wheat, wool,
chemicals and steel products worth 71 million US dollars to China.
</P>
<P>
Lille Mayor Pierre Mauroy met with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin during his September visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Eugene Johnson, the RDA official in charge of the China market,
said that small- and medium-sized enterprises account for 30
percent of Sino-French joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the importance for regional development agencies
to provide assistance to related enterprises," according to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Morel noted that local regions in the two countries continue to
enjoy fruitful cooperation. The Shanghai office for the Rhone Alps
Region has helped over 80 French companies to find
cooperative partners in China.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Tianjin municipal official pointed to the highly
satisfactory cooperation between the city and the Nord-Pas de
Calais, saying that China needs advanced technology and equipment
developed in the French region, and noting that the two sides are
considering expanding cooperation to the environmental protection
sector.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Determined to Solve Problem with Syria: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has said that Turkey this time is determined to solve
the protracted problem of Syria's support to Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Daily News, which was
published Friday, Cem said that Turkey has made up its mind
to take some effective measures to ensure peace and tranquility
of its borders.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion there is a determination. This is the best
definition for the present situation," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Turkish government and military leaders
issued stern warnings against the Syrian administration over the
alleged Damascus' backing of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK) militants.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said that Turkey has to make preparations for a
war against Syria if there is really a need for that.
</P>
<P>
Cem noted that the fact Syria provides financial and
military support to the PKK is well-known to all and Turkey,
as a sovereign country, realized that the situation had gone
beyond all the limits of patience.
</P>
<P>
"How many lives would we have saved and how many billions
of U.S. dollars would we have spared if we had shown this
determination 10 or 12 years ago?" Cem stressed.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Syria should halt its support for
separatist terrorism and put a full stop to this problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish foreign minister said that Turkey's
determination is by no means aimed at the Syrian people who
are regarded by Turks as their own brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem with the Syrian people. Our problem
is with the Syrian administration. They should get into action
and relations should get into a better mode." he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have long been at odds over the PKK problem
which the Syrian government has repeatedly denied. Disputes over
water resources and border issues are also factors preventing
normalization of their ties.

<HEADLINE> Building Industry Becomes Pillar of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The construction industry has
witnessed steady growth over the past two decades and has emerged
as the pillar industry of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
The sector accounts for more than 60 percent of China's total
fixed asset investments, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector's incremental output accounts for 6.7
percent of the nation's gross domestic product, holding fourth
place following the industrial, agricultural and commercial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The industry has completed housing with total a floor space of
4.4 billion sq.m. over the past 20 years, as well as a large
number of infrastructure projects which have greatly improved the
living standards of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita floor space for urban residents jumped to 8.8
sq.m. in 1997, up dramatically from only 3.6 sq.m. in 1978, with
the figure for rural residents rising from 8.1 sq.m. to 22 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The expanded industrial scale has substantially increased the
number of employees in the sector, with recent statistics showing
that the 44,000 construction firms at the fourth level and above
employ more than 21 million people.
</P>
<P>
The industries equipment and technical level has improved
greatly and China currently ranks at forefront worldwide in terms
of constructing large buildings and highrise complexes.
</P>
<P>
China's construction industry has opened ever wider to the
outside world. The seven construction contracts firms in the
industry consummated in 1978 involved totalling of only two
million US dollars of funds. However, the 8,442 contracts signed
in 1997 were valued at 11.4 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Plot to Kill Lesotho's King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa turned down
allegations that there was a plot to assassinate Lesotho's King
Letsie III, The Citizen newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force (SANDF) spokeswoman
Laverne Machine said Thursday that the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) task force was still protecting the
palace in Lesotho capital Maseru as a priority.
</P>
<P>
She also denied reports of plans by the SANDF to storm the
palace Thursday to remove protesters who have been camped out
there since August 4.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was an opposition ploy to advance its cause and
to demand for a government of national unity, said the report
quoting a senior South African government source.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the alleged assassination plan, Lesotho's
opposition alliance spokeswoman Mamello Morrison said: "The
information was given to us by a private secretary to the king
because they had received very disturbing information that they
wanted to find out what the implications were."
</P>
<P>
Morrison said the call from the private secretary was coupled
with information received by protesters that the SADC task force
was planning to storm and bomb the palace Thursday in an effort
to get rid of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
She said that opposition leaders had spoken to South Africa's
political party and church leaders to ensure something is done to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have successfully done that because it was happily
denied by the people in Pretoria," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she knew who was planning the assassination, the
opposition spokeswoman said she did not.
</P>
<P>
However, she directly implicated Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom
Thabane in the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the negative attitude he has displayed during the
talks so far, I can't put plans like this from him," she said.
"He was the only one opposed to plans (for a transitional
structure) so far."
</P>
<P>
The king's brother Seeiso Seeiso said: "The whole thing came
about yesterday (Wednesday). I don't know where it came from, but
there was a request that His Majesty be taken to a safe area.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say for certain who the source of the rumor is and I
don't know how true or valid it is," he said. "But there are
some people who are uncomfortable with his position. It seems to
be a repeat of the events of 1990 when King Moshoeshoe was taken
out of the country."
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Environment and Women Affairs Minister Mamoshebi
Kabi was applauded Thursday when she questioned the need to have
a monarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kabi told the Lesotho National Assembly that the time had come
to seek a mandate from the electorate to decide the future of the
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen quoted a source close to SADC-brokered talks as
saying that people were raising these issues to create a
diversion from the real issues at hand, such as the establishment
of the transitional structure for new elections.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho ruling party and its opposition rivals agreed last
week to hold fresh general election in 15 to 18 months, but they
failed to agree on who would run the country until then.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, the parties agreed to consider a SADC
proposal on the establishment of a transitional structure to
prepare for the elections. The rival parties will meet again
next Monday.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The border police force in
southern China's Guangdong Province has set up a frontier command
post as part of an effort to ensure the smooth return of Macao
to China.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the border police force organized an exercise to
sharpen the frontier guards' ability to handle potential
situations in Hengqin, an islet close to Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Jieyuan, commander of the frontier troops in
Guangdong, more than 500 soldiers have been sent to Zhuhai to
reinforce public security work in that city, adjacent to Macao.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the number of frontier guards stationed on Hengqin
islet has increased to some 250 to crack down on illegal border
crossings into Macao.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that Guangdong and Macao police have established close
ties and increased cooperation, and the two sides meet once every
month to brief each other on major events and discuss ways to
fight illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
From January to September this year, border police in Zhuhai
seized 583 people trying to sneak into Macao, 79 of whom were
"snakeheads," or organizers of illegal border-crossing
activities.

<HEADLINE>   Study: Exercise Reduces Stroke Risk by 46 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 8 (Xinhua) -- People who did the
equivalent of an hour's brisk walking every day had a 46 percent
lower risk of stroke than people who did not exercise, according
to a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a survey of 11,000 Harvard graduates between
1962 to 1990, also found that those who did the equivalent of a brisk
half-hour walking most days had a 24 percent lower risk of stroke than
those who did not.
</P>
<P>
"Walking, stair-climbing and participating in moderately intense
activities such as dancing, bicycling and gardening were shown to
reduce the risk of stroke," Dr. I-min Lee of the Harvard School of
Public Health said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We found that doubling the effort showed an even greater reduction
in stroke risk," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lee and his team reported their findings in the latest issue of
the American Heart Association's journal Stroke and recommends people
to get at least half an hour of such moderate exercise each day.
</P>
<P>
"We know that physical activity can reduce blood pressure and help
slow the development of clogged arteries, keep weight down, reduce a
person's cholesterol levels and help reduce the clotting of blood,"
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Stroke is the third-biggest cause of death in the United States,
after heart disease and cancer.

<HEADLINE> Incompetent College Teachers Laid-off in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South China University of
Science and Technology has removed 65 professors from their
positions for poor teaching performance.
</P>
<P>
These professors, part of a staff of 328 tutors for
postgraduates, recently had their teaching and research abilities
appraised.
</P>
<P>
The university, based in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, is one of the province's pilot universities
for introducing competitiveness into their personnel management.
</P>
<P>
This marks a big step forward in the province's reform of the
personnel system in institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most teachers at these institutions did not have
to worry about being discharged, for school authorities never
fired any teacher.
</P>
<P>
The situation is quite different today.
</P>
<P>
The province's Zhongshan Medical Sciences University has also
introduced reform into its employment system by dividing teachers
into three classes -- excellent, good and poor -- according to
their performance.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial authorities, the reform aims to
improve faculty quality in universities and raise overall
teaching standards.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Opposition to End Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition Grand National
Party (GNP) Friday announced it will return to the National Assembly,
or parliament, to fight against what it called the ruling camp's
politically-motivated scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Our party has decided to return to the National Assembly. We will
now move our struggle to the National Assembly to stage a stronger and
more effective protest," GNP Chairman Lee Hoi-chang said at an
unexpected press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The GNP has been boycotting the 100-day regular session of the
parliament due to open on September 10 to protest at an ongoing
prosecution authorities' corruption probe, which the opposition
described as the ruling camp's politically-motivated scheme to weaken
and break up the GNP by use of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
In August, the prosecution authorities found that the GNP had used
leading figures of the Office of National Tax Administration to
collect huge sums of money in donations to support its presidential
candidate Lee Hoi-chang during last year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors are investigating into the behaviors of some 200
people, including legislators and high ranking public servants, as
well as executives of banking institutions and corporations.
</P>
<P>
The latest confrontation between the GNP and the ruling camp of
the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and the United
Liberal Democrats (ULD) focused on members of Lee Hoi-chang's
presidential campaign team who allegedly tried to turn the
presidential campaign into Lee Hoi-chang's favour last year by
asking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to stage
a shootout at the truce village of Panmunjon.
</P>
<P>
The GNP vowed to mobilize all legal means to clear various
allegations and demanded an investigation to determine whether
President Kim Dae-jung himself contacted the DPRK just before the
presidential election last year.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to have an independent counsel appointed for an
unbiased investigation on politicians and on presidential campaign
fund, said GNP leader Lee Hoi-chang at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's decision came just one day after the ruling camp
announced Thursday that it will open a unilateral parliamentary session
from next Tuesday if the GNP continues to boycott the assembly when
many urgent issues have to be resolved.

<HEADLINE> British PM Supports HKSAR's Efforts to Ride Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday expressed his support to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government for its resolve to lift
Hong Kong out of the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I pay tribute to the Administration here and its leader for
the manner in which they have sought to guide the SAR through a
crisis not in any one economy's ability to control," Blair said at
a luncheon shortly after he flew in from Shanghai on the last leg
of his five-day official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Saying people naturally look for immediate answers for urgent
problems, the British prime minister warned: "This is not a time
for re-writing the rules that made Hong Kong one of the envies of
the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is a time for holding firm to basic principles, being
truthful about what can and cannot be done," Blair said in a
luncheon address. He praised the SAR's efforts to maintain Hong
Kong's dollar peg and China's determination not to devalue the RMB
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current crisis, he noted, Hong Kong continues to
stick to its long-held vision of an open world economy, with
liberalized trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome Tung Chee Hwa's renewed commitment in his policy
address to open markets, without exchange controls, and to Hong
Kong's standing as an international center for trade and finance,"
said Blair. "You are absolutely right to stick to openness."
</P>
<P>
He praised the SAR government for its policy decision not to
cut, but to increase the education budget in times of economic
difficulties, a decision which is "right for the long term."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister enumerated many advantages Hong Kong has to
help itself through the crisis, including a transparent system of
regulation, prudent macroeconomics policies, open and liberal
environment for trade and investment, a well-capitalized banking
system, an open and disciplined administration, a level playing
field, and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Hong Kong's political transition has been a success
despite the buffeting in its economy by the global financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"On Hong Kong, those who predicted failure have been proven
comprehensively wrong. The handover has been a success," he told
the luncheon, jointly organized by the British Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted: "China has honored her commitment to Hong Kong's
autonomy. Hong Kong, once the barrier, has become the bridge
between Britain and China."
</P>
<P>
More than one year after he last came to Hong Kong for the July
1 handover ceremony, the British prime minister also told the
audience what else has impressed him here in Hong Kong: "The rule
of law is robust. Basic freedom and rights continue to be
respected and exercised. The people of Hong Kong speak out and
demonstrate on issues they care about."
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Hong Kong, the British prime
minister is scheduled to meet with SAR officials and visit a
shopping center and a temple before he leaves on Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> British PM Urges Global Efforts to Withstand Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday called for all economies in the world to work
together to withstand the financial crisis, which has expanded on
a global scale.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis is global and the methods of dealing with
it must also be global," said Blair in a luncheon speech shortly
after he arrived in Hong Kong on the last leg of his five-day
official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He said it is urgently needed to "tackle successfully both the
immediate consequences of the crisis and its longer-term causes."
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the major economies of the world, mainly G-7
countries, must work closely together for prudent financial
policies and sustainable economic growth, said Blair.
</P>
<P>
He continued:" It is time to look afresh at the international
financial system, to devise new rules and codes of practice to go
with it, which not only measure up to the volume of capital moving
about global financial markets but also its speed."
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said the fast and enormous flow of
capital around the globe called for a need to review the Bretton
Woods institutions, which have served the world well for 50 years
and still deserve continued support today.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there is no one simple or quick answer to
the crisis, but added: "It is a challenge to which we must respond
imaginatively and above all rapidly."
</P>
<P>
"We can only move forward on a globally agreed basis, by
including representatives of the wider international community,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair called on the world community to respond to the financial
crisis by working together to maintain openness and overcome
problems, not by retreating into protectionism and isolation.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Jamaican Friendship Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with visiting Jamaican Prime Minister Percival
Patterson and said that the two countries should usher in the next
century with long-term, sustained and stable Sino-Jamaican
relations.
</P>
<P>
By so doing, President Jiang added, the two countries will
continue to support each other and expand the scope of their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that there is no conflict of
interest between China and Jamaica. On the contrary, both
countries are confronted with the same tasks of advancing their
economies and enhancing the standards of living of their peoples,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciations for the Jamaican government's
adherence to the "one China" stand, and gave thanks for its
support of China on the issues of Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 26 years ago,
substantial achievements have been scored in bilateral cooperation
in the fields of politics, economy, culture and other fields,
Jiang said, adding that the two countries shared views on many
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the Jamaican government for its efforts to
safeguard national sovereignty, rejuvenate its economy, and
increase the standard of living for its people.
</P>
<P>
He cited Jamaica as a major Caribbean nation, saying that it is
playing a more important role in international and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that although China has suffered some of the
worst flooding in history, this will not hinder his country in
meeting its economic growth goal, and the reforms and opening-up
have not been stalled.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Patterson said that his current visit is aimed
at consolidating existing Jamaican-Chinese friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the turn of the century, strengthening
bilateral ties will not only bring benefit to the people of the
two countries, but will also be conductive to the peace and
stability of the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Patterson spoke highly of China's great economic
achievements, and called the country a stablizing factor in the
Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China has exported 100 airplanes
of various models to more than 20 countries and regions in Asia,
Africa, Oceania and South America, with a combined transaction
value of more than 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exports include the Yun-7 and Yun-8, and Yun-12
airliners, according to the China Aero-Technology Import and
Export Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Yun-12 plane has been sought after by importers for its
high quality, reliable functioning, and low price. British and
U.S. aviation administrations have given airworthiness
certificates to this model, which can be widely used for
air-drops, agriculture, forestry, geological prospecting and
sightseeing, the corporation said.
</P>
<P>
China has set the goal of independently developing large
airliners through co-production with the world's leading
airplane manufacturers, a source said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Continued Stability of Yuan Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 ( Xinhua) -- A report released today by the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said China should continue to
maintain a stable yuan exchange rate in 1999 and pledge to the
world that the currency will not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
The autumn report of Economic Trend Analysis and Prediction,
compiled by a number of noted Chinese economists, said that a
stable yuan is good for China's economic development and will help
maintain its balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
"Both domestic and international economic conditions since the
start of the Asian financial crisis prove that China's policy of
not depreciating its currency is correct and has profound
significance," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Experts said in the report that the negative impact of the
financial turmoil is still developing and that the economies of
most Asian countries and regions are suffering negative
growth. Hong Kong's economy is also facing grave difficulties,
while at the same time international speculators are flexing their
muscles to attack any detected weak spots.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they noted that a stable yuan exchange rate is
crucial to maintaining stability in the international economic
order and easing the consequences of the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With respect to China's domestic economy, sharp investment
increase decided by the government will surely push up price
indexes, while a stable yuan will avoid a recurrence of excessive
price hikes and benefit the sustained, rapid and healthy
development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about a possible devaluation of the yuan continue, the
report says, but none of them has proved true and the Chinese
currency is still doing very well. At present, China enjoys stable
foreign exchange reserves, a surplus in foreign trade, and
balanced international payments. These factors will enable the
yuan to remain stable in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met today with visiting Jamaican Prime
Minister Percival Patterson and said that China hopes to further
consolidate and strengthen Sino-Jamaican ties.
</P>
<P>
The two nations enjoy good relations despite the
geographical separation, and differing historical traditions and
social systems, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Government and people appreciate the
strong support Jamaica has given China on many leading issues,
especially the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated that China has always held that all countries,
big or small, poor or rich and strong or weak, should be equal
politically. China's foreign diplomacy centers on the tradition
of treating others equally, earnestly and reasonably.
</P>
<P>
He said China is fully prepared to further explore the
potential for consolidating and strengthening exchanges and
cooperation with Jamaica in the political, economic and cultural
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Li said Prime Minister Patterson's visit will play an important
role in the further development of China-Jamaica relations.
</P>
<P>
Patterson pointed to Li's successful visit to Jamaica in
1995. He said the Jamaican Government established diplomatic
relations with China in 1972 and fully recognizes that there is
only one China in the world.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that China, one of the world's most
influential nations, has unswervingly supported Jamaica and other
developing countries. He added Jamaica and other countries in the
Caribbean will never forget China's assistance.
</P>
<P>
Paterson reaffirmed that the Jamaican Government is fully
prepared to engage in joint efforts with the Chinese Government
and contribute to the further development of bilateral ties.

<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an exhibition
center and related basic facilities for the '98 China
International Air Show in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong
Province, have been almost completed, an official of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The city, which will host the air show between November 15-22,

build an 23-km eight-lane highway around the local airport, a
press center covering 8,000 sq.m. and a number of hotels and
conference centers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Plans to Export Coffee Through Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan coffee exporters are in
negotiations with Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) over the using of
Kenya's auction facilities to sell their coffee abroad, Kenya
Coffee Auction spokesman Tony Valentine has said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Valentine as
saying lately that Uganda's Bunsuna Coffee Exporters are seeking
admission to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange to sell Ugandan robusta
coffee.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how much coffee is involved yet, but the
organization wishes to use our market, and they are quite
impatient to get moving," said Valentine.
</P>
<P>
Uganda produces mainly robusta coffee, and if the proposal is
accepted, it would mean that robusta would be sold together with
Kenya's arabica coffee, a new development for the auction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
CBK spokesman Paul Kivila said that the board will decide in
two weeks whether Uganda's Bunsuna Coffee Exporters will be able

<P>
Following the complete liberalization of the Ugandan and
Tanzanian coffee industries that did away with central auctions
and official grading, the farmers and exporters in Kenya's two
east African neighbors are having a hard time selling their
coffee.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's coffee export is expected to drop to 2.6 million bags
for this season from last year's 4,237 million bags due to a fall
in production for bad weather, the state-run Uganda Coffee
Development Authority has forecast.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Sino-British Partnership Progressing (1)  by Yu Haisheng and Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair, the
first British head of government to visit China since 1991, today
headed for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the
last leg of his five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, Blair and his Chinese counterpart
Zhu Rongji signed a joint statement pledging that China and
Britain will be engaged in setting-up a comprehensive Sino-British
partnership.
</P>
<P>
The statement outlined the framework for the development of a
fresh bilateral relationship oriented to the 21st century, local
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on a state visit to Britain by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the second half of next year,
which Zhu and Blair believe will bring steadily growing
Sino-British ties into a "new phase."
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Blair also agreed to establish a Sino-British Forum to
enable people from all walks of life in the two countries to
contribute their ideas to the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The sound development of Sino-British ties has by no means been
a smooth process. During Hong Kong's transition period, the unwise
practices of the British Hong Kong authorities jeopardized
relations and caused serious concern to the people who care about
the future of Hong Kong and the Sino-British relationship.

<P>
Chinese leaders have stated on many occasions that the two
sides should, proceeding from the fundamental interests of people
of both countries, handle their relationship from a long-term
perspective.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair expressed hope that Hong Kong can be a
"bridge" rather than an obstacle between the two countries after
he assumed his post in May of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to China's important role in the world, and
said that Britain should strive to forge a "wider and
constructive" relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visited Britain in late March this
year, the first such visit by a head of Chinese government in 13
years. During his visit, Zhu made it clear that there will be no
barriers to the growth of bilateral relations after Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
Since the return of Hong Kong, Sino-British relations have
experienced warm ties. Five British cabinet members have come to
China since the beginning of this year in a bid to boost political
and economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the improvement and development of Sino-British
political relations has created a favorable atmosphere for
expanded economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now China's second largest trading partner in the
European Union (EU). It also ranks first in the EU in investment
in China this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries have facilitated exchanges in
cultural, technological and military areas.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain, as permanent members of the UN Security
Council, enjoy wide-ranging common interests and
responsibilities. Establishing a comprehensive Sino-British
partnership will have a positive impact on world peace and
development.

<HEADLINE> Some 70 Percent of S.Korean Companies Cut Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 percent of South Korean
companies have reduced their staff or planned to do so this year due
to the ongoing financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under a survey on 424 Seoul-based firms, 69.7 percent have cut down
the number of employees or planned to do so within this year since
South Korea entered the so-called IMF period after it borrowed 58
billion U.S. dollars from the international body last December, said
the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of firms have cut their staff by morer than
10 percent while another 39.4 percent said they have excessive
manpower, showing that the number of layoffs will continue rising this
year.
</P>
<P>
The nation, whose unemployment rate stood at 1.6 million in
September, is seeking to the jobless rate under eight percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
The survey said 65.7 percent have cut their staff due to poor
management performance while 23 percent made layoffs as a part of
restructure.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy, has to restructure its
economy, open market and shut down ailing financial institutions
within this year in accordance with the agreement it signed with the
IMF last December for a rescue loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> No Prisoners Escape During Massive Prison Relocations: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- During massive relocations of
50,000 prisoners in Jilin, Heilongjiang and Anhui provinces and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region during this summer's flood
season, not a single inmate escaped, Chinese Minister of Justice
Gao Changli said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This can be regarded as a miracle in the history of
rehabitating and educating the criminals," Gao said at a national
tele-conference commending individuals and organizations of
judicial administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
Even in the two provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi, where the
floods were most severe, no prisoners ran away, and no
unusual deaths or major epidemics occurred during the
floods, either, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this year's devastating floods, 75 prisons and 21 labor
camps in eight provinces and regions were seriously affected and
many have had to be moved elsewhere. Total economic losses at
prisons amounted to 3 billion yuan (361.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Faced with flood disasters rarely seen in history, prison
wardens were on high alert and stuck to their duty to maintain
order and safety at the institutions under their charge," the
minister claimed.
</P>
<P>
No major accidents occurred in the flood-affected areas this
summer, and crimes perpetrated inside prisons were lower than in
the same period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Awards were presented today to 48 organizations including the
Yueyang Prison in Hunan Province and 121 individuals working in
prisons and other judicial administrative bodies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Busy Planting Autumn Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers, from north to
south, are busying planting autumn and winter crops, and
agricultural technicians say current weather conditions are most
conducive to planting.
</P>
<P>
The planting period will last until December and the main crop
is wheat that will be harvested next summer, said an official of
the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The country will plant more than 30 million hectares of grain
during this period, including 26 million hectares of wheat this
autumn and winter, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Though blessed with high temperatures and sufficient soil
moisture now, the official noted that this season's planting still
faces some unfavorable conditions such as developing drought in
the northern part of the country. The poor quality of wheat seeds
in some places and seriously damaged water conservancy projects
will also pose planting problems.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth planting and a good harvest next summer, the
ministry recently published an emergency notice urging local
governments to fight against drought and improve planting
quality.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural departments also warn of more severe plant
diseases and insect pests this autumn and winter. The notice asks
local governments to spread the use of seed-coating and seeds
mixed with pesticides to ward off insects.
</P>
<P>
Because of the severe floods this year, China's summer grain
harvest fell to 113.1 billion kilograms, 11 percent less than last
year's figure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Study Finds More Teens Starting to Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. teenage
smokers have increased by 73 percent in the past eight years, a
study released Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a survey of more than 78,000 people of all
ages, found that 1.2 million people under the age of 18 became
daily smokers in 1996, the latest year for which figures were
available. The figure was 708,000 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"More than 3,000 young people under the age of 18 start smoking
every day... some people began smoking daily at 10 or 11 years of
age." said Gary Giovino, chief health expert of U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the survey and
released the findings of the study.
</P>
<P>
Giovino blamed the increase of teenager smokers on the
cigarette companies, whose marketing agents "took on more of a
youth focus in the late 1980s, with the Joe Camel campaign and
some Marlboro promotional campaigns aimed their products at young
people."
</P>
<P>
Tobacco usage in television and movies during the same period
was also a factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
If current trends continue, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention warned, about 5 million youths will eventually die from
a smoking-related disease.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Undertakes Program for Post-Flood Field Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Rural Development
Board (BRDB) has undertaken a comprehensive program for post-flood
field service network, said a BRDB press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program includes a plan to disburse 5.5 billion taka (about
117 million U.S. dollars) as micro-credit to the flood-affected
clientele.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be disbursed among cooperative farmers, assetless
men and women in the flood-hit areas in the agricultural sector
for increasing income generating activities through its
development project.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a task force was formed to ascertain the damage and
losses as well as needs for providing loans and other facilities
to the cooperators and assetless people, the release stated.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes a plan to disburse one billion taka
(about 21.28 million dollars) as credit support to the agriculture
sector and 3 billion taka (about 63.8 million dollars) to non-farm
activities under poverty alleviation projects of the BRDB.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, BRDB has planned for an extra allocation
of 1.5 billion taka (about 31.9 million dollars) to meet the
post-flood situation.
</P>
<P>
Within the BRDB areas of cooperation, over 1.7 million
cooperators and assetless men and women in 50 districts have been
affected by the devastating flood, which has caused an enormous
loss to them.
</P>
<P>
The requirement for post-flood rehabilitation under the BRDB
program has been estimated at 10.22 billion taka (about 217.4
million dollars), the release said.
</P>
<P>
The BRDB disbursed 400 million taka (about 8.5 million dollars)
for agricultural rehabilitation and income generating activities
among the flood-affected cooperators during the flood.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the credit facilities, periodical training is
being held to impart skills to the cooperators, assetless men and
women, and from this program, flood-affected people are getting
training allowances as financial help.
</P>
<P>
The recent ten-week-long floods had destroyed crops on 580,000
hectares of land in the country's 52 severely-affected districts,
causing a loss of about 40 billion taka (about 851.1 million
dollars), while farmers lost 3.5 million tons of crops including 2
million tons of rice, according to the Department of Agricultural
Extension.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain to Meet in 1999 Davis Cup First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Coming off last month's
embarrassing performance, the United States has a tough task
ahead when it meets Britain in the first round of the 1999 Davis
Cup.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will travel to an undetermined site in Britain for a
first-round tie to be held from April 2 to 4, 1999, as the Davis
Cup begins its 100th year. Ironically, the U.S. met the British
Isles in the first Davis Cup in Boston in 1900.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is coming off last month's 4-1 loss to Italy in the
semifinals in Wisconsin, the United States. The Americans were
playing without stars such as Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and
Michael Chang and now face Britain, which can field a much better
team than the Italians.
</P>
<P>
Playing in the prestigious World Group for the first time
since 1992, Britain has two top-15 players in Tim Henman and Greg
Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Britain tie will be a rematch of the 1978 Davis Cup
final, which the Americans won for one of their record 31 titles.
The U.S. has won the last three meetings, leads the series 10-7,
and has not lost to Britain since 1935.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. wins, it would host either Australia or Zimbabwe
in a quarterfinal tie in Boston.
</P>
<P>
In other first-round ties in the 1999 World Group, Sweden
meets Slovakia, Germany hosts Russia, the Netherlands plays
France, Spain takes on Brazil, Belgium entertains the Czech
Republic, and Italy hosts Switzerland.

WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. former heavyweight
champion Michael Dokes Pleaded innocent Thursday in a Las Vegas
court after being accused of attempted murder in the beating of
his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
Dokes was arrested on August 31 after his fiancee went to a
hospital for treatment of injuries. She told police she was
beaten, sexually assaulted and held against her will by Dokes.
</P>
<P>
The victim suffered several facial fractures and was so
severely beaten that her face was unrecognizable, police said.
</P>
<P>
Dokes was charged with attempted murder, sexual assault and
false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Dokes held the WBA heavyweight title in 1982 briefly, but his
career was ruined by drug arrests and cocaine abuse. He made a
comeback and fought for the heavyweight title in 1993, but was
stopped by Riddick Bowe in the first round.

<HEADLINE> Thai National Team Members Face Doping Testing Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Games doping control
test committee will test athletes from 10 sports, and those found
positive could be sacked from the Thai national team.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Varin Tanthasuppasiri, in charge of the Games doping
control, said his team would start tests this month by examining
samples of athletes' urine from athletics, boxing, cycling, sepak
takraw, shooting, swimming, weightlifting, windsurfing, rugby
football and wrestling, the Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on steroids and other prohibited substances. We
will be especially concerned for certain sports such as boxing,
wrestling and weightlifting as athletes tend to depend on banned
substances," said Varin.
</P>
<P>
The committee will select only 50 urine samples, which will be
sent to the official doping control center of the Asian Games at
Mahidol University. The 13th Asian Games will be held in Thailand
in December.
</P>
<P>
"If any athlete tests positive, I will submit the name to the
Olympic Committee of Thailand to decide on the punishment.
</P>
<P>
"They could even end up being deleted from the national team
list," he said.
</P>
<P>
Varin also said he had to begin the test in October because
steroids become effective when injected six to eight weeks before
a competition.
</P>
<P>
"However it is possible that some athletes might use some
substances to clear the steroid in their urine not long before a
competition. So we have to be very careful about this case too,"
Varin added.
</P>
<P>
Medically, the use of steroid can be very hazardous to the
body, but negative effects will not be immediately obvious but
occur especially at between 30 and 40 years, after most athletes
have retired from competition.
</P>
<P>
"The accumulation of steroids in the body can cause high blood
pressure, fat in blood vessels, liver cancer and heart attacks.
You need a lot of money to cure these sicknesses, and sometimes
you must be under medical supervision for the rest of your life,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is not worth using these banned substances just to
become famous or successful in a competition. I would like Thai
athletes to be aware of the negative aspects of using steroids,"
the doctor said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Tumble At This Week's Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Low demand and a higher
Australian dollar have pushed wool prices under a new
500-Australian-cent benchmark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Auction prices have now fallen 34 percent over the past 12
months and are at their lowest level in five years in Australian
currency terms.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange's (AWEX) eastern market indicator
shed 12 cents to close at 497 Australian cents (305.8 U.S. cents)
a kilogram clean this week.
</P>
<P>
About 18.9 percent of the 83,368 bales on offer were passed in.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters' (ACWE) said in its
weekly market review that there were no visible signs of a
recovery in consumer demand in a climate of continuing global
economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"The depressing trend in auction prices reflects the reality of
available supply far outstripping a very poor level of demand for
wool," the review said.
</P>
<P>
"In this environment, the sharp appreciation of the Australian
dollar against the U.S. dollar ... was thought to be the reason
for the very large drop in auction prices on Thursday for 22
micron and coarser types, which traditionally comprise the staple
diet of orders for China," the ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
About 76,900 bales are rostered for next week's sales at
Australia's cities of Goulburn, Melbourne and Fremantle.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Panama will set up a reserve
to protect endangered animals in the Panama Canal area, a senior
official of wild life protection said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The animal haven will be located near the area of Howard Air
Base and will extend over 3,500 square meters," said Olga Gaitan,
president of the Animal Friends Association (AFA).
</P>
<P>
The future reserve's land reverted last year to Panamanian
sovereignty from the U.S. government in accordance with the
Torrijos-Carter treaties, which was signed in 1977 by general Omar
Torrijos and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
This zone will provide a veterinary clinic, a mini-jungle for
exotic endangered animals, and a domestic animal shelter, Gaitan
said.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Renewable Resources Institute, in charge of
protecting Panama's wildlife, has listed endangered species of
animals such as the "titi" monkey, the American tiger, the harpy
eagle, parrots, lizards, rabbits and toucans, and many others.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for these animals to live unprotected, that's
why we must protect them at the haven we will develop near the
Panama Canal," Gaitan said.

BUENOS AIRES, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said Thursday that he insists on resuming negotiations on
sovereignty of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands during his upcoming

</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask England to abide by the U.N.

Menem will pay an official visit to Britain by the end of this

But official sources from the British government have

APEC members should separate internal political conflict from
the regional forum, Friday's Nation newspaper quoted Deputy
Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra as saying at a function.
</P>
<P>
"An internal matter should not be an obstacle to summits of the
region, even though we are all concerned about the situation in
the country," he said, adding that "Malaysia should go ahead with
hosting the forum".
</P>
<P>
Leaders of several countries have voiced concern over human
rights abuses in Malaysia after the sacking and detention of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.

<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said he might not attend the
APEC forum. Philippine President Joseph Estrada also reportedly
threatened to boycott the summit scheduled for November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Not to Particiapte in NATO Strike on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bulgarian official said
Thursday that his country will not take part in any possible
military strikes on Yugoslavia "for the time being" over the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the parliamentary
Foreign Policy Committee, Committee Chairman Assen Agov said that
the Bulgarian parliament is ready to react depending on the
developments in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that even in case of a military intervention by NATO,
this country will not be exposed to a direct threat.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is hardly expected to launch air strikes on Kosovo
before Monday," Agov said.
</P>
<P>
For more than three hours, the MPs of the Foreign Policy
Committee were listening to information presented by the National
Intelligence Service and the President's Foreign Political
Secretary, Vladimir Filipov.
</P>
<P>
The Committee will have a debate on Kosovo before next
Thursday. "I will insist that the Foreign Minister and the
Defence Minister take part in it," Agov said.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said that
his country will pursue consistently its policy of remaining
cautious on the Kosovo issue and will act with consideration of
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"We must be ready to act in any circumstances in the course of
development of the Kosovo problem and to take timely decisions;
our stand should be well-grounded and consistent," Kostov was
quoted as saying by the Bulgarian news media.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that
he had authorized U.S. participation in NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia if the latter did not stop its offensive against ethnic
Albanian separatists fighting for independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our
interests and to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the
Balkans," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's move
did not indicate that any military action was imminent.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Open Offices in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plans to open offices in three
Thai provinces along the Thai-Myanmar border in an effort to solve
the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The offices will be set up in Mae Hong Son, Tak and
Kanchanaburi provinces as soon as possible, the UNHCR said in a
statement available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We expect UNHCR's role at the border, in close cooperation
with the Royal Thai Government, to contribute to enhanced
protection of the refugee population," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR and the Thai government have been criticized for
failing to give adequate protection to more than 100,000 Myanmar
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the criticism, the statement said the report had
not taken recent developments into account, particularly in terms
of the agency's expanded role at the Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principle of solidarity and burden-sharing, the
Thai government reached a common understanding on working
arrangements with UNHCR in May this year to enhance the agency's
role in resolving the problem. The arrangements include witnessing
admission, assisting Thai authorities in registration, assisting
in the relocation of temporary shelters and helping Myanmar
displaced persons with safe return.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements are expected to be implemented this month with
the Thai government and the UNHCR jointly monitoring its
development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the UNHCR will also be granted free access to
refugee shelters.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials have said that Thailand, as a host to
refugees and displaced persons, recognized the need for
international solidarity and burden-sharing as the solution to the
refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has called on the international community to provide
financial support which should go beyond emergency relief and
should focus on reintegration and monitoring returnees to ensure
the continuity of repatriation and to prevent the recurrence of
outflow.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Myanmar refugees, there are some 38,000
displaced Cambodians in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, 8,177 displaced persons have been
voluntarily repatriated under the UNHCR assistance, and some
37,000 had returned spontaneously.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Insists UN Must Authorize Military Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy stepped out of line with its
NATO allies Thursday when Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
military intervention to force a cease-fire in Kosovo must be
authorized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Rome to parliament, Prodi said Italy would continue
to push for a "peaceful" settlement of the hostilities in the
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"The government intends to maintain its commitment to a
political and peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo," Prodi
said, and any military action will "have to be legitimate,"
according to decisions taken by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said Wednesday that member
countries agreed the alliance could intervene in Yugoslavia
without further U.N. Security Council approval.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, the council adopted a resolution demanding
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic halt hostilities in
Kosovo and start negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a discussion between alliance members," a NATO
spokesperson in Brussels said Thursday, commenting on Prodi's
speech today. "I believe we will find a common position which all
member countries can agree with," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament, Prodi said Italy had recently
stepped up diplomatic attempts to obtain full implementation of the
U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy was committed to "providing full protection to
the affected populations and alleviating the humanitarian tragedy
through every means available."
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, in which ethnic Albanians have been
fighting for independence since early this year, military
intervention has been suggested by some countries, but the use of
military force in the war-afflicted Kosovo area is still under
debate.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Air Force Tightens Air Defenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Amidst reports of sighting of
unidentified aircraft over the Northern theater of operations, the
Sri Lankan Air Force has further increased anti-aircraft defenses.
</P>
<P>
Air Force sources Friday said they had taken the claims of
sighting aircraft and helicopters seriously.
</P>
<P>
Defenses in Colombo and other areas threatened by possible
Tamil terrorist air attacks had been provided increased security,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months detection of unidentified echoes by
Naval vessels operating in the Northern waters fueled speculation
that the Tamil rebels had acquired a helicopter, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the rebels could have acquired
small aircraft which can be smuggled in a knocked-down condition,
said the sources, adding that they ruled out the possibility of
the rebels producing their own aircraft. But they could build a
mission for a single suicide attack.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate state in the north and east
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Global Turmoil Calls for Worldwide Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Financial officials from 182
countries and regions unanimously endorsed a strategy of
cooperation to strengthen the international financial system in
their week-long debate on how to deal with worsening regional
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The financial instability, which started 15 months ago in
Southeast Asia and quickly spread to Japan, Russia and across the
Pacific to Latin America, drew the attention of finance ministers
and central bank governors during the joint annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees there is a way out of the crisis. It is an
uphill way, but it is there," said IMF Managing Director Michael
Camdessus following Thursday's closing session.
</P>
<P>
"We have undoubtedly moved a long way forward in identifying
the steps needed to establish a more durable global economic
system and for addressing the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a ``systemic'' crisis and prompt action was
needed. The financial officials agreed that a global crisis
requires a global response. The architecture of the system needs
to be strengthened to adapt to new challenges.
</P>
<P>
Five key elements of the new architecture -- transparency,
sound financial systems, involvement of the private sector,
orderly liberalization of capital markets, and internationally
accepted standards and codes of good practice -- were endorsed at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed a series of meetings held by the Group of
Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations, the Emerging Market
economies, the Group of 24 developing nations, the Group of 22
parties of the industrial countries and emerging markets, as well
as the IMF's Interim Committee and the IMF-World Bank joint
Development Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, industrial countries were called to provide
continuing impetus to sustainable growth at home and abroad, and
especially in Japan, which has been confronted with serious
economic recession. They were also encouraged to take more bolder
and quicker measures to promote economic recovery while repairing
the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Russia has called for a solid program of stabilization and
reform, while developing nations showed determination to maintain
and strengthen their macroeconomic policies and adjustment
programs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank were urged to play a stronger role
in dealing with the crisis by increasing their financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Besides the principle statements, there were also some concrete
actions. Japan announced a 30 billion U.S. dollar loan guarantee
program to the crisis-hit Asian nations in a bid to help quickly
overcome the difficulties and revive their economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazil will receive a total of 30 billion dollars or
more as the IMF tries to prevent a financial catastrophe in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, President Bill Clinton, who called for a
financial system with a new architecture. He pledged to win the
republican-dominated Congress's approval of an additional 18
billion dollars to increase IMF resources. But Congress to date
still insists on preconditions that may be difficult for other
nations to accept.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which has put together 137 billion dollars in bailout
packages for nations affected by market turmoil so far, expects to
gain an additional 90 billion dollars in resources to prevent a
global financial instability and greater consequences of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
To some criticism that the meeting produced so many promises
and lack of concrete actions, Camdessus said that strategies have
been made and policies have been in place, what is needed most is
implementation of these strategies and policies.

considerable economic expansion starting in 1999, providing that
"international crises" do not have a dampening effect.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that if economic turmoil were to hit the
European Union, then the repercussions would be extremely serious
"given the strong integration of our industrial system."
</P>
<P>
It said that a crisis within the EU would affect a large number
of sectors and drag down the entire manufacturing system.
</P>
<P>
But Prometeria said that a deterioration in the economy of
eastern European countries would have "marginal effects" on
Italy's industrial production.
</P>
<P>
If the US economy were to fall into recession, Prometeria said
the effects would be limited to a small number of sectors which
have recently expanded into the US market.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the turbulence on the international scene, Prometeria
foresees an increase in domestic demand, especially for investment
products and durable goods, which will allow industrial production
to maintain a healthy growth rate," the research center
concluded.

<HEADLINE> 925 Sri Lankan Soldiers Killed, Missing In Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22 army officers and
903 soldiers had been killed or missing in action during Tamil
rebel attacks last week in the Northern Province, according to the
Island newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
A further 25 officers and 401 soldiers had been wounded in the
action and at least 717 Tamil terrorists were killed and 1,100
others wounded, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) had
transferred the bodies of 684 army personnel from the Tamil rebels
to the government, the report quoted the military sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The town of Kilinochchi, which was held by the troops since it
was captured in November 1996, was assaulted last week by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who wanted to
capture this prime location on the main supply route from South to
North.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were successful in forcing the troops to retreat to
Parandan where the fierce battle continued, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With the rebels concentrating on the re-capture of Kilinochchi
government troops were able to recapture Mankulam, a town over 10
kilometers South which had been earlier held by the LTTE rebels
and the troops failed to recapture it despite five months of
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The troops, who have been engaged in clearing a 75-kilometer
supply route to the North under a major offensive codenamed
"Operation Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) since May last year,
have recaptured only 45 kilometers so far.

<HEADLINE> No Ground for Military Action Against Yugoslavia: Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy reiterated Thursday that
there are no premises for military action against Yugoslavia and any
such action must be legitimized within the framework of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Romano Prodi made the statement in a telephone
conversation with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov,
according to the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said, "The Italian government believes there are no
premises for military action against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia." Any military action of this nature "must be
legitimized within the U.N. framework", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Italy fully supports U.N. Security Council resolution
1199 and is asking for its full application, especially for the
withdrawal of Serb police and military units and an end to the
repression of ethnic Albanians."
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Primakov briefed Prodi on the meeting
between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday morning, and Belgade's
willingness to accept a mission sent to the southern province of
Kosovo by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
with no reservations attached.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed his hope that on the Kosovo issue, Russia
could get more support and cooperation from Italy.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a NATO source said the withdrawal of Serb forces
has been "totally inadequate because there are still 11,500 men in
special units in the province" and thousands of army troops.
</P>
<P>
"In the 15 days since the U.N. resolution was passed, Milosevic
has not respected the request of the international community,"
added the source.
</P>
<P>
The source also said it seemed that the civilian population is
still being intimidated and that Milosevic's units "appear to be
preparing to stay in the area during the winter".
</P>
<P>
From early this year, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, accounting
for 90 percent of Kosovo's population, have been fighting for
independence. The issue has drawn international attention, and
NATO has been threatening to launch air strikes against
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough on How Spiders Make Their Silk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Danish scientist has
discovered how the spiders make their silk. Experts said this
discovery might help chemists produce spider silk on an
industrial scale.
</P>
<P>
According to October's issue of Discover, Fritz Vollrath, an
evolutionary zoologist at the University of Araneus in Denmark,
has found that the spiders' method is remarkably similar to the
process used to manufacture industrial fibers such as nylon:
spiders harden their silk by acidifying it.
</P>
<P>
Spider silk is stronger than any known natural or synthetic
fiber. Scientists would love to know how to mass-produce it.
</P>
<P>
But unlike the silk from silkworms, spider silk will never be
harvested directly from the animals. They are cannibals, you can't
keep thousands of them in a little room.
</P>
<P>
Therefore Vollrath's finding may help chemists produce spider
silk on a large-scale.
</P>
<P>
Further more the spider silk is easily recycled, when you're
done with your shirt fabricated with spider silk, you just eat it
as the spider eats its own web.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes for Fair, Constitutional Process in Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday expressed the hope that the house impeachment inquiry of
his behavior would be fair and constitutional.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way
that is fair, constitutional and timely," said Clinton soon after
the House of Representatives authorized an open-ended impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"Personally I am fine," Clinton said. "This is beyond my
control. I have to work on what I can do. I trust the American
people. They almost always get it right. They have for 220 years."
</P>
<P>
The republican majority promoted their Watergate-style inquiry
in a debate that lasted far beyond the scheduled two hours.
</P>
<P>
Democrats argued in vain to limit the investigation to the
Monica Lewinsky affair and finish it by the end of the this year.
</P>
<P>
The controversy has "hurt our nation and it has hurt our
children," House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said on the house
floor. "We must not compound the hurt."
</P>
<P>
Republicans rejected democratic arguments that Clinton's
attempt to conceal an affair with Lewinsky was not impeachable
conduct, saying the issue was not sexual conduct but lying under
oath.
</P>
<P>
The republican resolution directs the Judiciary Committee to
investigate "whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of
Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States of
America."
</P>
<P>
The house rejected by a mostly party-line vote of 236-198 a
democratic alternative that would have limited the scope, set a
December 31 deadline and asked that the Judiciary Committee first
consider the historical standards for impeachment before deciding
Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
democrats, at times passionate, protested that debate over such
a grave issue was limited to two hours. They applauded defiant
criticism of the inquiry and warned of voter backlash.
</P>
<P>
One of the most outspoken democrats, Representative Maxine
Waters of California, said that "thousands of pages of hearsay,
accusations and gossip and stupid telephone chatter" do not meet
the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who will
oversee the inquiry, pledged to avoid a "fishing expedition" and
asked his democratic colleagues to work with the republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll out today found 53 percent of those
surveyed oppose impeachment hearings while 44 percent favor them.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Calls for Dialogue Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday that the political dialogue over the Kosovo
issue should re-start immediately because the situation in that
province is rapidly returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanjug news agency, Milosevic made the remarks
at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, during
which both sides stated that any military intervention could bring
problems to the world order and therefore is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reaffirmed Russia's opposition to NATO's threat of
unilateral resort to force under any circumstances before his
visit to Belgrade and to London for a meeting of the six-nation
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that only the U.N. Security Council can ratify the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington that
he had authorized U.S. participation in NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia if the latter did not stop its offensive against ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our
interests and to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the
Balkans," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's move
did not indicate that any military action was imminent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's unemployment will
reach 20 million this year, about 22 percent of the country's
estimated 90 million workforce, the Indonesian Observer Friday
quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the unemployment figure is 18 million but
through to the end of 1998 the figure is estimated to reach 20
million," Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President B.J. Habibie on Thursday, Idris
said unemployment could stabilize at this level in 1999, depending
on how the economy developed and whether the rupiah continues to
strengthen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue with job creation schemes,
including irrigation and road projects, to try to keep
unemployment down, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would also approach foreign countries,
particularly in the Middle East, to see if they could take more
skilled Indonesian workers, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Ranks 8th in Overseas Tourism Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China now ranks 8th in the
world in earnings from overseas tourism, according to information
provided for "World Travel Day" ceremonies in the city of
Chongqing, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
China received more than 50 million tourists in 1997, and earned 12
billion U.S. dollars from related services.
</P>
<P>
The country rank 41st in 1978 when it began to open to the
outside world and earnings from overseas tourism only stood at
around 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the tourism industry also earned more than 20
billion yuan from over 600 million domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, there were increases in
arrivals from all overseas tourist markets except Asia. The number
of tourists from other Asian countries fell eight percent in the
eight months.
</P>
<P>
Some 41 million overseas tourists visited China from January to
August, up 12 percent from the same period last year, and related
earnings amounted to 8.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> NBA Labor Talks Stall, Sides to Meet Again Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of
negotiations today between the NBA and its players union did
nothing to raise hopes that the regular season will begin as
scheduled on November 3.
</P>
<P>
Although the five-hour meeting -- the first between the sides
since August 6 -- was described as "cordial," by NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik, the prevailing air of pessimism heading
into the proceedings was realized as both sides refused to give
ground. Another meeting is set for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly did not make any progress in terms of reaching
any agreements," Granik said. "Perhaps we made progress in terms
of the players understanding our position."
</P>
<P>
A formal decision about the cancellation of regular-season
games is expected to be made next week, but it looks likely that
the league will lose regular-season to a labor stoppage for the
first time in its 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
The owner-imposed lockout, in effect since midnight June 30,
has already led to the cancellation of the entire preseason
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Today, Players Association representatives went over a
proposal they soundly criticized from the league less than two
weeks ago. It is expected they will present a counterproposal
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The major stumbling block is the league's attempt to put a
ceiling on salaries and install a hard cap by phasing out the
Larry Bird exception. The union says the Bird exception, the
clause in the previous agreement that allows teams to re-sign
free agents without regard to the salary cap, is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Along with phasing out the Bird exception, the latest owner's
proposal also deals with the elimination of the three-year rookie
scale, which allows third-year players unrestricted free agency
after their third season with the team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several NBA players have attended practice sites
and workout facilities this week to discuss the lockout with fans
and media.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are awaiting the ruling of arbitrator John Feerick
on a grievance filed by the Players Association hours before the
owners imposed the lockout.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of which way John Feerick rules, this is only
going to get settled with the players at the bargaining table,"
NBA commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
The union claims NBA players have guaranteed contracts that s
hould allow them to be paid during the lockout. Thg NBA contends
its actions are entirely legal during a work stoppage.

<HEADLINE> Olano Wins Time Trial Gold in Cycling Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Abraham Olano shook off a knee
injury to win his second world title in three years at the world
cycling championships in Valkenburg, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish rider had to fight the pain of a knee injury
during the 43.5km elite time trial over a hilly course but still
triumphed by 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Olano averaged 47.8kph in cold, wet conditions to beat
compatriot Melchior Mauri. Ukrainian Sergei Gontchar took the
bronze medal, 47 seconds behind Olano.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Olano won the world road race title ahead of the
all-conquering Miguel Indurain who beat him for the gold medal in
the world time trial that year in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
A year later he shared the Olympic podium with his fellow
Spaniard who took the time trial title in Atlanta with Olano
again the silver medalist.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he
had authorized U.S. participation in air strikes by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In remarks during a health care speech at the White House,
Clinton indicated a growing impatience with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to comply with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I decided that the United States would vote to give
NATO the authority to carry out military strikes against Serbia if
President Milosevic continues to defy the international
community," said Clinton.

"In the days ahead, my counterparts in Europe will be making
similar decisions," he added. (US-Clinton-Kosovo)

MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed "regret" in
connection with the statement by State Duma Chairman Gennady
Seleznyov calling for a referendum on confidence in the president,
presidential press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov called for a referendum on the removal of the
Russian president at a press conference on Thursday, a day after
the nationwide protest actions, during which the main political
demand was for the president's early resignation.
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, "after this large-scale action of
protest which took place on Wednesday it would be more legitimate
to call a referendum in Russia on whether society trusts or does
not trust the president, on whether the president should or should
not resign." (Russia-Yeltsin)

<HEADLINE> China Constructs Facilities for the Handicapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China has begun to construct
more facilities for the handicapped in public places.
</P>
<P>
The Fangzhuang residential area of the Fengtai District of
Beijing is one of three pilot areas for the construction of
facilities for the disabled in the Asia-Pacific region. The other
two are in India's capital, New Delhi, and Thailand's capital,
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government and the China Handicapped
Federation jointly supervised the construction of facilities in
this Beijing neighborhood, and forty council members of the China
Welfare Fund for the Handicapped recently inspected the new
projects there.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities encompass 23 public places, including
kindergartens, shops, hospitals, post offices, banks and streets,
all of which now provide conveniences for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The central government also promulgated a series of related
laws and regulations to promote progress of the
construction. Fifty-six key projects in Beijing for the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China are
taking the building of facilities for the handicapped into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that construction costs for facilities for the
handicapped will be quite low, compared with the transformation of
existing buildings and roads.
</P>
<P>
Facility construction for the handicapped has become part of
building plans all over the world in the past few years to
provide convenient access and safety for the disabled.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Sticks to Free-Float System: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not change the free foreign exchange system despite a need to have
a system enabling the government to supervise the flows of foreign
exchange, particularly that of export earnings, a minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to change the system," Coordinating Minister
for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginanjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement in response to a question on
whether the government would maintain the free floating foreign
exchange system amid a phenomenon that the rupiah has continued to
strengthen against the U.S. dollar in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah flexed its muscles on Thursday, soaring to 8,900
against the U.S. dollar on the back of Japanese yen's impressive
performance.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening rupiah lifted the Jakarta Stocks. The Jakarta
Composite Index rocketed 8.4 percent to close at 288.55 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President B.J. Habibie here late Thursday,
Ginanjar said the government perhaps needed a system which could
help it report and supervise the flows of foreign exchange,
especially that of export earnings.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he said, the International Monetary Fund
had been asked to give inputs on this matter but the government
would not take a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
If the supervising system was implemented, businessmen would
remain free to bring their foreign exchange in or out of the
country, Ginanjar was quoted by Antara News Agency Friday as
saying.

<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China lost to Scotland 1-2 in a
group two match of the Alfred Dunhill Cup Golf Tournament in
St.Andrews, Scotland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, debutants in the tourney, claimed one point
when Zhang Lianwei defeated world number six Colin Montgomerie
72-73.
</P>
<P>
Montgomerie was rescued by teammates Andrew Coltart and rookie
Gary Orr. Coltart carded a 73 to beat Cheng Jun by five but Orr,
scraped through only when Wu Xiang-bing overplayed his approach
to the last and three-putted for a bogey five.
</P>
<P>
While in group one, John Daly led the top seed U.S. team to
crush England 3-0.
</P>
<P>
On a gloriously sunny day at the Home of Golf, Wild Thing Daly
overcame early erratic driving to come from behind and beat Lee
Westwood by three shots with a two-under-par 70.
</P>
<P>
Daly's victory in the first match of the tie was, however
almost academic as world number one Tiger Woods and number four
O'Meara had already established big leads against David Carter
and Peter Baker.
</P>
<P>
Woods shot 66 and Masters and British Open champion O'Meara 67
to win by eight and seven shots.
</P>
<P>
In the other tie in group one, eighth-seeded Sweden beat Japan
3-0.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Australia beat Argentina 3-0 in group three
where the only upset of the day occurred, seventh-seeded New
Zealand going down 2-1 to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Zimbabwe and defending champions South Africa,
seeded sixth, both won their matches 3-0 against Germany and

<HEADLINE> Dow Makes Dramatic Comeback Despite Other Stocks Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average of 30 major companies Thursday ended with a dramatic
comeback from a 274-point drop, averting a potentially ruinous
slide below this summer's lows.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed just 9.78 points lower at 7,731.91 despite
sliding within 68 points of 7,400, a level that served as the
turning point in the summer selloff that climaxed on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The selling frenzy in the morning was caused by sliding of U.S.
dollars in currency markets and fueled by discouraging comments
from some prominent analysts, including Goldman Sacks strategist
and long-time bull Abby Joseph Cohen.
</P>
<P>
However, most stocks were not so lucky as Dow Jones Thursday at
Wall Street as the market is still plagued by unanswered questions
about big company profits, hedge funds, global economics and the
threat of a U.S. recession.
</P>
<P>
The number of stocks that fell outnumbered those that rose by
more than a 6-to-1 margin at the closing bell.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell as much as 105
points, trading below 1,400 for the first time in 16 months,
before finishing 43.49 points lower at 1,419.12, a loss of 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 finished 11.24 points lower at 959.44
after recovering from a 47-point drop earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index was down 7.48 at 477.20, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 22.02 at 563.75.

<HEADLINE> Germany May Not Participate in Possible Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany would apparently not be
able to participate in a possible NATO military intervention in
Kosovo soon because of a political standstill after the September
27 general election, German press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder Thursday held brief
discussions with the outgoing chancellor Helmut Kohl on the Kosovo
issue just hours before he left for Washington for a one-day
visit. However, both of them did not made any comment after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The message Schroeder takes to Washington is that the new
German government would support a NATO operation in Kosovo but
German forces could not take part anytime soon because of the
transition of government, said the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's government previously already offered 14 Tornado jets
for possible NATO air strikes in Kosovo. But such a deployment
must be approved by parliament.
</P>
<P>
A parliament vote is difficult to arrange at the moment because
the old parliament is already out of session while the new one is
not due to convene before October 26. It would take several days
to call the old parliament into a special session for any vote on
the Kosovo issue, German news agency DPA said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover German political parties still differ on whether there
is sufficient legal basis for a NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Greens party, which is the most likely junior partners in
the new German government, stressed Thursday that it would oppose
any German participation in a NATO military action in Kosovo
without a UN resolution approving the use of force.

<HEADLINE> FA: BSkyB/Man United Deal Not Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The English Football Association
confirmed Thursday that it had written to the Office of Fair
Trading (OFT) claiming BSkyB's 623m bid to buy Manchester United
"is not welcomed."
</P>
<P>
News of the FA's bid to block the deal comes as the OFT admits
receiving 350 complaints opposing the deal.
</P>
<P>
An F.A. spokeswoman confirmed comments attributed to F.A.
Chairman Keith Wiseman in which he expressed concern that the
deal could make United too powerful.
</P>
<P>
"The F.A. have written to the OFT saying that if the bid is
allowed to go through it will create a situation where not only
the strength of one club but also the influence of one club would
extend far beyond the range of others. The overall message we
have conveyed is this is not something to be welcomed," FA
chairman Keith Wiseman tells the Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
"Our opinion has been reached on our football feelings. You
can't put a finger on the mischief but most people have a gut
feeling that the bid is not right. It will produce some
distortions, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The OFT will decide on November 2 whether to refer the
takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Three hundred and fifty responses is an unusually high
number-there is no doubt about it," said an OFT spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Usually we get complaints about takeovers from the companies'
rivals but here we have had a large number of complaints from the
fan base."
</P>
<P>
The OFT has until November 2 to consider the 623 million pound
(1.07 billion U.S. dollars) bid for United by BSkyB, a company
controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
The OFT will then advise the government Department of Trade
and Industry whether it believes the bid should be cleared or
face further scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB holds the rights to live action in the premier league
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The United board has recommended acceptance of the bid. Sir
Roland Smith, chairman of the United Plc board, told shareholders
this week that BSkyB would not interfere in team affairs or
player acquisitions.

<HEADLINE> Hearts Lose UEFA Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA dismissed on Thursday Scottish premier league side Hearts'
appeal to have their European Cup Winners' Cup defeat against
Mallorca overturned.
</P>
<P>
Hearts had made a formal complaint to UEFA over the height of
the goal posts following the match against the Spanish club last
week.
</P>
<P>
The Edinburgh club, who drew 1-1 to go out 2-1 on aggregate,
said the UEFA delegate at the match found that one of the
goalposts at each end was too high due to an uneven pitch.
</P>
<P>
Hearts' chief executive Chris Robinson said the goalposts were
10 centimeters higher than their regulation height of 2.44 meters.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA rejected their appeal on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hearts spokesman Douglas Dalgleish said: "We've lost the
appeal...UEFA say the result must stand.
</P>
<P>
"They haven't given us a reason yet. That will come on Friday
morning, in writing, and then we will be able to decide how to
proceed," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Holland Asked to Set up Interest Sections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Holland will
be asked to set up interest sections in their embassies in Jakarta
and Lisbon for Indonesia and Portugal respectively, according to
an agreement between Indonesia and Portugal here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after two days of talks in New York
between senior officials of the two countries on the question of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The talks, a follow-up to the talks between Annan and the
Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal in early August, were
chaired by Jamsheed Marker, Personal Representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Marker told reporters that "in a constructive and friendly
atmosphere", they focused also on a U.N. proposal "providing
substantive elements for achieving a just, comprehensive and
internationally acceptable solution" to the question of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Further discussions on the subject will be held on November
10-21.
</P>
<P>
The third item on their agenda was the All-inclusive Intra-East
Timor Dialogue (AIETD) to take place in Austria from October 31 to
November 3.
</P>
<P>
Marker said he was very satisfied with the progress of the
Indonesia-Portugal dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great deal to do as yet and a long way to go, but
the willingness to find a compromise and the atmosphere in the
negotiations is very positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal severed diplomatic relations with Indonesia in 1975
following the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, a former
Portugal colony.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which has never recognized Indonesian
sovereignty over East Timor, has been calling for a just,
comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the
question.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Ready for Air Strikes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that he had authorized U.S. participation in air
strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In remarks during a health care speech at the White House,
Clinton indicated a growing impatience with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to comply with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I decided that the United States would vote to give
NATO the authority to carry out military strikes against Serbia if
President Milosevic continues to defy the international
community," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"In the days ahead, my counterparts in Europe will be making
similar decisions," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's move
did not indicate that any military action was imminent.
</P>
<P>
An "activation order" for NATO military action is expected as
early as this weekend unless Milosevic complies with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the United States was confident that ultimately
NATO would reach a consensus in favor of the strikes. Italy has
said the West needs a U.N. legal mandate for intervention.
</P>
<P>
Clinton argued that because of Milosevic's "unconscionable"
action, there was now a danger of violence spreading to
neighboring countries and a humanitarian crisis developing as
winter sets in on the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We would far prefer to secure President Milosevic's compliance
with the will of the international community in a peaceful
manner," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"But NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our
interests and to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the
Balkans," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said U.S. ambassador Richard Holbrooke in meetings this
week had made "absolutely clear" what Milosevic must do to avoid
military action.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is simple," Clinton said. "It is full compliance with
the United Nations Security Council resolutions by President
Milosevic," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, the U.N. Security Council approved a
resolution calling Yugoslavia to stop fighting in Kosovo, pull
back forces, allow relief agencies to get access to the refugees
and start negotiations with ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Romania Not to Intervene Militarily in Kosovo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Romania cannot be commanded to
intervene militarily in Kosovo, chief of the Romanian Army's
General Staff Constantin Degeratu said Thursday at the Victoria
Palace government's head office.
</P>
<P>
He said that a decision regarding a certain military solution
linked to this conflict has already been taken at NATO level. "I
know no other country has been called or has offered itself to
participate in the conflict in Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Degeratu said that Romania has "normal" relations with
Yugoslavia and that "our country's actions are based on a good
neighborliness" within these relations.
</P>
<P>
"Romania, as a member of the U.N. and the Partnership for Peace
plan, is compelled to comply with the U.N. decisions and try to
find better solutions to diminish the negative consequences of the
Kosovo conflict," Degeratu said.
</P>
<P>
The latest development of the Kosovo crisis and especially
NATO's possible military intervention in the region are sources of
worry for the whole nation of Romania, a friendly and immediate
neighbor of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu Thursday afternoon
consulted with the ruling coalition party leaders on the evolution
of Kosovo after his Wednesday meeting on the issue with the prime
minister, the defense minister, the foreign minister and the chief
of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council of National Defense is expected to meet
Sunday at the request of the Romanian president to discuss the
situation in Kosovo, sources in the presidency announced.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government Thursday also discussed the Kosovo
issue at its weekly meeting. "Romania will not deny its
commitments that derive from the Partnership for Peace plan in
which Romania is a member and, according to the U.N. resolutions,
it will not have the obligation to participate in military
actions," Rasvan Popescu, the government spokesman said after the
meeting. He added, "Political and humanitarian support is
inevitable."
</P>
<P>
As stressed by the authorities, Romania has supported all the
diplomatic efforts enacted by the contact group, the NATO member
states and the Security Council in order to find a negotiated
solution to Kosovo that should avoid the use of force, hinder
humanitarian disasters, allow the observance of the fundamental
rights of all the citizens in Kosovo, maintain the territorial
integrity of the Yugoslav Federation and remove the spectrum of
conflict in the Balkans as much as possible.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Practical Steps in Combating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday called
on the international community to adopt practical measures and
enhance cooperation in fighting against the organized
transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
delegate Xie Bohua said as the rapid increase of international
contacts and the speedy development of science and technology,
many criminal activities go beyond national borders, infiltrate
political and economic areas, and seriously affect the normal
social order and the political stability and economic development
of a country.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China believed that the Political Declaration and
Global Action Plan at the 1994 Naples Ministerial Conference had
had a positive impact in the international community's joint
efforts at controlling and preventing organized transnational
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the Chinese Government was of the view that the
Convention Against Organized Transnational Crime should fully take
into account the established general models from existing
conventions against transnational crime and the basic principles
governing judicial assistance given by various countries.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the United Nations should have a larger role in
combating organized transnational crime in particularly by
increasing resources for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia Thursday expressed their endorsement to U.S.
Special envoy Richard Holbrooke's new efforts to end the worsening
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after an emergency meeting of the Contact
Group foreign ministers, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
that Holbrook would hold another round of talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Friday to put forward six demands for
a full end to various violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The demands are: an end to violence, the withdrawal of security
forces and heavy weapons, free access for humanitarian agencies,
full cooperation with an international war crimes tribunal, the
return of refugees and a start to negotiations on self-rule with
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, including the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy did not explicitly refer to the
threat of military action if Milosevic did not comply with the U.N.
Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We would not invite Russia to approve the use of force. That
is a matter for NATO," Cook said, adding that NATO would meet
within a few days to consider the use of force if Milosevic
refused to back down.

<HEADLINE> German Scientists Discover Gene for Cell Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Max
Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry in Gottingen, Germany,
have found a gene named Apaf1 which is a key component of cell
death, also known as apoptosis, according to a press release
issued Wednesday by the Institute.
</P>
<P>
They said that this gene can act as a switch in the chain of
the molecular and could lead to the death of a cell.
</P>
<P>
The scientists used mice in their studies to decipher the role
of this gene and they found that this gene is important for the
embryoal development of the mouse. They were also able to better
define the position of the corresponding gene products in the
hierarchy of events which lead to cell death.
</P>
<P>
Life without death is inconceivable. Cell death is vital for an
organism. If apoptosis does not take place, the effects can be
serious. Certain forms of cancer and autoimmune disease can be
tracked back to a lack of apoptosis; the death of nerve cells in
certain forms of Alzheimer's disease and also possibly the damage
done to brain after a stroke are the result of too much apoptosis.
</P>
<P>
They said that Apaf1 gene could become a very attractive object
for many areas of medical research, for the development of new
anti-cancer strategies, the treatment of neurodegenerative disease
such as Alzheimer's and other genetic diseases, which involve a
malfunction of the apoptosis pathway.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Makes Dramatic Comeback From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks Thursday
made a dramatic comeback from their heavy losses after bargain
hunters stepped in to staunch the frenzied selling.
</P>
<P>
Based on early, unofficial data, the Dow Jones industrial
average ended off 9.78 points, or 0.13 percent, at 7,731.91 after
shaking off a loss of nearly 275 points in the earlier afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declines swamped advances by a huge 5 to
1 margin on very heavy volume of 1.11 billion shares on the New
York Stock Exchange. Technology, Internet and financial stocks
suffered some of the biggest losses.
</P>
<P>
Amid a frenzy selling caused by this week's sudden nose dive by
the U.S. dollar in currency trading, the Dow industrials fell
nearly 275 points in earlier tradings Thursday. The dollar
reportedly fell sharply Thursday after sliding 8.1 percent
Wednesday against the Japanese yen, the biggest one-day drop in a
quarter century.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the Dow's recovery to investors who were
dismissing the day's jitters and instead looking for cheap stocks.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt. Rejects Striking Teachers' Offer to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government cannot
reopen negotiations with teachers under duress unless their union
Kalonzo Musyoka told Parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy ministerial statement, Musyoka said that he was
not ready to negotiate with people who have "thrown a rope around
my neck".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government signed the pay rise agreement last
December just before the second multi-party general elections.
The increases are by as much as 200 percent spread over five
years.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of teachers started strike in confrontation
with the police across Kenya Monday in a desperate bid to press
the government to implement its pledges of teachers' pay rise.
</P>
<P>
However, Musyoka told parliament his ministry has
allocated 44 billion Shillings (about 733 million U.S. Dollars)
in the budget, out of which 37 billion Shillings goes to
teachers' pay, leaving only 7.2 billion Shillings for development
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Almost 20,000 Kenyan teachers, who are not union members and
have not been reporting to work since the strike, were sacked
by the Teachers Service Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The strike, called by the 250,000-strong Kenya National Union
of Teachers (KNUT), is the third this year. At least 21
opposition members of parliament have openly supported the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries range from 2,700 Shillings to 29,000
Shillings (45 to 480 U.S. Dollars) a month, relatively higher
than most other civil servants in the east African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- About 8,000 Sudanese refugees
have been forced to return home, fleeing insecurity in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Vision aid agency said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees arrived in Western Equatoria of Sudan Wednesday
after their camps have been burned out in the east of the Congo.
The invaders are unidentified.
</P>
<P>
A large number of refugees, especially mothers and childrens,
